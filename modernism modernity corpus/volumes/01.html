For centuries it was in large part through the common telling of its
stories and the imaginative loyalties they fostered that Jewish survival
was ensured. But the two enormous and linked transformations of Jewish
existence in this century--on the one hand, the Zionist move-ment and the
establishment of the state of Israel, and, on the other, the previously
unimaginable horror of the Shoah--profoundly altered the patterns
discovered in--or, as I will argue, imputed to--the nar-ratives that are
now constructed to articulate the meaning of Jewish history.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because the kinds of stories we tell ourselves and one another are
a central portion, perhaps even the core of who we are, and, more
technically, because the ways we narrate and order those stories
are as significant in their effect as is their thematic content,
the impli-cations of literary techniques go far beyond what strictly
formalist considerations suggest. Especially when the story is one of
a com-munal historical catastrophe, there is an urge to make sense of
it by relying upon one of the most basic of all narrative techniques:
foreshadowing. Yet, implicit in foreshadowing is the image of a closed
universe in which all choices have already been made, in which human
free will can exist only in the paradoxical sense of choosing to accept
or wilfully--and vainly--rebelling against what is inevitable. This
is the case whether the foreshadowing takes place at the theological,
historical, or psychological level.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Christian apologetics, Marxist teleology, and psychological determinism
are striking instances of how powerful our impulse toward foreshadowing
can be, and illustrate how it is bound to seem arbitrarily colonizing of,
and condescending to, any moments that threaten to exceed its interpretive
grasp. Thus, the Christian Church Fathers' reduction of the Hebrew Bible
to a cycle of prefigurations of and preparations for the Gospel story
is, for all its intellectual dexterity and inventiveness (especially
the elaboration of figural allegory), rightly viewed by Jews as a
brutal impoverishment of the original texts. "Supersessionist" theology
necessarily reduces the predecessor text to an "Old Testament," whose
independent signi-ficance is annulled once it is construed as only the
first stage of a process culminating in the annunciation of a "new" and
more complete truth. Think for a moment of the Pauline Epistle in which
the wandering of the Jews in the desert is read as a <I>figura</I> of the
challenges facing the first Christian communities, or the ways in which
the Christian exegetical tradition interpreted the story of Jonah as a
prefiguration of the Savior's Passion, with the three days in the belly
of the whale foreshadowing the three days when Christ harrowed Hell. In
its encounters with the Hebrew Bible, Christian hermeneutics read the
central events of Jewish tradition as "witnessing," in the sense of
foreshadowing, the authority of its own stories. Hence, for example, the
pressure  to rename a narrative like the Hebrew Bible's <I>Akedah</I> or
"Binding" of Isaac as the "Sacrifice" of Isaac, in order to make the
Jewish story interpretable as an anticipation of Christ's sacrifice
on the cross.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Indeed, there is a strong sense in which
the very idea of history as a linear unfolding from darkness toward
light, and from ignorance toward truth is rooted neither in Jewish nor
in classical thinking, but, as Jonathan Boyarin has argued, entirely
in "the early church fathers' idea of the progression from Judaism
to Christianity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 And, much as the Jewish and pagan world
found the claims of the first Christian missionaries incomprehensible, to
someone not already persuaded of the truth of their secular revelations,
the conventional Marxist explanations of why the working class stayed
so loyal to their national governments at the outbreak of the First
World War, or of why large sections of the German proletariat adhered to
Nazism, often against their own economic interest, can seem astonishingly
dismissive of the peculiarities of each specific circumstance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Against foreshadowing, and as its formal and theoretical antithesis,
I want to propose a concept for which Gary Saul Morson has coined
the term "sideshadowing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Sideshadowing champions the
incommensurability of the concrete and refuses the tyranny of all
synthetic master schemes; it rejects the conviction that a particular
code, law, or pattern exists, waiting to be uncovered beneath the
heterogeneity of human existence. Instead of the global regularities
that so many intellectual and spiritual movements claim to reveal,
sideshadowing stresses the significance of random, haphazard, and
inassimilable contingencies, and instead of the power of a system to
uncover an otherwise unfathomable truth, it expresses the ever-changing
nature of that truth and the absence of any predictive certainties in
human affairs. Or, in Robert Musil's more subtly ironic formulation, what
we need to recognize is the reality of underdetermination: "The Principle
of the Insufficient Cause." As Ulrich, Musil's Man without Qualities,
explains, "you know of course what the principle of the sufficient cause
is. Only, people make an exception where they themselves are concerned. In
real life, by which I mean our personal and also our public-historical
life, what happens is always what has no good cause."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To concentrate upon the sideshadowed ideas and events, upon what did not
take place, does not cast doubt upon the historicity of what occurred,
but is to view it as one among a range of possibilities, a number of
which might, with equal plausibility, have taken place instead. The one
that actually happened, though, exists from then on with all the weight
afforded by the singularity of what we might call its event-ness. Only
the brightness of an actual event can cast sufficient shadow for
sideshadowing to matter, and only the felt force of a life can give
impetus to the counterlives that seize the imagination. Counterlives
count because they are a constituent element of the lives we have, just
as it is often by the shadows the sun casts, not by its direct light,
that we can best calibrate where we stand. To keep the claims of both
the event and its unrealized alternatives in mind may be more perplexing
as a theoretical formulation than as an ongoing act, and problems that
critical habit and grammar often urge us to see cleanly divided are in
practice usually vitally, and even messily, intertwined. Accordingly, to
show just how crucial is the conjunction of life and counterlife, event
and its sideshadow, requires not so much a global schema as a sequence
of careful acts of local scrutiny focusing upon the ways particular
problems are figured in our narratives today.

Our instinctive gratitude to what frees us from the too-strictly plotted,
the too-seamlessly inevitable story, undoubtedly accounts for much of
our pleasure in experimental fiction. But this responsiveness to the
improvisatory is changed decisively at those moments when con-temporary
history and literature intersect, when the issue becomes one of
representing an event with whose occurrence we are still attempting to
come to terms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The more devastating the event, the greater the compensatory pressure
to comprehend it according to the strictest teleological model as the
climax of a grim trajectory whose inevit-able outcome it must be. This
sense of wrenching inevitability, like a tragic hero's vain efforts to
avoid his fate, is the cornerstone not only of Aristotelian tragedy, but
of its most powerful literary descendants across genres and epochs. Yet
a historical cataclysm, no matter how ter-rible, is not a tragedy, and
to interpret it as one would denature the character of what I earlier
called its event-ness. Undeniably, when an occurrence is so destructive
for a whole people as was the Shoah, it is difficult not to respond to
it as one would to a pre-scripted tragedy, that is, to interpret it as
the simultaneously inconceivable and yet foreordained culmination of
the entire brutal history of European anti-Semitism. But tragedy is an
arranged genre and it is essential to bear in mind that no historical
event, no paradigm of struggle, resistance, and loss, can transform the
death of countless human beings into a tragedy, if only because real
events never happen as part of an already narrated form.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is important to specify that nothing I have said so far argues for
historical skepticism or questions the moral claims upon us of events
from the past. Rather than casting doubt upon the event-ness of history,
sideshadowing helps us to reckon the human cost of an occurrence

<B></B>

by
reminding us of all that its coming-into-existence made impossible. The
nonlives of the sideshadowed events that never happened are a part of
the emotional/intellectual legacy and aura of each actually occurring
event,
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 inflecting it in distinct ways, as, for example, the
extinction of the culture that sustained Yiddish as a spoken and literary
language has pro-foundly changed the way in which Jewish life has been
represented since 1945. As Berel Lang rightly insists, "the immediate
horror of the death camps has made it difficult to conjure the lives
that might have been in lieu of the deaths that were--but this, too,
obvi-ously constitutes the actual and continuing loss."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

I think that some conception of side-shadowing is already intuitively
present whenever we talk about the extent of the horror inflicted by the
Nazis; indeed without such a concept, part of the devastation wrought by
the Shoah would be permanently blocked from consciousness. Yet, while
there is nothing con-troversial about formally describing the workings
of sideshadowing in this context, entailed in that account are a number
of further implications that directly contest many of the most common
narrative practices and theoretical premises flourishing today.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To have chosen to contest the claims of foreshadowing even in narratives
of the Shoah is to confront a seemingly intractable counterinstance, on
the principle that if the validity of sideshadowing can be discerned
here, where it seems so difficult to recognize, then its pertinence
in cases that are not as morally and theoretically arduous will be
more readily apparent. If the Shoah is so critical a test case it is
precisely because it is also the one in which so much is at stake,
humanly as well as epistemologically, in the simultaneously impossible
and unavoidable debate about its meaning. At the same time, it is
important to emphasize that I am not claiming that the enormity of
the Shoah makes the consideration of more quotidian historical events
superfluous. But narratives about the Shoah can serve as exemplary test
cases for my position both because of the importance of the Shoah for
modern consciousness and because it has so often been represented through
a plot governed by a logic of historical inevitability. Such emplotment
either explicitly or implicitly rejects the relevance of sideshadowing,
and hence provides the kind of totalizing master narrative against which
the counterhistory proposed here can be heard most effectively.

The realization that we ourselves are often still deeply implicated in
historical conflicts and debates whose terms we have not so much shaped
as inherited leads to the most pervasive, but also the most pernicious,
variant of foreshadowing, the variant that I think can be best understood
as "backshadowing." In backshadowing, the shared knowledge of the
outcome of a series of events by narrator and listener is used to judge
the participants in those events <I>as though they too should have known
what was to come.</I> Thus, our knowledge of the Shoah is used to condemn
the "blindness" and "self-deception" of Austro-German Jewry for their
unwillingness to save themselves from a doom that supposedly was clear to
see. Backshadowing of this kind, and the presumptions it nourishes, run
unchecked, and often uncriticized, throughout histories, biographies, and
novels focusing on the life of

<B></B>

Austro-German Jewry, until, in Michael
Ignatieff's powerful description, "just as the cultural achievement of
the empire is overshadowed by the empire's collapse, so the achievement
of Jewish emancipation within the empire is overshadowed by its infamous
finale...In no field of historical study does one wish more fervently
that historians could write history blind to the future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the dilemma cannot be solved by consciously "blinding" ourselves
to the future in our histories, if only because it is not at all clear
how we either can or should try to bracket all knowledge of the Shoah
when we write about the community that perished in it. The discretion
required, a discretion that sideshadowing is particularly concerned to
teach us, is  not to see the future as preordained; and, as a direct
corollary,  not to use our know-ledge of the future as a means of
judging the decisions of those living before that (still only possible)
future has become actual event. The issue here has nothing to do with an
<I>aporia</I> of undecidability and everything to do with the demands of
decorum in its full classical sense: the difficult attempt to work out
which modes and techniques of representation are appropriately responsive
to the exigencies of different human experiences. The two linked forms of
discretion I have specified seem, as is so often the case with questions
of side-shadowing, uncontroversial enough as general principles, yet
in practice they have scarcely ever been heeded in narratives about
the Shoah. Thus, to return to Ignatieff's critique of histories of
Austro-German Jewry, "because we know that the path for Vienna's Jews
led to Mauthausen and Theresienstadt concentration camps, it is easy
to be ironic at the expense of those Jews who believed in assimilation
into a milieu that was to expel them so brutally... [But to do so is
to] evaluate the victims by the degree of prescience with which they
antic-ipate their victimhood...and add to the heavy burden of Jewish
messianic destiny, the absurd requirement that they be more prescient
than other peoples."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Such a requirement is precisely what
marks numerous accounts about the victims of the Shoah, without their
authors seeing that it drains all meaningful reality (that is, a reality
made up of specific choices and decisions) from the lives of the people
being described. In place of this reality, such accounts substitute an
often intolerable, even if unintended, superiority shared by author and
reader over the heads, as it were, of the book's subjects.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a concentrated instance of what I have thus far defined in more general
terms, consider the following sentences from a recent and much-praised
biography of Franz Kafka. After mentioning the birth of Kafka's sister
Elli, on 15 September 1889, the biographer, Ernst Pawel, writes: "Earlier
that year, in the not too distant Austrian town of Braunau, one Clara
n&eacute;e Pl&ouml;zl, wife of the customs inspector Alo&iuml;s Hitler,
had given birth to another of the emperor's subjects, a sickly infant
whose survival seemed doubtful. He survived."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Mentioning
the son born to a Braunau customs inspector called Hitler can only
elicit the kind of tawdry <I>frisson</I> Pawel is trying to achieve
if we let ourselves be susceptible to an egregiously blatant act of
backshadowing. In 1889 no connection existed yet between the Kafka and
Hitler families, and to gesture backward from the terrible years when
such a connection, in the form of murderer and victim, did come to
occur, is so shamelessly manipulative that it would be easy to laugh
away, except that one finds it as a crucial topos in innumerable other
texts on the same theme. Pawel's biography is dense with similarly
embarrassing moments. Toward the end of the book, for example, as
Kafka is approaching his early death, Pawel writes, "the family doctor
urgently advised another extended rest, and

<B></B>

Kafka, <I>faute de
mieux,</I> settled on a boardinghouse in the Bohemian mountain village
of Schelesen, now Zelizy, not far from what was to become the infamous
Terezin concentration camp, through which all three of his sisters passed
on their way to the gas chambers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These descents into what one may call a kind of Hitler-kitsch
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

are especially alarming because reviewers of the book proved themselves
so responsive to exactly this strain in Pawel's writing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 More
unsettling still, many of his tropes surface elsewhere in different hands
and genres. Thus, in a study by political scientist George S. Berkeley,
<I>Vienna and Its Jews: The Tragedy of Success,</I> it is startling to
come across the following sentence right after a mention of the famous
suicide/murder of Crown Prince Rudolph and Mary Vetsera at Mayerling
in January 1889: "The other event of special significance to the Vienna
Jews which occurred in 1889 passed unremarked by almost everyone, Jew and
Gentile alike. Three months after Rudolph's death, in the border village
of Braunau, a son was born to Alo&iuml;s and Klara Hitler."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

It is worth lingering for a moment on the astonishing phrase "unremarked
by almost everyone," with its surely unintended and risible hint
that someone actually did notice the event--perhaps three wise men
mysteriously alerted to the demonic nativity in Braunau by a kind of
negative illumination--but the coincidence of imagination and phrasing
in the Pawel and Berkeley books requires more than merely being noticed
and dismissed. Of course the similarity is not due to plagiarism of any
sort; rather, it is the result of a fascination with Hitler that strongly
mobilizes both writers' fantasies. Arthur C. Danto, in a wonderfully
apposite jest against predestination and foreshadowing, once quipped, "No
one came to Madame Diderot and said, 'Unto you an encyclop&aelig;diste
is born.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Danto's irony works so economically because
the notion it reduces to absurdity is one to which almost no one would
subscribe in the first place. But it is just as true that no one came
to Frau Hitler in Braunau and said: "Unto you a <I>Reichsf&uuml;hrer</I>
is born." Both the quotations by Pawel and Berkeley rely for their force
on just such a premise.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If we laugh at the example of Madame Diderot and yet are capable of
responding with a shudder to the portentous news of Hitler's birth
without seeing its absurdity, it can only be that in the face of evil
on as great a scale as Hitler embodies, there is a general freezing up
of normal intellectual discriminations. Yet exactly these moments of
confrontation with the monstrous require more, not less, clarity, and
demand a greater measure, rather than an abdication, of the ability
to stay focused on fundamental distinctions. One of the disturbing
"pleasures" apparent in numerous recent fictional representations of
Hitler (works as dif-ferent in their structure and rhetoric as, for
example, a film like Hans J&uuml;rgen Syberberg's <I>Hitler: Ein Film
aus Deutschland,</I> or a prose fantasy like George Steiner's <I>The
Portage to St. Cristobal of A.H.</I>) is the way their narratives
derive their energy from--and hence transport their audience to--an
emotional register whose intensity supposedly places it beyond moral
discriminations. In <I>Crime and Punishment,</I> Dostoevsky anatomized
the feverish excitement that arises when abandoning oneself to the
contemplation of horror is confused with authentic imaginative freedom,
and a kind of lumpen Raskolnikovism is discernible in what has become a
flourishing "Hitler industry." As Alan Mintz has warned, "the fascination
with evil is a highly appetitive faculty,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 and there is a
demoralizing sense in which rhetoric like Pawel's and Berkeley's feeds
exactly this most dubious of urges.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The difference between, on the one hand, a perspective dominated by
backshadowing, and on the other, one that respects the variety in
how people understood their own positions

<B></B>

and the contradictory
expectations with which communities debated important decisions, turns
on what Frederic Maitland defined as the first rule for comprehending
history: an awareness that events now far in the past were once in
the future.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Part of the reason why Maitland's formulation is so important to a theory
of sideshadowing is that it helps bring into focus the differences between
my position here and that of works like Danto's <I>Analytical Philosophy
of History.</I> Although I have gratefully seized upon Danto's jest about
Madame Diderot, it is important to acknowledge that unlike Ignatieff,
Danto is not arguing that historians should "write history blind to the
future." On the contrary, he stresses that while an account of Diderot's
subsequent career would make no sense if uttered by Madame Diderot or by
a hypothetical angel attending his birth, such a judgment is un-avoidable
for later historians. Danto further implies that without a knowledge of
later events, any historical account may be seriously inadequate and
incomplete. But he is equally at pains to warn against histories that
include "descriptions of events...which make an essential reference
to later events--events future to the time at which the description is
given. In effect [such works] are trying to write the history of what
happens <I>before</I> it has happened, and to give accounts of the past
based upon accounts of the future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Phrased in this way,
it becomes clear that the issue is in part determined precisely by the
intended chronological scope and ideological /moral assumption of a
specific historical account. In terms of my argument here, I believe
that only when narratives about pre-Shoah European Jewry are able to
incorporate the different ways individuals evaluated their circumstances
at the time, and can do so without flaunting a foreknowledge of the
impending catastrophe, is it possible for a genuine sense of grief,
unadulterated by anger or condescension at the "inevitable" truth that
went unnoticed, to be heard clearly.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A history of European Jewry that continues into the Nazi period obviously
must include a detailed discussion of the Shoah, but  if the story
were to stop earlier, for example at the end of World War I, it need
not allow, and indeed may only be deflected by allowing, the knowledge
of the coming genocide to structure its account of the prior epoch; and
 even when the narrative makes the Shoah central to its description,
it should not use the author's and reader's knowledge of that catastrophe
to impose the terms within which earlier events are analyzed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
J&uuml;rgen Habermas, in an argument directly indebted to Danto, but
still more committed to a theoretical horizon that appears to legitimize
backshadowing, insists that

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Historical accounts make use of narrative statements. They are
called narrative because they present events as elements of stories
[<I>Geschichten</I>]. Stories have a beginning and an end; they are held
together by an action. Historical events are reconstructed within the
reference system of a story. They cannot be presented without relation
to other, later events...The sentence, 'the Thirty Years War began
in 1618,' presupposes that at least those events have elapsed which
are relevant for the history of the war up to the Peace of Westphalia,
events that could not have been narrated by any observer at the outbreak
of the war...The predicates with which an event is narratively presented
require the appearance of later events in the light of which the event
in question appears as an historical event.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One way to highlight the issue at stake here is to confront Habermas's
account with a contrary formulation in which we imagine a German burgher
running through town shouting,
<B></B>



 "the Thirty Years War has just
begun!" The distinction, in other words, is not only one of foreshadowing
and backshadowing, but also of the horizon of consciousness and knowledge
that one is seeking to describe. There is nothing wrong with a historian
narrating events from a perspective of a time future to his subject
matter and knowing more about that subject than its contemporaries could
have--e.g., the length of a given war--but such knowledge should not
delude the historian into thinking that the future was inevitable simply
because it happened, nor should he use it to judge the way contemporaries,
existing without such information, viewed their own circumstances and
decided upon particular courses of action. Moreover, and crucial to the
larger question of narrative techniques, both Habermas and Danto assume a
curiously restrictive notion of what constitutes a "story." Both archaic
and postmodern narratives make clear that stories need not have a single
beginning and a single end; indeed, they need not even have a single,
chronologically-ordered series of actions. As soon as the paradigmatic
structure for an extended narrative is not limited to the well-wrought
novel developed over the past two hundred years, it becomes clear that
some of the fundamental storytelling conventions of our culture have never
fallen under the sway of a single story unfolding along an irreversible
temporal continuum. History can be understood as readily by these earlier
(mythic) and later (postmodern) categories of narrative organization as
by the linear, determined trajectory of a story that Habermas and Danto
posit as the sole available model. We could rephrase Habermas by saying,
"stories need have no beginning or end; they are held together by actions
and their sideshadows." But Habermas pushes his case still further by
insisting both that the historian <I>necessarily</I> use his greater
knowledge precisely to create a "coherent story":

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A series of events acquires the unity of a story only from a point of view
that cannot be taken from those events themselves. The actors are caught
in their histories; even for them--if they tell their own stories--the
point of view from which the events can take on the coherence of a story
arises only subsequently.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But we should notice here again the assumption that a story has
"coherence," by which Habermas means specifically the coherence of
a classically shaped and closed narrative. The crux of the matter is
that a certain view of history is, in reality, determined not so much
by principles of historiography but by a prior and na&iuml;ve view
of what constitutes a story <I>tout court.</I> If we reconceive our
understanding of the possibilities of storytelling and entertain more
flexibility in our possible models, if we do not insist upon closure
and the retrospective judgment that closure is allowed to dictate, then
the point of view of any single moment in the trajectory of an ongoing
story has a significance that is never annulled or transcended by the
shape and meaning of the narrative as a (supposed) whole.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The problem is that the particular flourishing of historical consciousness
that began in the nineteenth century ended up by making the historian, or
at least the thinker as historical system builder, whether in the form of
a pure philosopher like Hegel, a philosophically trained revolutionary
thinker and polemicist like Marx, or a conservative vulgarizer like
Spengler, seem the one best equipped to interpret the world. But these
kinds of historical analyses, especially when they are part of a larger
philosophical vision, tend to legislate the future, as well as to explain
the present and past, in terms of a single, coherent system whose laws
the philosopher-historian has uncovered. The inevitability of these
laws not only renders

<B></B>

individual human creativity and freedom
irrelevant, it also removes any significance from imagining alternative
paths. Within such a logic, alternatives are "mere daydreams." The
task for sideshadowing is to restore the legitimacy of reflecting
upon what might have taken place instead. Sideshadowing's attention
to the unfulfilled or unrealized possibilities of the past is a way of
disrupting the affirmations of a triumphalist, unidirectional view of
history in which whatever has perished is condemned because it has been
found wanting by some irresistible historico-logical dynamic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What sideshadowing explicitly rejects is a certain view of how events
assume meaning for us, a view perhaps most powerfully put by Wilhelm
Dilthey:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We grasp the significance of a moment of the past. It is significant
insofar as a linkage to the future was achieved in it...The individual
moment [has] significance through its connection with the whole, through
the relation of past and future...But what constitutes the peculiar nature
of this relation of part to whole within life? It is a relation that
is never entirely completed. One would have to await the end of one's
life and could only in the hour of death survey the whole from which
the relation of the parts could be determined. One would have to await

It is worth asking why it should be exclusively the end of the story that
determines how one interprets everything that went before? How much of
a specifically Christian theological perspective has been unwittingly
imported into a historiographic context by this privileging of what
sounds remarkably like a secular Last Judgment? To place such heavy
weight upon "the end of one's life and...the hour of death" reveals this
metamorphosis of a Christian <I>topos</I> with particular vividness. Both
on the personal biographical level, and on the historical one, there is no
reason to accept the retrospective authority of the last days. Dilthey's
attitude here exactly parallels those who say that the Shoah, as the
death of the Austro-German Jewish community, must be understood as a
judgment upon that community, as the event by which everything earlier
acquires its final sense. It is not the smallest irony of such arguments
that, while speaking from a perspective supposedly consonant with Jewish
traditions and values, they actually rely upon the deepest strands of
a Christian metaphysics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But intimately linked, as it clearly is, to a sense of the importance of
sideshadowing, the rejection of the sense-making authority of the future
to determine how we interpret past events still leaves unspecified a way
to clarify the difference between <I>prediction</I> and fore-shadowing. A
constituent part of our sense of the present moment is an imaginative
invest-ment in some of the futures that might come out of it. Because
presentness already includes anticipation, prediction does not in
itself violate the integrity of presentness. Some form of prediction
is an inherent aspect of how we organize our world, affecting both
greater and smaller plans, whether moment by moment or at decisive
turning points. In prediction one makes the best guess possible about
an <I>unknown</I> future, a guess limited by all the partiality of
one's knowledge, temperament, and desire. But in both foreshadowing and
backshadow-ing the writer continuously passes judgment on each of the
projects and predictions of his characters by drawing on the plenitude
of his greater information about the end of the story. Since he knows
which events "really mattered," which plans will bring disaster and
which success, the existence of his subjects as human beings engaged in
an ongoing effort to shape their own futures is denied any substantive
meaning. In texts based upon historical events

<B></B>

known to both
the author and reader, the narrative may <I>seem</I> concerned with
registering the predictions of the characters. But the intrusion of
foreshadowing, the network of portentous signs that signal the future
of the characters and their world, is particularly deceptive because it
is based upon the shared familiarity of a known outcome. In historical
novels, unless the horizon is kept strictly within the consciousness of
the characters themselves, any surplus of knowledge or interpretation is
an instance of pure backshadowing from an already established future,
even if, technically, it presents itself in the rhetorical modes of
either prediction or foreshadowing.

Although everyone's list will surely differ, it is all too easy to think
of representations of the Shoah whose lapses into tastelessness and
exploitation are deeply offensive and which, in their vulgarity, risk
coarsening the collective memory. But rare though they are, there is a
handful of works that have been painfully and movingly illuminating,
whether texts by sur-vivors as different from one another as Primo
Levi's meditations on his concentration-camp experiences and Dan Pagis's
poems <I>Transformations,</I> or entirely imagined narratives like David
Grossman's remarkable novel <I>See Under: Love,</I> semi-fictionalizations
like Heinz Schirk's film of <I>The Wannsee Conference,</I> or many
of Alain Kleinmann's paintings. The best of these, moreover, testify
convincingly against an excessive insistence that <I>only</I> the
gathering of facts has ethical validity--a kind of fetishization that
is all the more insidious because, as the Czernovitz-born  Israeli
novelist Aharon Appelfeld cautions, "the numbers and the facts were the
murderer's own well-proven means. Man as a number is one of the horrors
of dehumanization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is true that of the few authentically moving fictionalizations
of the Shoah, even fewer are actually set inside the death camps, as
though a kind of imaginative closure in the face of the horror made
such scenes unrepresentable. The urge to erect a kind of ethical taboo
prohibiting the fictional representation of the concentration camps is
in part justified--and no doubt in part also motivated--by  an awareness
of how many recent works contain scenes set in the death factories in
order to mobilize the emotions that such extreme situations elicit. The
kind of <I>frisson</I> for which Pawel grasps by linking the births
of Kafka's sister and Hitler bears a family resemblance to the way
William Styron uses the Auschwitz scenes in <I>Sophie's Choice</I>
to give his novel an intensity it would otherwise lack. And both of
these in turn are not as far removed as their authors might think from
the use of concentration-camp settings as a staple of sado-masochistic
pornography. But there is also another, and perhaps even more prevalent
danger that haunts many readers of literature on the Shoah: that of
becoming so caught up in the material that, compared with its intensities,
other themes, ideas, and emotions seem insignificant. This seems to me
an extraordinarily misplaced and even pernicious response, but it is
nonetheless sufficiently seductive and widespread to require conscious
resistance. Norma Rosen's article, "The Second Life of Holocaust
Imagery," for example, is characteristic of this tendency. Rosen, who
is not herself a camp survivor, insists that "for a mind engraved with
the Holocaust, gas is always that gas. Shower means their shower. Ovens
are those ovens. A train is a freight train crammed with suffocating
children."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

 Although she qualifies this grisly
description with the scarcely less overwrought acknowledgment that
"of course this does not always happen. Some days the sky is simply
blue and we do not wonder how a blue sky looked to those on their way
to the crematoria,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 it is difficult to read the texture
and rhetoric of the whole passage except as symptomatic of an almost
clinically obsessive identification with the suffering of others. One
of the more enduring of the many horrors of the Shoah is that it seems
to give such identifications the justification of a highly developed
historical/moral imagination about the agony inflicted upon one's people.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No writer on the Shoah has been more aware of the risks of representing
the ultimate viciousness of the Shoah, or more careful to avoid feeding
an appetitive fascination with evil, than Aharon Appelfeld. A child
of wealthy, thoroughly assimilated Bukovina Jews who were murdered
in the Shoah, the nine-year-old Appelfeld survived by escaping alone
from the Transnistria Camp. Thereafter, he stayed alive by hiding
in the forests, and occasionally working for local peasants until
the Russian army took him along as an assistant cook and helper in
their sweep westward. Finally, he ended up in a refugee camp on the
Italian coast, from which he was taken to Palestine by the Zionist
youth rescue movement. Appelfeld, beyond any other prose writer,
is credited in Israel with having made the Shoah into a legitimate
theme for novelists. Writers like A.B. Yehoshua acknowledge that
"Appelfeld... opened up new possibilities for treating the Holocaust in
literature," and he reminds us how much resistance Appelfeld's novels
initially encountered among an Israeli public that, before the Eichmann
trial, wanted to hear as little as possible about the world inhabited
by the murdered Jews of Europe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Central to the success of
Appelfeld's writings has been the care he exercises in not allowing the
violence of the killers to be directly represented in his novels. In fact,
there are hardly any Nazis in Appelfeld's books at all. His narratives
of the Shoah take place among the secularized Jews of Austria and its
eastern border states, and when the world of the surrounding Aryan
majority is directly visualized, it is always in the form of peasants,
minor officials, and morally compromised, but not openly sadistic fellow
townsmen, rather than through the typical bludgeon-wielding SS guards
of Shoah exploitations. By avoid-ing explicit reference to the Shoah,
and more particularly, by refusing to allow the archetypal scenarios of
concentration-camp savagery to orchestrate the emotional force of his
stories, Appelfeld succeeds in short-circuiting any possibility of the
sado-masochistic identification that haunts literature on the genocide.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But what Robert Alter has praised as Appelfeld's "art of intimation," his
"habitual strategy as a writer haunted by the Holocaust to concentrate
on its historical margins, either prelude or aftermath,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 is
purchased at the price of a psychological reductiveness and a historical
flattening that ultimately may not be much preferable to the lurid
repertoire of horror scenes it was intended to replace. The best way
to illustrate the cost of Appelfeld's technique is to look closely
at <I>Badenheim 1939,</I> the first and most critically acclaimed of
his novels to have appeared in English.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Badenheim is a
typical Austrian spa town, where prosperous, thoroughly secularized
Jews spend their vacations enjoying the restorative mineral baths,
the rich hotel food, and the cultural life of an annual musical and
theatrical summer festival. In the novel, the town becomes a microcosm
of the world of Austro-German Jewry with its cultural pretensions, its
rejection of any overt signs of Jewishness, especially as embodied by
the "vulgar <I>Ostjuden</I>" (Jews from Eastern Europe whose style of
dress, language and

<B></B>

religious observance exacerbated the unease of
westernized Jews),
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 and its hallucinatory refusal to confront
the danger that was literally enclosing it from every side.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

Already a modern, if unacknowledged, ghetto, Badenheim, in the course
of the novel, is turned into a Third Reich transit camp by a series of
ever-tightening legal restrictions imposed by the governing "Sanitation
Department," until eventually, the final directive for a compulsory
"resettlement" to the East orders the entire population to the railway
station where "an engine coupled to four filthy freight cars" 
emerges to take them to their destination. Even at the end, although the
Jews of Badenheim have been deprived of their freedom, their jobs, and
their contact with the outside world, and have been ordered about like
so much chattel (although without any overt physical coercion that would
violate the book's fable-like tone), they retain their by now clearly
absurd optimism. Dr. Pappenheim, a renowned impresario, and the most
fully described character in the book, ends <I>Badenheim 1939</I> with
the cheerfully encouraging comment, "If the coaches are so dirty it must
mean that we have not far to go" .

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But every reader of the novel knows the names of the stations where
the train will dis-gorge its passengers, and if Appelfeld can avoid
mentioning Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, or Mauthausen it is only because of
his certainty that the reader will do so in his place. The reader hears
the desperate will to lie to oneself in Pappenheim's final words and
understands how soon and how savagely that Panglossian confidence will
be silenced. And what is of crucial importance, the reader understands
this precisely from a deep familiarity with the kinds of Shoah texts
and images Appelfeld is applauded for having excluded, so that in a
sense everything that Appelfeld formally bars from his fictional world
he invites back in by virtually compelling his readers to stage the
horrific set pieces in their own imaginations. Ultimately, there is less
difference than either Appelfeld or his admirers would like to claim
between a concluding sentence like "If the coaches are so dirty it must
mean that we have not far to go" and Pawel's "in the...Austrian town of
Braunau, one Clara n&eacute;e Pl&ouml;zl, wife of the customs inspector
Alo&iuml;s Hitler, had given birth to...a sickly infant whose survival
seemed doubtful. He survived." <I>Badenheim 1939</I> is so confident of
its reader's familiarity with descriptions of Nazi bestialities that
it never needs to mention them at all in order to have their specter
loom in the interstices of every scene and dialogue. Thus, when Gabriel
Josipovici interprets Appelfeld's "silence" about the Camps as an implicit
"condemnation" of writers who "mythologize" the Shoah and whose texts
feed our horrified fascination with the details of the extermination
process, he pinpoints the finest impulse in the novels but ignores the
extent to which their power is only made possible by the success of all
the narratives Appelfeld's restraint is supposed to rebuke.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

It is primarily with these texts and images that <I>Badenheim 1939</I>
is in dialogue, and what is lost thereby is the reality of Austro-German
Jewish life, as well as an acknowledgment of the individual complexity
on which genuine understanding depends.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One way to crystallize the general implications of Appelfeld's practice in
terms of my earlier discussion is to see how it completely forecloses any
chance at sideshadowing. Since the relentless glare of the Shoah is ever
present, not merely at the book's end but throughout its unfolding, it
floods the various scenes with its overpowering significance so that
none of them can have a consequence independent of that all-dominant
one. Appelfeld himself clearly recognized the aesthetic and moral problem
raised by backshadowing: his determination

<B></B>

 to avoid directly
representing the Shoah by ending the novel before the killings actually
began is part of this recognition. But since he never tries to voice
a more flexible vision of history, his novel incorporates none of the
openness of sideshadowing, and his decision to exclude the actual violence
of the genocide remains an isolated scruple unrelated to achieving an
authentic understanding of the world of the victims.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To acknowledge the validity of sideshadowing is not merely to reject
historical inevitability as a theoretical model. More importantly, it
means learning to value the contingencies and multiple paths leading
from each concrete moment of lived experience, and recognizing the
importance of those moments not for their place in an already determined
larger pattern but as significant in their own right. This is what
I think of as a "prosaics of the quotidian," and it is fundamentally
linked to the historical logic of sideshadowing. At a crucial point in
<I>Badenheim 1939,</I> the narrator tells us: "But the people were still
preoccupied with their own affairs--the guests with their pleasures
and the townspeople with their troubles" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 This
"preoccupation with their own affairs," as much as the denial of their
Jewishness, is what the novel regards as the unpardonable sin of everyone
in Badenheim, and in Appelfeld's narrative it leads to consequences like
the characters' general refusal even to discuss the fact that overnight
"a barrier was placed at the entrance to the town. No one came in or
went out" . Concern with the immediate and local, the familial and
private, is judged inherently unworthy, an act of betrayal of others
and of blindness to one's own deeper interests. Measured against the
Shoah, as everything in <I>Badenheim 1939</I> is, Appelfeld's charge
carries an intuitive plausibility, but it only makes sense if we agree
to that standard of measurement; his scale loses its meaning if we
consider, for example, that concern with one's ethnic identity, with
the welfare of others in one's community, or with the nature of the
political dispensation under which one lives, are themselves also local
and personal matters, as much a part of prosaics as our "daily pleasures
and troubles." In his contempt for prosaics, or, more accurately, in
his linking of prosaics with pure selfishness, Appelfeld invokes a
standard that he had explicitly rejected when it was forced upon him
as a survivor-immigrant in the early years of Israeli statehood. To
his teachers in the Zionist youth movement, Appelfeld himself later
complained, "personal experience was simply not worthy of recall. Only
if you had been a pioneer...a partisan. Suffering by itself did not
merit attention--unless it served a collective purpose."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

What prosaics argues, though, is that a genuinely democratic, rather
than a tyrannical, collective purpose can arise only out of the shared
aims and hopes of the individuals who make up the larger group; such a
purpose is the meeting-point, not the liquidation, of the innumerable
separate preoccupations and motives of everyone who agrees to work for
the realization of the collective purpose.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Beneath the melancholy of its coolly satiric tone, the deeper irony of
a work like <I>Badenheim 1939</I> is that while it finds a new idiom
in which to narrate the margins of catastrophe, it also finds itself
entrapped in the very explanations it deems unacceptable as soon as they
are spelled out more clearly. Appelfeld himself has spoken with passion
and sorrow about "this anti-Semitism directed at oneself...Even after the
Holocaust Jews did not seem blameless in their own eyes. On the contrary,
harsh comments were made by prominent Jews against the victims for not
protecting themselves and fighting back."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 (Appelfeld is
presumably referring to Hannah Arendt, among others.) Although it is
their assimilationism and lack of Jewish pride, not their inability
to fight, that is satirized, Appelfeld's characters collaborate so

<B></B>

fully in their destruction that among those "prominent Jews" who
make "harsh comments" about the victims of the Shoah, it is difficult
not to include the author of <I>Badenheim 1939</I> as well.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What may seem like only formal decisions about how much knowledge of
the future to include in a narrative set in an earlier epoch, or about
how much to let the narrative glance sideways and project forwards to
events that never happened, is already thematically charged and thereby
morally significant. If it is absurd to see the "great world-historical
event" of 1875 as Lenin's fifth birthday, and if we can smile at the
idea of a secular angel arriving in Langres in 1713 to tell Madame
Diderot that she would soon give birth to a great encyclo-p&aelig;diste,
then we also have to learn to absolve from any blame those Jews who
attended the summer festivals of Salzburg or Badenheim and went about
dressed in <I>Trachten</I> rather than in the paramilitary gear of the
<I>Haganah</I> or the <I>tephillin</I> of the orthodox. There is ample
reason to find preposterous the argument that it is now time to forgive
the murderers; but enough time has passed for us to realize that it was
always partially the shame of not having been there to help them survive
that made blaming the victims of the Shoah so much a part of how the
history of European Jewry has been figured since 1945. Sideshadowing
eliminates neither historical responsibility nor moral judgment, but it
insists we assign them prosaically: to individuals and individual actions
where such judgments properly belong. It is these specific actions and
choices made by individual people that constitute the history we inherit
and with which our own actions and choices must ultimately come to terms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To summarize and then extend my argument thus far as succinctly
and polemically as possible: I think that in the ways the history of
European Jewry has usually been narrated, its annihilation in the camps
is granted a kind of negative teleology that then retroactively provides
the terms by which its entire experience prior to the Third Reich
is judged. And as we have seen, backshadowing of this sort, whether
in the melodramatic formulations of a Pawel or Berkeley, or in the
elegiac ironies of an Appelfeld, inevitably denatures the very different
possibilities facing Jews living at different historical moments, under
radically incommensurate and often rapidly changing conditions. It has
also made the Shoah the foundation for a certain kind of modern Judaism
in which the claims of victimhood as constitutive of Jewish experience
throughout history are asserted either for their potent political charge
or as cultural talismans to be celebrated or chafed against depending
on the particular spokesman's temperament and intentions. Beyond the
immediate political consequences of such a position, consequences
that include, but are not limited to, an emotional/rhetorical climate
in which successive Israeli administrations seek to mobilize Jewish
loyalty through a calculated appeal to the same tragic story  (i.e.,
"Eretz Israel as the last refuge of the [inevitably persecuted] Jews"),
there is a more insidious corollary to privileging the Shoah in such a
way. Whether unwittingly, or as part of an explicitly accepted belief,
each time the Shoah is evoked in the terms I have described, it relies
upon the

<B></B>

logically prior assumption that the real "proof" of the
worth of an individual, a doctrine, or a political/ethical system, is
how it holds up under the harshest testing imaginable--a kind of <I>in
extremis veritas</I> interpretation of an entire culture and all of its
specific practices.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Clearly nothing of what I have written should be taken as an attempt to
disparage the ongoing studies of the historical roots, political context
and (if this is the right phrase) bur-eaucratic "institutionalization"
of the Shoah. But analysts are right to underline the fact that Menachem
Begin was the first Israeli Prime Minister regularly to invoke the Shoah
in his major addresses, and anyone fascinated by the evocative power of
narrative and rhetorical patterns will register how fraught with risks
such a backward glance can be when it encourages, implicitly or by design,
apocalyptic fears through the medium of its evocations.  As we can see
today both in Israel and in the American political and academic body, once
victimhood is understood to endow one with special claims and rights,
the scramble to attain that desig-nation for one's own interest group
is as heated as any other race for legitimacy and power. Victimhood, one
needs to remember, is scarcely a fixed term and there is something truly
depressing in the clamor of competing voices to prove whose distress has
been more per-sistent and devastating, and whose claims to compensatory
rectification are therefore more worthy. For a particularly demoralizing
example of this tendency one need look no further than the August 1991
Crown Heights turmoil between the Lubavitcher and the black communities
and the ways in which it was immediately inscribed within competing
nar-ratives of victimization. Long infuriated by the perceived special
treatment accorded to the Lubavitchers, black anger was triggered when
a car in the Grand Rebbe's entourage jumped a curb and struck two black
children, killing one, Gavin Cato, and seriously injuring his cousin,
Angela. In the three days of riots that ensued, a twenty-nine-year-old
Australian Jewish scholar, Yankel Rosenbaum, was murdered and two more
Hasidic men were stabbed. The assaults were accompanied by intense
anti-Semitic harassment in which Jews were directly compared to slave
owners, and the death of Cato was seen as a direct continuation of the
callous disregard for black lives on the slave ships and plantations. In
an article revealingly entitled "Invisible Man: The Lynching of Yankel
Rosenbaum," David Evanier recounts how "the media at best treated the
accidental death of Gavin Cato and the murder of Rosenbaum as morally
equivalent. The worst ignored Rosenbaum entirely. The conflict between
blacks and Jews was seen as being in balance, with the 'social justice'
edge going to the blacks... Anti-Semitism was not mentioned in any
editorial about Crown Heights in New York newspapers until August 29
[nine days after the killing] in the <I>New York Post.</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

But even though Evanier's accusation of moral obtuseness on the part of
the New York media seems to me in the main justified, his own narrative
is itself decidedly problematic. The reason the media tended to see "the
'social justice' edge going to the blacks" was primarily because in the
United States, Jews are not regarded as a vulnerable minority, while
African-Americans are perceived, both rhetorically and legally, in such
terms. But instead of contesting the whole ideology of justification
by degree of historical victimization, Evanier, as the title of his
piece clearly announces, wants only to reassign the status of principal
victim first by casting Yankel Rosenbaum as the 1991 equivalent of the
unnamed black narrator of Ralph Ellison's <I>Invisible Man,</I> and
then by claiming that the Lubavitchers today run as great a risk of
public lynchings as did Southern blacks during the Jim Crow era. The
Lubavitcher



community itself, in the form of the "Crown Heights
Emergency Fund," placed a full-page <B></B>
advertisement in <I>The New York
Times</I> on 20 September 1991 under the heading "This Year Kristallnacht
Took Place on August 19th Right Here in Crown Heights." Their version of
what Leo Strauss had called a <I>reductio ad Hitlerum</I> was rightly
perceived by those who had been in Germany on <I>Kristallnacht</I>
(9 November 1938) as an outrageous comparison. The brutal beatings and
mass arrests of thousands of Jews, the looting of Jewish homes and stores
throughout the country, and the burning of Jewish synagogues, libraries,
and community centers, all organized and planned by the state itself,
simply bears no relationship to the events in Brooklyn.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

However, I am not concerned here to re-examine the circumstances leading
to the death of Gavin Cato and the murder of Yankel Rosenbaum, but
rather to question the entire urge to establish one's credentials as an
eternal victim in order to claim an unassailable moral high ground. Such
a claim can only be substantiated by interpreting each unhappy event as a
repetition/continuation of the worst experiences in the communal memory,
with the result that it almost seemed to both sides to have been Nazis
and slaveholders who confronted one another, rather than citizens of
Brooklyn in 1991.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Were the consequences of such distortions
not so pernicious, they might almost be comic: the image of a Southern
plantation owner with <I>peyas</I> (sidelocks), dressed in a Hasidic black
coat and wearing his <I>tallit</I> (prayer shawl) and <I>tephillin</I>
(phylacteries), confronting a black dressed in the SS regalia of the
Aryan master race has an undeniably macabre absurdity to it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moreover, as my examples make clear, in spite of current assumptions
in this country, to criticize the rhetoric of victimhood does
not mean aligning oneself with any particular political party or
direction. Throughout much of this century in Europe, the primary
political expression of the sense of being injured, of anger at having
been reduced to the role of a marginalized victim, has been the province
of the far right. Fascism and Nazism both capitalized on and fueled
the <I>ressentiment</I> of people who were convinced that they had
been unfairly mistreated, while others (usually the Jews, but also
intellectuals, homosexuals, members of Masonic Lodges, etc.) received
unmerited privileges. Hitler, in particular, regularly appealed to the
Germans to see themselves as innocent victims of a host of interlocked
evils ranging from the Versailles treaty to parliamentary corruption,
all secretly orchestrated by an international Jewish conspiracy intent
on world rule. Insofar as the increasingly problematic categories of
"left"- and "right"-wing positions still retain any useful meaning today,
it is instructive to see that the position of justification by one's
historical affliction is invoked in Israel largely by the political
and cultural right, while in North America and the United Kingdom
this is done primarily by the left. Yet people who are quite willing
to resist the Likud Party's invocation of the Shoah to legitimize its
policies are swayed by analogous arguments derived from the horrors of
slavery, or the history of gender-, race-, and sexual-inclination-based
discrimination and violence, in order to justify the creation of a newly
ennobled victim-group whose refrains of oppression are manipulated for
legislative and political ends.

It took considerable courage for the Israeli novelist A.B. Yehoshua to
remind a predom-inantly Jewish readership that "we must bear in mind that
our having been victims does not accord us any special moral standing. The
victim does not become virtuous for having been a victim. Although the
Holocaust inflicted a horrible injustice upon us, it did not grant
us a certificate of everlasting righteousness. The murderers were
amoral; the victims were not made moral. To be moral you must behave
ethically. The test of that is daily and constant."

This
same distinction holds true, unpopular though such a view is, for victims
of AIDS, racism, rape, or cancer, or any of the numerous brutalities and
inequities that continue to flourish in our society. Indeed, it seems to
me an indecency to assume that victims are somehow "ennobled" by their
(usually involuntarily undergone) suffering, since such an assumption
necessarily endows the cause of the suffering with the capacity to bring
out a previously hidden worthiness. If anything, as the experience of
recent history has shown, too sharp a sense of one's own victimization
can easily lead to a compensatory urge to tyrannize over others, and
those convinced of their unique victimhood are quite likely to prove
tyrants both to themselves and to others if given the chance, whether
their frustration is confined to a protest against the curriculum in a
modern university, expressed in the mob violence of an urban riot, or
vented in political rallies like those cheering Ariel Sharon in the most
recent <I>Gush Emunim</I> settlement in the West Bank.

For Jewish thought, what is most troubling in the conjunction of
foreshadowing and the sense of victimization in narratives like
Appelfeld's or Pawel's is its complicity with the dispiriting
clich&eacute; that sees in the entirety of Jewish existence nothing
more than a wrenching from horror to horror. It is exactly against what
Sal&ograve; Baron called this "lachrymose view of Jewish history" as only
a <I>Jammergeschichte,</I> an endless tale of woe, that the best volumes
of modern Jewish historical and cultural studies have been written. In
a crucial essay on the "Deformations of the Holocaust," Robert Alter
urged that "it is as important to study how the Jews <I>lived</I> as
how they died."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 In many ways, I believe that it is Alter's
formulation, with its principled refusal to interpret the Shoah as
the single grounding event of Diaspora Jewish history, that offers a
genuinely productive relationship to the achievements, as well as to
the pain, of the past two centuries of Jewish experience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But just as important, I want to insist that <I>any</I> sense of
identity as constituted primarily by victimization is an extraordinarily
problematic basis for either an individual or a group to build upon,
and the sad truth is that, in contrast to the celebrated opening of
Tolstoy's <I>Anna Karenina,</I> it is "unhappy" consciousnesses that
so much resemble one another in their misery, while happiness is always
singular and hard-won. More challengingly, though, and, against much of
the writing done today on the Shoah from both religious and philosophical
perspectives, I believe that very little about human nature or values
can be learned from an <I>in extremis</I> situation except the virtual
tautology that extreme pressure brings out extreme and extremely diverse
behavior. Beliefs, ideas, values, and people are tested best in the daily,
routine actions and habits of normal life, not in moments of extraordinary
crisis, and because foreshadowing can only point to a single, inherently
dramatic, rather than typical and quotidian resolution, it must privilege
the uniquely climactic over the normative and repeatable. To reject
the validating force of extreme crises involves both formal and ethical
decisions precisely because such a rejection, based as it is on a moral
stance, will necessitate the search for a new form of writing in order to
articulate its new understanding. Only a prosaics of sideshadowing can, I
think, do justice, both humanly and philosophically, to the richness, of
the claims of the ordinary, because it recognizes how various the strands
of that ordinariness really are, and how shrilly thin by comparison



are the dramas we usually take as revelatory. More specifically, because
the Shoah has been appropriated so often during the past four decades
as an all too-available archetype of both personal and collective
suffering, its meaning has been assimilated to the most conventional
<I>donn&eacute;es</I> of our epoch. Despite the 
<B></B> 
ritual insistence on the
singularity of the genocide, the "final solution" has itself become one
of the most often adduced instantiations of an unexamined and deeply
false commonplace--the belief that the real worth of our culture can
only be authoritatively tested at the extreme limit of human behavior.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For someone who has been through the blackness of the concentration
camps, the conviction that the experiences undergone there have revealed
a fundamental truth about the world often seems irresistible. In Lawrence
Langer's extraordinary analysis of taped interviews made with survivors of
the Shoah, Irene W. explains that the "extreme pessimism" that haunts her
is part of a "total world view" in which she feels that she has learned
the real "truth about people, human nature, about death...[I emerged]
knowing the truth in a way that other people don't."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 We
need to be extraordinarily careful neither to condemn sur-vivors for
the bitterness that they insist is only the "truth" the rest of us are
too sheltered or afraid to acknowledge, nor to share their judgment in
our own thinking. For many, but by no means all survivors, their time in
the camps is the central truth of their lives, and stays with them, in
Langer's phrase, like "a communal wound that cannot heal."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

We need to respect their "total world view," but it is not, nor should we
try to make it, the truth of ours. It is the <I>singularity</I> of the
concentration camps, not their representative or emblematic character
that we need to keep clearly in focus, especially now that the Shoah is
invoked so often to sub-stantiate and lend emotional force to a diffuse
range of arguments about modern society, fundamental human nature, and
the character of Western culture as a whole.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In spite of the impassioned self-identification with and search for an
absolute (even though absolutely negative) meaning in the experience of
the Shoah, no one becomes a survivor either by virtue of being a Jew
or by the intensity of their absorption in the history and literature
of the Shoah (e.g., Sylvia Plath's notorious lines from "Daddy": "An
engine, an engine / Chuffing me off like a Jew. / A Jew to Dachau,
Auschwitz, Belsen. / I began to talk like a Jew. / I think I may well
be a Jew").
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 This fact needs to be emphasized because it
can serve as a corrective to an unconscious, but therefore all the
more insidious, "idealizing" (in the sense of "taking as a globally
instructive model") of the Shoah. Because so much of our culture is
still strongly bound to the belief that the truth lies in the extreme
moments which "ordinary bourgeois life" covers over, and that it is
only at the (appropriately named) "cutting edge" of the unthinkable
that the most valuable insights lay hidden, it has become possible, by
a truly grotesque inversion, to interpret the ruthlessness of the Shoah
as offering the most authentic--because most horrendous--image of the
underlying reality of our world. Although the extent, brutality, and
single-mindedness of the Nazi genocide are unprecedented, its narrative
incorporation into what one can call an ideology of the extreme has
the paradoxical, and entirely unintended effect of assimilating it to
a cultural tradition that itself encouraged a turn to the excessive and
the apocalyptic. (Notice here, as well, how this paradox, in which the
genocide is simultaneously regarded as utterly unique and yet emblematic
of the modern world, perfectly recapitulates the contradiction between
interpreting the Shoah as at once unimaginable and inevitable.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The fascination with the brutal and the dangerous holds a compelling
place in our culture's imagination. In Joseph Conrad's <I>Lord
Jim,</I> for example, the narrator, Marlow, tells his listeners that
"the truth can be wrung out of us only by some cruel...catastrophe,"
and Jim himself is advised that the only way to test himself is by
seeking out the most extreme

<B></B>

and trying circumstances possible:
"to the destructive element submit yourself...In the destructive element
immerse."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 But as Dostoevsky had already predicted at the end
of the nineteenth century, it is not that far from the celebration of
authenticity, risk, and spon-taneity to envisaging murder as the final
and potentially purifying confrontation with "the destructive element"
in humankind. Moreover, as Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi points out, it is Jewish
culture that regularly has been "decimated by the apocalyptic fantasies
of others,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 and in the refiguring of the extermination of
European Jewry it is especially important not to allow an internalized
version of that same imaginative legacy to dictate the terms within
which the Shoah is interpreted.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is a subtle but clear link between the view that the truth stands
out most clearly in an extreme situation and the conviction that a hidden
system or pattern exists waiting to be uncovered beneath the diversity of
normal human existence. Both attitudes long for global revelations and are
contemptuous of random, haphazard, and inassimilable contingencies. Both
are in quest of a revelatory moment that will disclose the <I>one</I>
truth that matters. Against this notion of truth being found at the utmost
hazard of life, the prosaics of sideshadowing wants to locate it in the
ordinary and quotidian actions of our communal existence. To grasp just
how provocative this proposition really is, it is worth emphasizing that
sideshadowing encourages the same skepticism towards Hegelian or Marxist
teleological readings of history as it does towards earlier master tropes
like chiliastic numerology. Sideshadowing is defined by its attention
to the pressures of randomness and contingency, to a view of the self as
an aggregate of ever-changing habits, memories, and experiences, shaped
in part by unforeseen and unforeseeable circumstances, and to a notion
of truth as precisely what is <I>not</I> a puzzle to be solved or a
revelation to be authenticated in a uniquely climactic struggle. Hence,
too, prosaics insists upon an understanding of time as a succession
of content-rich differences, rather than as an endless repetition of
identically meaningless units suddenly punctuated and redeemed by the
thunderclap of the significant cataclysm.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Jewish thought, the privileging of the claims of victimhood has created
what Michael R. Marrus calls "the triumphalism of pain,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>

but versions of that triumphalism flourish through-out Western society,
operating simultaneously at the level of high art, mass culture, and
political rhetoric. The British writer Michael Frayn shrewdly asks why the
paradigm of literature should so closely resemble a kind of <I>Consumer's
Report</I> description of a new product: "Like electric toasters, the
characters of fiction are tested, by stress and crisis, until they
break down. And the convention is that what emerges at this point is
their 'real' nature, which has up till then remained hidden from others
and even from the owners of the nature themselves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 The
strength of this paradigm is evident throughout our culture, not merely
in literature, and its persistence testifies to the interpenetration of
tropes from one register to another. If the narration of Jewish history
has any generalizable lesson, it is surely to illustrate the dangers
of such a convention. The fact that Jews, as often as anyone else, lay
claim in their own self-interest to a special access to truth derived
from their unprecedented suffering only shows the persistence of a
cultural <I>topos</I> even among those who, in other ways, have sought
strenuously to shed the victim's role.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For a prosaics of sideshadowing, the question of how to live one's
ethnic, racial, or sexual heritage is a subset of the more general
issue of finding a proper relationship to temporality and communal
identity. Against current ideologies that compete about which one of
these

<B></B>

aspects, most commonly either the ethnic or the sexual,
should be seen as somehow foundational for the entirety of one's being,
prosaics regards each one as an equally valid ground base upon which one
learns to play out the infinitely complex variations that constitute our
freedom. Mikhail Bakhtin would argue that counterlives are imaginatively
enriching because, to adapt Caryl Emerson's apt phrase, they remind
us of the primacy of the differences we <I>make</I> over those with
which we are born.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 As a corollary to this theme one can
add Michael Frayn's insistence that "we don't choose a moral response
[from a pre-established set of options]; we construct one."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>

The step-by-step, never identical construc-tion of a life, a history, and
an ethic is the core of a prosaic practice and the principal imaginative
lesson of sideshadowing.

Because the word "holocaust" carries with it a penumbra of
unwelcome Christological echoes and still more unwelcome implications
of a divinely sanctioned sacrifice, I have preferred to use the
Hebrew word "Shoah" throughout this essay in referring to the Nazi
genocide. "Holocaust" is derived from the Greek <I>holokauston</I> used
in the Septuagint in the sense of "totally consumed by fire." In the
Septuagint it refers specifically to sacrifice by fire, assonant with
the Hebrew term for sacrificial offering, <I>olah</I>, which, as Berel
Lang explains,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
designates the type of ritual sacrifice that was to be completely burnt
(as in Leviticus 1:3). The English usage of holocaust in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries elaborated this literal sense of a religious burnt
offering; later, the term began to appear as a metaphor for sacrifice
more generally ...Both the Hebrew designation <I>shoah</I> ('wasteland'
or 'destruction,' as in Isaiah 10:3 and Proverbs 3:25) and the Yiddish
variation of the Hebrew <I>churban</I> ('destruction')--the latter
traditionally applied to the destruction of the Temples and then reapplied
metonymically to other destructions--are more accurately descriptive than
'Holocaust,' because they imply a breach or turning point in history
(<I>and</I> because they reject the connotation of 'sacrifice').

Austrian Jews had long been in the habit of vacationing
at resorts that were hospitable to them, less out of any particular
"clannishness" or desire to remain exclusively among their own kind
than as a consequence of being barred from numerous other spas. George
Berkeley quotes a proclamation by the mayor of one of these spa towns,
Maria Tafel, issued in July 1920: "It has been repeatedly observed that
Jews are finding lodgings and meals in Maria Tafel. Owners of hotels,
coffee houses, and inns are requested not to cater to Jews...Maria Tafel
is the most famous health resort in Lower Austria and not a Jewish
temple." Berkeley adds that "another resort community, Erfinding,
decreed that no Jew could stay in the town for more than twenty-four
hours." (Berkeley, <I>Vienna and Its Jews,</I> 158.) In 1922, in order
to be allowed to stay overnight in the resort town of Mattsee, near
Salzburg, Arnold Schoenberg was asked to produce a certificate of baptism
to counter charges that he was a Jew. Although Schoenberg had converted
to Lutheranism in 1898, the incident at Mattsee, along with others of
a similar character, acted as a catalyst for the composer's return to
Judaism. (Robert S. Wistrich, <I>The Jews of Vienna in the Age of Franz
Joseph,</I> [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989], 630-32.) Thus,
no matter how assimilationist, or how eager to deny their identities,
long before the date of the novel's actions, vacationers in a place like
Badenheim would have been sufficiently conscious of being Jews to have
chosen (or been indirectly forced) to go to a resort that was ready to
accept them. Moreover, Appelfeld is fully aware of these details, and
freely uses them in his other novels. <I>The Age of Wonders,</I> for
example, opens with the twelve-year-old narrator's memory of when he
and his mother were suddenly expelled from the vacation resort where
they were spending the summer of 1938.

Similarly, on 29 October 1992, when seventeen-year-old
Lemrick Nelson, Jr. was acquitted of all charges in the murder of
Rosenbaum, the black and Hasidic communities were united in the conviction
that the whole trial was determined by racist motives. But for the first
group, Nelson's initial arrest and trial was the result of collusion
between a corrupt police force and a suborned city medical examiner's
office eager to find a "black sacrificial lamb"; for the second group,
the teenager's release was seen as due largely to the jury's anti-Semitism
and fear of mob violence. An official report of the entire Crown Heights
episode, commissioned by New York Governor Mario Cuomo and overseen by
Richard Girgenti, the state's Director of Criminal Justice, concluded
that the entire city administration, including the Mayor David Dinkins,
the Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown, and top police commanders, were all
at fault for not preventing the escalation of violence. The report also
blamed inept police procedure in handling the evidence against Lemrick

Music fills the streets of the New Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
<I>Stra&szlig;enmusik,</I> or "street music," is everywhere to be
heard. On a given day in virtually any German city with a population
greater than one hundred thousand, one can encounter an array of
performance sites separated from each other by, perhaps, one hundred
feet, a distance sufficient to prevent the performances of one group
from interfering with those of another. On this same day, the musicians
performing would surely represent various mixtures of Andean pan-pipe
music, a Slavic folk-music troupe, a youthful chamber trio from the
local music academy, Roma or Sinti musicians assuming various guises,
an American with a guitar and minimal stock of songs from the 1950s and
1960s folk-music revival, and a desperate-looking German in a wheelchair,
playing a cassette recorder as a musical instrument. After one has spent
some time in German cities, it may well seem that music is a permanent
fixture; the Andean pan-pipe ensembles are everywhere; so too is Irish
folk music in one form or another. Street musicians, nevertheless, are
mobile, and many travel from city to city so that they might find new
audiences, ready for new sounds and new entertainment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Passersby respond to this street music in different ways. Some listen
intently, particularly to the most foreign and exotic music, or to the
youthful prodigies from the music academy. If the musical performance
is not particularly accomplished or the musicians present a rather
ragged-looking front, pedestrians march quickly by, looking with an
intense nervousness in another direction, but usually still dropping
some coins in the hat or guitar case on the sidewalk.

<B></B>

For the
most part, street musicians earn well from their performances. They are
sensitive to the flow of pedestrian traffic and rarely situate themselves
in such a way that they intrude upon the coming and going along the
street. To intrude physically with pedestrian traffic would also bring
them into conflict both with the merchants, whose shops are the eventual
goal of the pedestrians, and with the police, whose responsibility it
is to maintain orderliness. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that
street music has come to provide one of the ways with which German
cities represent and disseminate their own public images. Street music
makes the city a pleasant place to visit and to shop, to enjoy and to
be entertained.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other musical traditions frequently inflect this soundscape, and the
exact mixture of tra-ditions usually indicates shifting public attitudes
toward the ways in which the city represents the past and present. In
the New Germany, these shifting public attitudes are evident in the
growing presence of foreignness, not just the Slavic troupes from
Eastern Europe, which have increased markedly in number during the
past four years, but in the repertories drawn from Jewish and Turkish
traditions. These repertories transform the streets because they are
musics to be listened to, not just heard.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 They direct the
flow of pedestrian traffic and the pace with which foreignness can be
released from the narratives of the past and integrated into the struggle
to build a multicultural present.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Street music is no single musical style or repertory, but rather a sound
mix from the past and present, which also cuts across national, ethnic,
and racial borders. Street music is also not simply an international
phenomenon. If the mix of repertories suggests a sort of world music,
a global potpourri played and played out for a society capable of
connecting itself to cultures throughout the world, closer observation
and listening fix instead on the German-ness of the conditions that make
this modern street music possible. Political themes in many German songs
are local; others refer directly to the problems inherent in Germany's
growing political presence in a Europe struggling with union on one hand
and resurgent nationalism on the other. The local is evident also in the
songs of those who sing in dialect or in foreign-language repertories from
across the borders. In these ways, street music marks and remarks upon
many of the conditions that have made the New Germany possible and that
establish the historical connections between the New Germany and its past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The modernity that <I>Stra&szlig;enmusik</I> represents is
unavoidable. The modern German city is not a complex of simply streets,
but of streets converted to <I>Fu&szlig;g&auml;ngerzonen,</I> or
"pedestrian zones." It is as if the twentieth-century German equivalent
of Walter Benjamin's Parisian arcades is the pedestrian zone.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
The twentieth century, in fact, has necessitated the German pedestrian
zone, which replaced many of the streets of the inner city destroyed
during World War II; it is as if the pedestrian zone is a monument to
the past, at once given meaning by and establishing routine with the
rhythm of pedestrians going about their business.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 In the
German pedestrian zone, the aural replaces the visual, mapping the urban
German land-scape with sound.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 The pedestrian must negotiate
this landscape not as the fl&acirc;neur, choosing the route according
to whim or fancy, but rather as the good B&uuml;rger, following those
paths that map out the route, that routinize the everyday.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the soundscape possesses the qualities of everyday experience, its
individual com-ponents, nevertheless, are highly differentiated in the

New Germany. The musicians whose aural domains continually reconfigure
the street and the historical stage it creates for the everyday represent
vastly different musical traditions. The street is not the only stage
on

<B></B>

which these new forms of foreignness have emerged to contest
the modern German cultural landscape. A Yiddish folk-song revival and
the mass production of Turkish music have increasingly benefited from
an expanded market and media interest in the past decade. The bins in
German record stores overflow with Yiddish CDs and cassettes, most of
them made by young Germans, but many of them productions of "historical
recordings," remastered artifacts and rare recordings recuperated as
documents of pre-Holocaust Europe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 For many Germans this music
memorializes "their" Jewish past. This past, however, never existed,
at least in Germany, where Yiddish was never a modern vernacular and
Jewish <I>klezmer</I> music was never more than an exotic import from
Eastern Europe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 These attempts do serve as modern versions
of previous music histories, for example those that yielded earlier
Yiddish folk-song revivals (e.g., at the turn of the century and during
the 1920s).
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The revival of Yiddish folk song sustains itself
as another form of memorializing the past.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The growing presence of Turkish music in Germany depends on a different
transform-ation of the cultural landscape, an implosion from within
that has necessarily spilled over to the public sphere. Turkish music
initially entered German intellectual history together with orientalist
passions, the poetry of Goethe, notably <I>West-&ouml;stlicher
Divan,</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 as well as music historical writings, the
best-known of which was Raphael Georg Kiesewetter's <I>Die Musik
der Araber,</I> which despite its name was based largely on Turkish
sources.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The music of new Turkish musicians, however, is not
the same as that imagined by the orientalist, but rather a modern popular
music, which chronicles the experiences of <I>Gastarbeiter</I> (guest
workers), who keep Germany's industrial machinery running but remain
suspended between the cultures of two worlds. The Turkish music that
fills Turkish-German television and appears in new published and recorded
anthologies is by no means a revival; like its earlier incarnation, it
depends on a modernity born of the expansion of industry in a country
whose own population is unable to provide a sufficient work-force to
keep the assembly lines moving. Denied German citizenship, Turkish guest
workers have become an irreplaceable cog in Germany modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernity and foreignness are therefore inseparable from the street music
of the New Germany. The conditions that undergird street music are the
same as those that conflate modernity and foreignness, while rendering
their relationship uneasy: their cohabitation in the music of the city is
an unsettling reminder of the past. Modernity, as I wish to examine it
in this essay, arises because of the particular ways in which past and
present are connected.

<B></B>

Through musical performance, a composition
from the past or a song that signifies an event of the past enters the
present. In addition to connecting past and present, music also exhibits
the capacity to embody difference, hence the foreignness that penetrates
German modern-ity. I should also wish to argue in this essay that German
modernity, like German street music, is not simply an international
phenomenon or another version of globalization. German modernity depends,
so I shall argue, on the specific ways in which the present can index
the past; music--especially street music--renders these ways specific.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Street music creates venues in which the past is contested and
challenges traditionalized notions of music's ability to convey
identity--particularly the intractable presence of Germanness, the will
to rediscover the nationalism that has reproduced tragedy so effectively
throughout the past two centuries. It is precisely in street music,
moreover, that the constructed distinctions between folk, popular, and
&eacute;lite music come undone, for it is a music that singles out no
one audience, but rather invites all to listen. This, too, is a condition
of modernity in the New Germany. Modernity has historically undergirded
the arts in Germany. "New music," that is, "musical modernism," receives
considerable financial support from public coffers, and the production
of modern music in centers such as Darmstadt and at festivals such as
Donaueschingen thrives in unparalleled fashion. During the past decade new
musical practices have proliferated in Germany, reestablishing connections
to more troubling moments in the German past and undergirding modernity in
its generation of German history. The places in which one finds these new
musical practices assume many forms and create diverse publics. In fact,
these new musical practices would seem to mirror many different Germanies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The insistent presence of modernity in public musical practices not only
makes the proliferation of Germanies possible, but also reifies them
through forms of performance that connect past and present. Music played
out before the public may narrate that past as if it were the present. It
therefore is of only secondary importance whether the history narrated
by music recreates a moment of Reformation history, the wedding dances
played by a Jewish <I>klezmer</I> ensemble, or the songs of Peruvian
migrant workers. Such musics are performed on many different stages in
Germany and attract diverse audiences. These audiences may well be an
&eacute;lite, concert-going public; they may well be shoppers negotiating
the pedestrian zone. I should like to argue here, in fact, that it is
characteristic of German modernity that music challenges many different
publics to confront the presence of foreignness in Germany in the past
and present.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The <I>Stra&szlig;enmusik</I> of the New Germany embodies what initially
seems like the ineluctable contradictions of modernity, the juxtaposition
of tradition and contemporaneity, of folk music and the technologies
of modern music. Music itself--as a performative art--makes these
contradictions possible, for it so effectively uses the present to
index the past. It is impossible to shake the burden of the past from
music, and yet each performance reflects the conditions that made it
possible. The <I>Stra&szlig;enmusik</I> of the New Germany is therefore
no more separable from the revivals of invented traditions or the
steady production of German automobiles than from the busy traffic of
pedestrians, whose affluence and engagement with music are necessary for
the financial support of musical performance of all kinds, in the concert
hall or on the street. If indeed sharp political differences separate
the German from the street musician, the performance of music unites
them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 German street music, moreover, has

<B></B>

historically
been at base political, and hence transforms the pedestrian zone into
a site for the contestation of contemporary problems. That resulting
sense of expectation, nevertheless, is not at base political but rather
apolitical, ameliorated by the long history of <I>Stra&szlig;enmusik</I>
in Central Europe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The contradictions of modernity embodied by street music are at once
immediately apparent and immediately displaced from the moment of
its production. The resurgence of Jewish, Turkish, and other musics
representing foreignness during the past decade conveys the immediacy of a
persistent problem confronting Germany throughout the twentieth century:
namely the presence of non-Germans on its soil. At various historical
moments, these non-Germans have borne the designations of different
"races" <I>(Rassen)</I> or the somewhat more neutral designations
of different "peoples" <I>(V&ouml;lker).</I> Their differences,
nevertheless, demanded that they occupy special places in German society
and history. These places, when properly maintained, can mask and hide
the conflicts of race, yet history has dictated a repetition of the same
acts of displacement, necessitating repeated forms of deracination, that
is, of excluding foreignness from notions of Germanness. Contemporary
<I>Stra&szlig;enmusik</I> is one of the most recent, most public, and
most modern of such forms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The entangled interrelations of music, modernity, and foreignness not
only symbolize but have become a simulacrum for the presence of the
modern pedestrian zone in Germany. In this essay I wish to interrogate
this entanglement, adopting a rhetorical strategy that reflects the
contradictory ways in which one negotiates the pedestrian zone itself. We
shall move, therefore, from site to site, from performance to performance,
not so much to prove that we can unravel the fabric of modernity or that
we have solutions for the troubling responses to racism and foreignness in
German history. Instead, the musical performances we shall encounter here
will represent the conditions of modernity that make this entanglement
possible. We shall confront modernity, then, as we would in the New
Germany, as an every-day experience, whose components, nonetheless, are
anything but everyday.

<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
<!--_/attribution-->
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
German artists and intellectuals consciously began to cultivate the
concept of modernity <I>(die Moderne)</I> at the end of the nineteenth
century. Imbuing the concept with revolutionary potential, these artists
and intellectuals, such as Heinrich Hart, one of the ideologues of
the so-called Berliner Moderne, moved modernity to the streets of the
city. Formed first from a sense of rejecting the past, the new aesthetic
of modernity encountered foreignness on the streets, a foreignness
formed out of the migration from rural areas to the city, and out of
immigration to the city, largely of Eastern European ethnic groups. The
city, in turn, became a context for modernity, but this context mixed in
various forms of foreign culture represented by new residents and new
communities. Modernity, therefore, assumed no single form in Berlin,
Munich, or Hamburg, but instead reflected the flux and complex bricolage
that an expanding urban population fostered.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Berlin
guidebooks even took pains

<B></B>

to publicize the city's modernity as
multicultural, publishing statistics that listed the different national
origins of its new residents, proclaiming at the end of one such set of
statistics that "the main railway terminals were situated in such ways
that the foreigner <I>[der Fremde]</I> will find himself immediately
caught up in the swirl of the gigantic city."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Modernity
thus assumed local forms, which encouraged Jewish and Eastern European
intellectuals to regard Berlin as the site for establishing new forms
of artistic production, even those with political ends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The new modernity also signaled a liberation of the many places in
which the arts were produced and displayed or performed, were made
public. On one hand, these places were physical, the lecture halls
of the universities that Heinrich Hart and his colleagues avoided,
or the institutions that canonized the artistic production of late
romanticism. On the other hand, these places were temporal, for it
was a liberation from history--the oppressive spaces carved out by
Hegel and Heinrich von Treitschke, occupied by "historical peoples"
<I>(Geschichtsv&ouml;lker)--</I>that provided the essential literary
impulse for aesthetic modernity. The processes of liberation, however
differently they were construed, nevertheless ran head-on into the
contradictions of modernity. Munich poets, such as Ludwig Thoma,
adapted modernity to dialect and to the forms of folk literature (e.g.,
"D'Marie," the eponymous poetic narrative of a waitress), and criticized
the foreignness that increasingly characterized Munich.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
In contrast, non-Germans played an important role in staking out new
aesthetic turf, for example, Vassily Kandinsky, through his seminal
position in the Blaue Reiter movement, and Arnold Schoenberg, through
his break with tonality in music and his position as aesthetician for the
so-called New Viennese School. Both Kandinsky and Schoenberg, moreover,
tempered their modernism with folk and popular traditions, Kandinsky
with folk Catholicism and Schoenberg with cabaret.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The contradictions in turn-of-the-century modernity were by no means
isolated phenom-ena in German intellectual history. German science,
too, concerned itself, at times obses-sively, with the definition of
progress, one of several conditions giving way to modernity, through
its dialectical relation to <I>Rasse</I> and <I>Volk.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
By the beginning of the twentieth century, these terms were essential
to the understanding of difference. <I>Rasse</I> might mean "species,"
used for example to describe different animal species. When describing
humans, <I>Rasse</I> referred at one level to biological differences, but
at another to the distinctive ways in which peoples created culture. Such
terminology was totally scientistic in its capacity to parse the world
into meaningful differences.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Progress and modernity in music, too, relied on this scientism. Central
European music-ologists conflated racial difference and teleological
history, "heredity and development" as Richard Wallaschek referred
to them, demonstrating unequivocally that the greatness of modern
German music was an inevitable component of the culmination of world
history.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Central Europeans epitomized what German folk
song scholars such as Werner Danckert called <I>Geschichtsv&ouml;lker,</I>
or "people with history," whereas other Europeans represented the
<I>Randv&ouml;lker,</I> the "people at the edges," that is, "marginal
people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 By the turn of the century, however, the borders
between edges and history were collapsing, confronting peoples with or
without history with the conditions of musical modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The measurement of racial and ethnic differences in music continued
during the course of the twentieth century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 The exact
balance between biological and cultural explanations of these musical
differences shifted and continues to shift, sometimes politically
correct, at

<B></B>

other times not. Quantification relies on observable
phenomena in the music itself--harmony, as the supreme achievement
of a people with history--but also on the proximity of musical to
language structure. Seemingly neutral classificatory judgments connect
music to place, privileging those repertories and genres that are
<I>bodenst&auml;ndig,</I> "rooted in the soil." The pedestrian zone, in
contrast, offers little chance of rooting musical traditions in soil; its
musicians are clearly without history, perpetually in need of seeking
out new places in which to perform modern musics, whose timelessness
confuses its relation to history.

In 1933, the new National Socialist government of Germany conceived of a
cultural ghetto, in which all Jews in the major cities of Germany would
be forced to live: the <I>J&uuml;discher Kulturbund.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
The <I>Kulturbund</I> presented Jews with a new dilemma, for its aim
was to prevent them from interacting with Germans in the cultural life
of urban Germany; Jewish artistic life was to be isolated. That these
new laws arose for racial reasons is obvious, but they also resulted
from a German response to modernism in the arts, with which Jews were
explicitly connected (or for which they were blamed). Jewish students
would be blocked from attending German universities, and Jewish orchestral
musicians would no longer be able to play with non-Jewish colleagues
in symphony or opera orchestras. There was an alternative, however,
namely the possibility of building up an entirely Jewish cultural
life; indeed, this was the only alternative. In the early years
of the <I>Kulturbund,</I> the alternative, even though greeted with
skepticism and bitterness, unleashed a flurry of cultural activity and
organization. Jewish orchestras and Jewish theater flourished; Jewish
publishers (e.g., Schocken in Berlin) expanded their lists; evidence of
a modern Jewish aesthetic in the arts began to take shape.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The landscape of the <I>Kulturbund,</I> soon synonymous with the
cityscape of Jewish Berlin, quickly acquired the contradictions of
modernity. The means of artistic production depended on the city,
literally on the possibilities of negotiating the streets of Berlin in
order to reach a concert or theatrical performance. The alternative
of creating Jewishness in music or in the other arts unsettled the
urbane culture of the German-Jewish community. At one level, it was
an alternative that Jewish intellectuals and artists had rejected, for
example when polemically voiced by the anti-Semitic Richard Wagner. At
another level, there was little consensus what a Jewish music was, what
its fundamental melodic and formal structure were, and where its modern
institutional venues were. The efforts to create a Jewish culture in the
German city were ironically successful, with sold-out concert seasons and
ambitious artistic experiments of all kinds documenting the transformed
Jewish neighborhoods in the German city. By <I>Kristallnacht</I> in
November 1938, the boundaries of these neighborhoods again collapsed,
ultimately during the Holocaust destroying those who failed to escape. The
destruction of

<B></B>

this German-Jewish cultural space was paradoxical,
for in fact a history of Jewish aesthetic modernity had formed and had
subverted the possibility of a German modernity without Jewishness in
music.

In 1992, the <I>Kulturbund</I> again made an appearance in Berlin,
historicized and memorialized by exhibits at the Akademie der K&uuml;nste
in Berlin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 A half-century later, the experiments that
transformed the public spaces of Jewish Berlin had been reduced to the
semipublic spaces of the exhibit, fixed in history because of their overt
foreignness. Even within contemporary German historicism, it is difficult
to know what to do with the artistic activities of the <I>Kulturbund,</I>
for the theaters and concert halls in which they took place--often, but
not exclusively synagogues--no longer exist, nor can they be revivified
by new performances. New histories--modern histories--have accrued in
the streets that once connected the performances of the <I>Kulturbund</I>
orchestra to the synagogues and

<B></B>

libraries of the 1930s. Defined at
that time by those who passed along them, these streets have different
meanings today. It is only through different cultural routes that
musicians in the 1990s can represent the modern Jewish music of the 1930s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
German folk song demonstrates a seemingly obsessive concern with
place. Images of place yield entire genres, notably the <I>Heimatlied,</I>
the "song of the homeland." Folk song differ-entiates regions through
their specific histories and dialects. The song of the alpine meadow is
no less characteristic of the folk-song canon than the urban broadside
ballad, sung from printed leaflets on the street and purchased by
passersby for their own entertainment at home. The musical connection
between language and place is central to that canon, so it is hardly
surprising that folk song does far more than describe the places
and regions of the German cultural landscape. Many songs, in fact,
symbolically bind regions on the cultural map, establishing the conditions
for their maintenance and even for their defense. The well-known "Wacht
am Rhein" ("Watch on the Rhine") and its many variants provide one of
the clearest calls to action, should the enemies of Germany challenge
its western border, which the Rhine forms, at least for a few hundred
miles in southwestern Germany. The Rhine, as a signifier of Germany, is
the subject of countless other folk songs, as well as composed musical
works, ranging from the Heine-Silcher "Die Lorelei" to Wagner's <I>Das
Rheingold.</I> Its musical monumentality derives in no small measure
from the danger that its loss would mean for Germany.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Rhine River, in effect, maps diverse conditions of Germanness. Folk
songs and operas alike fetishize the river's history, representing it
through performance as a means of mem-orializing the past. In "Wacht
am Rhein," it is the confrontation with France over Alsace-Lorraine
that enters popular history. The physical monuments that line its
shores--inscribed in the experiences of thousands of tourists each
year, usually with the mnemonic assistance of loudspeakers blaring "Die
Lorelei" or "Wacht am Rhein"--undergird what the river repre-sents in
the German historical imagination. Again, the performative quality of
music represents, and even monumentalizes, the past in remarkably flexible
ways. The historically controversial "Deutschlandlied," still the national
anthem of Germany, utilizes a melody, itself perhaps a Croatian folk
melody, that was adapted by an Austrian composer (Franz Joseph Haydn) in
the service of the Hungarian court (Esterh&aacute;zy). Its monumentality,
never-theless, is obvious, for countless historical experiences have
become interwoven into the song through its performances in string
quartets, Protestant hymns, Olympic games, concentra-tion camps, and
films about World War II.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Music and monuments often function together in the reproduction of
the past as present in Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Busts of great composers
line concert halls, and musical auditoriums of all kinds occupy a
central position of particular social and political importance. The
late nine-teenth-century obsession with massive form in German romantic
music coincides precisely with the mass production of physical monuments
in Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 This parallel between monuments and music
results from indirect associations, for the two refer to the past in
quite different ways. Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge argue that the
history-making potential of monuments resides on their surfaces, whereas
in fact at a deeper level in the monument history has only an impoverished
representation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Song, in contrast, possesses an internal
capacity to reproduce history through performance, whereas its surface
qualities (e.g., the melody of the "Deutschlandlied," which covers and
allows very different texts) can only incompletely represent history
because the meaning of the surface depends entirely on the experience
of the listener. Music and monuments therefore complement each other.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the modern sites in the New Germany where music and monuments
function most effectively in this respect is the street. On its surface,
the pedestrian zone is itself a monument, often memorializing the past
that was destroyed by bombing in World War II. Other monuments punctuate
the surface of the pedestrian zone, however, memorializing city founders

or reporting the former residence of a cultural or political figure once
occupying a building on this site. The Holocaust monument, too, has
become an omnipresent historical trope in the German city,
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
ironically conflicting with other monuments to the fallen soldiers of
past wars, also ubiquitous in German cities. Street music, in quite
different ways, erects temporary monuments. Passersby pause to listen,
but also to gaze upon a performance fixed against the backdrop of the
street. The street musician provides a fluid monumentality, moving from
day to day to different spots along his or her routes (figs. 4 and 5);
those who fail to move also fail to maximize their potential earnings
and to curry the favors of shop owners who alternatively benefit from
and tire of musicians near the doors of their shops.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Street
music may acquire a radical potential to reconfigure the public sphere,
to alter its meanings as different groups occupy and aim to use it as
a space in which to demonstrate their different social and political
agendas. The modernity of the music itself opens the public sphere to
precisely such reconfiguration.

Excursus 2--<I>Arbeiter</I> and <I>Gastarbeiter:</I> Sites of Resistance
<!--_/b-head-->
</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Song has provided German workers with one of the most powerful
forms of resistance. At once organizing laborers into action
and voicing their discontent with the machines of modernity, the
workers' song (Arbeiterlied) has become a genre unto itself in modern
Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 As such, the workers' song embodies and conveys
German history, particularly the history of resistance against authority,
which since the 1930s has often been so con-structed as paralleling and
undergirding "democratic" and "revolutionary" history. Implicit in these
historical streams, channeled by the working class, is an empowerment
of the worker to take charge of history. Not surprisingly, then, the
major folk-music anthology of the German Democratic Republic, Wolfgang
Steinitz's Deutsche Volkslieder demokratischen Charakters aus sechs
Jahrhunderten, cast the history of the German people as one of struggle
chronicled by song.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

<B></B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The historicizing potential of folk song was by no means a trope found
only in the former East Germany. At the local level, workers' choruses
emerged in the early nineteenth century as the standard bearers for
a sweeping folk-song movement, and by the twentieth century these
local organizations often shaped their repertories to chronicle the
struggle between modernity and the individual at the local level. Labor
movements had the power to organize the local at a global level, and to
this end they employed songbooks as means of fostering an aesthetic and
political lingua franca. The songs of these labor movements migrated from
songbook to songbook and from chorus to chorus, yielding an aesthetic
solidarity. Songs such as the "Moorlied" quickly came to unite the
local and the international. Composed in 1933 by Rudi Goguel and set
to texts by a miner named Esser
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 and Wolfgang Langhoff in
Papenburg, one of the first concentration camps, primarily for members of
the Communist Party, by 1935 the "Moorlied" had become an international
symbol of revolution. As concentration camps multiplied, both in number
and in their capacity to imprison diverse

<B></B>

groups of individuals
posing an imagined threat to the German nation, so too did the "Moorlied"
return to the local level, where it circulated in the oral traditions
of virtually every camp. After the Holocaust, the "Moorlied" became a
specifically national symbol for the struggle against fascism, for the
most part losing, however, its local and international currencies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The political nature of the workers' song serves it well as part of a
musical repertory for the street. Individual songs may be topical--that
is, local and specific to the political moment--but they may also rely
on the public's knowledge of standard repertories.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Analyses
of

<B></B>

the repertories of individual street singers, at least those who
fashion themselves as <I>Liedermacher</I> (singer-songwriters), reveal
these repertories to signify diverse forms of resistance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 On
one hand, the street seems to be an unlikely site for songs from workers'
movements or political protest, which, after all, reflect little of the
spirit that shoppers and tourists invest in their walks. On the other
hand, the street has been the primary site of resistance--aesthetic and
political--throughout much of modern German history.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The struggle of workers against modernity has not disappeared from the New
Germany, if indeed a new worker, the <I>Gastarbeiter,</I> is carrying it
forth. The nature of that struggle has changed, or rather the foreignness
that symbolizes it has changed. The music of neither singer-songwriter
nor street musician has abandoned this struggle. Wolf Biermann, the
most famous German contemporary singer-songwriter, utilizes Turkish
musicians and musical styles in some songs, while elsewhere adapting
Yiddish songs to his personal style.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The expectations
of listeners accustomed to his aesthetic of resistance, therefore,
conflate <I>Arbeiter</I> and <I>Gastarbeiter</I> in Biermann's songs,
as well as in the rock music accompanying the public demonstrations
protesting the violence against Turkish guest workers and their
families. Resistance--historical and modern--enters the songs of the
street, making them sites for the contestation that inevitably takes
place on the street.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No single leitmotif pervades German folk song as extensively and as
malleably as <I>Heimat,</I> in the strictest sense, "home," but in the
folk imagination and usage, "homeland." <I>Heimatlieder,</I> "songs of
the homeland," evoke conflicting senses of the homeland to which one is
bound and the homeland for which one longs. Regional and nationalistic
songs remain at base <I>Heimatlieder,</I> and they usually fill volumes
designated as such. German emigrant folk-song repertories generally
privilege <I>Heimatlieder,</I> which refer not to a New World, but to the
Old World, the homeland left behind. For German-speaking communities of
Eastern Europe, forced to return to Germany after the defeat in World War
II, <I>Heimatlieder</I> historicize the homeland left behind--villages
in Romania, Poland, or Russia--not the homeland, Germany, to which they
are bound by German bloodline.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 The song of the homeland
represents a place perennially German, at once recuperating that place
and rendering it an historical presentness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is not by coincidence that <I>Heimatlieder</I> are folk songs, for
the pair <I>Volk</I> and <I>Heimat</I> provides one of the most cloying
tropes in popular German historiography.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The folk are
inseparable from their homeland; one defines the other. Other conceptual
pairs often take up and then modify the trope of folk and homeland,
perhaps the best-known of which is <I>Blut und Boden,</I> "blood and
land," one of the slogans justifying German expansion during World War
II. These conceptual pairs inevitably anchor race to place; that is,
they equate Germany with the land occupied by Germans. The Banat region
of Romania or Silesia in Poland becomes German because Germans lived
there, transforming place through their presence. <I>Heimatlieder</I> make
history portable, reinventing the connection between race and place with
each performance, regardless of its venue. Songs of the homeland are,
moreover, geographically specific, for they catalogue local events and
places, the local landscape and local customs. This historical mapping
is deeply encoded in the song itself; a melody, for example, may index
the homeland, even if texts sometime change.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Songs of the homeland are by no means limited to dialect regions,
emigrant Germans, or resettled Eastern European Germans. "Du getto
main," a Yiddish folk song from the Vilna ghetto, possesses all the
traits necessary for a <I>Heimatlied,</I> not only because of its direct
use of typical themes and vocabulary, but also because it localizes the
history and events of a specific <I>Heimat.</I> That it parodies the
story of ghetto residents who must steal food is possible only because
German- and Yiddish-speaking Jews during the early twentieth century had
transformed the ghetto into a central symbol for the place occupied by
Jewish communities confronting modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 The ghetto song
was at first not a folk song, for it did not derive from oral tradition
in the <I>shtetl,</I> but rather from the migration to the city, where
Jews became laborers in a rapidly industrializing society. The ghetto was
a modern space, defined by the streets of the city and the life on those
streets.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The ghetto song was therefore about accommodating
the dilemma of foreignness fostered by modern society. The homeland of
the ghetto song represented this dilemma, situating race again in the
repertories of German folk and popular music and in German modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The German city has less willingly yielded itself to the formation
of other homelands since World War II. Resettlement problems have
taken precedence over the remapping of urban spaces to accommodate a
multicultural society. Historical memory seems, instead, to be afflicted

<B></B>

by amnesia, forgetting about Jewish quarters in the German cities,
such as the Scheunenviertel in Berlin, or about the various ghetto-like
juxtapositions of race and place during the Third Reich, whether these
were putatively cultural, as in the <I>J&uuml;discher Kulturbund,</I>
or political, as in the concentration camp. The Kreuzberg district in
Berlin, nevertheless, contains one of the largest Turkish communities in
the world, and refugees seeking asylum occupy barracks abandoned since
1989 by the American, French, English, Canadian, and Soviet occupation
forces. The new <I>Randv&ouml;lker,</I> "marginal people," inhabit new
margins, namely those of the city, reconfiguring also the urban modernity
built previously by the <I>Geschichtsv&ouml;lker,</I> by those "people
with history." The irony persists that <I>Volk</I> and <I>Heimat</I>
remain coupled, but that songs now contest the homeland available or
not available for foreigners in the New Germany.

Excursus 3--The Circus as Musical <I>Heimat</I> for Foreignness
<!--_/b-head-->
</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Elaborate circus posters bedeck the walls, bus stops, and billboards
of all German cities throughout the summer. Circuses take place
during other parts of the year, but it is in the summer that they
are most mobile and can move quickly from city to city, from village
festival to urban extravaganza. Whether or not the circus possesses
specifically German qualities is moot, though many would claim this to
be the case;
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 circuses consciously represent themselves
as international, even as stages on which the world's diversity is
put on display. The German circus--or the circus in Germany--does, in
fact, put rather particular German passions on display. Not least among
these is the modern version of the "Wild West Show," much beloved at
the end of the nineteenth century, when Wild Bill Cody brought his to
Germany, staging it even before the gaze of Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Wild
West, particu-larly with its "cowboys and Indians," became a greater
fascination in the German popular imagination through the stories of
Karl May, whose novels--in department-store editions or multitudinous
movies--are well known to all German readers. The modern German circus
has transformed the literary theme of the Wild West to a grand form of
spectatorship and located it in the center ring.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The German circus poster on the street announces that a circus is in
town, using the head of an Indian chief stylized according to the popular
imagination. The same poster announces that other forms of foreignness
will be placed on display, contributing to a seductive international
flavor. Visiting the German circus, one is not disappointed: the sights
and sounds of the world and of multiculturalism, in its most fantastic
guise, are redolent in the atmosphere of the big top.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Under the big top itself, the Wild West Show unfolds in narrative fashion,
as a story that Karl May himself might have written. A cowboy emerges
from the side entrance as the protagonist, usually quickly establishing
a liaison with a woman, whose lack of equivalent equestrian skill marks
her as a pioneer settler. The scene is disrupted by invading Indians,
heavily clad in deerskin or some ersatz thereof, and playing on musical
instruments to intensify the pace of the narrative. Drums virtually
take over the story, as a flurry of abductions, fights, and eventual
rescues bring the story to its predictable conclusion. It is at the
intermission that one learns that the musicians of the Wild West were
not Native Americans, but North Africans. Wandering through the animal
displays and sideshows, one comes to several groups of Moroccans--circus
<I>Gastarbeiter--</I>who sell leather goods (not 
<B></B> 
deerskin, however)
and small drums and end-blown flutes. Circus Indian music is, in fact, a
specialty of North Africans who spend the summer in Europe to earn enough
money to support themselves for much of the rest of the year in Morocco,
where frequently they are also professional musicians.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
The instruments sold outside the big top are Moroccan, many of them
smaller versions of the same instruments accompanying the previous
story of racial encounter in the Wild West. Buying a small hand drum
allows one not only to purchase a musical artifact from Morocco, but
also from the Wild West and the worlds of Wild Bill Cody and Karl
May. These instruments reconfigure time in the narrative of the circus
by performing new histories of distant and modern foreigners (cover
illustration, <I>Musikautomat</I>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Circuses have often afforded Germans a vehicle for recalibrating
history through spec-tacle empowered by music. In the <I>J&uuml;discher
Kulturbund</I> of the 1930s, the Jewish children of the Berlin cultural
ghetto transformed themselves into the "Zirkus-Knorke," singing of
this experience with the "Zirkus-Knorke-Lied" . This circus
was not only a form of escape and entertainment, but also a site of
resistance, for the children of the Jewish com-munity took charge of
their own foreignness, satirizing and parodying it (in Berliner dialect,
a <I>Knorke</I> is something like a buffoon), and placing it on a stage
that they commanded.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Similarly, the workers who created and performed the "Moorlied" used
the ironic moment of a self-made circus to resist the authorities in
the concentration camp Papenburg, acting out the narrative of resistance
in the "Zirkus Konzentrazani." The musical performance, on its surface
representing the circus of self-presentation, allowed the internees
to stage an act of resistance under the very gaze of those whom they
were resisting.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The modern German circus is a complex site of foreignness, in which the
racism of the past is confused with the racism of the present. The Native
American, representing the fantasy of the Wild West as <I>das Land der
unbegrenzten M&ouml;glichkeiten,</I> the "land of possibilities without
borders," becomes one with the North African, who crosses the borders of
modern Germany representing the musically exotic beyond those borders. The
circus, then, is a venue in which races mix but do so unnoticed, or
at least in ways that the spectators expect and desire. Each summer,
this "multicultural" moment plays itself out again and again throughout
Germany, erasing the boundaries of history and redrawing them according
to the exotic drumbeat of foreignness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
German song embodies many different kinds of boundaries: geographical,
historical, and linguistic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 German song contains texts
in the German language, in fact, in <I>the</I> German language, High
German, whose own history parallels that of the centuries-long political
consolidation that preceded the first German unification under Bismarck in
1871. The poetic High German is not just a marker of classical art song,
say the <I>Lieder</I> of Schubert and Schumann, using texts by Goethe or
Schiller, but rather distinguishes the most important narrative genres
of folk song. German ballads, therefore, are in High German, even (i.e.,
especially) when transmitted orally in preliterate societies, thereby
reinforcing the connection to an inscribed German history. High German
folk-ballad texts cut across other boundaries, both dialect areas inside
Germany and ethnic regions outside. This is the case, for example, in
Alsace-Lorraine, where the language of ballads is distinct both from
the regional dialect/language, Alsatian, and from French, in effect
historically empowering the

<B></B>

German ballad to obviate the Rhine
boundary between France and Germany. In other boundary regions, such
as German-speaking S&uuml;dtirol in northern Italy and traditionally
multicultural Burgenland in eastern Austria, German song more clearly
establishes the conditions between German and non-German cultures, between
the <I>einheimisch</I> (at home) culture and the foreign. Even modern
songbooks from these areas contain few if any folk songs in languages
other than German, though these regions and most of their residents are
usually multilingual.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The manipulation of boundaries within the German song results from a
dialectical rela-tion between song and history. German song is a product
of the Enlightenment, particularly Johann Gottfried Herder's coining
of the term <I>Volkslied,</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 and the classicization of
a German literary language in the late eighteenth century, which in
turn became the source for romantic song composition in the nineteenth
century. In the spirit of the age, German song was constructed from
racial categories, which in turn proscribed which people could sing which
songs. In establishing his criteria for Germanness in the arts, Herder
also privileged the foreign, illiterate, wild peoples who, "distanced
from science," had no need to "commit their songs to paper."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
It was with literate traditions that history began, and, rather than
the exoticized timelessness of oral tradition, song began to occupy
specific boundaries and genres, which in turn acquired musical forms,
such as the strophic art song, that reproduced themselves.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
The musical aspects of German song, too, developed within a specific
history of tonality, that is, the harmonic implications dependent on
relations determined by intervals of the third. At one level, German
folk song demonstrated a basic melodic gestalt of melodies anchored to
the harmonic movement of tonality; at another, German art song came to
realize an avant-garde, a musical venue for historical experiments with
tonality, as in the songs of Hugo Wolf.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By the end of the nineteenth century, the German song was canonized,
fixed by the boundaries of a music history specific to that century. By
the turn of the century, however, challenges to these boundaries arose,
challenges launched by those going beyond and breaking with tonality,
and embracing what they themselves called modernity. In the realm of art
song, these challenges came from Gustav Mahler, and soon thereafter from
Arnold Schoenberg. Neither Mahler nor Schoenberg, of course, was German;
both were Jews whose families had been resident in the Slavic areas of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Their careers involved endless crossing
of boundaries, and their musical languages, particularly Schoenberg's,
eventually undermined the harmonic hegemony of German song, with the
institution of the twelve-tone system, in which all intervals were
potentially equal.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The history of Germanness in music, as an unbroken passage from oral to
literate, from simple to complex, foundered with the collapsing of these
musical boundaries. Replacing this history was not another teleological
history, but rather the experiments of modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
Paradoxically, but not surprisingly, Germanness did not disappear
because of these experi-ments. Its obstinate historical presence served
at times as the object of experimentation, as in the orchestral songs of
Gustav Mahler, <I>Des Knaben Wunderhorn,</I> which utilized the canonic
collection of German folk poetry of the same name.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Popular
songs, on the other hand, often achieved widespread currency because they
reproduced the idiom and familiarity of folk song. A modern German song
emerged that was not so much the product of tonality or nineteenth-century
history, but instead involved a process of interrogating the canonic

<B></B>

German song. Its historical dynamic, nevertheless, continued to
rely on its capacity to index the past, even to recuperate the past and
formulate the present from it. Bound to history, the modern German song
reproduced that history with each attempt to express modernity.

Excursus 4--Cabaret and the Interrogation of Germanness
<!--_/b-head-->
</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like other sites of musical practice that one encounters in the New
Germany, cabaret enjoys a revival. Television devotes programs to
cabaret, with Sunday night programming in the early 1990s touring new
and innovative cabarets.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 Cabaret performances are very
much a part of modern nightlife, which has meant a further revival of
musical practices that once throve in past cabarets, altering contexts
while reviving period-specific musical styles. The Viennese popular
stage provides one example of this historicism when the musician Roland
Neuwirth performs "neue Schrammelmusik," adapting the elements of the
musical language of the Schrammel-Quartett, the most important popular
ensemble in late nineteenth-century Vienna, but embedding in them a
biting, contemporary satire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Like the circus and the venues
of aesthetic resistance that have appeared on the excursions in this
essay, cabaret depends on satire and parody, which in turn depend on
modern practices of spectatorship and narrative in popular culture. At
their deepest level, all these practices result when for-eignness and
difference are displayed on the stage in ways that would be impossible
elsewhere.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Cabaret uses satire to define a moment of deracination and to serve
as a counterforce to the Germanness that enveloped musical practices
during the nineteenth century. The history of cabaret begins, of course,
during a period coeval with the decay of obsessive nineteenth-century
nationalism. It is hardly surprising that cabaret first began outside
the sphere of German cultural hegemony, in Paris, Barcelona, and
Scandinavia, before crossing the boundaries and blossoming in the
hands of turn-of-the-century modernists such as Frank Wedekind in
Munich.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Little is to be gained by arguing that there were
specifically German traditions of cabaret; each performance and each
caf&eacute; in which cabaret took place conflated the international
and the local. Each performer used satire to critique time and place
in highly individualized ways. The essential satire of cabaret could
function in no other way.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Similarly, foreignness finds its way to the stages of cabaret in
very different ways. Traditions of Jewish cabaret at the turn of the
century, for example, depended both on the increased population of Jews
in the urban centers of Central Europe and on the growing opportunities
for Jewish musicians and entertainers to perform in other kinds of
cabarets or in popular theater. Because of the first of these reasons,
Jewish cabaret focused its satire largely on Jews from outside Germany,
particularly on Eastern European Jews inhabiting neighborhoods such as
Berlin's Scheunenviertel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Because of the second reason,
Jewish composers turned to the cabaret to find ways of interrogating
the German musical canon. Schoenberg not only performed in cabarets,
but composed cabaret songs. Significantly, these songs are not in the
twelve-tone vocabulary that broke with the history of tonality, but
rather heighten and stylize a popular musical vocabulary.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The satire of cabaret is possible only when criticism is levelled equally
at Germanness and foreignness, hence heightening their interrelation. Some
Jewish cabaret songs had texts, therefore, that were anti-Semitic. That
different spectators responded in contrasting ways to these songs was
inevitable, which may in part explain the survival of cabaret into
the Third Reich. The cabarets of the <I>J&uuml;discher Kulturbund</I>
attracted enormous attention, generating

<B></B>

also new forms of satire
and social critique.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Of all the sites of musical practice
and aesthetic resistance allowed in concentration camps, none survived
longer than the cabaret.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 As satire increases on the stage
of the cabaret, it deflects the gaze of the spectator, as if in a hall
of mirrors; criticism reflects endlessly upon itself, blinding all
to the object of racism because all subjects equally have moments of
becoming that object. Because of this satire, the boundaries between
difference and racism are alternately drawn and erased, becoming
confused and confusing. In modern Germany, these boundaries have
increasingly characterized the satire of popular and political song,
and for this reason characteristics of the cabaret have spilled over
to the street, song being the vehicle that crosses the boundaries of
genre and venue. On the street, satire often provides a context for
songs drawn from foreignness, as well as those foreigners who perform
them. In this process, the relentlessly reflecting and reflexive social
criticism that characterized turn-of-the-century cabaret and characterizes
cabaret as Germany

<B></B>

approaches the turn of the next century further
contributes to the contradictions of modernity performed again and again
on the street.

History confronts the New Germany with an enormous burden of political
dilemmas and contradictions. Both liberal and conservative, Left and
Right, must deal with complex pasts that problematize the decisions of
the present. Essays attempting to sort out these ways of dealing with the
past have already come to constitute a kind of metahistory, distancing
the processes of decision-making from the reality of contemporary
contradictions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 Foreignness assumes so many forms in
German modernity that it is seemingly impossible to show soli-darity
with one instance without demonstrating unsettling positions toward the
other. This dilemma particularly characterized the German Left's attempts
to support the Palestinians while at the same time claiming not to be
anti-Semitic. Stated differently, only in Germany can one not separate
Israel from the Jews, if, as modern German history insists, the final
formation of the state of Israel was also an inevitable consequence of
the Holocaust.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Race and racism fail to disappear from the
present because they are so embedded in the past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The modern slogan for the changing cultural landscape of the New
Germany is <I>Multikulturalismus.</I> This thoroughly non-German
coinage, adapted of course from English, supplants German formulations
such as <I>Minderheiten</I> (minorities) or <I>Vielv&ouml;lker</I>
(many peoples), both of which place the new foreigners in a subordinate
position, or would officially remind Germans of that position. The attacks
of skinheads and other groups from the German Right on Turkish homes and
foreigners in general illustrate the fact that the egalitarianism signaled
by terms such as "multiculturalism" simply does not exist; foreigners
remain essen-tially powerless against <I>Volk</I> and <I>Heimat.</I> Yet
multiculturalism is fetishized, sprawled across the surface of billboards
advertising Benetton sweaters or showing blacks

<B></B>

and whites in amorous
embrace because both smoke Peter Stuyvesant cigarettes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The musics of the new multiculturalism also pervade the modern cultural
landscape of Germany. Turkish music in Germany possesses its own long
history and an historiographic tradition dating from the nineteenth
century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 As the settings and functions for Turkish music
in Germany changed, so too did the instruments and the constitution
of ensembles. Rural folk musics entered the (German) city, and the
growing presence of female musicians regendered the predominantly
male musical traditions of Turkey. In the past several decades
Turkish-German musicians have successfully utilized the mass media,
creating published anthologies and releasing recordings, such as the
one from which "&Ccedil;ok Uzaklardan Geliyoruz" above was taken, for
Turkish consumers in Germany. Turkish television stations in Germany
broadcast enormous amounts of popular music, some of it from Turkish
television, some of it recorded in Germany, but all of it packaged for
consumption in Germany. The Turkish-German music culture, however, is not
integrated into modern Germany. It is there to experience, if one wishes
to enter the clubs of Berlin's Kreuzberg or to pause when searching for
interesting television programming. Popular German singers too, as we
have already seen in the case of Wolf Biermann, borrow Turkishness for
their repertories. Turkish music itself, however, is performed along the
boundaries of modern society, waiting for the moment to be integrated into
a truly multicultural Germany just as persistently as Turkish workers are
waiting for the moment when they will be granted citizenship.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is in the margins and along the boundaries of society, moreover, that
the musics of foreigners have always thrived. It is only since World War
II that these boundaries have gradually collapsed. Symbolizing the musical
foreignness located in the boundaries through-out Germany's modern history
have been Europe's most ubiquitous and professionalized musicians, Romas
and Sintis, to whom I shall refer as Gypsies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 Gypsy musicians
have been distinguished by the ability to perform the musics of groups
with whom they come in contact, which is to say, those who engage them
as professional musicians. Throughout the nineteenth century and during
much of the twentieth century, accounts of Gypsy music observed the ways
in which it is really Hungarian
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 or accompanied the festivals
and customs of other groups. The history of Gypsy music exemplifies an
extreme musical contestation of race: a music with no identity of its
own, but that achieves identity only through its capacity to express the
non-Gypsy. This capacity is the result of mobility and adaptability,
which in turn mark the presence of Gypsies throughout the streets of
Europe. Depictions of Gypsy musicians, therefore, usually place them in
public places: in the marketplace of the village, in the bands of outdoor
restaurants, in the ensembles that play for weddings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 In
modern Germany, Gypsy musicians have adapted the domain of the street
to their musical <I>Heimat</I>, paradoxically not residing in or near
this domain, but rather again on the outskirts of the city or at the
edge of villages. In this function, they exhibit an extraordinary
modernity, for, despised by the public, they nevertheless become the
ultimate mirror of multiculturalism. Their history has been one of
assimilation and adaptation at the deepest cultural level of music
making. In essence, they symbolize the fallacy of insisting that Germany
cannot be a multicultural nation.

--"Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" ("The Beautiful Jewish Woman")
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
<!--_/attribution-->
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The story of "Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" describes the love relationship
between a young Jewish woman and a gentile, a relationship made impossible
because the woman may not go out onto the street, even to meet her
lover. The story begins with entreaties from the woman to her mother
to allow her to "go for a little walk" (verse 2). The mother repeatedly
refuses, rejoining that "you may not go alone" (verse 3). After repeated
attempts to find an appro-priate family and Jewish companion to accompany
the young woman's entry into the gentile world (the version here raises
the possibility of the little brother and sister), the young woman waits
until her mother is asleep and violates the rules of the community and
family by going alone, in some versions jumping from her window onto
the street below. "Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" ends either with the
conversion of the woman as necessary preparation for marriage or with
suicide by drowning (the case in this version), whereby the woman does
not cross the boundary into a gentile world, nor does she reverse her
exit from the Jewish community. The theme of homeland, in the end, proves
irreconcilable. The ballad ends as a <I>Heimatlied</I> with no homeland:
"'Leb wohl du liebe Heimat, wir sehn uns nimmermehr!'" ("'Be well, my
dear homeland, never again will we meet!'").

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a German ballad, "Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" has one of the most
distinctive histories of crossing the cultural boundaries of modern
Europe. The ballad was sung in both High German and in Yiddish,
with versions collected not only in Germany and German-speaking areas
elsewhere, but also in Jewish communities of Eastern Europe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
"Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" is therefore both a German and a Yiddish
ballad; its history, in fact, is at once German and Jewish. It has,
nevertheless, a troubled history, which symbolizes the difficulties of
recon-ciling its two ethnic domains, which in turn mark racial domains
within the song itself. This history has defied the boundaries between
German Central Europe and Jewish Eastern Europe, entering the song
canons of both. Variants in oral tradition respond to the Jewishness
of the narrative and its symbols in divergent ways, ranging from
anti-Semitic variants to those that carefully record the norms of Jewish
law.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
 In none of the German or Jewish versions of the songs
do the boundaries between communities yield to the lovers; entry into
the German or gentile world--being seen on the street by non-Jews--makes
the decision to leave the Jewish community irreversible. Ultimately,
the street outside the Jewish woman's window, found in most variants,
becomes a world open to Jews only when they are no longer Jews.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like the other songs experienced on the excursions in this essay,
"Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" embodies disturbing contradictions of
modernity. It is, after all, a song explicitly about the moment of
passing from the traditional to the modern, but that moment offers no
possibility of compromise. Past and present confront each other as if
the former may yield to the latter when the Jewish woman sets foot on
the street. In the song, however, it is not possible simply to pass
from the past to the present. Embracing the present means denying the
past--either conversion or suicide.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" refers to indistinct pasts and presents,
and its sense of modernity depends not on specific indices of real
individuals. For the most part, the music one encounters on the streets
of modern Germany relies on such indistinct references to time and
place.

<B></B>

Even the surface specificity of "Die Wacht an der Isar"
refers back to "Wacht am Rhein," which in turn acts as a simulacrum for
historical German concerns with the ways in which boundaries circumscribe
contested homelands.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is not to say, however, that the songs of the street or of the other
moments that this essay has recounted lack history. Quite the contrary,
they are profoundly historical, precisely because they are inseparable
from the moments of their performance. The historical conditions on which
the specific performances are premised are the result of contradictions:
cabaret and its biting satire; the uncertainty about the constitution
of Germanness and its relation to homeland; the self-made circuses in
the <I>J&uuml;discher Kulturbund</I> and concentration camps; the songs of
Turkish <I>Gastarbeiter</I> and Gypsy musicians without homes. Together,
these contradictions form the long history of a nation that insists it,
unlike the United States, has no history of assimilating foreigners.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the streets of the New Germany, music exists only through
performance. Passersby experience musical performance largely as
fragments. Most passersby merely slow their pace in order to hear a few
words in a song; others listen intently to the performance of an entire
song; there are even a few hangers-on who listen to entire repertories
and return repeatedly to the same street musicians. In fact, street
musicians earn quite well in the New Germany, as they did in the past. It
is perhaps a sign of the persistent financial well-being of Germany that
it can afford to support the performance of its historical narratives
on its streets.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Through performance, music creates the illusion of timelessness, one
of the tropes of a modern German historical imagination. Timelessness
allows one to collapse long periods into symbols, virtually footnotes in
a larger history. Hence, the Third Reich, the Holocaust, world wars,
and the socialist GDR become local aberrations, not "our history"
but "theirs." This timelessness distresses when the contradictions
of modernity begin to trouble again, as the unwillingness to accept
foreignness has increasingly troubled the racial consciousness of the
New Germany. Again, the past has invaded the present, and modernity
repeats itself. The street music of the New Germany insists on a public
awareness of this repetition, for once passersby turn away, they are
again confronted with another performance, another repetition. The
contradictions of modernity reside in and turn on these repeated musical
performances, with musical representations of history continuously
undermining the possibility that the present might erase the memory of
the past.

I use the concept "New Germany" throughout this essay
to refer to reunited Germany, which has taken shape in various stages
after the so-called <I>Wende</I> ("turn" or "change"), which resulted
from the dismantling of the wall between the German Democratic Republic
and the German Federal Republic in 1989, and the subsequent dismantling
of the government of the GDR. Initially, the concept of a New Germany
represented the culmination of historical forces in the popular German
imagination, the return to Germany's position in Europe as it always had
been. The banality of this position, "as it always had been," however,
quickly gave way to the awareness that the New Europe, also a product of
the <I>Wende,</I> as well as the New Germany, would not be able to shake
themselves of the unsettling and implosive forces of modern history. All

The success of many street musicians lies in their ability
to earn money, and it would encumber this success were they to intrude
in the daily routine of the shopper or businessperson. Andean pan-pipe
ensembles, to take one example, create a loop of three or four pieces,
evoking the same familiarity that background music has in an airport or
American shopping mall, a music that is passively heard, not actively
listened to. The potential exoticism of such ensembles, therefore,
becomes part of the entertainment expected by pedestrians.

Pedestrian zones dominate city centers for specific
historical reasons. During World War II the British, following the policy
of Winston Churchill, in large part as revenge for the German bombing
of Coventry and London, heavily bombed all cities with populations
greater than one hundred thousand. Not only did these attacks remove the
architectural reminders of the past--the centers of cities such as Dresden
and W&uuml;rzburg, both levelled through fire storms--but they made it
necessary quickly to rebuild city centers after the war. The pedestrian
zone, in a sense, made this possible, for it directed Germans again toward
the city center. It is for this reason, however, that the pedestrian
zone symbolizes both the past that was destroyed and the need to rebuild.

The musicians making these recordings frequently display
the fact that they do not come from the tradition, as in the case of the

Briefly glossed, <I>klezmer</I> is an instrumental
music, performed by variously constituted small ensembles (e.g.,
two violins, viola, and small bass violin, with a tsimbl, or large
hammer dulcimer). <I>Klezmer</I> groups played at holidays and rites
of passage in the Jewish community, as well as dances and other social
occasions. Ensembles also performed in non-Jewish settings and with
non-Jewish musicians, making it impossible to isolate it as a strictly
Jewish practice, which, however, generally characterizes the sundry
arguments used to justify <I>klezmer</I> revivals, in North America,
Europe, and Israel. See Walter Salmen, <I>,,...denn die Fiedel macht

Substituting Munich's major river, the Isar, for Germany's
most symbolic river, the Rhine, this text attacks the enemies of Munich's
conservatism. The weapon for these attacks is the reactionary literary
journal <I>Grobian</I> (1904-1912), which, however, served as a voice
for countercurrents in Munich's turn-of-the-century modernity. There
is no point in translating this song text literally here, even, as
given here, the two verses that begin and the two that end the song;
it merely contains a laundry list of the enemies who would traverse the
Isar to invade the Bavarian cultural heartland. That the final two verses
conclude this list with Germany's greatest enemies, the Jews, clearly
illustrates the contradiction they represented in German modernism.

German communities in Eastern Europe constituted so-called
<I>Sprachinseln,</I> "speech islands," and formed as Germans settled
during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, usually to bolster the
insufficient labor force in a particular area or to bring special skills
to the existing labor force. "Germans" from these areas were and are
still able to return to Germany with full citizenship, simply by virtue of
their familial connection to some previous polity historically related to
modern Germany. Other prerequisites for return, for example, knowledge
of the German language, are not necessary. The homeland, it follows,
is biologically maintained, even when the individual is politically and
geographically removed from Germany itself.

Romas and Sintis are only two of the numerous groups

German groups. My shift to "Gypsy" reflects not only a reproduction

1. Ritual Murder

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On 28 October 1916 Kafka wrote to Felice Bauer:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The other day I've read "Ritual Murder in Hungary" by Zweig; its
supernatural scenes are as feeble as I would have expected from what
I know of Zweig's work. The terrestrial scenes on the other hand
are intensely alive, taken no doubt from the excellent records of the
case. Nevertheless, one cannot quite distinguish between the two worlds;
he has identified himself with the case and is now under  its spell. I
no longer see him the way I used to. At one point I had to stop reading,
sit down on the sofa and weep aloud. It's years since I wept.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What is striking are Kafka's tears. What about this drama evoked the
tears which he had not shed for years? It was not the "reality" of the
blood libel trial, for there were a number of such trials about which
Kafka knew and which did not move him to tears.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 It is the
literary restructuring of the realities inherent in the trial that made
Kafka weep--its form now not a reflex of the world but a construction
of the author. Kafka's comments and his tears flow from his reading of
Arnold Zweig's play, at the center of which stands the representation
of the contemporary complexities of male Jewish identity at the turn of
the century.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the turn of the century the categories of race, illness, and gender
were organizing principles of the construction of the fictions of the
world. Race, illness, and gender are not ahistorical principles of
psychic organization, but rather the historical articulation of deeper
psychic categories. It was impossible to think about race at the fin de
si&egrave;cle without evoking gender and illness/health, impos-sible to
speak of gender without the other two categories being

<B></B>

present, and
just as impossible to evoke the ill or healthy body without discourses
of race and gender being present. As Kafka states in a letter to his
friend, the Jewish, tubercular physician Robert Klopstock in April
1922, "A Jew, and a German besides, and sick besides, and in difficult
personal circumstances besides--those are the chemical forces with which
I propose to straight-away transmute gold into gravel or your letter
into mine, and while doing so remain in the right."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 From
all of these categories of difference--race, gender, and illness--both
those consciously present and those implied, Kafka makes his world
of words. Whether that world is gold transmuted into gravel, as Kafka
ironically comments, is an aesthetic judgment; it certainly is a world
that has gripped our fantasies for at least the past fifty years.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Zweig's play is about the myth of blood libel. This charge, lodged
again against Jews at the turn of the century, linked notions of
race, gender, and illness. All of these questions were implicit in the
play by Zweig that fascinated Kafka, and, as we shall see, were also
important in contemporary debates about orthodox Jewish ritual practices,
particularly those that treated the question of <I>shechita,</I> or
ritual slaughter. Fantasies about Jews engaging in ritual murder are
linked to the meanings associated with the reality of ritual slaughter
at the turn of the century. Interlocking discourses of murder and ritual
slaughter are present in the world of literary representation as well
as in the rhetoric of the blood libel accusations of the time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The late nineteenth century saw the resurgence of the accusation of
medieval blood libel lodged against Jews. The charge, until that point,
had been uniform: Jews killed Christian children for the vital ingredient
of blood, the story went, in the production of the unleavened bread
used by Jews during Passover. This blood, it was argued, served as a
cure for the Jews' diseases, especially those associated with their
own bleeding, such as the menstruation of the males, or by extension
phthisis, pulmonary tuberculosis. (Here Kafka's understanding of his own
tuberculosis, which appeared in 1917, incorporated existing images of the
relationship between Jews and tuberculosis.) Thus the traditional image
of the Jew within the blood libel trials tied ideas of race together with
images of illness. By the close of the nineteenth century, the accusation
is quite different--it is not Jews killing Christian boys and girls,
but male Jews killing post-pubescent young Aryan women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The
Jews in this parodic imitation of the mass actually eat the blood baked
in their flat, unleavened bread.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the Hungarian ritual murder case at Tisza-Eszlar that formed the
basis of Zweig's play, a new and equally compelling anxiety about being
a <I>male</I> Jew is represented, one which is inherent in the debates
on Jewish identity and the political possibility of conversion at the
turn of the century: the gendering of the Jewish murderer is part of the
shift of the image of the Jew in the blood libel trial from the Jewish
collective to the Jewish male, and the image of the victim from the child
to the woman.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 In this context a new question is evoked--the
Jewish male as potential Judas, as the betrayer of his own people. The
drama raises the basic questions: Under what circumstances would I
capitulate, would I turn on my fellow Jews and become one of "them," one
of the accusers? Could I thus "convert" and come to believe everything
"they" say about the Jews as truth? Am I really totally without morals,
can I become anything that serves my own purpose? Is there really the
"Wandering Jew" within me who will appear when I am confronted by the
accusations of the <I>goyim</I> or am I a steadfast Jew?
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To examine the contemporary implications of this problem we can turn to
the play that made Kafka weep, Zweig's 1914 "Ritual Murder in Hungary,"
and see how Zweig plays out the Tisza-Eszlar ritual murder case on the
stage. Kafka discounts immediately the

<B></B>

"supernatural scenes," which
frame the drama in a pseudo-Faustian tone. (Zweig evidently felt the
same, as his reworking in 1920 suggests.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
) In its non-symbolic
scenes, Zweig's drama kept very close to the realities of the case as
reported in the newspapers of the time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 As Kafka knew, he
quotes from actual transcripts from the trial, which were reported in the
major newspapers and journals of the day. Zweig's dramatization, however,
provided a metacommentary on the case and on the inherent anxiety about
trials that haunted Jewish awareness at the turn of the century.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To understand the literary quality of this theme, we can turn to a
thick description of Zweig's drama for its representation of race,
illness, and gender. The opening Faust-like frame set in heaven leads
to an earthly <I>Lustmord,</I> the rape and murder of the (in this
version) almost eighteen-year-old Esther Solymosi outside of her little
Hungarian village. In the drama, she is some four years older than the
actual victim. Zweig wanted to stress the repressed sexual aspect of
the accusation of blood libel against the Jews and thus based his own
reconstruction of the actual murder on the attractions of a sexually
mature woman. For in the play, the murder is committed by the local
landlord, Baron G&eacute;za von Onody. Onody's rape of Solymosi ends in
her death from suffocation; he quickly disposes of her body in the river.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Solymosi's disappearance is registered by her mother, who is persuaded
by a gypsy fortune-teller that the Jews are at fault because they need
Christian blood for their matzos (<I>DSS,</I> 25). At this moment the
town people become infected with the notion that this event has happened
and indeed that they had seen it transpire. Mass hysteria leads to the
accusation of ritual murder. Once the accusation of ritual murder is
made, the mob attacks the <I>male</I> Jews leaving the synagogue. The
real murderer, Onody, appears on the scene and suborns the magistrate to
prosecute the case, stressing, however, that it is only the twenty-seven
Jewish <I>men</I> of the town who are guilty, not the women.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The magistrate points out to him the lack of good witnesses, given the
low standing of the peasants bringing the accusation. They decide that
the best witness would be a Jew, perhaps a woman or a boy who could have
seen the crime through the keyhole (<I>DSS,</I> 33). Thereupon the judge
and two policemen go to the home of Josef Scharf, the <I>schammes,</I>
the caretaker of the synagogue. Unexpectedly and seemingly at random,
they arrest his son, the thirteen-year-old Moritz Scharf, the pivotal
figure of the drama, who because of his age is just old enough to be
sworn to give testimony (<I>DSS,</I> 35).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moritz is taken off in chains to the prison in the regional capital, where
he is interrogated by the magistrate. This interrogation of the naive and
helpless boy extends over three pages in the printed text, in which the
child tells the magistrate what really happened: how his father returned
from the synagogue, and prepared the Sabbath at home. He narrates this in
an ironic tone, quite aware that the "ignorant" <I>goyim</I> don't really
understand the intricacies of the ritual, even though the secretary (for
an <I>"am horaz,"</I> an ignoramus) seems to grasp some of this. This is
precisely not what the magistrate wishes to hear and he orders the child
taken out and beaten by one of the policeman until he stops lying. He
is brought back into the room and is both frightened and in tears from
pain. He still states that what he has told is the truth, and that he
knows nothing about the murder; the magistrate orders him locked in a
cell without food or drink for three days. Every time he begins to fall
asleep he is to be wakened by blows. By the third act, we find ourselves
in Moritz's prison cell, his face "pale and sunken," disfigured by
whiplashes. He begs the guard not to beat him anymore, to give

<B></B>

him
food and water. The magistrate appears and Moritz asks him why he has
"tortured" him so and the magistrate replies, "because you have lied"
(<I>DSS,</I> 50). Moritz refuses to admit to knowing anything about the
murder and faints.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Zweig's drama the process of the child's coercion is detailed. It is
not fear of punishment that causes Moritz to convert and become a witness
to an act that did not occur, but the promise of social integration. The
magistrate is about to have him beaten again, but reconsiders, has him
moved into a bigger, cleaner cell and orders that he be given food and
drink and be permitted to walk two hours a day in the prison garden. At
the end of the week, the magistrate calls Moritz to him and promises
continued good treatment, good food, good clothes. He promises him,
"Anything you want. We'll take care of you, you will be sent to a good
school. We will get you a good job; you can even go to university, and
become a judge like me" (<I>DSS,</I> 52). The promise given the child
is that if he perjures himself he will be permitted to enter into the
greater society, even to become a soldier, as he had formerly desired. The
magistrate then sets a series of questions: Who opened the door? Who
held the girl? Who butchered her? Who collected the blood? Where was
the body disposed? He will return the next day to hear the answers. What
the magistrate wishes to have substantiated is how the "Jews butchered"
the victim (the set phrase employed by him as well as by her mother
[<I>DSS,</I> 52, 67]). It is the details of the act of butchering the
Christian woman that are rehearsed by the magistrate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moritz considers the magistrate's request and decides to tell him what
he wants to know, but the audience is made aware that the boy does not
believe his own statement. Instead, Zweig shows us the "talmudic" mind
of the Jew in operation: Moritz considers that the magistrate wants
him to lie, so it is not a sin. All of the Jews will know that he
has lied, and that his word will have little effect before the court
since they will clearly take the word of the adults accused of the
crime over his. He then proceeds question by question to answer the
magistrate, repeating his questions as statements. At the trial Moritz
substantiates each stage of the ritual murder. The Jews, including his
father, placed the naked victim on a table covered in red cloth. "The
butcher <I>[Sch&auml;chter]</I> cut her throat with the big calf knife
and the others caught her blood in large, silver bowls." (<I>DSS,</I>
76-77) The body was then dismembered and cut into twelve pieces, one
for each of the tribes of Israel, and each piece wrapped in linen and
buried in a different child's grave in the cemetery.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here sexuality and ritual butchery are associated with the image of
ritual murder. The reason the Jews are undertaking this act, according to
a monologue held by a Hungarian nobleman, Gy&ouml;z&ouml; Ist&oacute;czy,
lies in the diseased nature of the Jews and their infection of the healthy
Hungarian body: the Jews are leeches <I>(Blutegel)</I> who suck the best
blood from the Hungarians, "damned vampires" who cover Hungary like a
"skin infection <I>[Kr&auml;tze],</I> like a rash <I>[Ausschlag]"</I>
they serve Satan, the proof of being "from 1869 to 1870 36,000 people
died of cholera and other plagues in Hungary and Rumania: but almost no
Jews. Does the plague come from God or the Devil?" The Jews, who attach
<I>[sic]</I> our lands, should not be permitted to drink the blood of
our children (<I>DSS,</I> 63-65). His speech contains quotes from the
most infamous (and widely read) tractate on the blood libel, August
Rohling's <I>Der Talmudjude</I> .

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By this point in the play the witness sought has been found, and the
details of the ritual murder can be substantiated before the court. So
that no one in his audience misses the point, Zweig interrupts the flow of
the historical plot and introduces yet another "supernatural <B></B> 
scene"
in which the sixteenth-century Jewish convert to Christianity and opponent
of the Jews, Jakob (actually Josef and then later Johannes) Pfefferkorn,
"a renegade, small, with the face of the lowest Jewish type," appears on
stage and stakes his claim for Moritz Scharf before God and his prophet
Elijah. Scharf is now the apostate in both name and deed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The only "witness" to the charge of ritual murder then was Moritz Scharf,
on whose testi-mony the charge now hangs. Moritz is brought into the
courtroom, dressed "like a Hungarian peasant boy, with high boots, white
shirt, and blue linen pants. His hair is cut short, so that his sidelocks
<I>[payess]</I> are missing" (<I>DSS,</I> 74). He recounts in detail the
confession which had been presented to him by the magistrate in perfect
high German without a trace of his earlier Yiddish accent.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
In his own mind, he is already beginning integration into the greater
society through his perjury. The details are precisely those narrated
by the magistrate, down to the dismemberment of the body. Following
testimony, he is confronted by his father before the court.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moritz's father mourns his son as if he were dead or a convert
(<I>DSS,</I> 87). But he sees in his son's apostasy his own faults, his
own guilt for not having been a good enough Jew and father, having led
his child into the temptations of a big city without enough Jewishness
to protect him. Now, following this early twentieth-century model
of acculturation, he is paying the price for living on the margins
of a truly Jewish life--the apostasy of his son and the accusation
of the blood libel. Zweig, like Kafka, was an acculturated Jew who,
following the anti-Semitic excesses of the 1890s, came to understand
that the demands for social integration would mean the destruction
of the Jews in the modern world. This paradox lies at the center of
Kafka's reading of Zweig's drama--how can acculturated Jews deal with
their own acculturation or cultural conversion? For certainly the very
acts of writing and reading such a drama were signs that Zweig and Kafka
belonged to the very cultural milieu Moritz Scharf desires to enter. Is
this an unconscious act of betrayal?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This was the central question for other contemporaries who commented
on the case. For the French-Jewish physician Hippolyte Bernheim the
creditability of the witnesses comes to define the case.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
Bernheim described the background of the Tisza-Eszlar case in great
detail, for he wanted to understand why the child would have given
such monstrous testimony. He dismissed the idea that Moritz was
simply blackmailed into lying because of threats to himself and
his family. Rather, he assumed that the child came to believe that
he had actually seen the events described to him by the public
prosecutor. Bernheim sets the scene.
<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here we have the "small, weak child, raised in the direst
poverty...brought before this august person, who incorporates all justice
and power." This "poor, isolated being is overwhelmed by him" and listens
as he describes the Jews as "a damned race, who see it as their pious
undertaking to spill Christian blood, in order to dampen the dough for

the unleavened Easter bread." The power of the rhetoric of this figure
has an "impact on the weak character" of the child and this "extreme
suggestion permeates his hypnotized brain." Bernheim proposed that the
child's testimony was a "retrospective hallucination such as one can
generate in a deep trance." Here we have the replacement of the world of
trauma with the world of fantasy. The testimony of the child was evidently
false, but why? Not because he was consciously lying, but because he had
come to believe the reality of the experience that he had imagined. The
reason for this was the suggestibility of the child (the product of his
environment) and the presence of this over-life-sized figure of power
and authority (the father-surrogate). The child, who comes to believe
that he has seen a murder committed by his co-religionists, is the
ultimate victim. The only thing that he can do is to forget what he has
in actuality seen. The child becomes what the world wants him to become.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Zweig's drama the trial itself continues with the prosecutor revealing
that the exhumation of the victim's body showed no signs of any ritual
murder, and that he will raise a charge of perjury against Moritz and
propose a punishment of a year in prison. A reenactment of the crime
in the now wrecked and desolate synagogue shows that Moritz's account
cannot be accurate given the physical placement of the table in the
synagogue. It was impossible to see through the keyhole. Moritz now
acknowledges that he saw nothing and the magistrate then turns on him
and accuses him of having lied to him. "I have never lied... I have
always told the truth...always the truth..." (<I>DDS,</I> 107)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The final act of the play finds Moritz alone in the synagogue where
he is silently observed by Pfefferkorn and Elijah, who compete for his
soul. Moritz's long monologue reveals his confusion, his inability to
tell his lies from the truth. "Am I still a Jew? Perhaps I am still
a Jew?" He undresses, seeks out a shroud, places a knife against his
heart and commits suicide (<I>DDS,</I> 112-13). The knife he finds in
the synagogue seems to be the knife used in reenacting the ritual murder
at the close of the previous scene. His suicide is thus an extension of
the ritualization of death in this culture. In his dying moment he sees
Elijah, who kisses him. Like the dying Faust at the close of the second
part of the drama Moritz is redeemed in his death, but here as a Jew. A
suicide note is found next to his body. "No one murdered me, I murdered
myself. I believed that I told the truth. The eternal one, blessed be
he, will judge me" (<I>DDS,</I> 121).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The final scene in heaven brings the shadow of Moritz before Rabbi
Akiba and the Baal Shem Tov to be judged. The Baal Shem Tov defends
Moritz noting that "the suffering of the body is greater than a
human being. He was a boy, brother, who bore the suffering of a man"
(<I>DSS,</I> 122). The Baal Shem Tov's defense of Moritz is accepted by
God and Moritz, like Faust, is truly saved.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The reality is somewhat more banal. After the conclusion of the trial, the
boy along with the rest of his family, moved to Budapest. When asked by
a reporter there what actually occurred in the synagogue that Saturday,
his reply was, "Nothing happened there" (<I>BLT,</I> 131).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Having read Zweig, Kafka wept.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The blood libel trial in this drama represents a further Jewish fantasy
about the body. It is clear that only Jewish males were accused of blood
libel at the fin de si&egrave;cle and that the accusation represented a
cultural acknowledgment on all sides of the Jewish male desire for the
feminine Other. But the sexualization of the charge, as represented in
Zweig's drama, places the charge of sexual anarchy on the doorstep of the
nobility and the landlords, in a rehearsal of the late nineteen-century
anti-nobility preoccupation with the myth of the <I>jus primae noctis.</I>
The shift from young child to pubescent/young woman heightens the notion
of sexual guilt. But in Zweig's drama the guilt is rather that of the
upper classes than that of the Jew. This theme dominated the literature
of the period. Artur Dinter's 1918 <I>S&uuml;nde wider das Blut (Sin
against the Blood)</I> thematized the notion of a violation of the blood
through miscegenation. There, too, the Yiddish accent of the Jew marked
him as incapable of integrating. His immutability, like that of Moritz
Scharf, means that he remains a Jew no matter what. It is Moritz who is
the focus of Bernheim's, Zweig's, and presumably Kafka's concern. For
what the young Scharf embodies is the fantasy of becoming the same as
every one else in the society that persecutes him. His desire to become a
soldier, the offer that enables him to be seduced, is a promise to become
like everyone else. But this is revealed as impossible, and indeed as
a false promise. His body will remain the body of the Jew, no matter
how he changes his clothes or his accent. The feminized Jewish male,
the barely pubescent thirteen year-old who is only ritually a man, is
revealed as powerless through the process of the trial. Betrayed almost
randomly, he capitulates to the possibility of transformation. Moritz
Scharf's transformation into a Hungarian peasant boy reflects both the
desire to change and its impossibility. The boy never becomes a man,
and his permanent immaturity (even in his own eyes) is reflected in his
life and his suicide. The son remains ever a child--but a Jewish child,
bearing the burden of the difference placed upon him by a society that
offers only the false solution of social integration as its answer to his
difference. One must become what one is fated to become. And Kafka weeps.

Kafka rehearses over and over again the scenario of the ritual murder. In
his diary for 16 September 1915 he writes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Between throat and chin would seem to be the most rewarding place to
stab. Lift the chin and stick the knife into the tensed muscles. But
this spot is probably rewarding only in one's imagination. You expect
to see a magnificent gush of blood and a network of sinews and little
bones like you find in a turkey leg.

This passage evokes a very specific context for the ritual murder. The
scene as Zweig describes it in his drama is the <I>locus classicus</I>
for such murders--the victim is bound, head held back, throat slit, and
the blood collected in vessels. And in evoking the setting of the ritual
murder Kafka, like Zweig, reflects the intense contemporary debate about
the Jews and their ritual killing of animals, a debate used to reflect
on the nature of the Jew's soul and body as much as on Jewish ritual
practices. But Zweig, unlike Kafka, stresses the ritual opening of the
body as well as its murder. It is the linkage of these two moments which

<B></B>

reveals the contemporary discourse about illness, ritual murder,
and the Jews at the turn of the century.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The fantasy murder in Zweig's play is carried out by the butcher, who
according to the suborned witness, "cut her throat with the big calf
knife" (<I>DDS,</I> 76). <I>Shechita,</I> the Jewish ritual slaughter
of animals for human consumption, is at the turn of the century closely
associated with the charge of ritual murder and illness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
Two aspects of ritual slaughter play a role in the cultural debates
in Central Europe at the fin de si&egrave;cle. The first is the act of
slaughter itself and the second is the ritual examination of the carcass.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The act of slaughter is the very image of the ritual murder in the texts
and charges of the anti-Semites. To quote a contemporary Jewish source,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Through bending the head backward the throat is exposed. Then a
lightning-fast cut across the throat using a long, razor sharp knife
which cuts the softer parts of the throat through to the backbone. A
huge amount of blood flows in thick streams from the severed veins and
arteries, especially from the jugular. Because of the shock to the nerves
as well as the sudden halting of blood to the brain there is immediate
unconsciousness. The animal remains immobile until after about three
quarters of a minute a purely mechanical autonomic reflex causes more
or less powerful muscular reactions in the unconscious animal. Within
two to three minutes these give way to the death cramps.

This is from the <I>Jewish Lexicon</I> written in the 1920s; it stresses
the painlessness of the pro-cedure as well as explaining the seeming
physical torment the animals experience. This is in answer to the charge
of cruelty and brutality lodged against the Jews in the light of their
ritual practice of <I>shechita.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The social response to the ritual slaughter of animals by Jews is
brutal and direct. The anti-cruelty forces in Europe and America teamed
up closely with the anti-Semites who saw everything associated with
the Jews as an abomination to label this form of slaughter cruel and
barbaric. In Germany as early as the first Congress for the Protection
of Animals  there was a strong attack on ritual slaughter. Such
attacks were virtually always accompanied by comments linking animal
slaughter to other forms of Jewish "brutality." In 1885 the attack
on ritual slaughter led the Lord Mayor of London to comment that the
objections to this practice evoked the ritual murder accusations from
the time of Chaucer.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 In the 1883 meeting of the Congress
for the Protection of Animals in Vienna the argument was made that the
protection of ritual slaughter or at least its lack of condemnation was
a sign that the Jews controlled the political process in Europe. By 1892
a law against ritual slaughter was passed in Saxony. And by 1897 there
was a clear link between such attacks and the anti-vivisection movement,
as the cruelest experimental physician/scientists were reputed to be Jews.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Indeed Karl Liebknecht denounced the right-wing attacks on ritual
slaughter on the floor of the Reichstag on 24 April 1899 as a further
attempt to attack the Jews while a colleague of his in the same debate
simply labeled these attacks as "anti-Semitic desires." The liberal
newspapers, such as the <I>Berliner Tageblatt</I> in 1893, called those
campaigning against ritual slaughter "pure anti-Semites," and <I>Die
Nation</I> in 1894 labeled "the cry against the so-called <I>shechita</I>
[as belonging] to the best-loved sport of the modern persecutor of the
Jews."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A typical text from this tradition is Ernst von Schwartz's 1905 monograph
directed against the ritual slaughter of animals (<I>DBS,</I> 21). Schwarz
begins his book by defending himself against the charge that he is an
anti-Semite. He cites his Jewish landlord and his Jewish

<B></B>

doctor as
proof of his fairness. He defends the anti-cruelty forces as not being
anti-Semitic, but cites, as do many of the intellectuals of the day,
Jewish practices such as ritual slaughter as the line of demarcation
between the Jews (who desire to function within the system) and their
Christian neighbors. "Nothing is so disposed to increase the divide
between Christians and Jews and to make Judaism be felt as a foreign
element, than to demand the ability to do what is morally and legally
forbidden to Christians" (<I>DBS,</I> 21). But Jews, because of their
egoism, insist on their right to be different and still be part of the
body politic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Central to the ritual of <I>shechita</I> is the purification of the
animal's carcass with the elimi-nation of its blood through slaughter. The
religious argument is that the Jews (beginning with the admonition in
Genesis 9:4) were forbidden to eat blood. In the course of the late
nineteenth century this ritual argument was given hygienic content:
the refusal of the Jews to consume blood is a sign of the "hygienic"
importance of ritual slaughter in the preservation of human life,
especially its preservation from exposure to tuberculosis.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1889 Henry Behrend, in the popular British periodical <I>The
Nineteenth Century,</I> sum-marized the hygiene argument.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
Behrend, writing in the wake of the extraordinary popular acceptance
of Robert Koch's discovery of the tubercular bacillus in 1882, argued
that the present state of scientific knowledge demands that diseased
meat be withheld from human consumption. This was very much in line
with a general shift from treatment to prevention that developed in the
1880s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Behrend claimed that science now knows the etiology
of tuberculosis and other such infectious diseases (for example anthrax)
and knows how these diseases can be passed on to human beings. Such
meat "is not only deprived of most of its nutritive qualities, but
is capable of communicating its specific malady to man, when taken as
food" (<I>HOH,</I> 410). The effects of the disease can be seen in the
slaughtered animal, as the Sheriff-Principal of Glasgow comments, "the
presence of the agent of the disease must pre-cede the visible results
of its action; indeed, the present case affords an illustration of the
danger of inferring, from the absence of symptoms visible to the unaided
eye, that the disease is localized" (<I>HOH,</I> 411). In July 1888 the
International Congress of Tuberculosis in Paris stressed the dangers of
eating infected meat. The assumption of the period was that there was
an absolute association between the consumption of tainted meat and the
acquisi-tion of tuberculosis that would be "transmitted to their unborn
children" (<I>HOH,</I> 412). The eating of infected meat affected not
only the present generation but all future generations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The two basic scientific premises of Behrend's argument are: 1)
an absolute "identity of human and bovine tuberculosis" and 2) the
"communicability of tuberculosis to man from the flesh of affected
cattle" (<I>HOH,</I> 413). This communicability, Behrend claims, quoting
a Dr. Klein from the Brown Institution, "is communicable by ingestion"
(<I>HOH,</I> 416).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thus the "comparative immunity from the tubercular diathesis" of the Jews
can be ex-plained by their dietary laws (<I>HOH,</I> 418). Behrend quotes
No&euml;l Gu&eacute;neau de Mussy claiming before the Academy of Medicine
in Paris in 1885 that the "vitality of the Jewish race" depends on "the
care exercised by them in the selection of their food supply." This
is especially apparent, de Mussy states, in the relatively low rate
of infant mortality among the Jews, especially in Germany (<I>HOH,</I>
419-20). Moses becomes the first bacteriologist, prefiguring the model
of Koch and Pasteur.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The idea of parasitic and infectious maladies, which has conquered so
great a position in modern pathology, appears to have greatly occupied
the mind of Moses, and to have dominated

<B></B>

all his hygienic rules. He
excludes from consumption by the Jews all dietary animals particularly
liable to parasites; and as it is in the blood that the germs or spores
of infectious disease circulate, he orders that those eaten must be
drained of their blood before serving for food. What an extraordinary
prescience! The contagion of tuberculosis has been proved only during
the last few years; its transmissibility by food is not yet universally
recognized, though the experiments of M. Chauveau render it almost
certain; yet the law of Israel, thousands of years in advance of modern
science, has inscribed in its precepts these ordinances, preventive of
the malady." (<I>HOH,</I> 417)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This claim was made by physicians as well as the lay public. The Jews,
through their religious practices, were following a basic model of
hygiene. "We may go to Moses for instruction in some of the best methods
in hygiene," according to the famed Canadian physician William Osler in
1914.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Or indeed, even as Ernst von Schwartz stated in his
tractate against ritual slaughter in 1905, "Moses was the great, wise
reformer and hygienist" (<I>DBS,</I> 37).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Shechita</I> becomes the central means by which the Jews avoided
tuberculous infection. Especially among Jews (and their supporters) it was
neither "racial immunity" nor the "pathological constitution" of the Jews
that rescued them from illness but religious, i.e., hygienic practice. The
ritual slaughter of cattle was followed by the <I>Bedikah ha Reah,</I> the
ritual opening of the carcass and the inspection, especially of the pleura
and viscera, for any traces of anomalies. The Talmudic practice outlined
in <I>Mischna Chullin</I> 3:1 designated the various states of the pleura
that would designate the animal under Rabbinic interpretation of Halakhic
(ritual) law, as <I>treff,</I> unclean, and therefore inedible.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such information about diseases and the blood is of importance for
the society as a whole, especially for those insuring the lives of
individuals, as Professor Hosmer, cited by Behrend, states, "at the
present day in the life insurance offices the life of a Jew is said
to be worth much more than that of men of other stock" (<I>HOH,</I>
419). There is no discussion here of ritual slaughter and brutality, but
simply ritual slaughter and hygiene. Here the guidelines for the defense
of <I>shechita</I> are set: ritual slaughter is modern, hygienic, and
scientific; it is important for mortality tables and therefore for those
who deal with insurance, and deals with the source of pollution of all
future generations with its control of the blood.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Blood, within the hygienic rationale of <I>shechita,</I> is also
considered to have a detrimental effect on the preservation of meat
and thus serves as one of the touchstones of the arguments both for and
against the practice. The rhetoric against ritual slaughter was striking
in its brutality. In an anonymous tract from 1883, the argument was made
that ritual slaughter was not at all biblical in its origin but rather
rabbinical and that, indeed, the Bible demands the least painful death
for animals.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 This view separated the positive "religious"
tradition that leads to Christianity from the negative "essentially"
Jewish tradition of Rabbinic Judaism. The Bible, this view states, cannot
condone evil things; only Jews do this. Again we can turn to Schwartz
for an example. Blood, Schwartz states, is forbidden "because it is
holy and not because it is unhealthy, for that which is holy cannot be
sick, cannot be poisonous" (<I>DBS,</I> 36). But the blood drawn from
ritually slaughtered animals is polluted and can make one ill "because
of the dirtying of it through the presence of vomit that will make it
disgusting and poisonous" (<I>DBS,</I> 37). The Jews, because they are
inherently hypocrites, Schwartz states, will eat bloody meat. "What
Israelite has not already eaten bloody game?" (<I>DBS,</I> 38) But then
comes the final turn in Schwartz's argument. Jews <I>claim</I> they don't
eat blood because it is

<B></B>

holy or because to handle it is polluting,
but in reality they eat it anyway. These contradictions prove the lying
nature of the Jews even in regard to their claims for ritual observance
and laws of health and hygiene.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Shechita</I> was read as both a reflex of the Jewish soul and part
of a pattern of Jewish illness, and comes to have a specific cultural
significance. In Thomas Mann's <I>The Magic Mountain</I>  the
figure of Leo Naphta, whom the protagonist Hans Castorp meets in the
tuber-culosis sanitarium at Davos, is revealed to the reader to be a
Jew upon our first seeing his "corrosive ugliness." "Everything about
him was sharp: the hooked nose dominating his face, the narrow, pursed
mouth, the thick, beveled lenses of his glasses in their light frame,
behind which were a pair of pale-gray eyes--even the silence he preserved,
which suggested that when he broke it, his speech would be incisive and
logical."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  Naphta's background links all of the aspects of
our story about the Jew, ritual murder, and <I>shechita.</I> Mann believed
strongly in the inheritance of family characteristics and in the notion
of degeneracy as a pattern that explains individual pathology. For him
the Jew was the exemplary case study and the ritual butcher the Jew's
most powerful representative.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Leo, or as he was then called, Leib Naphta, came from the Eastern
reaches of the Austrian Empire, from the Galician-Volhynian border,
where his father Elie was a <I>schochet,</I> a ritual slaughterer. Mann's
description of his activities evokes all of the sense of the psyche of
the Jew as a "brooding and refining spirit."

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Standing near the victim, which was hobbled and bound indeed, but not
stunned, he would lift the mighty slaughter-knife and bring it to rest in
a deep gash close to the cervical vertebra; while the assistant held the
quickly filling basins to receive the gushing, steaming blood, and the
child looked on the sight with that childish gaze which often pierces
through the sense into the essential, and may have been in an unusual
degree the gift of the starry-eyed Elie's son. He knew that Christian
butchers had to stun their cattle with a blow from a club before killing
them, and that this regulation was made in order to avoid unnecessary
cruelty. Yet his father, so fine and so intelligent by comparison with
those louts, and starry-eyed as never one of them, did his task according
to the Law, striking down the creature while its senses were undimmed,
and letting its life-blood well out until it sank. The boy Leib felt
that the stupid <I>goyim</I> were actuated by an easy and irreverent
good nature, which paid less honor to the deity than did his father's
solemn mercilessness; thus the conception of piety came to be bound up
in his mind with that of cruelty, and the idea of the sacred and the
spiritual with the sight and smell of spurting blood. (<I>MM,</I> 440-41)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is a somewhat standard representation of the meaning of ritual
slaughter, but Mann, never one to leave well enough alone, provides
us with the mythic continuum on which this spiritual type must
be placed. Elie Naphta is also a "familiar of God, a Baal-Shem or
Zaddik, a miracle man" who can cure "a woman or a malignant sore, and
another time a boy of spasms, simply by means of blood and invocations"
(<I>MM,</I> 441). The word "blood" seems to reflect the blood gathered by
the <I>schochet</I> through the ritual slaughter; overtly, it refers to
the "race" of the Jews--to their blood. But Mann continues this line of
associations, for in the very next sentences, he describes Elie Naphta's
eventual fate. "But it was precisely this aura of an uncanny piety, in
which the odor of his blood-boltered calling played a part, that proved
his destruction. There had been the unexplained death of two gentile
boys, a popular uprising, a panic of rage--and Elie had died horribly,
nailed crucifix-wise on the door of his

<B></B>

burning home" (<I>MM,</I>
441). Here the set of associations seems to be complete--ritual slaughter,
the physiognomy and the psyche of the Jew, the Jew who cures using blood,
and the blood libel accusation, which ends in the immediate death of
the Jew crucified as a Jew. Here no trial supervenes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mann extends this chain of associations in a way that makes us think
even harder about the hidden associations with the notion of the blood
libel trials and the body of the Jew. For Leo Naphta is at Davos being
treated for tuberculosis because his mother was tubercular. According to
Mann, Leo has "the seeds of his lung disease" from his mother and from his
father, beside his slenderness of build, "an extraordinary intelligence"
(<I>MM,</I> 441). Mann evokes the slender body of the Jew, a sign of the
feminization of the Jew as well as of the pre-disposition to tuberculosis
as a mark of the Jew's difference. But here, like Naphta's Jewish-ness,
the disease is labeled as an inheritance of the mother.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The association between tuberculosis and ritual slaughter is not merely
a literary one. The two aspects of <I>shechita--</I>the ritual slaughter
of the animal (with its bleeding of the animal) and <I>Bedikah</I>,
the examination of its pleura, were often linked as hygienic moments
that prevented the transmission of disease. The leading Russian Jewish
specialist on the topic, the St. Petersburg physician I. A. Dembo
stresses, not the transmission of infection, but the increased health
of those eating meat that can be kept fresh longer because of the
bleeding process.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 But the association between hygiene
and ritual slaughter is the basic proof of its need. Such views were
supported by two of the most important medical authorities of the
day, Rudolf Virchow and Emil Du Bois-Reymond, to whom Dembo dedicates
his book.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 But it was tuberculosis which is most greatly
feared and is thus the disease best prevented by the entire ritual of
slaughter. Indeed, in the fin-de-si&egrave;cle Jewish Encyclopedia, the
article on <I>Bedikah</I> stresses that the examination of pleura was
to look for (among other things) <I>bu'ot,</I> defined in the article as
"blisters or tubercles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Those who opposed the ritual killing of animals as inhumane also found
themselves in opposition to the <I>Bedikah.</I> Thus Ernst von Schwartz
could claim that while the Jews claim that "the Jewish examination offers
the best possible guarantee for healthy meat" (<I>DBS,</I> 54) it is no
longer needed. Perhaps this inspection had some sense in ancient times
when the Jews were exposed to illnesses and lacked veterinary expertise,
but today, he states, "this is a comic appearing examination" (<I>DBS,</I>
49). He quotes J. Goltz, the director of the public abattoir in Berlin
as saying, "these rules speak more than any others against the hygienic
importance of <I>shechita"</I> and the head of the Bremen abattoir as
declaring, "many an animal are declared to be kosher which are then
declared to be inedible by the official inspection" (<I>DBS,</I> 51).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Jewish religious practices, then perceived as simultaneously "barbaric"
and as forms of hygiene. They were both "bad" and "good"--but
only for the Jews. Often the illnesses ascribed to the Jews didn't
include tuberculosis, for the magical power of <I>shechita</I> and its
ritualization (which paralleled the ritualization of the Catholic mass)
keep the illness apart from the Jews.

If Zweig's drama of ritual murder made Kafka weep, it is clear that
the debate about <I>shechita</I> gave Kafka a trope that linked
the concepts of beauty/health and ugliness/illness with the ritual
practices of the Jew. Kafka's context for this debate could have been
the

<B></B>

general discussion of <I>shechita</I> in Prague culture, but it
is important to note that Kafka had seen Jacob Gordin's Yiddish drama
<I>Di Shekhite</I> , in which the protagonist's act of murder
using a knife is juxtaposed to the training of a <I>schochet,</I> the
ritual slaughterer.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 There too, if ever so ironically, ritual
slaughter and murder are paired. Over and over Kafka rewrites the act of
<I>shechita</I> in terms of the anti-Semitic culture in which he lives
and that read it as the model for ritual murder of Christian women. The
question of ritual slaughter was expressly linked to the tradition
of ritual murder, as in an 1893 cartoon in the Swiss periodical <I>Der
Nebelspalter</I> of a Yiddish-accented David ritually slaughtering Goliath
(<A HREF="1.1gilman_fig01.html">fig. 1</A>). This image introduces the
anti-Semites' fantasy of the weapon
that Jews used for their ritual murder/<I>shechita:</I> not a ritual
slaughtering knife but a pointed and curved dagger. This is an ancient
fantasy; pointed knives are the staple of representations of ritual murder
from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to the infamous illustration
on the cover of the "ritual murder" issue of Julius Streicher's notorious
<I>Der St&uuml;rmer</I> of 1 May 1934.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 In truth, Jewish
ritual knives are blunt, not pointed. Kafka's own observation was that
the <I>mohel,</I> the ritual circumciser, used "an ordinary knife, a sort
of a fish knife," one blunt rather than pointed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Such knives
would be useless for stabbing, as the importance of ritual blades lies in
an extremely sharp honed edge. In Kafka's inscription of the act of ritual
murder, the victim is "stabbed...between throat and chin" (<I>D1914,</I>
130). This is a fantasy taken from the culture of the time and worked out
in the semi-privacy of Kafka's diaries. Kafka accepts the anti-Semitic
image of the <I>schochet's</I> knife because he wants to use the link
between the debate on ritual murder and ritual slaughter to undermine
certain very specific readings of the problem of becoming one's fate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Echoes of the power of the ritual scene of the blood libel murder and its
association with the (psychic) health of the Jew can be found in a number
of Kafka's literary works.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 As early as Kafka's "Description
of a Struggle" (1906/1910), the image of the ritual shedding of blood
closes a text. There the "acquaintance" without any seeming motivation
"pulled a knife out of his pocket, opened it thoughtfully, and then,
as though he were playing, he plunged it into his left upper arm, and
didn't withdraw it. Blood promptly began to flow. His round cheeks grew
pale." The narrator's response is to pull "out the knife, cut up the
sleeve of his overcoat and jacket" and tear his shirt sleeve open. "I
sucked a little at the deep wound" (<I>S,</I> 50). Kafka conflates the
notion of suicide and ritual blood letting--with the fantasy of the
pointed knife--and circumcision with the sucking at the open wound;
the wound of the circumcision is stanched by the ritual circumciser
sucking on the infant's penis. The narrator assumes the role of the
ritual circumciser, just as the acquaintance had assumed the role of
the ritual slaughterer. But here it is self-mutilation that reveals
the depths of despair in which the "acquaintance" finds himself. Kafka
projects the interrelated discourses of ritual and madness as applied
to the Jew into this neutral world of raceless and nameless characters.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The attack on <I>shechita</I> as cruel and heartless, given the
"modern, improved" forms of animal slaughter, is echoed in Kafka's "In
the Penal Colony" when the Officer tries to second-guess his visitor's
response to the Machine. "Perhaps you object on principle to capital
punishment in general and to such mechanical instruments of death in
particular, besides you will see that the execution has no support
from the public, a shabby ceremony--carried out with a machine already
somewhat old and worn" (<I>S,</I> 155). This echoes the Westernized

<B></B>

Jew's view that ritual slaughter, like circumcision, has come to
"have merely historical character, even as they are practiced today"
(<I>D1910,</I> 196). <I>Shechita,</I> like circumcision, has become
a "shabby ceremony." The machine then is a conflation. Opponents of
<I>shechita</I> advocated replacing this form of slaughter with new
slaughtering machines (such as a power-driven bolt that shattered
the animal's skull, immediately rendering it unconscious). While the
use of more modern forms of slaughter advocated by the opponents of
<I>shechita</I> is condemned in the form of Kafka's machine, the ritual
surrounding the machine simul-taneously evokes the religious practice
associated with <I>shechita.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such a complex reading of knives and slaughter is not limited to "In the
Penal Colony." The masochistic, Jewish response to the oppressive and
constricting Christian attitude toward Jews is ironically presented as a
theme in his tale "Jackals and Arabs," first published in October 1917 in
Martin Buber's periodical <I>The Jew.</I> This Jewish audience would have
recognized the rhetoric concerning <I>shechita</I> without any trouble.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here the jackals represent the Western fantasy of the Jews as always
haunting the edges of "culture," unable truly to alter their innate
instincts. Their bodies reflect their natures; they bear the marking
stench of the Jew, the <I>f&#156;tor judaicus,</I> "a rank smell which
at times I had to

<B></B>

set my teeth to endure [that] streamed from
their open jaws" (<I>S,</I> 408). They speak like Jews, with a "natural
plaintiveness of...voice" (<I>S,</I> 409). (At the turn of the century,
Jews are reported to speak with a Jewish intonation or vocabulary, out of
necessity rather than choice. A German proverb of the time says that "One
can inherit a Yiddish accent but one can not unlearn it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
)
Yet it is the eating habits of the jackals that set them most apart from
their neighbors in the desert, the Arabs. The jackals detest the Arabs,
who "kill animals for food, and [despise] carrion." The jackals are
appalled at their "exile among such creatures" (<I>S,</I> 408). Here it
is the mode of feeding, of becoming what one is fated to become through
eating, that defines the jackals.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The jackals eat differently than do the Arabs. They eat "naturally,"
consuming carrion, while the Arabs "murder" their food. The jackals'
desire is for a world cleansed of such an enemy, "no more bleating
of sheep knifed by an Arab; every beast to die a natural death; no
interference till we have drained the carcass empty and picked its bones
clean. Cleanliness, nothing but cleanliness is what we want..." (<I>S,</I>
409-10). The meaning of the eating habits of these two old foes lies
"in the blood, and perhaps will only end with it" (<I>S,</I> 408). What
must be done, says an old jackal, is that "we shall draw blood from them
and the quarrel will be over." It is the drawing of blood that will
cure. "And so, sir," they say to the European visitor, "and so, dear
sir, by means of your all-powerful hands slit their throats through
with these scissors!" And what is provided for their execution is a
"small pair of sewing scissors, covered with ancient rust" (<I>S,</I>
410). The weapon of choice has tiny but distinctly pointed blades.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In "Jackals and Arabs," Kafka provided a parodic rewriting of the
debate about <I>shechita</I> that replays and reverses all of the common
arguments. The "natural" manner of death, the eating of carrion, comes to
represent the historicized ritual tradition of the marginalized Jews. The
Jews argue that their method of slaughter is hygienic and that all others
are barbaric and unclean. Like the Jews, the jackals drain the blood from
the carcass. They are the inversion of the ritual slaughterers, eating
only <I>treff</I> meat from animals that have died a natural death after
draining their blood. The jackals are also the ritual murderers in an
ironic replay of the anti-Semitic stereotypes of the day. They want the
throats of the next victims slit--the Arabs are not to have the grace
of dying naturally. But the weapon provided is comical, a pair of rusty
sewing scissors whose pointed blades evoke the anti-Semite's version of
the knives associated with ritual slaughter and ritual murder.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Arabs treat these halakically unclean animals as their "dogs." They
throw a camel's carcass to the jackals, who go immediately "at the camel's
throat, sinking...teeth straight into an artery." All of the jackals then
pile onto the carcass. The "camel's blood was already lying in pools,
reeking to heaven, the carcass was torn wide open in many places" (S,
410, 411). What marks the "hatred" of the jackals for the Arabs is the
jackals' nature, represented in this version by a parody of
<I>shechita:</I> the animal's throat slashed and its body laid open for
the European's
inspection. As in "In the Penal Colony," the narrator serves as the
outsider whose visit highlights the blindness of all involved to the
very meaning of their world. For the readers of Buber's journal, Kafka's
evocation of the debates about <I>shechita</I> would have been clear
and would have called down the laughter against both those who attacked
this practice as reflecting the essential Jewish character and those
defenders who saw <I>kashruth,</I> ritual practice, as an essential part
of the ritual definition of the Jew. Kafka's association of the idea of
execution and the trial is joined to his sense of the use of this debate
as a means of stressing the inevitability of the Jew becoming the one
he is fated to become.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No healthy transformation is possible even in the fantasy world of
Kafka's texts. Kafka's view, like that of many acculturated Jews
of his time who saw the failure of civil emancipation as practiced
in Europe (including the Zionist Theodore Herzl), condemned even the
desire for such transformations as a form of corruption. The result of
conversion is an unhealthy individual; healthy individuals do not want
to shed their Jewishness because they value it as intrinsic to their
self-definition. As the French historian and defender of the Jews during
the Dreyfus Affair Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu noted, the irony of the Jew is
the weapon by which "the baptized Jew takes vengeance upon the God of the
Christians and upon their social system, for the disgrace of compulsory
baptism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Beyond Kafka's sense of the impossibility of
conversion, even the possibility of marrying outside of the "race"
leads to ghastly results. This can be seen in his understanding of
the special nature of the product of race-crossing, of the marriage of
Jew and non-Jew. The <I>Mischling,</I> the mixed-race offspring, had
a special status in the culture. For it was in the <I>Mischling</I>
that the most egregious aspects of both "races" were magnified. These
children of Jews and non-Jews are Jews, but Jews in a heightened form
who bear all of the stigmata of degeneration that exist in incestuous
or inbred families. "The child[ren] of such marriages...even though they
are so very beautiful and so very talented, seem to lack a psychological
balance which is provided by pure racial stock. We find all too often
intellectually or morally unbalanced individuals, who decay ethically
or end in suicide or madness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The <I>Mischling</I> is
the end product of the process of Jewish degeneration that produces
children who reveal the hidden racial difference of the Jews, their
"Blackness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 In this ideological construct, Jews are as
marked by the color of their skins as is the African. In addition to their
moral, psychological, and physiological failings, the <I>Mischling</I>
also is superficially "creative." This negative quality of the Jew has
its roots in the nineteenth-century discussion about the relationship
between genius and madness. For the Jew this creativity lies in the
Jew's use of the German language.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 But he cannot become too
much like Christians/Aryans, for then he is inauthentic. "If the Jew
differs from us, so much the better; he is the more likely to bring
a little variety into the flat monotony of modern civilization. I am
rather inclined to find fault with these sons of Shem--as I find fault
with the Orientals who adopt our customs--for resembling and copying us
too closely" (<I>IAN,</I> 261). The inauthenticity of the Western Jew
is the inauthenticity of the convert, whether religious or cultural.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka sees this as a problem in terms of his own person and command of
language. Visiting Merano in northern Italy in April 1920, his visibility
as a Jew becomes even more evident to him. There he is revealed to the
"Germans" as a Jew by his very language. He is marked as a Jew in the
way that is most telling for Kafka the writer. Moments later, he rails
against the <I>Taufjude--</I>the baptized Jew--and the <I>Mischling:</I>
"what horrid Jewish energies live on close to bursting inside a baptized
Jew, only to be modulated in the Christian children of a Christian
mother..." (<I>Friends,</I> 232). He meets a Jewish goldsmith from
Cracow who had been long in America and whose "German was disturbed
by an English pronunciation and English expressions; his English
was so strong that his Yiddish was given a rest." And Jews who speak
differently look different. "He had long, curly hair, only occasionally
ran his fingers through it, very bright eyes, a gently curving nose,
hollows in his cheeks, a suit of American cut, a frayed shirt, falling
socks." (<I>D1914,</I> 263) Here is what the Eastern Jew becomes when he
attempts to transform himself: an individual without language, without
culture, marked by the physiognomy of the Jew.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No transformation will change him and there is an inevitability about
his future, even if he were to marry outside of the "race." In an earlier
letter of 3 June 1919 to Josef K&ouml;rner on K&ouml;rner's work on the
Romantics, Kafka wrote that "...Bettina gives the impression of having
been a distraught half-Jewish young man dressed in a woman's clothes and
I don't understand how she could have had that happy marriage and those
seven children. Should the children have led halfway normal lives, it
would have been a miracle" (<I>Friends,</I> 215). It is the child, the
offspring, who suffers from the sins of the parents, the "half-Jews"
who inherit the worst characteristics of both parents, especially their
mental instability.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka, in some of the most telling and poignant moments of his fictional
oeuvre, repeatedly adopted motifs and images that had served as critical
terms in the intricate debate about Jewish ritual slaughter, creating
scenes that invoke the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne of <I>shechita</I> in
ways that seem to affirm the anti-Semitic rhetoric while transforming
crucial roles and details of the ritual scenario to disclose a terrifying
awareness of the consequences entailed in doing so. Thus Kafka evokes
the debate about the <I>Mischling</I> in his 1917 tale "A Crossbreed,"
the tale of an animal, "half kitten, half lamb" (<I>S,</I> 426). He
places this debate within the problematic setting of the debate about
<I>shechita.</I> The <I>Mischling</I> in Kafka's tale bears the qualities
of both animals: the head and claws of the cat, the size and shape of the
lamb. But more importantly it incorporates the inherently contradictory
mindsets of both animals. It lies in the sun and purrs or it scampers on
the meadow. But "[i]t cannot mew and it loathes rats" (<I>S,</I> 426). It
is unique and yet when confronted with other cats and lambs, there is
"no scene of recognition. The animals [gaze] calmly at each other with
their animal eyes, and obviously [accept] their reciprocal existence as
a divine fact" (<I>S,</I> 426). The narrator's response is to see the
animal as a true extension of himself.

huge whiskers. Were they mine, or were they the animal's? Had this cat,

Perhaps the knife of the butcher would be a release for this animal; but

With its association to ritual slaughter and tuberculosis, this butcher's
knife certainly evokes again the "knife that stabs not only forward
but one that wheels around and stabs back as well," as he described
his tuberculosis in 1917 (<I>Felice,</I> 544). But it is also the
"knife of the butcher," with all the evocations of slaughter, disease,
and contradictory masculinity. The answer to the mixed breed lies in
butchery, but Kafka demands that the victim be seen as "human." Is the
mixed breed truly human? And why is the narrator suddenly placed in the
position of the ritual butcher?

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka presents in his diaries a "singular juridical procedure" in which
the male victim is executed in his cell by a male executioner with a
dagger (<I>D1914,</I> 162-63). In Kafka's literary work this scenario
of the male killing the male reflects his own reworking of the problem
of the feminization of the victim. No text is clearer in this than
"A Fratricide" . In this tale "Schmar, the murderer" stalks his
victim. "His weapon [is] half a bayonet and half a kitchen knife" that
he whets on his boot while waiting for his victim Wese. Schmar butchers
Wese. "And right into the throat and left into the throat and a third time
deep into the belly stabbed Schmar's knife" (<I>S,</I> 403). This ritual
reenactment of the stages of <I>shechita</I> and then of <I>Bedikah,</I>
the examination of the pleura, is heightened by Schmar's shriek. "The
bliss of murder! The relief, the soaring ecstasy from the shedding
of another's blood! Wese, old nightbird, friend, alehouse crony, you
are oozing away into the dark earth below the street. Why aren't you
simply a bladder of blood so that I could stamp on you and make you
vanish into nothingness..." (<I>S,</I> 403). His victim is not merely a
"bladder of blood" but a living, breathing individual whose murder is
ritualized. In the end the murderer is apprehended by the policeman and
order is restored, at least on the most superficial level of the tale.

This text echoes the final scene in <I>The Trial</I>  in which
K. is led out and executed.

The two of them laid K. down on the ground, propped him up against the
boulder, and settled his head upon it.  But in spite of the pains they
took and all the willingness K. showed, his posture remained contorted and
unnatural-looking...Then one of them opened his frock coat and out of a
sheath that hung from a belt girt round his waistcoat drew a long, thin,
double-edged butcher's knife, held it up, and tested the cutting edges
in the moonlight...[K.] raised his hands and spread out all his fingers.

But the hands of one of the partners were already at K.'s throat, while
the other thrust the knife deep into his heart and turned it twice. With
failing eyes K. could still see the two of them immediately before him,
cheek leaning against cheek, watching the final act. "Like a dog!" he
said; it was as if the shame of it must outlive him. (<I>T,</I> 227-29)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This scene evokes (and masks) a series of contemporary associations
around the notion of ritual murder and ritual practice. In the final
scene of <I>The Trial</I> K. is no longer completely convinced of his
own innocence. Has he, like Moritz Scharf, become convinced of his guilt
because of the power of the accusation? Is he in the end the best witness
against himself? The execution that results has more than a slight tinge
of both ritual slaughter and ritual execution. The body is prepared in a
parody of the <I>akedah,</I> the binding of Isaac, as it is in the ritual
preparation of the victim in the discourse of the blood libel. Kafka
evokes the suicide of Moritz Scharf at the close of Zweig's drama; in
<I>The Trial,</I> it is a butcher knife that the nameless executioners
carry: as one holds his throat (to prepare him for the blow), the other
stabs him in the heart. Here the entire vocabulary of the ritual murder as
suicide is reenacted. But, again, a Jewish butcher's knife cannot stab;
only a practitioner of the more "modern" and "humane" form of butchery,
the pig butchers of Kafka's nightmares, can stab the victim in the
heart. The very knife that Moritz accuses the <I>schochet</I> of having
used in his lying reconstitution of the ritual murder, the knife that he
uses to kill himself, was itself "proof" of the falsity of the charge of
ritual murder. Through the vehicle of Zweig's play the two acts--the act
that marks the accusation of the blood libel and labels the innocent Jew
as a murderer and the suicide of the self-hating Jew--can be linked. It
is the opening of the body, the stab into the heart, that reveals the
awful truth, that one will become what one is fated to

<B></B>

become, at
least in Kafka's world of words. K.'s last thought is that he is being
murdered like an unclean animal, a dog, rather than a ritually pure
one. It is the dog from Kafka's "Jackals and Arabs" whose uncleanness
is the reflection of the world's attitude toward the Jews. Kafka writes
in his <I>Diaries</I> not of sewing scissors, but of a "pork butcher's
broad knife that quickly and with mechanical regularity chops into me
from the side and cuts off very thin slices which fly off almost like
shavings because of the speed of the action" (<I>D1910,</I> 286-87). The
slaughter of the Jew using the ultimate non-Jewish knife--that of the
pig butcher--reduces Kafka, like the fantasy of the murdered victim in
Zweig's drama, to <I>treff</I> meat. And the shame of K.'s death, like
the shame of Moritz Scharf in the drama, outlives him. All of this, of
course, is lived out only within those texts over which Kafka believed
(or half-believed) that he had control. Kafka projects the role of the
victim, diseased and outcast, robbed of his integrity and manliness,
ritually murdered by the Christian world about him, into the faceless
characters of his fictions. They, in their modernist textual world, are
not persecuted because they are Jews--for there are no representations
of Jews in this world. The suppressed, ill, Jewish male, predestined to
die shamefully, dies over and over again in the works of these writers,
ritually butchered in the anti-Semite's fantasy of ritual murder. The
alternative, the tubercular Kafka's own refuge in Zionism and his fantasy
of going to Palestine to work as a waiter, remained unrealized as he
spun his fictions of ritual death. And Kafka wept.

What William Carlos Williams was prepared in 1929 to call "modernism"
had at its "base," he claimed, a commitment to "the reality of the
word."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 His point in calling attention to this reality was
above all to insist on the primacy of "language" over "ideas" and so
<I>The Embodi-ment of Knowledge</I> urges, for example, that to make
ourselves "modern" we take Shakespeare seriously as a writer and "reject"
him "as a thinker" (<I>EK,</I> 13). But this preference for language
over ideas involved more than a preference for poetry over philosophy; it
involved a commitment to what Williams calls "the materials of letters,"
which are "real" and which "supersede in themselves all ideas, facts,
movements which they may under other circumstances be asked to signify"
(<I>EK,</I> 17). Even "the spaces between the words" count as an element
of language, not because they signify something (since signification
is what is being superseded) or even because they have a diacritical
function--you might count the spaces "for measurement's sake," Williams
says, but you don't need to since they should "properly" "be considered
themselves words--of a sort" (<I>EK,</I> 141). The point here is that
when signification is eliminated as the criterion of the linguistic,
the spaces between words can be seen to be as much a part of the poem as
the words are; if what it means to be part of "language" is to be part
of the "materials" of the poem, then the white spaces on the page are
essentially part of those materials. Hence Williams's famous attention
to where those white spaces should be put and to how much of them there
should be; in what may constitute the ne plus ultra of the materialist
aesthetic in poetry, he is even reported to have <I>weighed</I> his
poems, as if once one

<B></B>

recognized that the modernity of the modern
poem consisted in its claim to be "itself" rather than to mean something
else, all the physical features of the poem (what it looked like, what
it sounded like, how heavy it was) became its defining characteristics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The manuscript he put together in 1928 and 1929 under the title <I>The
Embodiment of Knowledge</I> testifies in prose to the intensity of
his desire to make poems that would in fact count as objects rather
than signs--"words," "not symbols" (<I>EK,</I> 18). But the ambition
to make such poems is already visible in <I>Spring and All</I> ,
and especially in that collection's first poem, which is also its most
explicit response to the publication the year before of what Williams
would call in his <I>Autobiography</I> "the great catastrophe to our
letters," Eliot's <I>The Waste Land.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Williams identified
what he regarded as the failure of <I>The Waste Land</I> with what
he called "plagiarism," by which he meant not the copying of other
poems but the copying of "reality." <I>Spring and All</I> attacks the
"traditionalists of plagiarism" by replacing the copy of reality with
"reality itself," by making "the writing have reality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

It is significant, for example, that versions of the words "spring,"
"and," and "all" are distributed through the opening description of
"the waste," "brown with dried weeds, standing and fallen / patches of
standing water / the scattering of tall trees / All along the road"
(<I>SA,</I> 183). "Fallen," "tall," "all" and, elsewhere, "small"
and even "hospital" repeat the "reality" of "all," an effect that is
even more striking with the repetition of "standing" (which produces
both "and" and a version of "spring"), then "scattering," and later
"upstanding" and "spring" itself. This deployment of "-ing" takes up
quite literally the distinctive participles of <I>The Waste Land</I>'s
opening lines ("breeding," "mixing," "stirring") in an effort not only
to free the words of what Williams contemptuously called "the pleasing
wraiths of former masteries"
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 but also to assert the primacy
of the "materials" demanded by "modernism." Although "By the road to the
contagious hospital" is invariably praised for its precise description
of the landscape, there is an important sense in which what these lines
do above all is produce the presence on the page of "and," "all" and
"-ing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 "The thing that saves your work," Pound had written
Williams six years earlier, "is <I>opacity"</I>;
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 it is the
"opacity" of Williams's words that makes their "reality" <I>as</I> words
visible. The reproach to Eliot in <I>Spring and All</I> requires this
opacity in order that the "reality" of words like "spring" be made prior
to their "meaning."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Pound went on in the same letter to tell Williams that "Opacity
is NOT an American quality," when, in fact, as <I>Spring and All</I>
begins to suggest and as <I>The Embodiment of Know-ledge</I> would make
entirely clear, a materialist poetics was beginning to occupy in Williams
precisely the place not only of a modern but also of a distinctively
American aesthetic. The "first American poet" (Poe), Williams writes
in <I>Spring and All,</I> "had to be a man of great separation"
(<I>SA,</I> 111). In one sense, this is simply a remark about the
difficulty of producing literature in what Williams characterizes as the
"crudely repressive environment" of the United States in the nineteenth
century. But "separation" is a term of art for Williams; it designates
the position of the "independent" (<I>SA,</I> 121) painting or poem:
"It is not a matter of 'representation'...but of separate existence"
(<I>SA,</I> 117).
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Thus the qualities that Williams thinks of
as "typically American" in Poe--his "reality," his "completeness"--are
the very qualities that characterize for him the material or "modernist"
work of art: it "separates" (<I>SA,</I> 120), it has its own "reality,"
it is "complete" (<I>SA,</I> 121).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And this conjunction is not in Williams a merely contingent one,
by which I mean it is not merely the case that the qualities he
admires in poetry also happen to be qualities that he thinks of as
characteristically American as opposed, say, to characteristically French
or

<B></B>

English. Rather the criteria of poetic ambition in Williams
are indistinguishable from the conditions of national identity as he
and others understood them. "We have a great desire to be supremely
American," Calvin Coolidge had told the Annual Meeting of the American
Classical League in 1921.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Insofar as the point of the poem
in Williams is to be itself (rather than to represent some other thing),
and insofar as the self the poem must be is American, the poetic goal
is what Williams calls "the American thing." This is insisted upon by
the title page of <I>The Embodiment of Knowledge</I> which juxtaposes
the epigraphs "The book as a whole is a whole" and "My country, right
or wrong." The wholeness of the book is the mark of its existence as a
"separate," "complete," "independent" entity; it is the primacy of this
auton-omy that Williams means to emphasize when he calls the writing he
admires "pure" and dis-tinguishes it from writing which has compromised
its independence: "There is pure writing and writing which is made to be
the horse of any one who has a burden to carry" (<I>EK,</I> 117). The
commitment to country, "right or wrong," is produced according to
the same logic; by eliminating the appeal to any external criteria of
justification (i.e., rightness or wrongness), it makes one's identity
into one's justification. The material poetics of embodiment is matched
by the desire "to embody America" (<I>EK,</I> 47).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From this standpoint, Williams's modernism is inextricably connected not
exactly to American nationalism but, more precisely, to American nativism,
the conversion of national identity to racial identity. "Our country,"
as Lothrop Stoddard put it in <I>The Rising Tide of Color</I> ,
has been "invaded by hordes of immigrant Alpines and Mediterraneans, not
to mention Asiatic elements like Levantines and Jews."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The
efforts to "Americanize" these "hordes" that had played so large a role
in the national discourse of the Progressive Era were now thought to have
failed, indeed to have been doomed to failure right from the start, since
they ignored "the truth that the basic factor in human affairs is not
politics but race" (<I>RTC,</I> 5). So the new response to this invasion
was a series of attempts, culminating in the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924, to
limit immigration and, giving up the impossible task of turning aliens
into Americans, to foster among the native-born a proper appreciation
of their own Americanness. It is in this context that Coolidge told the
American Classical League, "We do not wish to be Greek, we do not wish to
be Roman. We have a great desire to be supremely American."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

And although this desire to affirm one's Americanness was often linked
to assertions of the superiority of so-called "Old Stock" Americans (the
full title of Stoddard's book is <I>The Rising Tide of Color Against White
World-Supremacy</I>), it was, in the wake of the passage of Johnson-Reed,
more characteristically associated with the commitment to identity <I>as
such,</I> a commitment that in Williams is associated with the demand for
"pure writing" and that is identified by him as a form of "pluralism"
(<I>EK,</I> 149).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Williams, this "pluralism" derives from the principle that since "every
individual, every place, every opportunity of thought is both favored
and limited by its emplacement in time and place," the "old cultures"
of Europe "can never, without our history, our blood or climate, our
time of flowering in history--can never be the same as we" (<I>EK,</I>
150). The point here is that "reality" is "plural" (<I>EK,</I> 150),
different for different cultures, and it is this assertion of difference
rather than any claim to superiority that lies at the heart of nativist
logic. Thus Gino Speranza in <I>Race or Nation</I>  denies that
"what is excellent...for one people is necessarily excellent...for a
totally different people." "What is important," he says, "is to see
and stress the fact that there is a difference."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 And
even Stoddard, who in 1920 had

<B></B>

produced detailed rankings of
racial quality, maintains in 1927 that "No theoretical questions of
'superiority' or 'inferiority' need be raised."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 This is the
meaning, after all, of "My country, right or wrong"; the attachment to
country, irrespective of rightness and wrongness, affirms the primacy
of identity over any other category of assessment. Hence, whether or
not Stoddard had personally given up his belief in white supremacy, he
had absolutely disarticulated it from his opposition to immigration:
"The really important point is that even though America (abstractly
considered) may not be nearly as good as we think it is, nevertheless it
is <I>ours</I>.... That is the meat of the matter, and when we discuss
immigration we had better stop theorizing about superiors and inferiors
and get down to the bedrock of <I>difference"</I> (<I>RFA,</I> 102).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What's striking here about Stoddard's effort to set aside his
ethnocentrism--his bracketing the question of whether America is really
as good as we think it is--is not that he in fact gets rid of the
ethnocentrism but that he recognizes its irrelevance to his nativism,
or rather, that he recognizes that the power of nativism depends upon
its pluralism, its transcendence of questions about superiority and
inferiority. The point of suspending the question of America's goodness
is to make clear the fact that our attachment to it is based only on our
identification with it; even if, Stoddard says, "it could be conclusively
shown that a certain stock was superior to us in some ways...we should
still refuse to receive it, on grounds of self-preservation" (<I>RFA,</I>
257-58). Where the assertion of racial superiority requires a primary
commitment to certain universal values (the ones according to which some
races are deemed superior and some inferior) and thus a merely secondary
commitment to whichever race happens to rank the highest, the denial of
the relevance of superiority and inferiority makes the race as such into
the cathected object. This is what it means for Americans to want to be
not supremely good or supremely powerful or supremely rich but "supremely
American." This is what it means for difference to be bedrock; it is only
for the pluralist that identity--the difference of oneself from others--is
absolutely crucial since only the pluralist, suspending the question of
better or worse, understands the different as merely different.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It's in this context not only that miscegenation, the breaking
down of difference, becomes the privileged sex crime of nativist
modernism
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 (and incest, the insistence on identity,
becomes its privileged form of sexual expression
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
) but
also that assimilation--the great desideratum of Progressive social
policy--becomes a threat both to those who would assimilate and to
those who would be assimilated. Nativist writers derided the ideal of
the "Melting-Pot" and the projects of "Americanization" developed to
produce it. No "environmental influence," wrote the "Cultural Pluralist"
Horace Kallen, can take "different races" and "remold them into an
indifferent sameness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Thus, according to Speranza, even a
"people" as "fine and loyal" as the Mexicans of the Southwest could only
remain "culturally and historically unadapted and ill at ease in the
body-politic of the republic" (<I>RN,</I> 64). The "lesson" of New Mexico
"to our 'Americanizers' and our theorists," Speranza thought, was that
"racial characteristics"--"especially those subtler qualities of mind
and character which profoundly differentiate the culture and the spirit
of one people from those of another"--"do not die out" (<I>RN,</I> 31).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course, Speranza and Kallen had different affective relations to
this lesson (Kallen hopefully anticipating a "national fellowship of
cultural diversities" [<I>CDUS,</I> 32], Speranza fearfully anticipating
the same thing), but the difference in affect presupposes the shared

<B></B>

commitment to the identity through time of "racial characteristics";
if New Mexico is a "tragic example" of the failure of assimilation, it is
also a triumphant tribute to the impos-sibility of assimilation. In New
Mexico, as Willa Cather put it in <I>Death Comes for the Arch-bishop</I>
, "The Mexicans were always Mexicans, the Indians were always
Indians."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Indeed, in the context of a novel explicitly
concerned with the possibility of transforming people--that is, after all,
what the missionary Father Latour has come to New Mexico <I>for--</I>the
persistence of race marks the point beyond which no transformation is
possible. Replacing Americanization with conversion, Cather will imagine
the Catholic Church as an institution committed to preserving rather than
obliterating Speranza's subtle differences "of mind and character." Set
in a moment before the problem of Americanization had even been conceived,
the novel depicts conversion as the solution to that problem.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is for this reason that the problem of identity dominates <I>Death
Comes for the Archbishop,</I> whether in the form of Father Vaillant's
ship-of-Theseus-like wagon, "repaired so often and so extensively that
long before he abandoned it there was none of the original structure
left" (<I>DCA,</I> 258), or in the thematically more central form of the
inability of the missionaries to get the Indians to give up "their own
beliefs" (<I>DCA,</I> 135). Or rather, it is for this reason that identity
in <I>Death Comes for the Archbishop</I> never actually registers as a
problem; after all, the trick of the ship of Theseus is that the gradual
replacement of even every piece doesn't really seem to raise an identity
problem until it is revealed that all the discarded pieces have been
used to assemble another ship--which one is the ship of Theseus?--and,
in Cather, the wagon has no competitors so it is left standing as an
example of how identity can be maintained in the face of the eventual
disappearance of all the materials which seemed to constitute it. And,
more importantly, Catholicism doesn't seem finally to be in competition
with what the Bishop approvingly describes as the Indians' "veneration
for [their] old customs" (<I>DCA,</I> 135). When a trader tells him, "he
might make good Catholics among the Indians, but he would never separate
them from their own beliefs" (<I>DCA,</I> 135), the point seems to be
that there is no necessary contradiction between being a good Catholic
and clinging to one's own beliefs. "The Mexicans were always Mexicans,
the Indians were always Indians" (<I>DCA,</I> 286); the point of Father
Latour's Catholicism seems to be that it encourages rather than disputes
this maintenance of identity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As we know, the Bishop's equanimity in the face of New Mexican cultural
differences was not shared by all observers. Speranza, admiring the
"native people" of New Mexico as a "people with old traditions and
customs, and a civilization of their own," nevertheless regarded them as
"a deeply tragic example" (<I>RN,</I> 64) of the impossibility of making
good American citizens out of aliens. The tragedy consists not in the
New Mexicans' refusal to accept American rule; on the contrary, not only
have they accepted it, they have been, by Speranza's own admission,
"splendidly loyal to the stars and stripes" which they have "stoutly
defended on every occasion" (<I>RN,</I> 64). The tragedy consists
rather in the inability of New Mexico's natives to adapt "culturally
and historically" to "American institutions"; despite their political
loyalty and precisely because of their veneration for "old traditions and
customs," they constitute "an unassimilated and culturally alien element"
"in our midst" (<I>RN,</I> 64).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Speranza separates politics from "culture" as Cather separates religion
from "beliefs"; the point in each case is to imagine a form of identity
immune to the transformations of Americanization

<B></B>

 or conversion. The
missionary Bishop's relation to his Indian guide Jacinto is in this
respect exemplary:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The Bishop seldom questioned Jacinto about his thoughts or beliefs. He
didn't think it polite and he believed it to be useless. There was no
way in which he could transfer his own memories of European civilization
into the Indian mind, and he was quite willing to believe that behind
Jacinto there was a long tradition, a story of experience, which no
language could translate to him. (<I>DCA,</I> 92)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is the representation of European civilization as existing in the
Bishop's memory and the representation of Indian tradition as Jacinto's
experience that elevates the impolite to the useless. For insofar as
European civilization is imagined as something one remembers instead
of as something one learns, it is clearly impossible to "transfer" it;
Jacinto might conceivably learn about European civilization but he will
never remember it. And insofar as the Indian's tradition is identified as
a story of experience, the Bishop can have, in principle, no access to
it; meanings may be translatable but experiences surely are not. This
is what it means for identity to be displayed in <I>Death Comes for
the Archbishop</I> as a problem that has been solved. If to belong to
a culture you must be able to encounter it in the form of memory, as a
tradition that is already yours, then no one can ever cease to belong to
his culture or begin to belong to some other culture. The assimilating
ambitions of, say, the Jew Louie Marsellus in Cather's earlier <I>The
Professor's House</I>  (or of Jimmy Gatz in <I>The Great Gatsby</I>
[1925] or Robert Cohn in <I>The Sun Also Rises</I> [1926]) are imagined
in <I>Death Comes for the Archbishop</I> as ontological impossibilities.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this respect, at least, <I>Death Comes for the Archbishop</I>
represents an advance over <I>The Professor's House.</I> Insofar as
struggles like the Professor's to defend his family are abandoned in
<I>Death Comes for the Archbishop,</I> that is only because they have
become unnecessary: there is no Rosamond St. Peter to try to rescue from
miscegenation in the later novel. In fact, as Cather herself somewhat
hyperbolically put it, <I>Death Comes for the Archbishop</I> is "a
story with no woman in it but the Virgin Mary."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Removing
temptation from the paths of the priesthood, Cather guarantees that, just
as the Mexicans are always Mexicans and the Indians always Indians, the
Europeans will always be Europeans.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Indeed she locates this
principle of cultural self-identity through celibacy in the "story" of
the Indian "experience" itself: the "life-force" of the "best" young men
in the "tribe" is said to be "sapped" in the service of "a ceremonial
fire" that is never "allowed to go out" (<I>DCA,</I> 122). Thus their
refusal to give up "their own beliefs" (<I>DCA,</I> 135) is killing the
Indians, and the fact that they are "dying out" (<I>DCA,</I> 122) is
the proof of their allegiance to "their own beliefs." This more-or-less
con-ventional representation of the vanishing race is here transformed
into the Indian's way of being "supremely" Indian.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But this commitment to the purified ontology of nativist identity finds
perhaps its most explicit form in Cather's internal thematization of
her own aesthetic. Amid the prologue's general discussion of  "ancestry"
and of the attributes of different nationalities ("the Germans classify,
but the French arrange" [<I>DCA,</I> 9]), a question is raised about the
future Bishop's "intelligence in matters of art" (<I>DCA,</I> 11), about
whether he has what the Cardinal calls "a discerning eye" (<I>DCA,</I>
13). The relevance to missionary work of a good eye for pictures is
not obvious to the Bishop's supporters but Cather's model for <I>Death
Comes for the Archbishop</I>

<B></B>

was at least partly pictorial, and
Father Latour is explicitly made to articulate for her the meaning of the
visual in the context of a narrative genre like the novel. The model was
the frescoes of Puvis de Chavannes, which had long inspired her, Cather
says, "to try something a little like that in prose; something without
accent..."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The point of eliminating accent is "to treat
all human experiences" as if they are of "about the same importance,"
to minimize the significance of what she calls the "situation" (<I>OW,</I>
9). This formal ambition seems to her to match the "mood" or "spirit"
in which the historical models for Latour and Vaillant seem actually to
have "accepted the accidents and hardships of a desert country"
(<I>OW,</I> 10). More concretely, it finds expression in what she
describes as
the dying Bishop's loss of "perspective in his memories" (<I>DCA,</I>
290). This disappearance of "calendared time" turns the narrativized
connection of past to present self into a "great picture," guaranteeing
continuity through time by reimagining it as continuity in space. Not
only are the achievements of "European civilization" understood as
one's "own memories," one's own memories are understood as continuing
experiences: "He sat in the middle of his own consciousness; none of
his former states of mind were lost or outgrown. They were all within
reach of his hand..." (<I>DCA,</I> 290).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"It is impossible for society to break with its past" (<I>ANE,</I>
49), Coolidge had told the clas-sicists; the "great picture" of the
Bishop's life makes this impossibility literal. The problem of securing
one's identity in the past is solved by making the past continually
present. Instead of "states of mind" succeeding each other in time, they
are laid out next to each other in space, as if on a canvas, and the
elimination of perspective guarantees that none will seem closer than any
other. Cather is often and plausibly regarded as an exponent of organic
unity but the commitment here to unity goes beyond the organic because it
denies the possibility of time and so of change; because nothing can be
"outgrown," nothing can grow. What this means at the level of plot is
that nothing leads to anything else. So, paradoxically, everything is
con-nected but anything can be disconnected, which is why, for example,
Cather thought that it would be easy to select parts of <I>Death Comes
for the Archbishop</I> to anthologize. Because no part of the narrative
was subordinated to any other part of the narrative, every part was
equally a part of the whole. But because every part was equally a part
of the whole, any part could be used as a whole.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The identity of the work of art is imagined here as the utopian form of
cultural identity, simultaneously determining the relation of the self
to the past (guaranteeing that Indians remain Indian) and the relation
of the self to the collective identity that past produces (guaranteeing,
in effect, that Indians be defined by their being Indians). Hence in
Williams's version of this "memoriam to identity," "My country, right or
wrong" is accompanied not only by "The book as a whole is a whole" but
also by a dedication "TO MY BOYS--Wishing them luck" (<I>EK,</I> 2). The
dedication makes explicit what a poem like <I>Spring and All</I>'s
"The pure products of America / go crazy" suggests,
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 that
the conception of identity built into the poetics of embodiment is
essentially genetic; what makes a poem a poem and not a piece of prose,
for example, is its "source" or "origin" (<I>SA,</I> 230). This is why
Williams regards it as "possible, even essential, that when poetry fails
it does not become prose but bad poetry" (<I>SA,</I> 230). It cannot
"become" prose because neither prose nor poetry can ever become anything
different from what they already are. If poetry, in order to be poetry,
must come "from the source from which poetry starts"; if, in other words,
the identity of the object is determined by its origin, then nothing
can ever be anything other than what it already is. To

<B></B>

treat prose
as bad poetry would be to collapse the difference between two different
things by treating them as if they were two more-or-less-good versions
of the same thing. Insisting instead that each has "a separate origin,"
Williams makes comparison between them odious by making the difference
between them "essential."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In <I>The Embodiment of Knowledge,</I> this principle, as we have already
seen, is generalized: "every individual, every place, every opportunity
of thought is both favored and limited by its emplacement in time and
place" (<I>EK,</I> 149). And "America is such a place.  The old cultures
<I>cannot,</I> can never, without our history, our blood or climate, our
time of flowering in his-tory--can never be the same as we" (<I>EK,</I>
150). Williams's name for this principle is "the pluralism of experience"
(<I>EK,</I> 149). Modernism and pluralism necessarily accompany each
other in Williams since the modernist commitment to the materiality of
the poem requires above all that the poem be itself, which is to say that
it locates the poem's value in its identity and so in its difference
from anything else. Just as in nativism the goal of the American is to
be American, in Williams's modernism the goal of the American poet is
to produce American poetry. In this respect, Williams's polemic against
Eliot and the "traditionalists of plagiarism" explicitly extends Poe's
attack on "Longfellow and Other Plagiarists." Their plagiarism consists in
a betrayal of originality--since they "copy" other poets--and a betrayal
of materiality--since they "copy" "reality"--both of which are understood
by Williams as betrayals of nationality, since by copying other poets
they attach themselves to a tradition that is essentially European,
and by copying reality they refuse the obligation to embodiment that
constitutes in nativism the very meaning of nationality. Poe, by contrast,
is "original" (<I>IAG,</I> 229) and "abstract" (<I>IAG,</I> 230). His
originality consists in the fact that for inspiration he goes not to
England but "back to the ground"; his abstraction consists in the fact
that what he does when he gets there is not copy it (no local color in
Poe) but "clear" it (<I>IAG,</I> 216). Getting rid of the "scenery" "in
order to let the real business of composition <I>show</I>" (<I>IAG,</I>
230), Poe "was American" (<I>IAG,</I> 226).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From this standpoint, what is striking about Williams's poetics is not the
materialism--its commitment to the idea that the poem's identity consists
in its material features--but the deployment of that materialism in the
service of what might be called its <I>identitarianism--</I>the commitment
to the idea that the success of the poem consists in the achievement
of its identity.

 Coolidge's characterization of Americans
as desiring "to be supremely American" had great success with audiences
beyond the classicists to whom he spoke in 1921: Speranza quotes it on the
first page of <I>Race or Nation</I> and Stoddard makes it the cornerstone
of a chapter on "The Will to National Unity" in <I>Re-Forging America.</I>
Both these books attempt to rescue what they call "American culture" not
simply by excluding aliens (the Congress and the Coolidge administration
had already, they thought, accomplished that in the Immigration Act of
1924) but by urging their readers to appreciate the past and present
glories of the American "heritage." "We are to-day evolving a whole
series of distinctively 'American' forms which truly express the national
spirit and which therefore possess creative feeling and beauty," Stoddard
wrote. "Thus culturally, as well as racially and spiritually, alienism
is being slowly but surely mastered" (<I>RFA,</I> 368).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nativism's racial pluralism makes one's difference from others essential;
nativism's cultural pluralism makes one's potential difference from
oneself equally essential. Culture here provides the technology
through which the fact that you are who you are can be doubled by the
responsibility to be who you are. Stoddard's criterion of beauty is thus
the true expression

<B></B>

of "national spirit," a criterion that Williams
makes more powerful by making formal; the poem will express America by
embodying it. Transforming tautology (the poem is itself) into imperative
(the poem must be itself), Williams produces for American poetry the
project of American nativism: what we are (Americans), is what we
must strive to be (American). The poem becomes what it is, in effect,
not by expressing something else but by accepting that it can only
express itself: "quite truly a work of art means nothing...but itself"
(<I>EK,</I> 120).

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the second edition of her <I>The American Rhythm</I> (1930; the first
was published in 1923), Mary Austin identifies what she describes as "the
growing interest of Americans in Amerind dancing" with the tendency toward
"abstraction of movement" in modern "esthetic danc-ing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

Abstraction here plays the role of "opacity" in Williams. Such abstraction
is easier in "the plastic arts," Austin thinks, because they "are not
burdened, as literature often is, with the necessity of conveying a
certain amount of information." It is this "burden" that Williams's
"pure writing" ("There is pure writing and writing which is made to be
the horse of any one who has a burden to carry") refuses to assume, and
it is striking in this context that the element of American verse that
Austin herself singles out as distinctively American is rhythm, which
she identifies, through its manifestations in the "human organism"
(<I>AR,</I> 4) as the "physical basis of poetry" (<I>AR,</I> 8). What
makes American poetry American, in other words, is not that it thematizes
American subjects but that it has the physical qualities of American
bodies. The modern poets Austin admires, resisting "Greek and Hebrew"
models, "derive their impulses" from "our own aboriginals" (<I>AR,</I>
46); in a paradigmatically nativist gesture, Amy Lowell and Carl
Sandburg are made the heirs of the Ojibway and the Chippewa.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Insofar as modernist abstraction could be understood to have
a non-European genealogy, however, it was more usually described as
African than as Amerindian. African sculpture, in particular, seemed to
have achieved a "plastic freedom" that went beyond anything accomp-lished
in the West. In the West, as Albert Barnes put it, sculpture was

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
at all times complicated by the motive of representation, so that the
arrangement of masses, of head, trunk and limbs, which would have made
the most effective plastic ensemble, was rarely found. Literature, in
other words, stood in the way of plastic form. With negro sculpture, the
literary motive was absent and the artist strove to distribute his masses
in accord with the requirements of a truly sculptural design.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Barnes and for other critics, it was the explicit three-dimensionality
of African sculpture that produced the effect of abstraction and hence
of objects that were to be understood on their own terms rather than as
imitations of other objects. Thus, in his influential anthology <I>The New
Negro</I>  (to which Barnes also contributed), Alain Locke praises
the "abstract decorative forms" of African art and quotes Roger Fry on
the "disconcerting vitality" of these forms, "the suggestion that they
make of being not mere echoes of actual figures, but of possessing an
inner life of their own."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 African sculpture, like modernist
poetry, insists on its own reality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Locke, however, the new prestige of African art, its influence on
Matisse, Picasso, Modigliani, etc., is a phenomenon complicated by the
inability thus far of Negro artists to

<B></B>

profit from it. In an essay
called "The Legacy of the Ancestral Arts," he deplores the fact that
Negro artists have lagged behind Europeans in discovering and asserting
the value of African art, and he attributes this failure to what he
calls "our timid and apologetic imitativeness and overburdening sense of
cultural indebtedness" (<I>NN,</I> 256). While avant-garde Europeans have
been mining African sculpture for "lesson[s] in simplicity and originality
of expression," the "timid conventionalism" of the Negro has left him in
thrall to "the most reactionary conventions in art" (<I>NN,</I> 262). It
is only, then, by following the lead of the Europeans and turning his
attention to Africa that the Negro can overcome his "imitativeness" and
"con-ventionalism." And while this might seem paradoxical--isn't Locke
just asking the Negro to stop imitating reactionary Europeans and to
start imitating progressive ones?--in fact, what Locke is imagining here
is a way out of imitation altogether. For the Negro's relation to African
sculpture will be significantly different from the European's relation
to it. Where the European "inherit[s]" it by "tradition," the Negro is
"bound to it by a sense of direct cultural kinship" (<I>NN,</I> 256). Thus
in taking up his ancestral legacy, the Negro is not only not imitating
the European, he is not imitating the African either; he is, in effect,
being himself. Indeed, from this standpoint, what's paradoxical is the
European's relation to African art: the "originality" that the European
finds in African art is something that he can only imitate; the origin
that the Negro finds there is his own.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this account, the modernism of the Negro is a function of his racial
identity,
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 or rather, of his ability to establish the right
relation to his racial identity. Like Coolidge's Americans desiring
to be "supremely American," the "New Negro's" aspiration to modernity
generates a project out of a tautology. If, in other words, the New
Negro was new insofar as he managed to be himself, the "Old Negro" was
old because he hadn't quite managed to be himself. He had been instead a
"myth," produced partly by whites and partly by the "protective social
mimicry" (<I>NN,</I> 3) that his "psychology of imitation" (NN, 4) had
deployed in response to whites. The project, then, of being oneself
is given content by the Negro's historical pro-pensity to imitation, a
propensity that has, as Zora Neale Hurston puts it, given rise to the
charge (repeated so often that it has "almost become a gospel") that
"the Negro is lacking in originality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Locke's response to this charge was, as we have already seen, to deny
the imitativeness at least of the New Negro: the project of being a New
Negro involves the refusal of imitation. For Hurston, however, such
a refusal is impossible. "The Negro, the world over, is famous as a
mimic" ("CNE," 59). Hurston's goal is not to deny the qualities that
have produced this fame, but instead to undo the opposition between
imitation and originality, which is to say that she is concerned to
assert the Negro's ability as a "mimic" while defending him from charges
that he lacks "originality" and that he "imitates from a feeling of
inferiority." The defense against the first charge is that all art is
"mimicry"; if it doesn't "reflect" or "suggest" "anything in nature or
human experience we turn away with a dull wonder in our hearts at why the
thing was done" ("CNE," 59). From this standpoint, the Negro's ability as
a mimic is just his ability as an artist and would seem to need no further
defense. But the second charge--"that the Negro imitates from a feeling
of inferiority"--suggests the insufficiency of the response that all
art is imitation of nature. For what the Negro is accused of imitating
here is not nature but "white civilization," so the Negro's claim to
originality has to be estab-lished here in the face of what even Hurston
acknowledges is a "group of Negroes who slavishly imitate" whites.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To accomplish this defense, Hurston invokes a set of class
distinctions. Locke, introducing <I>The New Negro,</I> had cited
"class differentiation" (<I>NN,</I> 6) as one of the factors rendering
"traditional lines of opinion" about the Negro "obsolete" (<I>NN,</I> 5);
it is now "unjust" and "ridiculous," he argued, "to regard and treat
the Negro <I>en masse"</I> (<I>NN,</I> 6). But this argument could
have at best a problematic relation to the major claim of <I>The New
Negro,</I> that "Negro life" was now "seizing upon its first chances for
group expression and self-determination" (<I>NN,</I> 7): how can it no
longer be right to regard the Negro <I>"en masse"</I> at the very moment
when "a great race-welding" has finally made Negro "group expression"
(<I>NN,</I> 7) possible? Earlier, in, say, Du Bois, the commitment to
class difference had been accom-panied by a certain skepticism about
racial solidarity, a suspicion that upper-class blacks had more in
common with upper-class whites than with lower-class blacks; how could
class difference be mobilized now to produce (rather than undermine) the
"group expression" of the New Negro?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston answers this question by describing the differences between
classes as dif-ferences in racial identification: "The average
Negro glories in his ways. The highly educated Negro the same. The
self-despisement lies in a middle class who scorns to do or be anything
Negro" ("CNE," 59). Racial authenticity becomes the principle of class
distinction. The Negro "'farthest down'" "likes his own things best";
it is this Negro whose mimicry counts as original, because it is not of
whites and because what it is of ("various animals," for example, i.e.,
nature) shows that he imitates "for the love of it, and not because he
wishes to be like the one imitated" ("CNE," 60). (The status of this
mimicry as autotelic imitation is what makes it "art.") The middle
class Negro, however, "wears drab clothing, sits through a boresome
church service..., holds beauty contests, and otherwise apes all the
mediocrities of the white brother" ("CNE," 59). Hurston's idea is not
that as Negroes rise in class they become less Negro; on the contrary,
it is only the imitation of whites that identifies the middle class as a
class. The racial betrayal is understood here to produce rather than to
reflect adherence to the middle class, a point that is hammered home by
the claim that the "truly cultured Negro" "glories," like the "average
Negro," in his "ways": you don't need to be "average" to be authentically
Negro but you do need to be inauthentically Negro (imitation white) to be
"middle class."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But, of course, the very success of this effort to key class identity
to racial identification produces a problem: what, exactly, are the
"highly educated" Negro's ways? Does the "highly educated" Negro, like the
"average" one, imitate nature? If he does, how is he different from the
"average?" And, if he doesn't, what guarantees his authenticity? It
is essential to Hurston that the higher class not be collapsed into
the bottom one (the "farthest down") because, if it were collapsed,
there could be no reason for thinking of racial identity as prior to
class identity. Any movement upward from the "farthest down" would, in
other words, auto-matically count as movement away from the race and
so, with racial identity and class identity exactly correlated, there
would be no place for racial autonomy. And it is racial autonomy that,
as we can now see, is the payoff for the New Negro's insistence on class
difference. Where race and class are <I>not</I> precisely correlated, race
achieves an identity of its own--this is why the breakup of the Negro
<I>"en masse"</I> is actually a necessary condition rather than, as it
first seemed, an unfortunate contradiction of the "great race-welding." It
seemed like a contradiction because it seemed to threaten the unity of
the "group"; in fact, however,

<B></B>

breaking up <I>class</I> unity, it
sets the stage for <I>race</I> unity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So the problem is, on the one hand, if there is to be a Negro there need
to be identifiably Negro "ways," and, on the other hand, if there is to
be a Negro there needs to be more than one class of Negroes.  And this
is a <I>problem</I> because if there's more than one class but there's
only one set of ways, it's difficult to see how the difference in class
can be kept from becoming a difference in racial authenticity or, to
put it the other way around, how the identity of race can be kept from
becoming a mere identity of class. Hurston's solution to this problem is
embodied in her own intellectual practice. Where the middle class Negro
rejects Negro "ways" with the "terrible rebuke," "'That's just like a
Nigger,'" the "truly cultured" Negro writer insists on writing "just
like a Nigger" ("CNE," 59). She cannot write as a "Nigger" because, in
order to guarantee the autonomy of the "Negro," not all "Negroes" can be
"Niggers." But she cannot write <I>like</I> a white since that would make
her inauthentically middle class. In order to write <I>as</I> a Negro
she must write "like" a "Nigger." This is what it means for Hurston
to believe that "The Negro's universal mimicry is not so much a thing
in itself as an evidence of something that permeates his entire self"
("CNE," 49). It is only mimicry that guarantees the Negro's existence
as a Negro; imitation is, in Hurston, the condition of racial identity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The point, then, of Hurston's discussion of the "truly cultured" is
not simply to legitimate black intellectuals by connecting them to
their racial base. For without the black intellectual there could be
no racial base. The function of the "truly cultured" in Hurston is
to escape the reduction of race to class implicit in the distinction
between "Niggers" and "imitation white folks." Imitating "Niggers," the
"truly cultured" make racial autonomy (the irreducibility of race to
class) possible and so make racial authenticity possible. The "Nigger"
is thus the criterion of authenticity, but the "truly cultured" provide
the technology of authenticity, since without the existence of the "truly
cultured" making themselves "just like" the "Nigger," there would be no
properly racial nigger at all--the "Nigger" would just be the "farthest
down" who, insofar as he improves himself socially and economically and
educationally, ceases to be "Nigger" and becomes "imitation white."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Everything here depends on the distinction between just being "Nigger" and
both being and imitating "Nigger," between being something and trying to
be the thing one is. In Williams's nativist poetics, as we have seen, this
effort of identity takes the form of a critique of representation where
representation seems essential (i.e., in language); in the constitution
of the "New Negro," it takes the form of an insistence on representation
where representation seems supererogatory (i.e., the representation of
one's own racial identity). (An analog for this would be someone who could
"pass" but who chooses not to and is therefore required to represent in
some way his or her otherwise invisible racial essence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
)
With respect to a poetics of "Negro" rather than "American" identity,
this demand for representation put an almost unbearable pressure on the
lyric poem. Thus, in his contri-bution to <I>The New Negro,</I> "The
Negro in American Literature," William Stanley Braithwaite finds himself
characterizing Paul Dunbar's dialect poems both as the "first authentic
lyric utterance" of "Negro life" (<I>NN,</I> 37) and as "the end of a
regime" rather than "the beginning of a tradition" (<I>NN,</I> 38), and
this despite the fact that after Dunbar, "many versifiers appeared--all
largely dominated by his successful dialect work." Dunbar's problem,
according to Braithwaite, is that he "expressed a folk temperament,
but not a race soul," a judgment that Braithwaite

<B></B>

himself leaves
unexplained but that we can gloss through Hurston: the dialect poem
seems only to be rather than both to be and to represent "Nigger." The
dialect poem thus represents a kind of trap, but one that was perhaps
not as easily avoidable as Braithwaite seems to have thought. For the new
poets whom Braithwaite praises (e.g., Fenton Johnson, Roscoe Jameson, Anne
Spencer, and especially Claude McKay) man-age to achieve what he calls a
"poetry that is racial in substance" only by making race their subject
while speaking in a voice that sounds what he calls "the universal note,
with the conscious background of the full heritage of English poetry"
(<I>NN,</I> 38). The alternative to "Nigger," in other words, seems to be
"imitation white."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This, at least, is how Langston Hughes, the most talented of the "new
Negro" poets, depicted the reaction against Dunbar in <I>Not Without
Laughter</I> , where the socially ambitious Tempy--who thinks
"colored people" should "dress like white people, talk like white people,
think like white people"--only tolerates Dunbar "on account of his fame"
and condemns him because he wrote "so much in dialect and so often of
the lower classes of colored people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Tempy is contrasted in
this book to her sister Harriet, a blues singer, and, of course, Hughes
would frequently cast himself as a blues poet in poems that would count
for him as equivalents of Dunbar's dialect poems. But his commitment
to a poetry of racial identity could be asserted also in poems whose
diction is that of the standard English to which Tempy aspires (like
"The Negro Speaks of Rivers"), and, in fact, <I>Not Without Laughter</I>
seems at least as committed to reconciling these two modes as it is to
distinguishing between them. For although Hughes is as interested as
Hurston in keying class differences between blacks to different ways of
being black (committed, in other words, to understanding class identity
as a relation to racial identity), he is, unlike Hurston, also committed
to what amounts to a kind of collaboration between the classes that will
"help the whole race" (<I>NWL,</I> 303).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thus the class difference embodied in the antagonism between the upwardly
mobile Tempy and the family she leaves behind is imagined by her sister
(as it might be by Hurston) as an effect of Tempy's attempt to imitate
whites--"when niggers get up in the world, they act just like white
folks" (<I>NWL,</I> 41)--but by Tempy herself as an attempt to escape
sub-servience to whites; where Harriet has been taught to admire Booker
T. Washington, Tempy dismisses him as a "white folks' nigger" (<I>NWL,</I>
245) and sings the praises of W. E. B. Du Bois instead. So, although
each class defines itself in opposition to the other, each class defines
itself also by its commitment to "the Negro," and the difference between
their definitions is elided in the figure of their nephew Sandy who
reads Washington <I>and</I> Du Bois: "'I guess they are both great men,'
he thought" (<I>NWL,</I> 245). Refusing to choose between the classes,
Sandy embodies both their hopes for "the black race," mediating without
dissolving the differences between Washington and Du Bois, the church
and the street. In effect, he transforms them into the components of a
racial identity that will not be reduced to a class position. And insofar
as <I>Not Without Laughter</I>'s commitment to Sandy expresses Hughes's
autobiograph-ical commitment to the meaning of his own career, the poet
becomes the vehicle for a racial identity that simultaneously defines
and transcends class identity: defines it because each class thinks of
itself as more truly black, transcends it because the blackness of each
class is revealed through Sandy to be only a part of the blackness of
"the whole race" (<I>NWL,</I> 303).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The story of Sandy's relation to his race is thus a variant of
Hurston's account of the role played by the "truly cultured," the Negro
intellectual, in the constitution of racial identity. It's

<B></B>

different
in that Sandy subsumes rather than simply repudiates the ambitions of
the middle class, but it's perhaps more powerfully the same in that
Sandy's aspiration to become one of the race's "great men" (<I>NWL,</I>
245) embodies Hurston's aspiration through class difference to racial
identity. And the fulfillment of this aspiration is demonstrated by Hughes
not in any-thing that actually happens to Sandy in the novel but in the
narrative voice that depicts the aspiration. Insofar as that narrative
voice is not itself "Nigger" (it's not dialect, for example), it runs
the risk of looking like imitation white. But insofar as that narrative
voice is concerned with <I>imitating</I> "Nigger," with portraying the
speech and actions of the "farthest down," it achieves the condition of
the "truly cultured," those whose racial identity consists not in simply
being but in representing "Nigger." In effect, then, the narrative voice
of the novel produces both the necessary discrepancy from and mimetic
relation to the "Nigger" that in Hurston characterizes the emergence of
a properly racial autonomy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this sense, the formal distinction between the representing and the
represented voices of the novel is at the same time a genealogy, a fact
that the novel insists upon in its com-mitment to Sandy's representation
of his family, and that it literalizes by making Sandy's father Jimboy
the kind of blues singer out of whom the blues poet will emerge. So the
story Sandy tells of his own genealogy--the story, in Locke's terms, of
the emergence of the "New Negro" out of the "Old"--will at the same time
be the means by which he establishes his own place in that genealogy, the
means by which he both affiliates himself with and distinguishes himself
from the "Nigger." Hurston's requirement that the "truly cultured" be
inextricably linked but not identical to the "farthest down" invents
a new position for the black intel-lectual, making him the linchpin to
racial identity by making him the heir to and thus the transmitter of a
racial "legacy." Which is to say that the representational strategies of
<I>Not Without Laughter,</I> strategies that find probably their greatest
racial achievement in Hurston's own <I>Their Eyes Were Watching God</I>
, produce the conditions in which a "primitive" or "folk" culture
can be transformed into a racial heritage.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another way to put this is to say that the great achievement of
African-American intel-lectuals in the Harlem Renaissance was to invent
a new answer to the long-standing question of the intellectual's relation
to the masses. In Marxist terms, of course, this could only be a question
about the class identification of intellectuals. Thus, in essentially
the same time-frame (1929-1935), Gramsci was articulating the distinction
between "traditional" and "organic" intellectuals as a distinction between
those intellectuals who understood them-selves to belong to "an autonomous
and independent social group," a group constituted with-out reference
to social class, and those intellectuals who understood themselves to
express a set of class interests and who therefore identified their
position as intellectuals with "active participation" in the "practical
life" of the class to which they belonged.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Hurston obviously
understood herself as belonging to the group about which she wrote but,
as Hazel Carby has remarked, most "African-American intellectuals were
generations removed from the 'folk' they tried to represent," and even
those who weren't had, in the process of becoming intellectuals, left
behind the world and the "people" described by Hurston and Hughes. Thus
Carby criticizes Hurston for identifying herself "both as an intellectual
and as a repre-sentative figure from the folk culture she reproduced
and made authentic in her work"; as Carby points out, "asserting that
she was both did not resolve the contradictions embedded in the social
meaning of each category."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But to put the point this way is insufficiently to acknowledge what is
original about writers like Hurston and Hughes: their transformation
of folk culture into racial heritage, their rewriting of the people
as the race, and so their deployment of racial identity as a category
through which class difference can be articulated and by which class
difference can be sub-sumed. It is race not class that connects the
African-American intellectual to the culture that, disconnected by the
intellectual from the "folk," is thereby reconnected to the race. Thus
the meaning of the genre to which texts like <I>Not Without Laughter</I>
and <I>Their Eyes Were Watching God</I> belong is nothing but the process
of racialization, the enactment of the rela-tion between narrator and
narrated as a genealogy through which an autonomous racial identity is
both authenticated and, in the process of authentication, created.

The idea that a text should be itself by ceasing to represent is in at
least one way clearly opposed to the idea that a race becomes itself only
by being represented: the first urges that representation be suspended,
the second insists that it be enforced. But this opposition is at most
provisional. For Williams's commitment to the "opacity" of the poem,
to letting what he called in his chapter on Poe "the real business
of composition <I>show"</I> (<I>IAG,</I> 230)--"WRITING," "Method,
punctuation, grammar--" (<I>IAG,</I> 227) instead of "sentiment or mood,"
"trees and Indians" (<I>IAG,</I> 229)--cannot in the end completely
repudiate the effort toward "like"-ness. Poe's "greatness," according to
Williams, "is that he turned his back and faced inland, to originality,
with the identical gesture of a Boone" (<I>IAG,</I> 226). What's striking
about this comparison is not the likeness of Poe to Boone (they aren't
alike; their gestures are "identical") but the fact that Boone's "genius"
consists in his ability to be "like an Indian" (<I>IAG,</I> 137). "To
Boone the Indian was his greatest master. Not for himself surely to be an
Indian, though they eagerly sought to adopt him into their tribes, but
the reverse: to be <I>himself</I> in a new world, Indianlike." Poetry,
in Williams, is, above all, "not 'like' anything" (<I>IAG,</I> 121) and
the difference between Poe's writing and Longfellow's or Cooper's or even
Hawthorne's is that it is not "lifelike copying" (<I>IAG,</I> 228). Thus
the "local," "American" quality of Poe's work consists not in the fact
that it represents American subjects (e.g., "the Indians, the forests,
the great natural beauty of the New World" [<I>IAG,</I> 227]) but in
the fact that it is American, it's made "of original fibre." In order
to be "Indianlike," the writer must make no likenesses of Indians, he
must devote himself to "WRITING." Thus Boone is most "Indianlike" when
he refuses to become an Indian (refuses, in effect, the ontological
assumptions of naturalization) and insists instead on being "himself"
(<I>IAG,</I> 137), and Poe is most "Indianlike" when he refuses to write
about Indians and insists instead on the "WRITING" itself. The effort
of imitation is redeemed when it's mobilized on behalf of identity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this respect, it would be--and has been--misleading to think of
American modernism as <I>fundamentally</I> concerned with questions of
representation, either with the critique of representation or with its
defense. What I have been suggesting instead is that the modernist
concern with representation be understood as instrumental to the
modernist commitment to identity, and in particular to the modernist
commitment to identity as understood in racial and/or national terms. In
the texts discussed here, both the critique of representation and
the

<B></B>

insistence on it are mobilized on behalf of identitarian
categories. When these categories are literary texts, as they are in
Williams, the terms in which those texts are conceived are, as I have
tried to show, indistinguishable from the terms of racial identity in
the 1920s. When these categories are explicitly racial, the promulgation
of racial identity is made literally indistinguishable from strategies
of literary narration.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My point here is not that many or most modernist writers were
racists. Indeed, insofar as racism is identified with a commitment
to the superiority of some racial groups to others, it is by no means
certain that any of the writers discussed here were racists. Certainly
one could find many more egregious examples. And my point isn't
exactly that American modernist writers were deeply committed to
racial <I>difference</I> (as opposed to racial superiority), although
this certainly is true, both of the writers discussed here and of
many others. My point rather is that American modernism consisted in
the set of ontological commitments that both derived from and made
sense of the commitment to racial difference. The commitment to the
ontology of racial identity was, in other words, internal to American
modernism; what American modernism <I>was</I> was the insistence on that
ontology.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Its characteristic formal ambitions--for things
to be themselves, for things to represent themselves--are irreducibly
identitarian, as are its instances of failed ambition. After all,
nothing can succeed in being itself unless it can also fail to be
itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 American modernism, then, is both the privileging
of identity and its transformation into a project. "We have a great
desire to be supremely American," Coolidge wrote. "American Negroes have
been more a race in name than in fact," Locke complained; what the "New
Negro" wants is to be really a Negro: "This deep feeling of race is at
present the mainspring of Negro life" (<I>NN,</I> 11). The contribution
of the poetics of identity is to make sense both of the objects of these
desires and of the fact that they can be desires.

The only mention I've found of patterns like the ones just
described is Albert Gelpi's in <I>A Coherent Splendor: The American
Poetic Renaissance, 1910-1950</I> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
1987). Gelpi points out that "'All' recurs four times in the poem,"
and that "it rhymes internally with 'fallen, tall, small'" , and
he convincingly cites various other forms of alliteration and assonance
that amount to a "network of verbal echoes and sound play." He is less
convincing, however, in his explanation of what these patterns do: the
use of "reiterated dental consonants," for example, is said to "suggest
the balked stasis of the scene" and repetition in general is said to
"integrate the individual details into the picture." The problem here
is the effort to instrumentalize the "materials," to put them to the
use of representation when it is their resistance to representation that
mattered to Williams. The point is not that the poem has no meaning but
that these elements are foregrounded and yet are not part of that meaning.

This is not to say that a materialist poetics as such
<I>need be</I> a nativist or even a nationalist poetics. Williams might,
for example, have conceived of American identity as the sort of thing
that could be achieved without in any sense also being inherited, and so
might have admitted the possibility that someone who wasn't American could
easily become American. He might, in other words, have been committed to
the account of poetic identity that I describe him as holding without
being committed to the account of national identity that I describe
him as also holding, in which case he would not have identified poetic
independence with national independence. In this sense, of course, the
fact that he held both these views is contingent. My point in beginning
this paragraph with the claim that the relation between the terms in
which Williams describes poetry and the terms in which he describes
Americans is not contingent is just to emphasize that the connection
between poetry and Americanism is anchored in a deeper connection between
poetry and national identity. Thus the relation between his terms of
description (for poetry and American identity) is neither coincidental
nor an expression of enthusiasm for attractively American qualities;
the fact that the terms he uses are the same expresses his commitment
to the idea that the conditions of identity in poetry are the same as
the conditions of identity in nationality.

can't destroy racial identity. With respect to race, miscegenation
too is an environmental influence, conferring upon people the "traits"
of different races but leaving the traits themselves untouched; hence,
"intermarriage...is not racial assimilation." This scenario preserves the
integrity of the race at the expense of the integrity of the body; thus
Faulkner's Joe Christmas, running from a lynch mob, incomprehensibly
ends up hiding "where he must have known he would be certainly run to
earth" and, carrying a loaded gun, fails to fire at the man who catches
and then kills him: driven alternately and incoherently by his "black
blood" and his "white blood," he is unable to "let his body save itself"
(Faulkner, <I>Light in August</I> [1932; New York: Vintage Books, 1985],

pre-modern insistence on materiality as a form of metaphysical inquiry
into the conditions of identity--what makes writing writing--and the
nativist insistence on materiality as a way of making identity primary,
and so of distinguishing between different identities--what makes American
writing American.  In the poetics under discussion here, identity is
always relational--the point, in other words, is not the artifactuality
of the poem but the Americanness of the artifact.

The idea that class identity can be deployed on behalf
of racial identity needs to be distinguished from the idea that class
identity can be understood as a kind of (or on the model of) racial
identity. The racialization of class is crucial to some forms of nativist
modernism--reading <I>The Great Gatsby</I> against the contemporary
but nonetheless pre-nativist <I>An American Tragedy</I> , one
can see the Fitzgerald as an essay in transforming class differences
into racial differences--but it is nonetheless importantly different
from the autonomization of race through the insistence on class under
discussion here. (For a discussion of racial identity in Fitzgerald,

In <I>The Signifying Monkey</I> (New York: Oxford University

of "a dialect-informed free indirect discourse" in <I>Their Eyes Were
Watching God</I>, characterizing it "as a mediating third term that
aspires to resolve the tension between standard English and black
vernacular" . To put the point this way is to think of Hurston as
feeling pressure to choose between the standard and the dialect (as if
between middle-class or "white" and lower-class or "Nigger") and resorting
to free indirect speech as "a third language" that, combining the dialect
with the standard, becomes the "ultimate sign of the dignity and strength
of the black voice" . If, however, the point in Hurston is not to
incorporate dialect into the standard but to make dialect the object of
(self-) representation, then the production of blackness would depend on
maintaining rather than resolving the tension between the two, since it
is only this tension that makes the project of representation and hence
the articulation of racial autonomy through class difference possible.

Postmodernism might, in this context, be described as the
rescue of the ontology of race by way of its critique. Postmodernism,
in other words, is committed to denying racial essentialism and
asserting instead that race is a social construct while at the same
time employing the notion of race as a social construct in ways that
are incoherent without recourse to racial essentialism. For discussion
of this phenomenon, see Walter Benn Michaels, "Race into Culture: A

thinking in which the difference of the self from others is redeployed
as the difference of the self from itself. Affective responses to this
internal difference may vary but, for the reason suggested in the text,
the assertion of its possibility cannot.

Already its name seems inassimilable. Before we have recovered from its
harsh and repulsive beginning ("Ausch") we are hit by its violent and
sarcastic end ("Witz"). The name itself already suggests the content
which, according to Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard, is "the experience
of language that brings speculative discourse to an end."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
Staunch Heideggerians, who seek to justify their master's inability
to confront or even name the Holocaust, have declared Auschwitz an
unthinkable realm shrouded in silence. Many others also believe that
silence serves the pious memory of the victims and shows a deferential
respect for the survivors. They declare Auschwitz to be an unintelligible
world, a strange universe that cannot and may not be explained. Hochuth
called it "Planet Auschwitz," a forlorn, damned, and desolate world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Banished from the world of description, analysis, and conclusion,
Auschwitz has become a myth in which the assumed universality of its
impact obscures the contingencies of its beginning. I use the word "myth"
here in the sense that Roland Barthes gave to it in his cele-brated essay
"Myth Today." Mythification, he argued, occurs when language empties a
narrative of its historical contingency to fill it with an unchanging
nature. "In passing from history to nature, myth acts economically: it
abolishes the complexity of human acts, it gives them the simplicity of
essences..." The result is an account of "bliss-ful clarity" in which
there are no contradictions because statements of fact are interpreted as
explanations. "Things appear to mean something by themselves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
Today few events can rival the mythic power of "Auschwitz." Unlike
"Hiroshima," which indeed happened in an unintelligible flash, the story
of the atrocity of "Auschwitz" can be depicted in sufficient detail to
arouse our fascination. It takes place on a carefully mapped stage that
holds our attention.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this essay I aim to recover some of the historical quality of
Auschwitz that, in the words of Barthes, consists in the memory <I>that
it once was made.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 It is characteristic of a mythic site
<I>that it has always been,</I> since its significance is assigned at
the beginning of Creation, to be redeemed at the end of History. Jewish
legend records that the site of Solomon's Temple marks not only the
foundation stone of the world, but also the place where the Messiah
will appear to Israel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Auschwitz was not preordained to
become the major site of the Holocaust. It actually acquired the role of
"major site" almost by accident, and even the very fact that it became
the site of mass murder resulted more from the failure to achieve one
goal than from the ambition to realize another. To reclaim the reality
of Auschwitz we must become attuned to the contradictions of the site,
not in order to find reasons to deny what happened, but to square the way
it happened with the ways of the world--a world in which the mysterious,
mythifiable forces of malevolence seem ludicrously irrelevant com-pared
to the profane, utterly intelligible, and very effective tendencies
towards insufficiency and expediency.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

As Jean-Claude Pressac has shown, the contingency of Auschwitz's evolution
even applies to its mythic core: the crematories.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 In this
essay I will concentrate on another contradiction of the site that
clashes with an essential aspect of the myth of Auschwitz: the idea
that it was quite literally "the end of the world," that is, a place far
away from everywhere else. My choice of subject goes back to a personal
experience. The first time I visited Auschwitz I was surprised that a
center of extermination was located side by side with a major town. I
had seen Lanzmann's film <I>Shoah</I> and remembered its depiction of
the forsaken isolation at the death camps of Treblinka and Sobibor, the
silence of the forests that surrounded them. It was the same seclusion
that I knew from the Dutch transit camp of Westerbork, where the weekly
trains set out upon their fatal journey eastward. Growing up in Holland,
I had always thought that the secret terminus of those trains ought to
have been as deserted as their point of departure. When, forty years
later, I followed the course of those trains, I arrived in a densely
populated area, with large towns, huge industries, and very little
camouflage. And all that development seemed more than fifty years old. I
began to investigate the archives in Poland and found evidence that
increased my confusion. Not only was the camp at Auschwitz built right
next to an existing town, but this very town had been designated as a
center of growth by the same men who had ordered the construction of
the camp. National Socialist Auschwitz was to become a district capital
and the site of massive industrial activity. It became clear that the
mythification of Auschwitz, to which I too had contributed, had blinded
me to a more complex reality in which seemingly opposing things such as
the design for utopia and the reality of dystopia existed alongside each
other.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the following pages I aim to situate this relationship in the German
mental map of Central Europe and the geography of the industrialized
region of Upper Silesia. In other words, I try to understand the place
of Auschwitz. I will show how that place became the focus of a Faustian
project to create a German paradise amidst Polish perdition. The
issue of "place," that is, the location of Auschwitz under the sky on
the planet earth, raises the issue of "space," that is, the relation
of the camp to the human body. Thus I will address the architecture
of Auschwitz. Architecture can be defined as the art that mediates,
through place and space, between the infinity of nature (sky and earth)
and the finitude of the body.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 I will explore some of the
historical links that connect the place of Auschwitz with space in
Auschwitz. Metaphorically speaking, I will try to describe the stage that
hosted one of the

<B></B>

most profound tragedies the human race has both
permitted and endured. My story ends when the curtain rises--that is,
when Himmler takes the decision to ship Jews to Auschwitz on 26 January
1942. This decision has been interpreted against the background of the
mythical clarity of the Wannsee Conference, held a few days earlier. I
believe that the issues that surrounded the first arrival of Jews in
Auschwitz are more complex than previously assumed, but I simply do
not have the space to treat this very difficult and important issue
responsibly. I will limit myself here to observing that by the early
summer of 1942 Auschwitz-Birkenau had become the site of mass-murder
by means of two primitive gas chambers in adapted peasant houses. A
year later the same camp contained four modern crematories with advanced
killing installations and fourteen incinerators with a total of forty-six
crucibles. For one million people these buildings proved, indeed, the
end of the world.

 Let us turn away from this unqualified evil, and look at the nexus of
 promise and perdition that undergirds the rise of Auschwitz. A good
 point of departure is a proposal for the <I>Stammlager</I> (main camp)
 at Auschwitz which was drawn up in the summer of 1942--that is, at
 the very time that the killing started (<A
 HREF="1.1pelt_fig01.html">fig. 1</A>). The plan, which is
 preserved in the archive of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, was
 drawn up by the architect Lothar Hartjenstein, who worked in the SS
 design office in Berlin. Not only does it show the concentration camp
 itself (usually designated as Auschwitz I), located to the left--with its
 barracks, roll-call place, hospital, prison, work shops, and auxiliary
 structures such as the <I>Kommandantur</I>, the offices of the Gestapo,
 the barracks for the SS men, and so on--but it also shows, to the right,
 a pleasant village for married SS men and their families, including a
 hotel, shops, sports facilities and, on the edge of the barbed-wire fence
 close to the prisoners' hospital, a primary school. The plan symbolizes
 but does not exhaust the juxtaposition of nightmare and dream. It does
 not show the enormous camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau (a mile west of the
 <I>Stammlager</I>), or the town of Auschwitz itself (a mile east of the
 SS village). The camp at Birkenau (also known as Auschwitz II) had,
 by the time Hartjenstein completed this drawing, already become the
 terminus of countless transports with Jews from all over Europe. And
 the town of Auschwitz was the reason why the Germans were there to
 start with, and why they had built that enormous camp at Birkenau.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Before we explore in more detail the situation in Auschwitz we must get
some sense of the mindset and ambitions of the SS men who killed in the
camp by day and dreamt in the village by night. The plan seems a perfect
evocation of the pride with which National Socialists regarded their
ability to recognize a Manichean polarity in the world. The resulting
black-and-white vision, suggested in the opposition of camp and village,
was perceived as an expression of intellectual clarity. Hence Dietrich
Klagges, in his seminal <I>Geschichtsunterricht als national-politische
Erziehung (History Instruction as National-Political Education</I>),
called for a historiography that emplotted history as the battle between
good (German) and evil (non-German, especially the Jew):

<BLOCKQUOTE>

It is dangerously one-sided to present youth only with leaders

who attempts at the same time to destroy the people and the land. They

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
History was thus a protracted battle between the forces of creation and
order and the powers of destruction and chaos. As we all know, this need
for an aesthetic and moral symmetry that balanced the one against the
other was nowhere so present as in the death camps. It was no accident
that the self-declared Nordic racial avant-garde, the men and women of
the SS, were the perpetrators of the Holocaust. This dialectic seems
to inform Hartjenstein's plan. The problem, however, is that the true
opposition exists only within the confines of the camp, in the actual
encounter between the well-groomed, well-dressed, racially superior SS
man and the filthy, rag-clad, racially inferior <I>Untermensch.</I> The
village is only a contingent impli-cation of the fact that even SS men
need to relax, eat, and sleep. It has, however, no direct bearing on
our understanding of the camp itself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is also another way to interpret the bisection of the plan. This
is not based on the commonplace of National Socialist racism, but on
the complex of German vocation. Since the second half of the nineteenth
century, Germans had been taught to believe that they, and they alone,
had been the <I>Kulturtr&auml;ger</I> in the land that they called
<I>das deutsche Osten,</I> which roughly coincided with the territory
of the present Republic of Poland. There was some justi-fication to
this claim. In the Middle Ages Germans had, in their notorious <I>Drang
nach Osten,</I> brought Western technological, economic, and political
know-how to the less developed Slavs. But they had done the same for
the natives of Cameroon at the turn of the century. What made the German
East different from Cameroon was the fact that Germany's civilizing role
in Africa had no effect on the German sense of identity, while German
involvement with Poland had shaped, according to prominent scholars,
the Germans' sense of themselves and their destiny. In 1934 the German
anthropologist Josef Nadler identified the German "Push to the East" as
the event that had shaped the Germans into a <I>Weltvolk,</I> involving
all the German tribes which had hitherto remained politically, culturally,
and to some degree linguistically independent. Hence "this space [the
East] became the cradle of the idea of a common German destiny, of a
common German language, of a common modern German education, of a united
German state...When the Germans cross the historic river boundary [between
West and East] a new German world epoch begins, ethnic, spiritual, and
poli-tical."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Three years later a popular history of this
"Push to the East" stated unequivocally:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The German settlement of the East proves to be the central pillar in the
total make-up of the German nation. Its history mirrors German history
in general with penetrating clarity. One must know it for a general

and, consequently, for a correct and profound appreciation of the German
character.

The central word here is settlement. The geopolitical doctrine of
<I>Lebensraum,</I> which formed the foundation of Germany's infatuation
with the East, implied that a nation did not gain anything by conquering
other nations in order to rule them for economic profit. The only
purpose of colonization was settlement. To a German in the 1930s <I>das

the ideology of settlement pervaded and vitalized the whole of German
history.

The man who was chiefly responsible for transforming the ideology of
resettlement into practical policy was <I>Reichsf&uuml;hrer-SS</I>
Heinrich Himmler (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig02.html">fig. 2</A>). This
responsibility dated from 7 October
1939, when Hitler had appointed Himmler as <I>Reichskommissar f&uuml;r
die Festigung deutschen Volkstums.</I> As such, he was responsible for
a massive program to evacuate hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans
who were scattered in the countries that had fallen within the Soviet
sphere of influence as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and
to resettle them in those parts of Poland that Germany had conquered
in September 1939 and was officially to annex on 26 October of that
year. Hitler had openly announced this program in his Reichstag speech
a day before Himmler's appointment when he called for the establishment
of a new ethnic order in the former Polish territories with an eye to
the "resettlement of nationalities in such a manner that the process
ultimately results in the obtaining of better dividing lines than is
the case at present."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 From the very beginning Himmler took
great pride in the new role that allowed him to become one of the master
builders of the New Europe. In an illustrated editorial of <I>Das Schwarze
Korps,</I> he reflected on the history and future of German settlement
in the East:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The great epochs of a nation find the ultimate expression of their inner
force and power in its works of culture. <I>One</I> truth stands at the
beginning and the end of each historic epoch: stones will speak when
the people have fallen silent. Great epochs already speak in stone to
the present.

Following this was a description of the German castles in the East,
"testimonies of soldier-like conquest and stubborn defense, as well
as symbols of high German culture." The most famous German castle, the
onetime headquarters of the Teutonic Order at Marienburg, was "a memorial
of the right to life and the will to persist of the whole German nation
in the East."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 For Himmler the castles had preserved the
German claim on the East throughout the more than five centuries between
the collapse of German power in the fifteenth century and the rise
of National Socialism in the present. Thus he urged Germans to create
con-ditions such that a decline of German power would never happen again.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the reasons that Hitler had chosen Himmler as
<I>Reichskommissar</I> was the fact that Himmler headed the ideal tool
to create this New Order: the SS. As a paramilitary force it had the
muscle to take responsibility for the necessary ethnic cleansing, and as

Socialist racial and ideological avant-garde, imbued
with ideas of "Blood and Soil," it could provide the human resources
for rebuilding the German East into a Nordic paradise. The ordinary SS
men were left in no doubt as to their role in these territories, which
was described in detail by an SS handbook. The conquest of Poland had
not brought an alien land under German control. On the contrary: it
restored to the German <I>Lebensraum</I> "what German diligence had
created in the course of time." A massive program of reconstruction
was to consolidate "what has been gained in battle and make it into
an eternally linked part of the Greater German space. <I>The German
East was for centuries the German people's space of destiny. It will
remain so for the following centuries."</I> This reconstruction had a
demographic dimension. "The ethnic mosaic of the East demands a new
arrangement, which is historically, morally, and ethically totally
justified. Connected with the <I>new ordering of space in the East</I>
is not only the <I>German-Polish problem</I> and the one caused by other
ethnic minorities, but also the <I>Solution to the Jewish Problem</I>
as such." The text went on to blame the Jews for all that was wrong in
Poland. The ghettos were the source of epidemics and the breeding ground
of a criminal class. "The cooperation of Jewry and Poles produced the
notorious 

<B></B>

<I>'Polish State of Affairs.'</I> What this Polish State
of Affairs amounted to has become clear to even the simplest German
soldier during the Polish Campaign. <I>In the regained areas in the East
a comprehensive reconstruction is taking place with the aim of overcoming
this Polish State of Affairs and replacing it with German order and German
culture, lifting up the suppressed and enslaved Germans from the East, and
finally linking this soil now and forever with the German nation."</I>
The handbook continued with the observation that the recon-struction
was a titanic enterprise that involved radical land reform in which
up to ten small, non-viable Polish farms would be combined to make
one prosperous German farm. "The land will have to be rebuilt from the
soil up, village by village. Whole villages will have to disappear when
fields with a low yield are reforested." Traditionally the German East
had suffered from the draining effect of the departure of farm laborers
for the industrial areas in the West. To give them a reason to stay it
was important to improve their condition, which included their housing:

<I>the architectural reconstruction of the towns</I> in the East, which
should once again become centers of a German will for reconstruction

We have some remarkable accounts that attest to Himmler's obsession
with this utopian project. One of them dates from early 1940, and was
written by Himmler's personal friend Hanns Johst. The latter travelled
with Himmler through Poland to inspect the progress of a program of
ethnic cleansing, and recorded how, repeatedly during their trip,

<BLOCKQUOTE>

the <I>Reichsf&uuml;hrer-SS</I> stopped the car, climbed over the striated
ditches, walked into the fields ploughed over by grenade shells, took
some dirt between his fingers, smelled it thoughtfully with inclined
head, crushed the crumbs of the field between his fingers, and then
looked over the vast, vast space which was full, full to the horizon,
with this good, fertile earth. Thus we stood like ancient farmers and we
smiled at each other with twinkling eyes. All of this was now German soil!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And the two men considered how the German settlers would soon change the
appearance of the land. Here trees and hedges would be planted. Shrubs
would grow, and weasels and hedgehogs, buzzards, and falcons would prevent
half of the harvest from perishing because of mice and vermin. All of
this was a great work of culture undertaken in awe of nature. And they
speculated on how these changes would "create protection from the wind,
increase dew, and stimulate the formation of clouds, force rain, and thus
push a more economically viable climate further toward the East." And,
referring to the great resettlement programs already underway, they
predicted that "under professional, rational, and scientific leadership,
the Balt, Galician, and Volhynian returnees will do miracles." And
Johst recorded how the two men stood in the fields, held conquered
soil in their hands, and gazed "over the whole of these indifferently
treated surfaces...populat[ing] them with villages surrounded by rustling
orchards..." Almost as a kind of afterthought he jotted down that "the
Western world cannot understand this pure pleasure derived from task
and work, from sweat and calluses. It thinks

Neither Himmler nor Johst bothered about the millions of gentile and
Jewish Poles who were to be deported from their farms, villages, and
towns to make space for the ethnic German arrivals. On their trip through
Poland Himmler and Johst visited Upper Silesia, in the eastern region
where towns like Auschwitz, Blachstadt, and Saybusch, interpreted by
Himmler as relics of German medieval colonization, had become centers of
ethnic cleansing and large-scale ecological, architectural, and urban
reconstruction. In a meeting in the government house of Upper Silesia,
located in the town of Kattowitz, Himmler and the military and civilian
authorities in the region talked openly about the policies to be enacted:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Johst was not the only one who would be astonished at the frankness
with which Himmler discussed in public the nature and impact of his
policies. In his notorious speech given to the SS leadership on 4 October
1943, Himmler discussed the Holocaust openly, congratulating himself and
his comrades for the fact that they had "carried out this heaviest of
our tasks in a spirit of love for our people. And our inward being, our
soul, our character has not suffered injury from it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 A year
earlier he had discussed with equal frankness the problem of labor in the
German East. Originally Himmler had intended to rely on the Reich Labor
Service for the labor to plant new forests, drain the marshes, build the
roads, prepare the settlements, and so on. But by 1942 the whole of the
Reich Labor Service had been mobilized for the war and ceased to be at
Himmler's disposal. Himmler could not wait until the Reich Labor Service
could furnish manpower for peacetime projects. Noting that the SS had

Himmler's use of the word "bricks" had both a metaphorical and literal
sense. The German concentration camps, which Himmler controlled as
<I>Reichsf&uuml;hrer-SS,</I> had acquired in the late 1930s a key role
in the German production of building materials. Originally intended as an
instrument of terror to stabilize the National Socialist regime, at first
the camps had not been used to furnish labor for productive work, as this
would have competed with German business and hindered the reduction of
high unemployment. By 1937, however, the camps were becoming superfluous
as political tools, for the regime was now firmly established and enjoyed
general approval. The number of inmates had dropped from 30,000 in early
1934 to 10,000, and a German future without concentration camps had
become conceivable. Yet Himmler did not want to close them. First, they
provided him a political power base; more important, he very clearly saw
the camps' economic potential in a situation of labor shortage. Already in
1936-37 Himmler began to consider the productive potential of possible
concentration camp sites. Dachau was to remain where it was, but the
new camps at Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen were established in places
that seemed optimal. Both were to be involved in the production of
bricks to service the local programs of urban reconstruction. With
an eye to providing the city of Weimar with brick, the SS decided to
locate Buchenwald on the wooded Ettersberg, five miles from the former
capital, a site chosen because it was adjacent to large loam and clay
deposits. Sachsenhausen was to serve Speer's building program in Berlin;
located twenty-five miles north of the city along the Hohenzollern
canal in the town of Oranienburg, it offered good possibilities
for bulk transport to the capital. Having decided on the location of
these two camps, in early 1938 Himmler founded the <I>Deutsche Erd und
Steinwerke</I> (<I>DESt,</I> or German Earth and Stone Works) to set
up and run the brickworks at Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen, and possibly
other places, as well as to open and exploit granite quarries. The
first brickyard to be opened was the one near Buchenwald, planned to
have a capacity of 7 million bricks per year. With a subsidy of RM
9.5 million given by Speer, <I>DESt</I> also began construction of
a brickyard in Oranienburg, intended to be the largest brickyard in
the world with an annual production of 150 million bricks, ten times
as many as the largest existing brickyards could yield. The same year
<I>DESt</I> bought a defunct brickyard near Hamburg and began to plan a
40-million-brick-a-year production facility to supply the reconstruction
of Hamburg. A new concentration camp, Neuengamme, was built adjacent to
the factory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To supply Speer with granite, <I>DESt</I> began to operate granite
quarries in 1938. The first two to be acquired were a quarry near
Flossenb&uuml;rg, close to the Czech border in the Upper Palatinate, and a
famous granite quarry adjacent to the Upper Austrian town of Mauthausen,
near Linz. Before 1914 the quarries of Mauthausen had supplied most
of the granite used in Vienna, Budapest, and the smaller cities of the
former Austrian-Hungarian empire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 The quality of the stone
and the town's location along a major transport corridor had contributed
to its fame. With the dissolution of the empire, however, Mauthausen had
fallen on hard times. Demand for granite had decreased, even as the use
of concrete increased. For the town of Mauthausen the <I>Anschluss</I>
of 1938 was a welcome event; in Hitler's Germany, granite was again the
premier building material for public buildings. A few days after the


<B></B>

<I>Anschluss,</I> Himmler and his aide Oswald Pohl, who controlled
the administration of the SS and its companies, toured the Mauthausen
area with an eye to establishing a <I>DESt</I> branch to exploit
its riches. After some negotiation, the city leased two quarries to
<I>DESt;</I> adjacent to each, the SS began to build a camp. The same
pattern was applied in Flossenb&uuml;rg, and to <I>DESt</I> operations
in Silesia and the Alsace. Quarries were identified and assessed in
relation to transport and markets, then leased or purchased, and finally
complemented by new camps to provide labor: in Silesia the quarries,
which Speer had designated as the main suppliers of Berlin, were to
be serviced by Gross-Rosen and in the Alsace, by Natzweiler. In some
cases the pattern was reversed. The concentration camp in Auschwitz, for
example, was established adjacent to the formerly Polish town because
of demographic and political reasons. But within a few months of its
establishment, <I>DESt</I> acquired a gravel and sand production facility
close to the camp.

More important than the production of gravel was Auschwitz's function
as a labor reserve to facilitate German reconstruction of the eastern
part of Upper Silesia. For various eco-nomic and geopolitical reasons,
Auschwitz had attracted the attention of the men charged by Himmler
with the long-range planning of the German East. As early as July 1940
Himmler had been convinced by <I>Professor Doktor</I> Konrad Meyer that
a speedy Germanization of the area around Auschwitz was of the highest
priority.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Himmler's Chief of Staff, Ulrich Greifelt,
concurred. "It is very urgent at this point to create a purely ethnic
German corner," he wrote, also suggesting several communities as potential
places of settlement by ethnic Germans, among them the town of Auschwitz
and the nearby village of Birkenau (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig03.html">fig. 3</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 On Thursday,
10 October 1940 a meeting held in Kattowitz and attended by the SS and
Upper Silesia's civil servants decided that part of the new province was
going to be used for massive settlement by ethnic Germans. A map created
for this meeting designated the area around Auschwitz as <I>Siedlungszone
1a</I> (Zone of Settlement 1a) (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig04.html">fig. 4</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 This designation
implied that the given area offered few impediments to the envisioned
physical and social trans-formation. A master plan for the future of
the region was to be completed by the spring of 1941.

Planning started quickly indeed. The Germans set to work on both regional
and municipal designs. In December 1940 the architect Dr. Hans Stosberg
accepted the task of creating a master plan for the reconstruction
and enlargement of Auschwitz. After two months of work he produced a
preliminary design (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig05.html">fig. 5</A>), accompanied
by an explanatory document
that is printed as an appendix to this essay.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 It noted
that Auschwitz was located at the center of three major industrial
areas, and that it offered good building ground and a bountiful supply
of water. This was important because of the Upper Silesian coal mines
located on the watershed between the Oder and the Vistula; their coal,
being of relatively low grade, was intended to serve as raw material for
chemical industries, but the unavailability of water effectively prevented
the location of such plants adjacent to the mines. Auschwitz, because of
the confluence of three rivers, was the closest site with the requisite
water supply. Stosberg's draft assumes a city of first 35,500, and later
47,000 inhabitants. The largest single employer would be the chemical
industry, an IG Farben plant, to make artificial rubber from coal, a
complex that would employ 3,000 people who were to live in their own
quarter. Eventually, both the plant and a small part of the IG Farben
neighborhood were built. The draft continues with the railways, which
would employ 1,500 people. These workers and their

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 93]</B>

families
would live in a quarter close to the station. The document also mentions
"SS and ancillary businesses (but not the barracks and the concentration
camp inmates)." This would involve 1,500 workplaces.

Stosberg's design was faced with a number of vexing limitations. Space was
tight. It was clear that the industry was to go to the town's east. To
the south there was a large floodplain unsuitable for anything but
recreational use; to the north the same condition applied; and to the
west the town was surrounded on three sides by the concentration camp's
<I>Interes-sengebiet</I> (Zone of Interests), which was forbidden
territory. In his initial report of December 1940, Stosberg had
thought it possible to harmonize the needs of the concentration camp
for security with the needs of the town for breathing space. But as he
continued to design and the camp continued to expand, relations between
Stosberg and the SS soured. Stosberg and SS architect Hartjenstein
developed mutually exclusive plans for the quarter located between the
railway lines with the station, the <I>Stammlager</I> in Zasole, and
the river Sola (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig06.html">fig. 6</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Stosberg's design for the civic
peninsula that carved its way from the river bank into the camp's Zone
of Interests was meant to provide citizens with a dignified if not
festive access to the trains by means of a great boulevard that was to
be the spine of New Town West, a densely built-up neighborhood for 7,500
people. Hartjenstein's proposal for the SS settle-ment engulfed some fifty
percent of Stosberg's neighborhood, reducing it to what Stosberg termed
a "torso." Furthermore, the vernacular character of the SS Garden City
with its cozy one-family homesteads set in large gardens contradicted
the strongly urban character of Stosberg's plan, a note the latter
considered appropriate for the central urban axis connecting the city's
major elements: the station to the medieval <I>Ring</I> and, beyond that,
the new plaza <I>(Parteiforum)</I> that was to embody Auschwitz's dignity
as capital of a new county (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig07.html">fig. 7</A>),
the eastern neighborhood, and the
immense IG Farben plant that was to provide the economic justification
for all these improvements.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There were really two solutions to the problem: either the SS settlement
had to conform to the urban density of Stosberg's plan, providing an
appropriate southern flank to the avenue mentioned above, or the SS had
to move the Garden City to another site within their Zone of Interests,
allowing for a new border between the city and the camp, one closer
to the <I>Stammlager.</I> Stosberg was supported by the provincial
bureaucracy. But the camp also had strong supporters, not the least of
whom was Himmler. The two parties argued for almost a year, pushing the
border between the city and the camp up and down between the proposed
avenue and the perimeter of the camp. Ultimately the issue was settled in
favor of the city; in a large meeting held in Auschwitz on Wednesday, 23
September, the chief of the S<I>S-Wirtschafts Verwaltungshauptamt</I>
(<I>WVHA,</I> or  SS Economic and Administrative Department),
<I>SS-Obergruppenf&uuml;hrer</I> (General) Oswald Pohl, withdrew
Hartjenstein's proposal and an-nounced that he had ordered the
architect to prepare a master plan that moved the settlement to the
south side of the <I>Stammlager,</I> firmly within the camp's Zone of
Interests.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 None of these difficulties was anticipated in
Stosberg's 1941 report. There he still assumed that the camp's development
would not obstruct the "organic" development of the town. In view of
the later use of Auschwitz-Birkenau as an extermination plant, it is
ironic that Stosberg identified that area (between the station and the
Vistula) as a good site to establish "SS industrial installations."

Stosberg continued to work on his plan, of which important relics
remain. One is a double-folded New Year's greeting card that he sent in
December 1941. On the front he wished his

market (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig08.html">fig. 8</A>), while the back contained
a four-sentence meditation
placing Auschwitz firmly within the National Socialist Myth of the
German East:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In the year 1241 Silesian knights, acting as saviors of the Reich, warded
off the Mongolian assault at Wahlstatt. In that same century Auschwitz
was founded as a German town. After six hundred years the
<I>F&uuml;hrer</I> Adolf Hitler is turning the Bolshevik menace away
from Europe. This
year, 1941, the construction of a new German city and the reconstruction
of the old Silesian market have been planned and initiated.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As we will see below, the suggested relation between Hitler's attack on
the Soviet Union and the reconstruction of Auschwitz did not exist only
in history. It also applied to space.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The realization of Stosberg's proposal depended on the availability
of labor. Himmler was to oblige him. On 1 March 1941, on his way to
a gathering of Bukowinian Germans who were waiting in camps in and
around Breslau for their final resettlement in the region just south of
Auschwitz, Himmler visited Auschwitz and ordered the construction of
a large prisoner-of-war camp in Birkenau. A few weeks earlier he had
been informed of Hitler's decision to attack the Soviet Union in the
spring, and Himmler had immediately recognized that the expected mass
of Soviet prisoners of war would provide him with the labor force he
needed to continue the reconstruction of the German East. As the area
around Auschwitz had been assigned top priority in this project, it made
sense for the region to receive the bulk of prisoners of war who would be
transferred into SS custody by the Army. According to the commandant of
the concentration camp, Rudolf H&ouml;ss, the various provincial officials
present at Himmler's visit were not very happy at the prospect of 100,000
Soviet prisoners two

kilometers from Auschwitz, and raised
their objections with the <I>Reichsf&uuml;hrer-SS.</I> "Himmler just
smiled," H&ouml;ss recalled in 1946, "and disposed of their objections
saying, 'Gentlemen, this project will be completed; my reasons are more
important than your objections!'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Even purely technical
objections were not taken seriously. The wetlands of Birkenau were of
crucial significance for the province's future. Most of Upper Silesia's
population lived in a densely settled industrial belt occupying a
plateau that formed, as we saw before, a watershed between the rivers
Oder and Vistula; as a result the region lacked water, a deficiency that
potentially limited future develop-ment. To redress this, the province
had designated the lowland between the Vistula and the Sola as a major
water reservoir for the industrial heart of Upper Silesia.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
Provincial bureaucrats now argued that the sewage of 100,000 people was
going to make it impossible to maintain the water quality, but Himmler
impatiently dismissed their concerns: water management was merely a
matter of technology to be solved by the experts (H&ouml;ss, 285).

the bloody rides of [the Hun] Attila and [the Mongol] Genghis Khan,"
explained the text on the left. "On ugly little horses, almost grown

left only wilderness, murder, fire, and destruction." And, turning to the

Convinced that the war against the Soviet Union was a crusade to protect

The new attitude also affected the treatment of Soviet prisoners
of war. In the notorious "Guidelines for the Treatment of Political
Commissars," better known as the "Commissar Order," which was issued on 6
June 1941, the German army was forbidden to grant prisoner-of-war status
to captured Soviet political commissars. Instead these "bearers of the
Judeo-Bolshevik world view" were to be shot after identification. The
army's acceptance of the Commissar Order opened the road for more
violations of international law. On 28 June 1941, the general in charge of
the Prisoner of War Department of the German Army High Command concluded
a draft agreement with the SS that allowed SS <I>Einsatzkommandos</I>
(Special Units) to enter prisoner-of-war camps to select and execute
already imprisoned commissars, communist functionaries of all ranks,
agitators and fanatical communists, and "all Jews."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 This
agreement came into force on 17 July. The army justified it by noting
that "the special situation of the Eastern campaign...demands special
measures." Military consi-derations were now going to give way to the
"political objective," which was to "protect the German nation from

Less dramatic, but ultimately more deadly, was the German unwillingness
to provide the remaining prisoners with sufficient accommodation. Three
major international conventions, the First Hague Convention , the
Second Hague Convention , and the Geneva Convention  had
established minimal standards of prisoner maintenance. Yet because the
Soviet Union had not been a signatory to the last convention, which had
merely clarified certain points of the earlier ones that were already
ruling as law on the basis of custom, the German high command was led
to the criminal assumption that none of the conventions applied. I will
discuss some of their provisions later in more detail. Suffice it note
that already in the early summer of 1941 catastrophic conditions began
to occur in the camps holding Soviet prisoners of war. "Camps" is in
fact a euphemism: a camp consisted of fields surrounded by barbed-wire
fences. The inmates were to build themselves shelters, but no materials
were provided. One of them, camp Lamsdorf in Silesia, reportedly held
some 200,000 prisoners:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The camp was simply a square area of land where most of the Russians
huddled together in huts made from the earth which they had built
themselves. Food distribution to the camp was irregular and totally
inadequate. The prisoners cooked for themselves in fire pits in the ground
(H&ouml;ss, 132).

Unwilling and unable to deal with the problem, the army negotiated a
transfer of Soviet pri-soners with Himmler.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 As we have
seen, on Saturday, 1 March 1941 Himmler had desig-nated Birkenau as the
site for a large camp. Yet for months nothing had been done toward its
construction, and no funds had been allocated. When the Soviet prisoners
arrived in early October in Birkenau, there was no camp available. Yet
the Germans were happy to supply the designs. In fact, they had created a
new architectural office headed by Karl Bischoff (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig09.html">fig. 9</A>). Bischoff had
begun work in early October 1941, and a first master plan was drawn by
his assistant, the thirty-three-year-old Bauhaus graduate Fritz Ertl,
on 7 October (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig10.html">fig. 10</A>). The plan proposed
a two-part camp for a total
of 97,000 inmates. The smaller part, <I>Bauabschnitt I</I> (Building
Sector I, abbreviated as <I>BA I</I>), which could hold a little under
17,000 inmates,

<B></B>

was a quarantine camp, a reasonable provision
given the bad physical condition of the arriving prisoners; the larger
part, <I>Bauabschnitt II</I> (Building Sector II, abbreviated as <I>BA
II</I>), designed to hold a little over 80,000 inmates, was the main
camp. They were separated by a "neutral zone" (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig11.html">fig. 11</A>). In a meeting
held in mid-October the plan was modified, creating a second version that
became the basis for a fourteen-page document that explains the design
in detail.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 The most important change was an increase in
the camp's capacity from 97,000 to 125,000 inmates. One drawing, which
shows a section of the standard hut to be built, leaves no doubt that the
increase was achieved by cramming more inmates into the same space. The
original drawing, signed by Bischoff on 8 October, listed a capacity of
550 men (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig12.html">fig. 12</A>). A week later Bischoff
had crossed out the "550" and
replaced it with "744".
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Nothing else had changed. Perhaps
Bischoff's decision was inspired by the arrival of the first prisoners
of war. "They arrived in Auschwitz after long weeks of marching with
very little food supplied to them on route. During the breaks in their
march they were simply led into nearby fields and told to 'graze' like
cattle on everything that was edible." Having arrived, "they walked
around aimlessly in a daze, or they crawled anywhere into a protected
area to swallow something edible that they found. They tried to force
it down their throats, or they simply, quietly, found a place to die"
(H&ouml;ss, 133). Fear of anarchy also led to another modification: the
main camp <I>(BA II)</I> was now to be subdivided into twelve smaller,
self-sufficient "camps"--an arrangement that was to persist throughout all
subsequent modifications (<I>BA IIa, b, c, d, e</I> and <I>f</I>). Yet
another modification was the inclusion of a rail spur to connect the
camp directly to the railway junction a mile to the east. In the future
prisoners were to arrive by train (<A

Working in a hurry, Bischoff had been drawing plans without informing
Berlin and with no sense of available funding. On 25 October, SS
headquarters telegraphed Bischoff to remind him that a budget could
not be approved unless he submitted the plans according to the usual
procedures.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 A package was hastily created. The total budget
was to be RM 8.9 million, which compares in 1993 to $36 million. In an
accompanying letter Bischoff wrote that <I>BA I</I> was already under
construction and would be finished in fourteen days. It was not the last
time that Bischoff turned out to be far too optimistic about the amount of
con-struction that could be achieved in Auschwitz. The Soviet prisoners,
as H&ouml;ss observed, were "perfectly willing to work, but unable to
accomplish anything because of their weakened condition...The entire
body organism was finished and could no longer function" (H&ouml;ss,
132f.). None of this affected calculations back in Berlin: the SS head
office reduced the total cost from RM 8.9 million to RM 7.7 million. The
standard rate for labor costs did not apply because the prisoners were
to build the camp themselves, and for free.

Closer study of the actual designs reveals how the Nazi identification
of the Soviet soldier as an <I>Untermensch</I> was translated into
architectural terms. The prisoners were to be housed in 174 barracks. Each
barrack was to measure 116 ft. by 36 ft., that is, 4,176 sq. ft. Total
volume was 13,257 cu. ft. The barrack was subdivided into 62 bays, each
of 43 sq. ft., and each bay had three "roosts" (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig14.html">fig. 14</A>). Originally
a roost was supposed to hold three prisoners, but, as we have seen,
in mid-October the capacity had been increased to four. To sleep, sit,
and keep his belongings, each prisoner was now provided with "private"
space that amounted to 11 sq. ft., the dimensions of a large coffin, or
an average volume of 53 cu. ft., the size of a shallow grave. The cost
per barrack was to be RM 12,400, that is, RM 16.67 per inmate.

Inmates were being deprived of the minimum space needed to exist. Tadeusz
Borowski, who was interned in Auschwitz in 1943 as prisoner number
119,198, described the condi-tions in the camp as more horrendous than
medieval fantasies about hell:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
If the barrack walls were suddenly to fall away, many thousands of people,
packed together, squeezed tightly in their bunks, would remain suspended
in mid-air. Such a sight would be more gruesome than medieval paintings
of the Last Judgment. For one of the ugliest sights to a man is that of
another man sleeping on his tiny portion of the bunk, of the space which
he must occupy, because he has a body--a body that has been exploited to
the utmost: with a number tattooed on it to save on dog tags, with just
enough sleep at night to work during the day, and just enough time to
eat. And just enough food so it will not die wastefully. As for actual
living there is only one place for it--a piece of bunk. The rest belongs
to the camp, the Fatherland.

Borowski's comparison with medieval visions of hell was apt. Yet if there
is a certain justification to the sufferings of medieval sinners who
have been judged by God, nothing can justify the treatment of inmates at
Birkenau, arbitrarily selected by an SS doctor. In the medieval paintings
and reliefs, guilt and retribution are still related as cause and effect;
in Birkenau it is the other way around. In a Kafkaesque inversion of
crime and punishment, the camps first penalized people and then made
them guilty. Anyone forced to live in the barracks could only become
an object lesson for a photo-essay exploring the life and appearance of
the <I>Untermensch.</I>

The extraordinarily small space allocated to each inmate and the high
mortality rate within the huts meant that inmates would often die during
the night, and that those who were still alive had no way to remove the
corpses. Primo Levi, who experienced this in January 1945, reflected on
the implications of this forced intimacy between the living and the dead:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
 It is man who kills, man who creates or suffers injustice; it
is no longer man who, having lost all restraint, shares his bed with
a corpse. Whoever waits for his neighbour to die in order to take his
piece of bread is, albeit guiltless, further from the model of thinking
man than the most primitive pygmy or the most vicious sadist.

oppressed not only by compassion but by a confused restraint, which sealed

The design, which postulated a living space so tiny that it was fit
for a coffin and not a human being, showed a blatant disregard for
international law protecting prisoners of war. According to article
7 of the 1899 Hague Convention, "prisoners of war shall be treated as
regards food, quarters, and clothing, on the same footing as the troops
of the government which has captured them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 This principle
was reaffirmed in a second convention in 1907. The German General Staff
acknowledged its validity. Their sole clarification of article 7 was that
the prisoners were to be treated like German soldiers, "not worse, but
also not better."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 The 1929 Geneva Convention sought to define
the standard soldier with whom a prisoner should be compared. Article 10
of the 1929 convention established two criteria. First, prisoners were to
"be lodged in buildings or in barracks affording all possible guarantees
of hygiene and healthfulness. The quarters must be fully protected from
dampness, sufficiently heated and lighted. All precautions must be taken
against danger of fire." This statement was open to interpretation. It
assumed a compromise between generally accepted standards of comfort
and healthiness and limitations on the means of the detaining power to
meet them. Second, a more objective standard was given: "with regard to
dormitories--the total surface, minimum cubic amount of air, arrangement
and material of bedding--the conditions shall be the same as for the
troops at base camps of the detaining power."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 The designation
"base camps" indicated that the norm was not the accommodation of
soldiers in the trenches, but of those at rest or in training in the
rear. As prisoner-of-war camps were supposed to be in the rear, in
practice this meant that the accommodations of the prisoners and their
guards were to be comparable. That this was not the case at Birkenau is
demonstrated by a photo illustrating the guards' quarters (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig15.html">fig. 15</A>). For
a bedroom of nine guards official guidelines stipulated 3,600 cu. ft.,
or 400 cu. ft. per person. That is, eight times as much space allocated
for sleeping accommodations alone, to which one might add dining halls,
recreation rooms, and so on.

This should suffice. Yet a perverse curiosity makes us compare the
accommodations at the prisoner-of-war camp at Birkenau with the
official SS standards for concentration-camp barracks. On the same
day that Bischoff had begun work in Birkenau, his immediate superior,
Dr. Hans Kammler, issued a standard plan for the accommodation of
concentration-camp inmates (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig16.html">fig. 16</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Comparison of the
two plans reveals how the Germans treated the Soviet <I>Untermensch</I>
in comparison with European inmates. To allow for a fair comparison we
must note that the concentration camp barrack includes a washroom and
toilets. When those are

<B></B>

taken out of consideration there remains
a space of 6,515 sq. ft. for 200 prisoners. At a height of 9 ft. this
yields 58,650 cu. ft., or 293 cu. ft. per inmate. That is almost sixfold
the space allocated to the Soviet <I>Untermensch.</I> To prevent any
misconception: if we compare the 293 cu. ft. allocated to a hypothetical
European inmate with the 400 cu. ft. allocated to a guard (see previous
paragraph) we must bear in mind that the latter number refers only to
the guard's sleeping accommodation, while the 293 cu. ft. is the total
living space of the inmate. To continue the comparison: the huts in
Birkenau provided 181 sq. ft. of window surface for 744 prisoners, or
0.25 sq. ft. per inmate, while the standard concentration-camp barrack
provided eighteen times as much light. The melancholy comparison can
be applied to every aspect of the design. In Birkenau the toilets and
washrooms were housed in sixteen wash barracks and eighteen latrines;
that is, one wash barrack per 7,800 inmates, and one latrine hut per
7,000 inmates. Each hut had a surface of 1,745 sq. ft.; that is, a little
more than 0.2 sq. ft. per inmate. The standard concentration-camp hut
provides 4.9 sq. ft. of wash space per inmate, almost twenty times as
much. Toilet space in the standard camp was less generous at only 2.5
sq. ft. per inmate--but still more than twelve times as much as was
allocated to the Soviet <I>Untermensch.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The design of the wash barracks and privies is paradoxically "symbolic"
of the fundamentally asymbolic situation of Birkenau.

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 106]</B>

Article
13 of the Geneva Convention required belligerents "to take all sanitary
measures necessary to assure the cleanliness and healthfulness
of camps and prevent epidemics." Prisoners were to "have at their
disposal, day and night, installations conforming to sanitary rules
and constantly maintained in a state of cleanliness." They were also
to "be furnished a sufficient quantity of water for the care of their
own bodily cleanliness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 This concern for the prisoners'
cleanliness was inspired by the fear of lice, the most common host of
the typhus virus. Lack of water, lack of soap, and insufficient change
of clothing allow lice to gain a foothold on the human body, and so
expose the prisoner population to a typhus epidemic. Yet there is also
another reason. It has to do with the fundamentally symbolic nature
of the consciousness of the self that makes us unable to live amidst
our own excrement. Julia Kristeva has labelled excrement the confusing
"abject" that is neither subject (me) nor object (that), "but not nothing
either. A 'Something' that I do not recognize as a thing. A weight of
meaninglessness, about which there is nothing insignificant, and which
crushes me."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Excrement, so she believes, links us directly
to the child's separation from the mother, and with that to the origin
of a person's sense of identity. Describing defilement as the oldest
and most universal symbol of evil, Paul Ricoeur has come to the same
conclusion. Confronted with the excremental states of dirt, decay,
and rot, we feel "a threat which, beyond the threat of suffering and
death, aims at a diminution of existence, a loss of the personal core
of one's being."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 In a masterly essay on life in the death
camps, the late Terrence Des Pres described what he termed as the camp's
"excremental assault" on the inmates. The camp's filth, he argued, was
the result of a deliberate policy to destroy the last vestiges of the
prisoner's sense of self-worth. It was not enough to kill the prisoners;
one had to kill them as totally broken people. Only when the inmates
were completely crushed would the SS "reach the orgasmic peak of their
potential domination...Spiritual destruction became an end in itself,
quite apart from the requirements of mass murder."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Des Pres
is incorrect in his insistence that defilement was the result of the
SS's desire to exercise total power. The root cause was a fundamental
inadequacy of design, a lack of willingness on the part of bureaucrats
far away from the camp to allocate more than a minimum of material
and financial resources for the camp's construction, and an assumption
about the camp's use that proved badly mistaken. Yet intended or not,
the result was the same: with the latrines submerged in excrement, with
very little water to be had at very few points, and with mud everywhere,
what remained was an inmate population without any means to preserve the
outward signs of human dignity. As Des Pres asked, "how much self-esteem
can one maintain, how readily can one respond to the needs of another, if
both stink, if both are caked with mud and feces?" (Des Pres, 60). This
excremental assault led to the same collapse of symbol and reality we
noted with regard to the 53 cu. ft. allocated to each prisoner. In the
extreme conditions of the camp, Des Pres reflected, the division between
"concrete existence" and "symbolic modes of being" disappeared. "Body and
spirit become the ground of each other, each bearing the other's need, the
other's sorrow, and each responds directly to the other's total condition"
(Des Pres, 65). The result was a situation in which "meaning no longer
exists above and beyond the world; it reenters concrete experience,
becomes immanent and invests each act and each moment with urgent depth"
(Des Pres, 69).

This, then, brings us back to the designs. Were they even competent,
given the situation? First, there is the spatial arrangement: the
"privy" meant to serve 7,000 inmates is a shed with a single concrete
open sewer, 118 ft. long by 3 ft. wide, without seats and with one long

<B></B>

beam as a back support (<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig17.html">fig. 17</A>). The
design was adapted from a
model latrine for large units in winter quarters, and was first published
in a leaflet on wartime emergency construction (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig18.html">fig. 18</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
Like the model latrine, the camp latrine pit could be accessed from
walkways at both sides. Neither in Auschwitz, nor in the model on which
it was based were the walkways connected; but in Auschwitz this proved
catastrophic, for each of the walkways was 118 ft. long. Both in the
built version and the model, access to the walkways was provided by
doors at each of the building's short sides. Imagine 7,000 inmates at
sunrise, suffering from diarrhea or dysentery, and trying to enter, find
an unoccupied place, defecate, manage not to fall into the sewer, and
get out in the ten minutes or so allocated by the camp's regulations
to such necessities. Assuming that 150 inmates could find a place
at one time, and also assuming that all 7,000 inmates were to move
their bowels with the requisite precision, it would require forty-six
successive "seatings," with all the traffic jams involved. To be sure,
the design might have provided a series of doors on the long sides,
like the old English commuter trains used to have, and so accelerated
matters significantly; but the basic problem would have remained. One
sewer, supplied with an anemic supply of water and a drop of only 1.6
percent could never flush the discharge of 7,000 people in such a short
time. The result was a secretory catastrophe. Added to that were omissions
in the Auschwitz version that made the whole experience considerably more
unpleasant. First, there were no seats. Second, the system of support was
based on the minimal design of the field latrine, only to be used at the
front. Third, the "shame-walls" were removed, which might have provided
at least some physical privacy for those who had to defecate next to each
other. Finally, the separate aeration for the pit was omitted (it had
become superfluous since the pits at Auschwitz were open), which meant an
insufferable stench. Gisella Perl, who was forced to use these latrines
after <I>BA I</I> had become the women's camp of Birkenau, gives us a
succinct description of the situation delineated in Drawing 795 :

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
There was one latrine for thirty to thirty-two thousand women and we were
permitted to use it only at certain hours of the day. We stood in line
to get into this tiny building, knee-deep in human excrement. As we all
suffered from dysentery, we could rarely wait until our turn came, and
soiled our ragged clothes, which never came off our bodies, thus adding
to the horror of our existence by the terrible smell which surrounded
us like a cloud.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Added to this was the indignity of the arrangement itself: "The
latrine consisted of a deep ditch with planks thrown across it at
certain intervals. We squatted on these planks like birds perched on
a telegraph wire, so close together that we could not help soiling one
another."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No explanation can justify or qualify the horror of these provisions. We
have seen how decisions about the design were framed by a general
ideology that assigned the Soviet prisoner of war the lowly status
of <I>Untermensch.</I> But there was also another reason why Ertl and
Bischoff thought that they could get away with less than the absolute
minimum, a reason explained in one document discussing the intended
capacity of the waste-water treatment plant at Birkenau. Originally
the camp had been conceived as a base for crews of slave workers who
were to be employed in amelioration and construction activities in the
surrounding area. As it was to be largely empty during the day, the
architects reasoned that even when the camp was filled to capacity, it
would be possible to run it with only 66 percent of the minimum sanitary
facilities, for prisoners could be serviced by locally dug field latrines

<B></B>

at their place of work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 The reasoning was mistaken, for
it entirely neglected the question of peak use in the early morning and
evening, when all the prisoners had to use the facilities simultaneously.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The mistake made the lives of the inmates insufferable. Remarkably, it
also created huge problems for the SS. As we have seen, as early as 1
March 1941 provincial officials had noted that the camp's sewage was
going to create problems. Himmler had dismissed their concerns then,
and he dismissed them again later. Bischoff, characterized by an SS
psychologist as a man who was servile towards his superiors, troublesome
to his colleagues, and tyrannical to his subordinates, was not going
to make trouble about it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Facing serious shortages in
material and manpower, the architect callously reasoned that the camp was
temporary and that the inmates were going to be working outside during
the day: why not dump the camp's sewage directly into the Vistula? In
the first brief for the camp, he had projected three sewers to take the
waste water from the camp to an open channel directly connected to the
Vistula. No screens, sedimentation basins, or other cleansing units
were planned.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 The total budget was RM 250,000, that is,
2.8 percent of a budget of almost RM 9 million.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But even this minimal arrangement was not realized. Bischoff blamed a
lack of prisoners to dig the trenches.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 The inmates were
not Bischoff's only headache. The local and provincial planners created
trouble from the moment that they received Bischoff's proposals. In
early February 1942 the provincial chief of construction,

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 110]</B>

Wittmer, predicted that sewage would leak from the open channels into
the surrounding area and argued that a flood, which was a distinct
possibility in the lowland around Birkenau, would lead to severe
pollution.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 Provincial planner Ziegler concluded that
enough was enough, and that it was time to remind Himmler of his
responsibilities. In a letter of 18 February 1942 he reminded the
<I>Reichsf&uuml;hrer-SS</I> that "when I gave my permission some time
ago to create a concentration camp I made it clear that a camp of this
enormous size, located in such an extraordinarily well situated place for
industry (close to coal, at a major road and railway junction, and at the
confluence of three rivers), will be expected to accept many conditions
in the interest of other parties or for the common good." He noted that
H&ouml;ss had always understood this, and that therefore there had been
no problems until then.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ziegler's letter alarmed the SS headquarters; despite appearances, the SS
was not omni-potent, and while they certainly had total control over what
happened within their camps once they were built, they also had to adhere
to normal planning procedures and, if necessary, inspections, while the
camps were under construction. Ziegler had the power to stop the expansion
of Auschwitz. Hence the SS main office instructed Bischoff to draw up a
new plan for the camp's waste-water management which would satisfy the
province. Within a week it was completed. For a total expenditure of RM
424,000 Auschwitz-Birkenau would receive a seven-branch sewer that was
to have a total length of 1 mile (RM 52,000), three sedimentation basins
(RM 205,500), a separate draining system of pipes which connected to a
collection pipe for a total length of 9 miles (RM 117,000) and, finally,
a 0.7 mile-long open channel to discharge the effluent into the Vistula
(RM 49,500).
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But paper is patient, and little was done. The spring came, and the
summer, and the camp continued to expand, and more and more sewage
flowed untreated into the Vistula, and relations between the town, the
province, and the camp steadily worsened. Finally, on 23 September,
the parties came together to settle their differences. It was the same
meeting in which the SS yielded on the issue of Hartjenstein's Garden
City: with sewage spilling into the rivers, Oswald Pohl needed to give
in somewhere--especially as he lacked the resources to install a system
capable of dealing with the waste that the camp produced. When the sewage
came up as the last point of the agenda, Pohl chose to humbug his way
through the issue. The municipal and provincial bureaucrats, who had just
won an important victory concerning the relocation of the SS settlement,
allowed him to get away with it. All agreed that the matter needed the
special attention of Himmler, and that they would meet again in the near
future to resolve the sewage problem.

Thus began a period in which the creation of various provisional and
more sophisticated sewage treatment plants became a major obsession in
the Auschwitz <I>Zentralbauleitung</I> (Central Construction Office)
(<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig19.html">fig. 19</A>). Designs became more intricate
and technologically advanced,
but work on the ground progressed slowly. Only in July 1943 was Bischoff
able to complete the first provisional sedimentation basin just south
of the recently completed Crematory II (<A
HREF="1.1pelt_fig20.html">fig. 20</A>). This was to service
<I>BA I</I> of Auschwitz-Birkenau, which had already been completed a year
earlier. Because it was located adjacent to the crematory at the windward
side of the camp, the basin only sharpened the all-pervasive excremental
stench of the place. Progress on the provisional treatment facilities of
<I>BA II,</I> north of Crematory III, was slow, as there were no guards
to oversee the prisoners assigned to dig the channels.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 When
Pohl visited the camp on 17 August 1943 the completion of the sewage
plants was the

<B></B>

central topic of discussion. Bischoff explained
that one of the difficulties in constructing the system was the lack
of guards to oversee the prisoners: the treatment facilities had been
planned outside the camp's barbed wire fence, and the channels that had
to be dug ran for more than three miles through lightly guarded terrain. A
massive deployment of prisoners, needed to complete the project that year,
would be possible only if the camp could provide a steady and predictable
supply of guards. Knowing that Bischoff was hysterical on the issue of
prisoner labor, Pohl decided to see the site for himself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 He
must have urged the camp to heed Bischoff's request, because for several
weeks a great deal of work was done. But by mid-September the supply of
guards started to dry up, and progress was halted.

Bischoff's inability to complete the sewers because of the lack of guards
points to what was perhaps the greatest fallacy of Himmler's original
proposal to use slave-labor to build up the German East. Himmler had been
inspired by two precedents: the <I>Reichsarbeitsdienst</I> (Reich Labor
Service) and the Soviet Gulag. The Reich Labor Service, which had become
manda-tory on 26 June 1935, had been established to do exactly the kind of
work that Himmler expected from slave labor. By 1937 the programs of the
<I>Reichsarbeitsdienst</I> affected one fifth of Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 The
organization was involved in the reclamation of marshes, the draining and
irrigation of underdeveloped land, the concentration of fragmented farm
properties, the protection of lowlands by dikes, and the reclamation of
land from the sea. But the men of the Labor Service worked with minimal
supervision. They did not need guards. They took pride in their work. And
the hundreds of thousands of prisoners within the Soviet Gulag worked most
often in desolate areas in which an escape from the camp meant certain
death in the wilderness. Himmler, however, had to deploy his slave labor
(<A HREF="1.1pelt_fig21.html">fig. 21</A>) in a highly developed
environment and, as the war continued,
with dwindling manpower to guard them. Birkenau's original purpose had
been unattainable from its inception.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This brings us to the camp's transformation from a prisoner-of war-camp
into a concen-tration camp for Jews. I will neither analyze nor seek
to explain this transformation, but limit myself to recording some
facts. From the moment of their arrival the Soviet prisoners of war, who
were supposed to build their own accommodations, had died more rapidly
than the SS expected. H&ouml;ss recalled how "the situation became
really terrible during the muddy period in the winter of 1941-42. They
could bear the cold, but not the dampness and wearing clothes that were
always wet. This, together with the primitive, half-finished, hastily
thrown-together barracks at the start of Camp Birkenau caused the death
rate steadily to climb" (H&ouml;ss, 133). Snow began to fall at the end
of November. H&ouml;ss sent a report to Berlin indicating a catastrophic
situation. In response Kammler phoned Bischoff on 3 December, and demanded
a full report within twenty-four hours. Bischoff's statement introduced
the bad news with some statistics meant to impress on Kammler the extent
of his progress until now: in just over a month 140,000 cu. ft. of earth
had been moved, 1,600 concrete foundations had been poured, and 86,000
cu. ft. of brick work had been erected, using 1.1 million bricks. Further,
600 concrete posts had been erected for the fence, and 100,000 stretching
ft. of barbed wire had been put into place. The bad news was that only
two of the huts in BA I had been completed, twelve had been provisionally
enclosed, seven were advanced enough that work could begin on the girders,
and nine already had walls under construction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>


<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 114]</B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A major reason for the slow progress was that the Russians had not
been supplied with building materials. Bischoff's original brief,
drafted in October, had mentioned that "the barracks will be for the
greatest part built from brick as there is no wood available and the
material will be partly derived from the demolition of the hamlet of
Birkenau."
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 Thus the first batch of Soviet prisoners of war
were told to cannibalize the village; they had already been brought to
the point of cannibalizing each other, as H&ouml;ss later admitted when
recalling this early period in the history of the camp:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Cases of cannibalism happened quite often in Birkenau. Once I found the
body of a Russian lying between two piles of bricks. The body had been
ripped open with a dull instrument. The liver was missing. They beat each
other to death just to get something to eat...During the levelling of the
land and the trench-digging in the first section of Birkenau <I>[BA
I],</I> the men discovered several corpses of Russians apparently
beaten to
death and partially eaten...[The Soviets] had become animals who looked
for only one thing, food. (H&ouml;ss, 133f.)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not only did SS overseers withhold materials from the subhumans, they
also furnished no tools to cannibalize the houses in Birkenau. They were
to be pulled down with bare hands, and the barracks built likewise. This
contributed to the high mortality rate during construction. In the month
of October, 1,255 Soviets died; in November, 3,726; in December, 1,912;
and in January, 1,017. By the end of January almost 8,000 of the 10,000
men had died, which translates into a mortality rate of 240 percent per
year. One more month would suffice to kill the remaining 2,000.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The SS now began to look for a new source of labor. On 26 January
1942 Himmler com-municated his new plans to the inspector of all the
concentration camps, Richard Gl&uuml;cks. "As Russian prisoners of war
are not expected in the near future," Gl&uuml;cks was to take charge
of the "large number of Jews and Jewesses who are being emigrated
from Germany, and send them to the camps...During the next few weeks,
prepare to receive 100,000 male Jews and up to 50,000 Jewesses in the
concentration camps. Large-scale tasks and assignments will come to
the concentration camps in the next few weeks."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 Himmler's
communication spelt more doom than might at first appear. The Jews were
not to be housed in a concentration camp set up according to Kammler's
guidelines, but in Bischoff's infinitely more primitive prisoner-of-war
camp in Birkenau. Three years and one day after Himmler's telegram the
Soviet Army liberated Auschwitz. Early Soviet estimates put the number
of people killed in those three years at close to four million. Today
we believe that the number is more like one million.

</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>"Geographical Situation.</I> Auschwitz is located in the midst of a
fertile, loessial landscape that stretches between the Beskid Mountains
in the south and the Upper Silesian hills in the north. The loessial
terrace, which drops almost ten meters where it reaches the flood plain
of the Vistula, pushes toward Auschwitz far to the north. At the point
where the Vistula regains its eastern direction after having run north
for some time, there was once a natural ford just

<B></B>

above the meeting
place of the [tributary rivers] Sola and Pzemsa with the river Vistula,
while the terrace that offered steep slopes on three sides offered a
point of departure for the thirteenth-century German foundation of a
town in the shadow of a ducal castle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Natural Traffic Situation.</I> At Auschwitz the roads that come
southwest from the Moravian Gate and south from the Beskid Mountains
through the Sola valley meet the world trade route that connects the
North Sea to the Black Sea.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Location.</I> Today, Auschwitz is also a place where many important
roads and railroads meet ...Its location is determined not only by the
fact that Auschwitz is a central place in the region, but also by its
good traffic location within the larger space. That is to say, Auschwitz
occupies more or less the center of the Moravian, the Upper Silesian and
the Polish indust-rial areas. Also significant is its location at the
immediate periphery of the Upper Silesian coal mining area. The choice
of this site as a location for large industries is made feasible by the
presence of an almost flat, large, dry loessial terrace of more than two
hundred acres that can be developed, and the bountiful supply of water
in the Vistula valley.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Population.</I> The present population situation in Auschwitz
(Administrative District) is as follows:

<I>Population Planning.</I> Because of the importance of the location,
the future population has been set at 35,500 people, in addition to
which there will be two reserve areas for 11,500 people, creating a
total potential population of:

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
47,000 inhabitants.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thereby we assume the following division of the population:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Percentage of people employable (after Rechenberg): 55% of the
population. Hence 35,500 x 55% = approximately 19,500 employable people.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Percentage of this number employed to service the town and its region: 45%
of the employable people (minimum according to Rechenberg 35%, increased
because of the town's position as a central place in an otherwise rural
area, with important traffic functions--government, trade, traffic,
crafts, small industries. Hence 19,500 x 45% = local significance: 8,800.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Number of workers in the large industries: Buna [the IG Farben
plant]--3,000; rolling mill--600; other--400. Total = 4,000.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Railways and ancillary businesses = 1,500.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
SS and ancillary businesses (but not the barracks and the concentration
camp inmates)

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
500 settlers x 3 = 1,500.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reserve and otherwise employed = 3,700

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Total employed (8,800 + 4,000 + 1,500 + 1,500 + 3,700) = 19,500

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This suggests an average land use of 200 m<SUP>2</SUP>
 per house,
according to the land-use tables developed by Rosenberg; the population
density of 115 inhabitants per hectare is, according to my own research,
an average for a mixed, generally two-story, open and continuous
arrangement with streets in between, lined by three-story buildings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Planning of Districts.</I> The point of departure for general planning
has been the assumption that the only area suitable to large industry
is the zone located east of the town--at the town's leeside--south of
Dwory. A natural area for human settlement is offered by the nearly flat
and dry terrace, which stretches west of the town and immediately adjacent
to it. On the basis of considerations for safety from bombardments, the
settlement area is separated from the industrial area by a depression
of 500m. This area must be developed as a park-like green belt.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is all the available space than can be used for settlement
immediately adjacent to the existing town core.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The existing urban area is constructed around the medieval core, which
will be preserved with its <I>Ring.</I> It will serve in first instance
as the center of government and commerce.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Further, a natural expansion of the town can occur in the adjacent
area between the sta-tion and the Sola. Because relocation of the
station is impossible, this area is the only pos-sible...zone for city
expansion. This will lead to the creation of an organic connection
between the city as a whole and the station, of which the main hall will
be pushed 300m east in order to create a new station square with a post
office, a hotel and similar amenities. This expansion settlement area,
which will be able to house 10,000 people, will also give space for
the SS settlement and a settlement for railroad employees, each with
500 houses, with in total 2 x 500 x 4.5 = 4,500 inhabitants. The part
of this area that is located north of the

<B></B>

through road will be
reserved for light industries...

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Separated by a green belt from the settlement area adjacent to the
station is an area of 35 ha for the SS base, which at its northwest
corner touches on the existing mill.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another green belt separates the SS base from the concentration camp
proper, which is approximately 150 ha in size. The agricultural areas
that are necessary for the purposes of the camp are defined in such a
way that the organic development of the town will not be obstructed and
no important road connections will be interrupted. For the rest it is
assumed that the rivers Sola and Vistula will be the natural borders
[of the concentration camp area].

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As small industries can be located in the settlement area at appropriate
locations, a further industrial area has not been planned. If necessary
at a later date, one might consider creating another industrial area west
of the station, stretching west toward the Vistula. The establish-ment
of SS industrial installations might begin there, and, because of this
possibility, a long-term agricultural development should be avoided in
that location.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Traffic Planning.</I> At the railroad an expansion of the station is
foreseen...The spine of the traffic within the town will be defined by
the narrowly shaped connector that links the station, crosses over the
existing Sola bridge, and passes through a cut in the old town to the
settlement area of East Auschwitz. Also at the town core will be a new
<I>Ring</I> that will be a center for government, party, and community
buildings. This area will be connected to the regional road to the
north and a small railway station. The industrial road will continue
east through a park-like green belt to the place where the main gate
and the industrial offices will be located...

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Free Areas and Recreation.</I> The valleys of the Sola and the Vistula
with their borders shall be kept free. The flood plain south of the town
will become dry even during periods of flooding after flood controls
around the Sola have been completed, and can hence be used for sports
facilities and small gardens. A cemetery that can be expanded, with an
immediate surface of 35,500 inhabitants x 3m<SUP>2</SUP>
 = 10 ha, is
also foreseen. Because of the new bridge over the Vistula the forest at
Bobrek and Chelm can be easily reached.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Water and Sewage Treatment.</I> An area in the Sola valley has been
designated as a water control zone...An area has been allocated for
sewage treatment, but we must still decide on measures to protect it
from floods."

We begin this journal in the belief that the artistic movement known as
modernism produced the most radical and comprehensive changes in western
culture since romanticism. Here would be the place to list those changes,
if only they were all nameable and known, like characters in a chapter of
yesterday's reading. Instead we sense that the effects of modernism still
reverberate through all the arts, and its products surround us in the
buildings where we work, the houses and apartments where we live, and even
the chairs where we sit now trying to itemize its effects. Modernism was
more than a repertory of artistic styles, more too than an intellectual
movement or set of ideas; it initiated an ongoing transformation in
the entire set of relations governing the production, transmission, and
reception of the arts.  The modernists themselves seem to have understood
this when they urged that changes in the arts be viewed in conjunction
with changes in  philosophy, historiography, and social theory, to say
nothing of the scientific shifts that they claimed as part of their
moment's cultural revolution. The success of modernism was so great that
we all feel ourselves to be latecomers: postmodernism is the term now
invoked to assert an epochal shift away from our parents' perspective.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We hope that every issue of  will convey some
sense of the grand ambition and scope of artists and intel-lectuals of
the first half of this century. This is to say that this journal will
look widely at the art and thought of this period, but also that we want
to examine the sense of contestation that was essential to it: between
old and new orders, of course, but also among various divi-sions of the
intellectual endeavor. We hope for a journal that not only records and
explains some of the crossings between architecture and political thought,
say, or between music and economics; we want



the essays and reviews
we publish to attempt similar crossings. We will be pleased to publish
essays and reviews by sociologists on literary history, for example.
We won't always be able to find this sort of work, but we will always
be looking for it, and will regularly ask our authors to push toward
their neighboring disciplines in the hope that readers will recognize
the appropriateness of this ambition in a journal devoted to the study
of modernism, even when they may disapprove of poachers on their own
particular territory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The particular examples of border crossing that we've cited will suggest
one of the two major ambitions of the journal. One is simply to maintain a
sense of the international dimensions of modernism. An essay about a New
Jersey poet, as is evident in this first issue, may sit next to another
about German expansion into Poland. Our other, more difficult objective
is to bring into dialogue writers in the social sciences engaged by
issues of modernity and modernization and scholars of the literary and
fine arts committed to the history of modernism in the arts. Scholars of
the humanities have borrowed a great deal lately from social, political,
and economic historians, and procedures of literary inter-pretation have
influenced the writing of history as well; but we have a long way to
go before we can claim that these two large divisions of professional
intellectual activity are in dialogue with one another. In the pages
to follow we intend to experiment with various ways of encouraging
collaboration, though we know that it will be much easier to retain
the  international scope of modernism than it will be to facilitate
exchange across the disciplinary boundaries separating literary critics
and political theorists, economists and musicologists.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For the first few issues of  we have
chosen themes that will allow us to draw into the journal writers from
various scholarly disciplines. Our first theme is modernism and race, a
subject crucial both to modernism and to the social transformations of
modernity. For while the modernists frequently advocated internationalism
in art and politics, they also drew on folk or ethnic traditions that
seemed to preserve intact vestiges of sensibilities not yet tainted by the
processes of modernization, doing so in a period that also experienced
intense nationalism in Europe and the mounting force of interethnic
encounters mediated through travel, immigration, colonialism, and early
anthropology. We have had no difficulty finding fascinating work on this
topic--indeed we have given over our first two issues to it. Although
we have seen many studies of aspects of this subject in the past few
years, we want to hold this focus long enough to suggest how the history
of modernism might look if we took race as an originating concern of
modernism, as some of the authors included in this issue argue that we
should. Future issues will take up such themes as anarchism, religion and
secularity, fascism and culture, and the institutions of art, and we will
devote some issues to single res or movements such as F.T. Marinetti
and the Futurists, Wyndham Lewis, and Igor Stravinsky.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although our editorial policies are not intended to encourage
methodological conformity of any sort, the essays that appear in this
first issue will rightly suggest that the journal will be primarily
concerned with historical understanding, though that is an umbrella to
cover a crowd. We do hope to attract writers of various methodological
and political commitments to contribute to this collaborative effort, and
we want as well to include the work of writers, musicians, and artists
as well as professional scholars. We will try to attract to these pages
work by established and well-known scholars as well as by young and
lesser-known writers. What we will ask of all our authors is a commitment
to clear expression with a minimum of

<B></B>

specialized terminology; a
plain style, we think, is necessary to an interdisciplinary effort like
the one we've described.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Those are our hopes and desires, but the product of our efforts will
doubtless turn out to be quite different from what we expect. This is
after all a collaborative effort with colleagues from whom we have not
yet heard. We hope for a conversation whose outcome is hard to foresee.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We have received encouragement and moral support from many colleagues at
Yale and Chicago, and elsewhere too. Here we want to record our gratitude
to Charles H. Long, Deputy Provost at Yale, and Philip Gossett, Dean of
the Humanities Division at Chicago, without whose material support we
could not have started this project. Now we look forward to the support
of our subscribers to keep us going.

At a meeting of the American Antiquarian Society in 1895, after hearing
a paper on "The Scotch-Irish in America," G. Stanley Hall, president of
Clark University and one of the country's leading psychologists, remarked
that he did not know of "a better illustration of the beneficial effects
of crossing different stocks than this." Hall was not generally in favor
of race mixture, but he was willing to make an exception in this case,
because the brain fibers of the Scotch and Irish fitted so neatly into
each other's cranial interstices.

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The Irish race anthropologically regarded is, as a stock, remarkable for
its vitality, for its <I>esprit,</I> for its ready wit, for its quick
susceptibility to all relations with all things and all men around it. On
the other hand, the Scotch mature later, and from the stand-point of brain
analysis they must be as remarkable for the fibers that connect the parts
of the cortex one with the other, the so called 'association fibers,' as
the Irish brain must be for the 'projective fibers' connecting with the
external world. [The product of their] "favorable commingling of bloods
is seen in the Scotch-Irish race;...they are not only more susceptible
to all environments outside, but their activity is prolonged to a greater
period of age.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hall made it clear that much more was involved in the "commingling of
bloods" than simply physical characteristics. "The combination of racial
bloods is not a mere matter of biology or physiology...because physical
inheritance does not include mere physical mingling of the bloods, but
[also] that subtle atmosphere of associations, of home traditions, of
family recol-lections and ideals and aims, that are so inseparable."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From the American Antiquarian Society meetings in Boston to the chambers
of the United States Senate is a step out into the wider American
society of the 1890s. But where the speaker is Henry Cabot Lodge, the
transition is an easy one, and indeed the pattern of assumption is
not dissimilar. Speaking in favor of immigration restriction in 1896,
Lodge argued that though a Hindoo might "absorb the learning of Oxford"
and even sit in Parliament, he could not be made an Englishman, even
though they both came from the "great Indo-European family." It had
taken "six thousand years and more to create the differences which
exist between them," and these could not be effaced by education in
a single lifetime. Lodge went on to ask what was the "matter of race
which separates the Englishman from the Hindoo and the American from
the Indian?"

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It is something deeper and more fundamental than anything which concerns
the intellect. We all know it instinctively, although it is so impalpable
we can scarcely define it, and yet it is so deeply marked that even
the physiological  differences between the Negro, the Mongol, and the
Caucasian are not more persistent or more obvious. When we speak of
a race, then,...we mean the moral and intellectual characters, which
in their association make the soul of a race, and which represent
the product of all its past, the inheritance of all its ancestors,
and the motives of all its conduct. The men of each race possess an
indestructible stock of ideas, traditions, sentiments, modes of thought,
an unconscious inheritance from their ancestors, upon which argument
has no effect. What makes a race are their mental and, above all, their
moral char-acteristics, the slow growth and accumulation of centuries
of toil and conflict.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To move from scholar to scholar-politician to fictional Irish
saloon-keeper is hardly to encompass all levels of late nineteenth-century
American society, but for present purposes we will go no further than
to note that similar assumptions seem to underlie the thinking of
Mr. Dooley. Mr. Dooley felt that the trouble with the Cubans was that
they didn't

<B></B>

"undherstand our civilization." To us, freedom meant
hard work; to the Cuban, it meant blissful idleness. "Ye can't make
people here undherstand that, an' ye can't make a Cubian undherstand
that freedom means th' same thing as a pinitinchry sintince.... Th'
Cubians ain't civilized in our way. I sometimes think I've got a touch
iv Cubian blood in me own veins."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1896, the processes and the problems of heredity were little
understood, and "blood" was for many a solvent in which all problems
were dissolved and all processes commingled. "Blood"--and by extension
"race"--included numerous elements that we would today call cultural;
there was not a clear line between cultural and physical elements or
between social and biological heredity. The characteristic qualities
of civilizations were carried from one generation to another both
<I>in</I> and <I>with</I> the blood of their citizens. Those of us
today who are sophisticated in the concepts of the behavioral sciences
have lost the richly connotative nine-teenth-century sense of "race"
as accumulated cultural differences carried somehow in the blood. Nor
do we mourn the loss. If rich in connotation, the idea of race as
blood is conceptually opaque, and in its political applications all too
literally and horribly bloody. But we should still be able to define and
to understand the broader meaning the term once carried. The common basis
of assumption shared by Mister Dooley, Professor Hall, and Senator Lodge
was widespread in the 1890s. And although there was an obvious racist
potential contained and often manifest in it, it did not necessarily
involve a racial deter-minism in what has come to be regarded as the
usual racist sense. For these men race was as much product as cause. If
it was a <I>determinant</I> of national cultural experience, it was
at the same time an <I>outgrowth</I> of previous national and cultural
tradition. Indeed, in 1890, the idea of race was in many ways and for
many people not very different from what we would call today national
character.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What I would like to do here is to look a bit more analytically at the
pattern of thinking that seems common to Hall, Lodge, and Dooley--as well
as to a large group of social scien-tists whose writings were originally
the subject of my study. One way of doing this is to pose several obvious
questions about race. What is a race? What are the causes and the nature
of race differences? What is the significance of those differences? In
considering these ques-tions, I will argue that their answers at the
turn of the century may be viewed as the residues of several historically
distinguishable antecedent traditions of racial thought, which I will call
the ethnological, the Lamarckian, the polygenist, and the evolutionist.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Each of these traditions contributed elements to the late
nineteenth-century pattern. The coherence and integration of these
elements of what I would call the classic concept of race should
not be exaggerated. Some of them may perhaps have been mutually
contradictory. Nor were they in fact always found in association. For some
purposes it may indeed be to the point to distinguish between monogenist
and polygenist, or romantic and Naturalistic points of view. But a certain
degree of coherence and integration are not lacking, especially before
1900, and quite often the elements of the classic pattern went together
in the thinking of a single man, as they did in the mind of G. Stanley
Hall. When integrated, the striking thing about the pattern, as about its
elements, is the sense of continuity. Hall was in some respects quite
forward-looking--he played an important role in introducing Freudian
psychology into this country. But in matters racial there is about his
thinking a clearly discernable aura of the nineteenth century. It is this
aura I shall attempt now to define--although in the time available, that
definition will be necessarily very schematic.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In answering today the question, What is a race? anthropologists are as
likely to suggest what it is <I>not.</I> According to the "Statement on
Race" published by UNESCO in 1950, "Amer-icans are not a race, nor are
Frenchmen, nor Germans...Moslems and Jews are no more races than are
Roman Catholics and Protestants; nor are people who live in Iceland or
Britain or India, or who speak English or any other language, or who are
culturally Turkish or Chinese...thereby describable as races." But in the
years before 1900, this negative process of definition by delimitation was
not complete even among anthropologists, and many other social scientists
were little more precise in usage than the man in the street. For both
scholar and citizen, "race" was still a catchall that might be applied
to various human groups whose sensible similarities of appearance, of
manner, and of speech persisted over time, and there-fore were evidently
hereditary. The actual unity of such groups might be linguistic or
relig-ious or national, and in fact the same groups that were called
races might also be called nations or peoples with little if any change
in the degree or character of hereditary affinity implied. Nor was the
racial designation any more disparaging than the others. If Negroes,
Jews, and Germans were all races, and the Americans were becoming one,
they were all, by and large, proud of it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is not to say that there had not been attempts during the nineteenth
century to define the notion of race more precisely. It is simply to argue
the persistence of widespread confusion of usage as the most immediately
evident characteristic of racial thought in this period. Indeed, it
was evident even in certain attempts by social scientists to introduce
greater precision into the discussion. To illustrate this--and to take
the place of extensive documen-tation of the prevailing looseness
of usage--let us look at two pieces by a leading sociologist of the
day, Franklin H. Giddings. An early pioneer in the application of
quantitative approaches to sociological research, Giddings in 1910
attempted to develop a more precise measure of the homogeneity of the
American population by assigning each "nationality or race to a position
on a predetermined marking scale of resemblance." Giddings argued that
popular thought could be systematized in terms of a marking scale of ten
positions, ranging from "0, Native-born of native white parents" through
Northwestern to Southern to Eastern Europeans down to "7-Asian yellow,"
"8-Civilized dark," and "9-Uncivilized." As a scientific check on this
popular marking scheme, Giddings suggested that one could break up the
undifferentiated popular impression into a number of factors for which
rating units could be assigned: parents native-born; self native-born;
native language English; reared under Celto-Teutonic traditions and
culture; reared under constitutional government; of European stock
reared under European civilization; belongs to race that has created an
independent political state; belongs to race that has created an ethical
religion; belongs to race that has created a literature; belongs to
race that has independently risen above barbarism; color lighter than
yellow; color lighter than red; color lighter than brown; color lighter
than black. Giving one mark for each of the criteria possessed by each
of his ten groups, Giddings found that when ranked by the total number
of such marks, these fell into exactly the order derived from popular
opinion. At the top with fourteen points were native-born white Americans
of native parents; at the bottom were "civilized dark" with five points
and "uncivilized" with two points, granted on the basis that <I>some</I>
of them were lighter in color than either brown or black.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order better to understand some of the assumptions underlying
Giddings's "Social Marking System," it will be helpful to look at a paper
he gave in 1901 on the "Use of the

<B></B>

Term 'Race' in Anthropology
and Sociology." Giddings there suggested that the essential element
of the race concept was the idea of kinship. The difficulty was that
the same word was used in so many different ways that one never knew
just what degree of kinship was implied. Arguing that there were eight
different types of kinship, Giddings offered a mathematical notation to
distinguish them. K-1 referred to familial consanguinity; K-2, to familial
propinquity; K-3, to nationality, "that wide degree of kinship (physical,
mental and social) which includes those who speak the same language
and for many generations have dwelt together under the same political
organization"; K-4 was potential nationality; K-5 was ethnic race, a
"group of related nationalities, speaking closely related languages,
and having well-marked psychological characteristics in common"--such
as the Celtic, Teutonic, and Latin; K-6 was glottic race, a "broad
relationship which was to a slight extent physical, [and] to a somewhat
greater extent mental and social"--e.g. the Hamitic, the Semitic, and
the Aryan races--the last of which included the Celtic, the Teutonic,
and Latin ethnic races; K-7 was chromatic race, of which there were five
that incorporated the various groups of the preceding level; underlying
all the other levels was the foundation of the kinship pyramid, K-8, or
cephalic race.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are a number of things that might be said about these two papers
by Giddings. Indeed, I would argue that they embody in residue almost
every aspect of the development of racial thought in the nineteenth
century, and that from an imaginative analysis of these two cultural
artifacts one might derive almost all the essential elements of
the late nineteenth-century conceptions of race. But the main thing
to be emphasized at this point is simply that Giddings's attempts at
systematization left the race concept in a rather confused state. Instead
of referring to two entities of quite different orders, one physical and
the other cul-tural, "race" and "nationality" in the Social Marking System
were simply the names applied to groups at different points of a blurred
continuum of socio-biological differences. Rather than clarifying this
confusion, Giddings's analysis of kinship simply suggested its basis. It
was not that he had no concept of nation that could not be distinguished
from race. It was rather that he used both terms to refer to degrees of
a single concept of kinship which, though it was divided into levels,
was essentially undifferentiated as far as the dynamic of its process was
concerned. The heredity that underlay nationality was different in degree
but not in kind from that which underlay ethnic or glottic race. "Race"
and "nation" were simply the terms applied to different levels of a
single pyramid, and as long as they were so conceived, it was almost to
be predicted that writers less precise than Giddings would confuse them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The historical bases of that confusion are too complicated to explicate
fully here, even if I were competent to do so. Instead I would like simply
to comment on a perceptual fact and an anthropological tradition that
seem relevant to the problem. The perceptual fact may be illustrated in
Columbus's confrontation with Caribbean natives at the very beginning
of European expansion. He clearly saw them as a group quite distinct
from his own, but the criteria of their distinctness were not clearly
differentiated, and his description of them lumped together physical,
linguistic, and cultural characteristics. It is this undifferentiated
"differentness," the directly observable community of race, language,
and culture that was the starting point of anthropology in the nineteenth
century--as indeed in a sense it still is today. Ethnology, as the study
of human groups was usually called prior to 1860, was the attempt within
a biblical framework to find some way of sorting out and relating the

<B></B>

multiplicity of such groups that had been confronted in the course
of European overseas expansion. In the early nineteenth century these
groups began to be called "races," but there was an evident hesitation in
the scientific use of the term, and the characteristics that defined it
were only gradually delimited even within what we might retrospectively
call the emerging science of man. Indeed, much of nineteenth-century
anthropology may be regarded as a competition between different schools
of thought as to the best solution of what I would call the ethnological
problem. In these terms, human classification was a unitary problem,
and the issue was <I>which</I> observable criterion was the one by which
human groups should be sorted. There was a strong current in ethnology
that argued that language provided the best criterion. A second current,
which by 1860 becomes differentiable as physical anthropology, argued the
primacy of measurable physical characters, particularly headform. And
there were even some, like John Wesley Powell, who argued the primacy
of cultural classification. Although the relative dominance of these
viewpoints can be chronologically delimited, the point here is that they
were all still viable points of view as late as the 1890s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When the American anthropologist Daniel Garrison Brinton categorized the
"Races and Peoples" of the world in 1890, he distinguished five different
"races," two or more "branches" within each race, several "stocks" within
each branch, and a number of "groups" or "peoples" within each stock. And
he employed all the available criteria, with physical characteristics at
the top and linguistic and cultural characteristics at the bottom. His
model was indeed quite similar to Giddings's pyramid, and the notion of
heredity was equally undifferentiated. If Brinton did not classify the
Jews as a race, but rather as a subgroup of the Chaldean group of the
Semitic stock of the South Mediterranean branch of the Eurafric race,
it is still clear that he regarded them in racial terms, and elsewhere
he indeed spoke of "the pure current of Hebraic blood."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So much then, for the question, What is race? I have argued that in the
late nineteenth century there was no generally accepted clear-cut answer
to the question, and that the confusion of usage can be viewed in terms of
the actuality of perception and the unresolved residue of the ethnological
tradition. It can also be viewed in terms of the prevailing answer to the
question, What are the causes of racial differentiation? On this issue,
the dominant point of view was that which I would call the Lamarckian
tradition. This also had deep historical roots, which can be traced back
to the burning of the Ethiopians by Ph&aelig;ton's chariot. Rather than
duplicating the historical work of Conway Zirkle, however, I would prefer
to look at another contemporary document.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In an article on human heredity published in 1890, James Stoller,
Professor of Natural History at Union College, speculated about what
we would call today national character. Stoller felt that it would
"scarcely be disputed that national characteristics manifest themselves
definitely, not only in the temperament, ideas, etc., of the people, but
also in their bodily features." In answering the question of how these
differences had developed, Stoller found his answer in a principle of
heredity so broadly conceived as to explain almost any physical or social
similarity imaginable. Like Giddings, Stoller interpreted heredity--which
in his usage might just as well have been called kinship--in terms
of a single pyramid. At the apex was the individual. Underlying all
individual qualities was familial inheritance, whose substratum was
to be found in national character, "those qualities which are less
specific, which we have in common with others who live under the
same laws and

<B></B>

institutions, and generally under similar physical
conditions." Underlying nation was race, and beneath the characteristics
we shared with our racial group were those shared by all men. Nor was
this bedrock. Two further levels of the kinship pyramid lay hidden in
the sands of time: those qualities we shared first with the "higher" and
"then with the lower" animals. If Stoller conceived all human inheritance
as a single phenomenon, it was in order to tie man more firmly into the
Darwinian framework. But in doing so, the important distinction between
race and nation was blurred. As in Giddings's system, they were simply
continuous levels in a single kinship pyramid. Their generative process
was identical: "it is obvious that our race characteristics come to us
in the same way as our national and family character-istics."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although there is nothing in his article to indicate that Stoller had
any very precise notion of the mechanism of inheritance, he did offer
a suggestive picture of human evolution.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[These animals] in their turn, under the influence of external causes,
came to possess new characters...while those which they had received
by inheritance from their forerunners ...attained in them a higher
development; in their turn, too, they transmitted their advanced
organization to the succeeding order of beings--that is, to the human
race. The same process continued through the successive generations
of the human family. The distinctively human qualities acquired at the
outset...were handed down to the races that succeeded. They, in turn,
bestowed all that had been bequeathed to them, together with their
newly acquired race characteristics, to their descendants. Finally, the
national characteristics, which in our time we may suppose to include
all the traits that characterize civilized man, were differentiated.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Clearly, Stoller conceived evolution in Lamarckian terms. Evolutionary
novelties arose as organic responses to external causes, and the resulting
progressive variations in organic structure were transmitted to following
generations. The underlying mechanism was obvi-ously the inheritance
of acquired characteristics, and Stoller's view on evolution and race
formation depends on the assumption of heritability.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I have attempted to demonstrate elsewhere that in the context of the
failure of Darwinism to provide an adequate explanation of the origin
of the hereditary variation upon which natural selection operated, the
Lamarckian assumption was widespread at the turn of the century. Here
I will simply note two of its implications. In the first place,
Lamarckianism made it extremely difficult to distinguish between physical
and cultural heredity. What was cultural at any point in time could
<I>become</I> physical; what was physical might well <I>have been</I>
cultural. Thus a widespread theory of the origins of instinct assumed
that habits might become organized as instincts through the inheritance
of acquired characteristics. Culturally conditioned behavior patterns
would thus tend to become part of the genetic makeup of subsequent
generations in the form of inherent tendencies or proclivities. On the
other hand, such racial instincts might, as Robert Park suggested as
late as 1914, be "broken down" by the substitution of new habits of
behavior. The whole notion of racial temperament was conceived in much
the same terms. Herbert Spencer, the ancestral epitome of this sort of
race thinking, put the matter in a nutshell back in 1870:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[I]t needs only to contrast national characters to see that mental
peculiarities caused by habit become hereditary. We know that there are
warlike, peaceful nomadic, maritime, hunting, and commercial races--races
that are independent or slavish, active or slothful, we know that many

<B></B>

of these, if not all, have a common origin; and hence it is inferable
that these varieties of disposition, which have evident relations to
modes of life, have been gradually produced in the course of generations.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The second point to emphasize is that this sort of thinking provided
in effect a theoretical justification for the prevailing looseness
of usage. Thus William I. Thomas, although recog-nizing in 1896 that
the national groups of the present were in fact quite mixed racially,
and might better be spoken of as "artificial" than as "true" races,
nevertheless went on:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
But the formation of artificial or historical races, through the
influences of milieu and the diffusion of a common fund of beliefs,
sentiments, ideas, and interests among a heterogeneous population brought
by hap and chance into the same geographical zone, is taking place before
our eyes at the present moment, and is a matter of history; and we are
safe in assuming that in this the process of the formation of true races
is repeating itself.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thus if the Germans, the French, and the Americans were called races, it
was not simply a confusion of terminology. To some they were races in the
making. To others, including Lodge, they were already races in the only
sense that "race" had meaning: as a community of "sentiments, modes of
thought, an unconscious inheritance from their ancestors"--a community
that was ultimately cultural, but whose essence had been infused by a
bio-social Lamarckian heredity into the very blood of its members.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Essence, of course, suggests a fundamental difference in nature, and
provides a conven-ient transition to the third question I posed above, and
to a third residual tradition in late nineteenth-century racial thought,
which I have called polygenist. In a specific historical sense, polygenism
was one alternative viewpoint in the biblical-scientific debate on race
that reached its height in the 1850s. Against the orthodox monogenist
view that men had all descended from Adam, polygenism argued that the
races of man were primordially distinct species aboriginally adapted to
specific geographic environments, and in these terms was explicitly
anti-Lamarckian. Polygenism seems to me best treated, along with
monogenism, as a specific historical expression of one of two enduring
alternative attitudes toward the variety of mankind. Confronted by
antipodal man, one could marvel at his fundamental likeness to oneself,
or gasp at his immediately striking differences. One could regard these
differences as of degrees of kind, as products of changing environment
or immutable heredity, as dynamic or static, as relative or absolute,
as inconsequential or hierarchical. In these broader terms, it seems
appropriate to include in the polygenist tradition not only the specific
naturalistic scientific current within pre-Darwinian ethnology, but also
a broader romantic current of racial thought that tended to see races in
organismic, superindividual terms, as entities that had a common genius or
soul that expressed itself in specific cultural forms and institutions,
and whose existence on earth followed the individual human life cycle
of birth, growth, maturity, and perhaps even death.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The main point, however, is that neither in its specific historical
or in its generic sense did polygenism die with the emergence of
Darwinism--despite the fact that Darwinism linked all races to a common
root. As I have argued elsewhere, the European physical anthropology
that developed in the last forty years of the nineteenth century
may appropriately be regarded as a continuation of the naturalistic
scientific current of pre-Darwinian polygenism.

<B></B>

Its polygenist
character is evident in the characteristic preoccupations of its major
res: the assumption that the cultural differences of men were the
direct product of differences in their physical structure, the idea
that the distinguishing differences between human races were virtually
primordial, the idea that the most important of these were those of the
human skull and brain, and the assumption that out of the heterogeneity
of modern populations there could be reconstructed "types" that were
representative of the "pure races" from whose mixture these modern
populations derived. Beyond this, many of the specific issues of the
earlier monogenist-polygenist debate continued to be discussed down to
the end of the century. Freed from the specific context of the earlier
debate, many polygenist positions became part of a free-floating body of
racial assumption that was often incorporated into the argument of those
who were Darwinian and in that sense monogenist on the issue of ultimate
human unity. I refer to the notions that the only viable race mixtures
were those between closely related racial groups, that acclimation to
specific environmental conditions threatened races with extinction if they
migrated to sharply differing environments, and that the brain sutures
of Negroes closed at an earlier age than those of whites. All of these
had been polygenist arguments in the midcentury debate; all were still
widely held viewpoints in 1900. Finally, the broader romantic polygenist
viewpoint that saw races in organismic terms, each with its own essence
and its own life cycle, was by no means incompatible with a broadly
Darwinian viewpoint, and was also widespread at the turn of the century.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As only one example of the persistence of polygenist thought, I would
point to U. G. Weatherly's 1910 article on race and marriage. Weatherly
feared that in "the absence of positive checks" a blending of races was
quite possible. But in distinguishing different types of race fusion, he
accepted the polygenist notion that complete fusion was only possible
if the races involved were closely related physically, and that unless
crossing continued, there would otherwise be a tendency to revert
to type. At a broader level, he clearly viewed races in organismic
superindividual terms: "like organisms, races are likely to be most
pliable in the nascent stage." Furthermore, each of these racial entities
was the bearer of an essence that expressed itself in the achievements
of the race, and whose purity must be maintained in order to preserve
the civilization it had created. Thus Weatherly argued that if "the
blood of the races which are now most advanced is to be diluted, so to
speak, by that of those most backward," the loss to humanity might be
"irreparable." Although much of Weatherly's thought on racial temperament
is best interpreted in Lamarckian terms, on issues of race mixture he
was quite within the polygenist tradition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the antagonistic traditions of polygenism and Lamarckianism could
coexist without apparent tension in many late nineteenth-century writers,
it was because the fourth tradition, evolutionism, far from simply ending
the mid-nineteenth-century debate between mono-genism and polygenism,
had instead made possible an accommodation between them. By and large,
evolutionism tended to view the causes of racial differences in Lamarckian
terms; but in regard to their nature, evolutionism may be interpreted
as simply placing the syn-chronic hierarchicalism of polygenism in a
diachronic framework. The differences between human races were viewed in
terms of their places on a temporal evolutionary continuum of physical
and cultural development. The increased time scale of evolutionism made
it pos-sible, while still regarding mankind as ultimately unified, to
see the differences between races as so deeply rooted in time as to be
almost primordial.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In considering the evolutionary tradition it is necessary to distinguish
the Darwinian com-ponent from the much older current of cultural
evolutionism, which saw the development of mankind in terms of stages
corresponding roughly to the popular termi-nology of savagery, barbarism,
and civilization. Rooted in eighteenth-century social thought and the idea
of progress in civilization, this latter viewpoint was not in the first
instance racial. Indeed, the regularity of the stages of human cultural
progress was based on the assumption of a com-mon human nature. However,
the idea of progress in civilization was not unaffected by the racial
preoccupations of the pre-Darwinian period. Furthermore, the tradition
of cultural evolution took on a very different meaning in the Darwinian
context. Faced with the problem of filling a large paleontological gap in
the record of human evolution, Darwin had drawn on both the polygenist
and the cultural evolutionary traditions. But when in the peroration of
<I>The Descent of Man</I> Darwin linked himself to the Fuegian and baboon,
in effect placing the Fuegians and other living savages in a chain that
ran from ape to European, the racial hierarchy of nineteenth-century
polygenism and the cultural hierarchy of the eighteenth-century social
theorists became part and parcel of one scheme of universal organic
evolution.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this context, the whole problem of racial mental differences took on
new meaning. There might indeed still be a common principle of human
nature, but this psychic unity was strictly limited. Turning again to
contemporary documents, one finds the position well worked out as late as
1905 in the writings of W. J. McGee. As McGee viewed it, mental evolution
began on an animal level where mind was completely "instinctive." From
there it advanced to a still largely instinctive savage mentality, to
barbaric minds "measurably similar in their response to environmental
stimuli," to civilized minds which, though well beyond instinct, were
still alike in response, and finally to the mind of enlightened man, which
was "essentially ratiocinative." There was indeed a principle of psychic
unity underlying this mental evolution, but it was a developmental
principle: "Minds of corresponding culture-grades commonly respond
similarly to like stimuli." All savage minds, whether of the black man
today or of the white man of past millennia, responded similarly to the
environment of savagery. But if the same similarity of response also
characterized barbarian minds, they were no longer the same as those
of their savage forbearers. As the result of "cumulative mind growth"
they were <I>better</I> minds. And because all "mind growth," whether
"from infancy to maturity, from the lower races to the higher, or
from the earlier culture-grades to the later," involved, by virtue of
the Lamarckian law of exercise, an advance both "of neural structure
and function," these minds were housed in bigger and more complex
brains. Indeed, the process of "cephalization," which was part and
parcel of the evolution of human culture, was so dramatic that McGee
noted a marked change from the "retreating" brows of Washington and his
contemporaries to the "full-forehead type of the living statesman."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The processes underlying this mental evolution are more clearly evident
in another docu-ment of the period. In examining the brain of John
Wesley Powell to settle a bet between Powell and McGee as to whose
brain was larger, E. A. Spitzka, a prominent brain anatomist, argued
that evolutionary increase in the size of the cerebral cortex was the
result of an increase in the number of associational tracks. With the
increase in knowledge, especially in civilized terms, each generation
has added its increment; the laws of natural selection provided "for
the perpetuation of the superior brains and the gradual extinction
of the feebler." Although Spitzka spoke in nominally Darwinian terms,
the process was in fact Lamarckian; the source of variation upon which
natural selection operated was the increment

<B></B>

 in associations made
during the lifetime of the individual in each generation. It is in this
context that one must view McGee's comment about cephalization as well
as, perhaps, Hall's comment, cited earlier, on the associational tracks
of the late-maturing Scotch.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the context of such views on mental evolution, let us return to the
linkage of race and civilization in an evolutionary framework. Again,
the model is pyramidal. In its broadest sense, late nineteenth-century
cultural evolutionism was a generalization about the overall course of
the past development of mankind as a whole rather than a description or
a prediction of the course of development in every human group. Social
evolution was a process by which a multiplicity of human groups developed
along lines that moved in general toward the social and cultural forms of
western Europe. Along the way different groups had diverged, regressed,
stood still, and even died out as they coped with various environmental
situations within the limits of their peculiar racial capacities, which
in fact their different environmental histories had created. The progress
of the "lower races" had been retarded or even stopped, but the general
level had always advanced as the cultural innovations of the "superior" or
"progres-sive" races were diffused through much of the world. Leadership,
as Lewis Henry Morgan argued, had often changed hands, but "from the
middle period of barbarism, however, the Aryan and Semitic families
seem fairly to represent the central threads of this progress, which
in the period of civilization has been gradually assumed by the Aryan
family alone."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this context, there was a generally accepted correlation between color
and civilization. Savages were, as Giddings suggested, dark. Barbarians
were red or brown. Yellow-skinned peoples had an ambiguous status, but
they were often viewed as at best semicivilized. Civil-ized men had
white skins, and only white-skinned men were fully civilized. Thus
Frank Russell, in his 1901 presidential address before the American
Folk-Lore Society, in the very process of arguing that anthropology
tended to support an attitude of racial tolerance, suggested that "not
only does the anthropologist take a more modest view of the virtues of
the Caucasian, but he also learns to credit the savage and barbarian
with many praiseworthy qualities." In terms much less favorable to
savagery, J. M. Cattell in 1903 offered the same implicit equation in
slightly different form: "a savage brought up in a cultivated society
will not only retain his dark skin, but is likely also to have the
incoherent mind of his race." Within the Aryan or Caucasian race, it
was of course the Northwestern European physical types who represented
the high point of evolutionary progress, who had not only indepen-dently
risen above barbarism, created a literature, an ethical religion, and an
independent state, but had been reared under constitutional government
and Celto-Teutonic cultural traditions --with all the accumulation of
hereditary capacity that this implied in a Lamarckian context.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Having considered the residual manifestations of the ethnological, the
Lamarckian, and the polygenist traditions of racial thought within the
late nineteenth-century evolutionary matrix, let us turn to the last
question I posed above about race, What is the significance of assumed
racial differences? The first thing I would argue is that it is not
entirely appropriate to approach this issue by a direct application of the
categories we are accustomed to in the present. For us, the significance
of race is expressed in such polarities as racist and egali-tarian,
heredity and environment, liberal and conservative. However, problems
arise when one approaches late nineteenth-century evolutionary racial
thought in these terms. Thus T. F. Gossett in his <I>Race: The History of
an Idea in America</I> has great difficulty handling Lester Frank Ward,
who in Gossett's terms was at once a liberal, an environmentalist, an
egalitarian, <I>and</I> a racist.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To appreciate the significance of race around 1900, we must start with
the understanding that there was a common body of assumption that many
"environmentalists" shared with quite extreme hereditarians. Both groups
commonly started from the same inclusive idea of race as an integrated
physical, linguistic, and cultural totality. Furthermore, because
science--to paraphrase a number of contemporary social scientists--no
longer separated the phenomena of the body from those of the mind, both
hereditarians <I>and</I> environmentalists tended to assume that racial
mental differences were related to racial physical differences. If
hereditarians assumed that customs and institutions were simply the
reflection in the social realm of differences in hereditary racial mental
structure, environmentalists assumed that customs and institutions, as
parts of the external environment, reacted upon the hereditary structure
of the racial mind. Because so little was really known of the processes
of physical--or indeed of social--heredity, the <I>persistence</I> of
bio-social racial characteristics, no less than their <I>occurrence,</I>
tended to be viewed as a unitary problem, and biological and social
heredity tended to be confounded <I>both</I> by environmentalists and
hereditarians. If an arch-hereditarian like Carlos Closson argued the
racial heredity of such complex phenomena as the "tax-paying capacity,"
there were any number of environmentally oriented Lamarckians who felt
that equally complex cultural phenomena were carried in the blood, if only
as instincts or temperamental proclivities. The political genius of the
Aryans, the inherent cosmopolitanism of the Chinese, the innate fetishism
of the Negro--all reflect a similar failure to discriminate between the
racial and the cultural, between social and physical heredity, a failure
based in some instances on a naive biological determinism, but more often
on an implicitly Lamarckian confounding of the social and the biological.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At this point, the classic pattern of race thinking embodied in the
remarks of G. Stanley Hall on the intermarriage of the Scotch and Irish
should be fairly clear: the confusion of race and people, the mixed
Lamarckian and polygenist thinking on the problem of intermarriage,
the mental evolutionism embodied in the idea that the Scotch reached
intellectual maturity later in life--to one degree or another all the
elements are there. But if Closson's race thinking differed from Hall's
at some points, there is some justification for considering them both
as variants of a single pattern of race thought. Both would certainly
have accepted Hall's statement that "the color of the skin and the
crookedness of the hair are only the outward signs of many far deeper
differences, including cranial and thoracic capacity, proportions of body,
nervous system, glands and secretions, vita sexualis, food, temperament,
disposition, character, longevity, instincts, customs, emotional traits
and diseases."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is not to suggest that there are no significant historical
distinctions to be drawn among late nineteenth-century racial
thinkers. For instance, within more or less the same body of racial
assumption, one might have quite different conceptions of the future
of the "inferior" races. A Lamarckian might argue that the accumulated
hereditary characteristics of inferior races marked them for extinction,
as F. L. Hoffman saw the fate of the American Negro. Or he might,
like D. G. Brinton, see certain stocks as permanently disqualified "by
a peculiar mental temperament which has become hereditary" from full
participation in the life of modern civilization. If he still granted the
"backward" races the possibility of development he might, like George
Blakeslee and Hall, see it in branching multilineal terms, with each
race "bearing fruit after its own kind." On the other hand, he might,
like George Fellows, envisage all races as climbing a single "ladder of
civilization": "if the essentials of

<B></B>

civilization were presented
to them in the right order they might advance along the line at a more
rapid pace."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The most significant division was not between hereditarian and
environmentalist, but between what might be called hard and soft
Lamarckians. Working within the same gen-eralized body of assumption,
one could move in two different directions. Hall, in whose theories
hereditarian tendencies of Lamarckianism were dominant, saw the
fibers of the brain as little susceptible to immediate influences
of environment. But for soft Lamarckians, the fibers of the brain
might be affected over a relatively short time period by changes in
the social environment. The acceptance of the polygenist assumption
that the development of the individual Negro came to a sudden stop in
adolescence as a result of the premature closing of his cranial sutures
did not <I>necessarily</I> mean that the Negro race was incapable of
development. On the contrary, political scientist Paul Reinsch argued
that a change in their social, political, and economic environment might
even modify "the cranial structure of the negro race."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is in this context that one must view men like Lester Ward. From Ludwig
Gumplowicz, Ward adopted an interpretation of history in terms of race
conflict. Characteristically, the conquering and the conquered races
had lived together first as separate castes and then as social classes
until the work of "social assimilation" had fully integrated them on a
higher level. The evolution of civilization was a function of the number
of such assimilations, each of which increased the "social efficiency" of
a race. The superiority of the Aryan race was due to the fact that it had
undergone a greater number of such compoundings. Ward insisted in a number
of places that this superiority was not innate but acquired. However,
since he also believed that the human brain developed by the Lamarckian
"law of exercise," the line between physical and social heredity tended
constantly to break down, and the superior "social efficiency" of the
Aryans assumed a biological aspect. Indeed, the "law of exercise" made it
possible for Ward to insist on the fundamental equality of all men, and
at the same time to explain all history as the conflict of "inferior" and
"superior" races.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such a cohabitation of environmentalism, egalitarianism, and
racialism, however, depended on the assumption of the inheritance of
acquired characteristics. In the period after 1900, that assumption
was rejected in the context of the emergence of modern genetics. On
the one hand, this development lent support to a much more rigorous
hereditarianism. But as some social scientists realized, the rejection of
Lamarckianism also helped to clarify the dif-ference between biological
and social heredity. And at the same time, the other assumptions of
the nineteenth-century racial tradition were undergoing a thorough
critique in the work of Franz Boas. Boas insisted on the conceptual
distinction of race, language, and culture. He rejected the polygenist
tradition in physical anthropology for a much more environmental and
nominalist conception of racial type. He attacked the fundamental
assumptions of cultural evolutionism and laid the basis for the modern
relativistic, pluralistic anthropological approach to culture. Viewing
these developments together, one might say that the mixed tradition of
nineteenth-century racio-cultural thinking was separating into opposing
currents of biological and cultural determinism. In this context,
the significance of race changed drastically, and the alternatives of
hereditarianism and environmentalism were much more sharply posed. That,
however, is another story--part of which I have treated in my book
<I>Race, Culture, and Evolution.</I> For the present, I hope that I have
offered a more integrated picture of the turn-of-the-century concept of
race than I was there able to embody.

 <A NAME="astnote" HREF="#top">*</A> This essay developed as a by-product of my first book, <I>Race,
Culture and Evolution: Essays in the History of Anthropology</I> (1968;
Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983). Although originally conceived
in rather grandly architectonic terms, that volume was published as a
rather disjunctive series of essays focusing mainly on different aspects
of Franz Boas's critique of late nineteenth-century racial assumptions. My
understanding of the racial "discourse" (to use a more recent term)
which Boas confronted was based on my doctoral dissertation, an analysis
of a systematic sample of American social scientific writing on race
("American Social Sciences and Race Theory: 1890-1915," University of
Michigan, Ph. D. Dissertation #60-3698). When shortly after the book's
appearance I was invited to give a lecture in March of 1969 in the
Department of History at the University of California, Los Angeles, it
seemed appropriate to the occasion to try to represent this discourse
in a more compact and systematic way, and in doing so I returned to
the dissertation itself. Like the dissertation, the lecture was never
published. But when I was asked to lead a discussion in the Workshop on
the Avant-Gardes at the University of Chicago in 1992, a vague memory
trace led me to the file in which it had been deposited. It was a pleasant
surprise to discover that, after a quarter century of further discussion
on race and racism, some of the themes that I had previously developed
seemed still to offer insight. There are of course also anachronisms: my
comments about current anthropological thinking on race and about national
character studies are obviously products of the late fifties and early
sixties. But since the focus of my own work has in the interim shifted to
another country and another topic, it has not seemed feasible to revise or
supplement the essay in the light of more recent scientific or scholarly
inquiry. Save for several very minor verbal corrections, it appears here
as first given--that is, without documentation, except by reference to
the book and dissertation from which it was drawn twenty-five years ago.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In late 1887 Bernard Berenson left Boston for his first tour of
Europe. This gifted young man--the child of Lithuanian Jewish parents
who had immigrated to America after his birth--had had his way paid
to Harvard by Boston Brahmin families impressed by his potential for
cultivation. After his graduation, wealthy patrons supplied him with the
means for the appropriate next step in a career of self-civilization:
the European <I>Wanderjahre,</I> sequel to the old-fashioned Grand
Tour. Having already travelled to France, to England, and to Germany,
Berenson in the summer of 1888 descended into what his biographer Ernest
Samuels calls "the fabled art cities of Italy," where his travel took on
a sharper focus. Lengthening out his stay, Berenson made a rapturous tour
of Italian artistic monuments both on and off the beaten path. (Samuels's
phrase for his swing through Pesaro, Urbino, Gubbio, Citt&agrave; di
Castello, San Sepolcro, and back to Florence--"a strenuous and highly
methodical campaign and the prelude to many similar bone-wearying tours
in quest of paintings and architecture"--will suggest the blend of ardor
and discipline that drove these travels.) In the course of his researches
he met the principal art historians of contemporary Italy--Giovanni
Cavalcaselle and Giovanni Morelli, chief exponents of the new, more
scientific form of art historical study. He also developed, under the
weight of his accumulating art-historical exper-tise, an increasing mental
distance from his adopted home: to a patron from the self-appointed
culture capital Boston he wrote that Boston now appeared provincial to
him, not



the metropolis but that culturally impoverished opposite
of the center called "the colonies." By Berenson's account, these new
alienations and devotions came to a head in 1890, when, sitting in a
Bergamo caf&eacute; with his Italian-Peruvian friend Enrico Costa, he
found his life-structuring mission:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Nobody before us has dedicated his entire activity, his entire life to
connoisseur-ship.... We shall give ourselves up to learning to distinguish
between the authentic works of an Italian painter of the fifteenth and
sixteenth century, and those commonly ascribed to him. We must not stop
until we are sure that every Lotto is a Lotto, every Cariani a Cariani,
every Santacroce a Santacroce.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A second emblematic incident occurs within a year of Berenson's finding
of his vocation but has a very different cast. In 1891 the superintendent
of police in New Orleans (in John Higham's words) "was murdered under
conditions which pointed to the local Sicilian population." Egged on
by both city officials and the media, the police rounded up a number of
Italian suspects, who were quickly put on trial. "But when some of the
accused were tried," Higham continues, "the jury (which may have been
suborned) stunned the city by refusing to convict. While officials stood
idly by, a mob proceeded to 'remedy the failure of justice' by lynching
eleven Italian suspects." In the wake of this nationally publicized
event the United States had an Italian-based version of the Big Red
Scare. Italy withdrew its ambassador from Washington in protest over the
lynchings; an impending attack by the Italian fleet became a subject of
popular rumor and fear; and workers in places remote from New Orleans
went on strike, demanding that their employers rid the workforce of a
hated Italian presence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The topic of this essay is the image of Italy in American culture on
the verge of modernity. I start with these two episodes because it
seems to me that the main point to be made is that there were not one
but two images of Italy in late nine-teenth-century America, for which
my initial examples can stand as synecdoches. The decisive fact about
Italian American relations in the postbellum period is that contact
between these cultures became greatly extended at this time, but in two
starkly different modalities. On the one hand, this is the time of the
birth of modern tourism, so that many more Americans "saw Italy" in the
last decades of the nineteenth century than had ever done so before. (The
touristic influx of Americans to Italy, still a comparative trickle in
the days of Margaret Fuller or Hawthorne in the 1840s and 1850s, had taken
on the dimensions of an organized mass migration by the 1890s, when Henry
James said of afternoon life in Venice, "the bark of Chicago disturbs the
siesta.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 On the other hand, the same decades that saw the
institutionalization of European tourism also saw the beginning of mass
immigration from Italy to the United States, so that Americans at this
time also began in new measure to encounter an Italy in their own home.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result, American relations with Italy in the Gilded Age took the
form of a rapidly developing traffic with two phases at once weirdly
symmetrical and sharply antithetical: the movement, in one set of boats,
of American pilgrims to

<B></B>

the shrines of artistic culture, located in
the land that another set of pilgrims was at that same moment leaving,
in another set of boats, in search of a better life in the first group's
land. But the traffic with Italy at this time did not entail physical
relocations alone. The drama of the American encounter with Italy in the
Gilded Age consisted partly in a growing mutual contact, but partly too in
the elab-oration of the cultural conceptions of "Italy" through which this
contact was imaginatively managed, mediated, and mastered. Berenson saw
Italy through one American idea of "Italy" fashioned by the culture
of his time. The New Orleans lynchers saw Italians through another
contemporaneously constructed American idea of "the Italian." To
understand America's Italy in the Gilded Age is to understand how these
experience-organizing conceptions were brought to social life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cultural frame through which Berenson selects and composes his Italy
might for convenience be labeled the touristic-aesthetic conception. This
conception's founding tenet is that a high, possibly even supreme,
experiential value is lodged in works of art, more especially in that
special rank of works called the classic. Italy, a place where such
works are found in thick abundance, becomes virtually synonymous with its
artistic heritage in this conception, a quasi-sacred ground of art, and
"visiting Italy" is then defined as the act of travelling from monument
to aesthetic monument to make visual and spiritual contact with the
value they contain.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Goethe's wanderings might remind us, the aesthetic-touristic conception
of Italy did not originate in the second half of the nineteenth
century. But in America, it acquired a greatly augmented cultural
dissemination and power at that time, when its rise has everything
to do with the emergence of a new-model gentry class.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 To
summarize this history very quickly: The period after the mid-1850s saw
the coming together of a new kind of upper order in America, composed of
members of the older local social elites, the owners of new industrial
enterprises, and the elements of the mid-nineteenth-century middle class
now moving into new professional and managerial positions. These groups
were all in different ways beneficiaries of the new wealth generated in
the United States through capitalist and industrial development. But
the same transformations that brought these groups new fortunes
also destabilized the older grounds and markers of American social
hierarchy, so that after mid-century such groups were linked not just
by their incomes but by their shared need to confirm their superior
status in the unsettled social world American development helped bring
into being. As has long been obvious, as it came to social coherence in
the Gilded Age, this new upper class identified itself in an especially
strong way with its new body of leisure practices, and it deployed its
new recreations--serviceable evidences, in Thorstein Veblen's phrase,
of its wealth and freedom from the need to work
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
--as chief
weapons in its struggle to establish social distinction. The expensive new
sports of the later nineteenth century--golf, yachting, tennis--embody
one of the status-bearing leisure

<B></B>

practices of this new class. Its
expensive new vacation customs--visible in its summer houses and vacation
colonies--are another such classifying habit. And this group's devotion
to Culture--the nonproductive activity <I>par excellence</I>--formed
another and no less central part of its work of social definition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Devotion to and cultivation of the high arts had, of course, an
association with an aristocratic class ethos long before the American
Gilded Age. At the same time, Culture in this sense became an especially
useful means for creating the social distinction sought by the upper
orders in these years. In the nineteenth-century United States,
to have physical access to high-order artistic creation--and still
more, to have had the means to acquire the trained abilities needed to
appreciate such art--signalled an enjoyment of social privileges and a
freedom from material constraint reserved for the few. The possession of
Culture had the further beauty of seeming to lift its owners out of the
material orders in which it simultaneously advertised their preeminence
in, marking them as devotees of "higher things" and superior to such
vulgar concerns. For reasons both of sincere devotion to such culture
and of its peculiar strategic value in securing social distinction, the
American social elites of the later nineteenth century placed a special
premium on their association with high art, investing their wealth, their
civic energy, and their creativity especially heavily in this cause. This
investment is witnessed in such upper-class social phenomena of the late
nineteenth century as the unparalleled purchasing of classical art and
the endowment of great social institutions to house it; the reformation
of premier American universities that made the initiation of the children
of the upper orders into the mysteries of the high arts one of their main
educational functions (English and Art History departments in the modern
academic sense have their birth in this development); the conspicuous
deflection of gentry children of both sexes into work in the arts and
arts management; and so on.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This excursion may seem like a digression from the question of Italy, but
it is not; in the nineteenth century Italy took on one of its dominant
American meanings through the history I have laid out. Touristic-aesthetic
Italy--Italy rered as the Land of Art where the well-to-do can
travel at leisure and cultivate aesthetic consciousness--is another
projection of the upper-class American culture of the postbellum decades,
in which one real social world is recast in the image of the interests of
another. In the later nineteenth century and after, Italy primarily meant
Art considered as a civilization-inducing (and distinction-conferring)
value in those parts of American culture the new upper class succeeded
in infusing with its sense of the world. Berenson's <I>Wanderjahre</I>
have this social origin written all over them. Transplanted to Boston,
spiritual capital of upper-class high-cultural piety in the United
States in the 1870s and 1880s, and reaccul-turated there in the great
high-culture-bearing institutions of the upper orders (the Harvard of
Charles Eliot Norton and the Episcopal Church of Phillips Brooks),
this one-time European returns to a Europe he now thinks of almost
exclusively as a set of artistic treasures, the perfectly acquired
knowledge of

<B></B>

which will give purpose to his life. This is Italy:
an Italy encountered in Europe but whose motivating social meaning has
been made in America.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second American Italy of the postbellum decades, the cultural
frame that organized the responses of the New Orleans mob, might for
symmetry be called alien-intruder Italy. This conception, a retouched
version of a clich&eacute; of "dark Italy" in circulation at least
since the Renaissance, drew its particular social energies from the
late nineteenth-century history of immigration, a history apparently
remote from, but at a deeper level entwined with, that of late
nine-teenth-century elite class-formation. After all, the same economic
transformation that produced the new wealth of America's best-off social
segments also pro-duced the new positions that opened up at the lower end
of the American economic ladder at this time; so that the immigrants who
came in mounting waves to enlarge a new class of urban poor and low-wage
workers were living at the other end of the same world of opportunity
exploited by the contemporaneous leisure class. Italians arrived in large
numbers in the United States through the operations of this history. There
had of course been Italian immi-grants before these years, but Italian
immigration notably accelerated in the mid-to-late 1880s, resuming again
after the chill of the depression of 1893-94. This newly conspicuous
group presence--most of it southern Italian
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
--reinforced the
new idea of Italy that was growing in American minds, but again this
idea did not only register real features of actual Italians.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead, Italians like the other immigrants of this time had complex
meanings projected onto them from within the culture of the native-born,
and were recruited into a symbolic cultural function among their other
labors.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Economic transformations that had been underway
at least since the 1830s had produced, by the mid-1880s, a sense of
widespread crisis in America, a sense that something had gone deeply
wrong with the American civic order. In the charged field of this sense of
crisis, endlessly reinvigorated by the recurrent experiences of violent
labor strife and menacing urban poverty, the new, more "foreign" immigrant
of the 1880s could easily be read as the cause of the painful changes
of the present, the foreign matter that had made the social body sick
with troubling "modern" symptoms. The Italian immigrants of the late
nineteenth century were largely read through this generalized image of
the foreigner as agent of contemporary instability--as in the New Orleans
lynching episode, where Italians are clearly being responded to as local
targets of more general phobias. The proximity of this event to the
Haymarket riot and anarchist trial of 1886-87 suggests that it replays
a highly portable late-century scenario in which infiltrating strangers
can be held accountable for American domestic woes. (The New Orleans mob
adopted Italians from among the list of functionally interchangeable
suspect ethnicities.) Lynching, the punishment mechanism in question,
similarly shows Italians being assimilated into more general schemes
for the ritual control of internal Others, since lynching was the main
parajudicial rite for managing that chief "menace" of the American South,
the black male.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In American thought of this time "the Italian" is often known as the
dark or swarthy one, ethnic difference being in this way amalgamated
with racial difference; "the Italian" is envisioned as the untidy,
non-self-improving one, natural resident of the slum and natural doer
of the most unskilled labor, and so is made a synecdoche for the lower
classes; and "the Italian" is imagined as the organized murderer, and
thus as a "cause" of violence in the world at large.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 But
these enduring prejudices only give minimally individuating "Italian"
features to a core image of scarcely differentiated xenophobia. The
Italian like other new arrivers in late nineteenth-century America is
at root imagined simply as Foreigner, the American as Unamerican and
Destroyer of Our Thing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It needs to be emphasized that the antithetical conceptions of Italy
as High Cosmopolitan Civilization and Low Domestic Barbarism were not
just pieced together at almost the same time but coexisted in the same
minds, supporting each other, paradoxically, through the structure of
their opposition. In particular, the Undesirable Alien image frequently
formed part of the same upper-class mind set that valorized cosmopolitan
high culture in the late nineteenth century: so that one branch of the
Bostonian Warren family sent Bernard Berenson to Italy while another
branch was organizing the Immigrant Restriction League; and the same
New York gentry who supplied an audience for Italian opera--rendered
an upper-class, high cultural art form in the American organization of
culture--also preferred that it be performed in German, to cleanse it
of "low" ethnic associations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Never before or since has
American writing been so absorbed with the Italian as it was during
the Gilded Age. I want to suggest that American literature was infused
with Italy at this time in part because Gilded Age literary activity
was so tightly bound to the social segment that had the Italian thus
doubly on its mind. Its conceptions largely frame the "Italy" imagined
in American writing, which imbibes them together with its surrounding
culture of letters; and working through the images of Italy designed in
this social niche can be said to be one function of American writing in
the Gilded Age.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">William Dean Howells won the status of principal living author or
repre-sentative man of letters in the "serious" literary culture
of his time, and his knowledge of Italy contributed directly to this
success. Howells's first exposure to Italy came about by happy accident:
he won the patronage post of United States Consul to Venice as the reward
for authoring the 1860 campaign biography of his fellow midwesterner
Abraham Lincoln. But if he came to Italy through the well-managed luck
of the political draw, Howells grasped early on  how he could use his
Italian sojourn to help establish an American career. As has been shown
elsewhere, Howells was sharply aware that a distinct high literary culture
was being institutionalized in the United States in the early 1860s, and
Howells spent the Civil War years in Venice filled with ambition to get
into this new sphere.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 <I>In</I> Italy he intuited the value
that this emerging American cultural order attached <I>to</I> Italy, and
so saw how he could exploit his knowledge of "Italy" as a career-founding
resource. The event he later designated the turning point of

<B></B>

his
life, James Russell Lowell's 1863 acceptance of his essay "Recent Italian
Comedy" for printing in the <I>North American Review,</I> shows Howells's
canny guess that playing up his European artistic initiations would be
the way to win acceptance into the cosmopolitan, art-valuing literary and
social circles coalescing at this time. Howells did not unambivalently
like living in Italy, but he threw himself undividedly into the task of
writing Italy up for American audiences, and by this means made his way
into the cultural world to which he aspired. The American publication of
his <I>Venetian Life</I>  led more or less directly to his hiring
as assistant editor of the <I>Atlantic Monthly,</I> chief organ of the
newly self-demarcated quality zone of literary production, and to his
entr&eacute;e into the social world of the Bostonian gentry. The early
travel novels he soon serialized in the <I>Atlantic</I>--books like <I>A
Foregone Conclusion</I> and <I>The Lady of the Aroostook</I>--similarly
displayed knowledge of Italy in order to consolidate a high-cultural
literary and an upper-class social status at home.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the early 1870s, before he turned full-time to fiction writing,
Howells had the bright idea that his first genre--touristic descriptive
prose--could be wittily redirected from foreign subjects to the quotidian,
contemporary home scene. His work of tourism-in-one's-own-home,
<I>Suburban Sketches</I> , shows how early the other Italy of
immigration enters his writing. This book's remarkable chapter "Doorstep
Acquaintances" records, as a characteristic everyday phenomenon of
the new urbanism, the experience of knowing people in passing, through
casual encounters in anonymous public space. (These acquaintances are
from across the doorstep, or from outside the home.) In this essay, the
people one "knows" in Boston's suburban streets are largely Italian:
a little tambourine-boy; the widow of a "Vesuvian lunatic" trying to
collect money for her return home; a chestnut roaster; a religious image
dealer who comes "da Lucca"; a Garabaldi-partisan scissors grinder; "a
little old Genoese lady [who] comes to sell us pins, needles, thread,
tape, and the like <I>roba</I>"; "dark-mooded, sad-faced" Neapolitan
street musicians, including one who is "swarthiest of the organ-grinding
tribe."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finding that a competence acquired through cosmopolitan travel can have
an unexpected second usefulness at home, Howells repeatedly speaks to
these people in his excellent Italian, activating the pleasing fantasy
that by his use of their language "we had made a little Italy together"
(<I>SS,</I> 38). But the ironic awareness that there may be only a
quite fictitious community between Italian touristic initiates and
actual Italian immigrants--the awareness that speaking their language
verbally may only conceal how little Howells "speaks their language" in
any other sense--vaguely haunts this essay's self-satisfied exercises in
multiculturalism; and at the end this awareness comes close to being fully
faced. The last doorstep acquaintance gets brought within doors, where
Howells offers him odd jobs to do. In this closer contact, the person
speaks of his actual human needs, needs not at all shared by Howells:
"What I want is a home." In response to this breach of decorum, Howells
amazingly writes:<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A sudden and unreasonable disgust for the character which had
given me so much entertainment succeeded to my past delight....and
I said to him: "Do you know now, I shouldn't care if I never saw you
again?" (<I>SS,</I> 59)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Doorstep acquaintance</I> here implicitly recognizes that it
is a relation predicated on a nonrelation: that the pleasurable
pseudo-intimacies of upper-class home-owners with the "different" people
they meet in the streets have been based on the secure knowledge that
they do not share a world in any real sense, and that these relations can
be summarily terminated should such sharing actually threaten to develop.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Italy of cosmopolitanism meets the Italy of immigration next
in Howells's work, Howells lodges his own experience in <I>Suburban
Sketches</I> in a fictional character, where he can study its more general
social meanings. Bromfield Corey, the patrician father in <I>The Rise of
Silas Lapham</I> , has spent his young manhood in Italy, not (like
Howells) through political fortune but through the standard operations
of a class acculturation system. The son of a great Boston merchant,
he is a moneyed person of a second generation, in which aptitude
dissevers itself from a commercial activity no longer economically
requisite and seeks the "higher," nonmaterial goods of cosmopolitan
cultivation. In particular, Corey goes to Italy, an Italy envisioned as
the sum of its famous art (while in Rome Corey has acquired a "theory of
Titian's method"),
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 where he obtains the eminence-securing
equipment suited to his generation of the American elite: the sense of
the aesthetic derived from Italy, a sense that was highly expert yet
carefully amateurish in its social manifestation, and that marks him as
a member of the upper orders.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After Corey visits the place of business of the noncosmopolitan,
ungentrified Silas Lapham, the industrialist paint magnate his son has
gone to work for, he strolls

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
at his leisurely pace up through the streets on which the prosperity of
his native city was founded, [where] hardly any re could have looked
more alien to its life. He glanced up and down the facades and through
the crooked vistas like a stranger, and the swarthy fruiterer of whom he
bought an apple, apparently for the pleasure of holding it in his hand,
was not surprised that the purchase should have been transacted in his
own tongue. (<I>RSL,</I> 133)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this vignette the language-sharing scene of <I>Suburban Sketches</I>
gets replayed in a more satiric way, a way that underlines the social
gaps thus verbally papered over and exposes the gesture's social
origins. Speaking Italian to an Italian is here recognized as an
unwitting expression of class: an expression of the leisure ("lei-surely
pace") and aesthetic self-cultivation ("apparently for the pleasure")
that differentiate Corey's social position both from the immigrant's
lower-class one and from the equally "alien" commercial classes in whose
district he wanders.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is widely regarded as the climactic effort of Howellsian realism, the

<I>Lapham</I> by the span of years that saw the
beginning of heavy southern Italian immigration to the United States. This
historical shift is marked in literary terms by the fact that within this
book old Bromfield Corey-like habits of cosmopolitan aestheticization get
applied to scenes that reflect new mass immigration. Basil March, the
center of consciousness of this novel, is not a patrician but a member
of something like the professional-managerial upper middle class (he is
an insurance executive when the book begins), another social fragment,
the book notes, that identifies itself with its superior possession
of culture and cultivation. ("They had traveled and seen much of the
world, and they had formed tastes which they had not always been able to
indulge, but of which they felt that the possession reflected distinction
on them," Howells writes. "Their house had some good pictures, which her
aunt had brought home from Europe in more affluent days, and it abounded
in books on which he spent more than he ought.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 When
the Marches move to New York, they are able to organize the spectacle
of the city of foreigners largely through the class-specific schema of
touristic-aesthetic cosmopolitanism that they share with Corey, as when
"the rear of the tenement houses showed [March] the picturesqueness
of clotheslines fluttering far aloft, as in Florence," or when, in
Washington Square, "they met the familiar picturesque raggedness of
southern Europe with the old kindly illusion that somehow it existed for
their appreciation and that it found adequate compensation for poverty in
this" (<I>HNF,</I> 259). (Here Howells's own earlier gesture of solidarity
with the Italian is seen with a harshness that goes far beyond Corey's
apple buying: "March thought he sufficiently expressed his tacit sympathy
in sitting down on one of the iron benches with his wife, and letting a
little Neapolitan put a superfluous shine on his boots" [<I>HNF,</I> 48].)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By this phase in his career Howells has succeeded in bringing to full
con-sciousness the two of contemporary American life and the way a
frame of perception learned through one of these culturally organized
experiences can be used to master the other. This process is exposed
most fully in Howells's description of Basil March's mental process as
he rides the new New York mass transit system toward Lindau's home on
the Lower East Side:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
He went over to Third Avenue and took the elevated down to Chatham
Square. He found the variety of people on the car as unfailingly
entertaining as ever. He rather preferred the East Side to the West
Side lines, because they offered more nationalities, conditions, and
characters for his inspection. They drew not only from the uptown
American region, but from all the vast hive of populations swarming
between them and the East River. He had found that, according to the
hour, American husbands going to and from business, and American wives
going to and from shopping, prevailed on the Sixth Avenue road, and
that the most picturesque admixture to these familiar aspects of human
nature were the brilliant eyes and complexions of the American Hebrews,
who otherwise contributed to the effect of well-clad comfort and citizen
self-satisfaction of the crowd. Now and then he had found himself in a
car mostly filled with Neapolitans from the constructions far up the
line, where he had read that they are worked and housed like beasts;
and 
<B></B> 
listening



 to the jargon of their unintelligible dialect, he had
occasion for pensive question within himself as to what notion these poor
animals formed of a free republic from their experience of life under its
conditions; and whether they found them practically very different from
those of the immemorial brigandage and enforced complicity with rapine
under which they had been born. But, after all, this was an infrequent
effect, however massive, of travel on the West Side, whereas the East Side
offered him continual entertainment in like sort. The sort was never quite
so squalid. For short distances the lowest poverty, the hardest pressed
labor must walk; but March never entered a car without encountering some
interesting shape of shabby adversity, which was almost always adversity
of foreign birth. New York is still popularly supposed to be in control of
the Irish, but March noticed in these East Side travels of his what must
strike every observer returning to the city after a prolonged absence:
the numerical subordination of the dominant race. If they do not outvote
them, the people of Germanic, of Slavonic, of Pelasgic, of Mongolian stock
outnumber the prepotent Celts; and March seldom found his speculation
centered upon one of these. The small eyes, the high cheeks, the broad
noses, the puff lips, the bare, cue-filleted skulls, of Russians, Poles,
Czechs, Chinese; the furtive glitter of Italians; the blond dullness of
Germans; the cold quiet of Scandinavians--fire under ice--were aspects
that he identified and that gave him abundant suggestion for the personal
histories he constructed, and for the public-spirited reveries in which
he dealt with the future of our heterogeneous commonwealth. It must
be owned that he did not take much trouble about this: what these poor
people were thinking, hoping, fearing, enjoying, suffering; just where
and how they lived; who and what they individually were. These were the
matter of his waking dreams as he stared hard at them, while the train
raced further into the gay ugliness--the shapeless, graceless, reckless
picturesqueness of the Bowery. (<I>HNF,</I> 158-59)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The New York of this passage is one that Howells was one of the first
to register, the polyglot or radically multicultural New York produced
by the new immigration of the late 1880s, and Howells's street Italians
have changed accordingly from solitary strolling musicians or fruit
vendors to a mass of manual laborers (Neapolitan construction workers)
partly differentiated from, yet partly also amalgamated with, a yet
larger mass of sheer foreignness. Basil March's way of confronting
this world embodies a new way of deploying a long-acquired cultural
equipment. He sees this scene through a habit of perception rooted in
the practice of tourism: he conceives what surrounds him as scenery or
visual tableau, makes the world a "sight" he can stand outside of and
subject to his connoisseurial appreciative powers. Jews, thus, become a
kind of pigment producing an unusual and interesting "effect" for March,
and immigrant poverty a tasty visual treat--an "interesting shape of
shabby adversity." (Note how the rough-and-ready visual identifiers
of different ethnicities--high cheeks, furtive glitters--take on the
pleasurable strangeness of ethnic cuisines for the eye.) But March does
not just aestheticize the scene in a static way. Rather--and I take this
to be Howells's really brilliant achievement in the passage--March in
effect constructs the scene as a visual display he can mentally adjust
the resolution of, a screen on which--while being sure that he will have
no real relation to the

<B></B>

strangers he sees--he can now humanize them
a little, now return them to an anonymous mass; now enter a little into
their real, individual experiences, now blur them out again. Southern
Italians...construction workers; workers whose labor is building the very
apparatus I am travelling on.... These people are indecently housed, the
newspapers report!...What could their life be like, how could America look
through their eyes? it occurs to March to wonder, but the thought just as
quickly fades from his mind. Then it comes up again: Small eyes? Must be
a Russian. High cheeks? Must be a Pole.... What could the inner lives be
like of the people with these visual exteriors? March asks this question,
but does not wait for an answer.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The habit of mind Basil March plays over his doorstep acquaintances--now
the much more anonymous and disindividuated mob of mass transit--receives
an unprecedentedly harsh censure in <I>A Hazard of New Fortunes.</I>
"It must be owned that he did not take much trouble about this: what
these poor people were thinking, hoping, fearing, enjoying, suffering;
just where and how they lived; who and what they individually were," the
suddenly stern narrator says in judgment of March's reveries. When the
Marches visit Castle Garden (predecessor of Ellis Island) to watch new
immigrants being processed, this bite enters Howells's voice again:
"It warmed their hearts, so easily moved to any cheap sympathy"
(<I>HNF,</I> 263). Yet if the book treats this mental process as
reprehensibly self-serving, self-congratulatory, and self-centered, it
simultaneously registers it not as a moral deficiency but as a social
reality: something urban contemporaries will know, a historically new
way of having experience. This, I take it, is where the matter of Italy
eventuates in Howells's work--not in a literary realism of Italian
immigrant experience ("who and what they individually were" finally
occupies Howells as little as it occupies March); and not only in the
satire of upper-class cosmopolitan aestheticism as a way to master the
foreign in our midst; but in the study of this realizing yet derealizing,
outward-reaching yet mentally self-enclosing way of having relations
with strangers in transit in anonymous public spaces--a modern mode of
community that arises, Howells suggests, when the touristic-aesthetic
mindset and foreign immigration come into sufficiently close cultural
conjunction.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Henry James could be presented as an even more advanced critic of
a class-based contemporary "practice" of Italy. Gilbert Osmund, the
suave expatriate of <I>The Portrait of a Lady,</I> is James's version
of the cultural type Howells red in Corey, and Berenson in himself:
the professional amateur, the one who has brushed aside chances for
worldly success to become a connoisseur of aesthetic effects. (Osmund
says of Italy, "There were advantages in living in the country which
contained the greatest sum of beauty. Certain impressions you could get
only there. Others, favorable to life, you never got, and you got some
that were very bad. But from time to time you got one of a quality that
made up for everything.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 James's point is that Osmund's
pose of disinterested connois-seurship is his tool for projecting a
social superiority that he cares for after all,

<B></B>

and this baring
of a status-seeking dimension to Italophile aestheticism makes for
powerful satire. But it would be wrong to infer that James himself is
simply detached from the res of Italy in circulation in his world. A
larger survey would suggest that he is deeply invested in the culturally
constructed Italys of his time in their most orthodox forms--and that,
like Howells, James moves toward the greater complications of his later,
more evidently "modern" outlooks not by transcending such cultural
frames but by working his way forward <I>through</I> them in a changing
social terrain.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In what became virtually a mandatory first step in the American literary
<I>K&uuml;nstlerlaufbahn</I> of the Gilded Age, the equivalent of a later
generation's stay in Paris, James too made a long sojourn in Italy in
his twenties, in 1869-70 and 1872-73. The difference of this eventual
expatriate and <I>echt</I> cosmopolitan's experience from Howells's can
be said to be that he responded to Italy more ardently. More accurately,
we could say that he induced in himself a more ardent realization of the
idea of "Italy" then being normalized in American high culture. James
unlike Howells came to Italy <I>en touriste,</I> saw the Italy laid out by
the touristic-aesthetic itinerary (he had his Ruskin in one hand and his
Murray in the other), and had the reactions and "experiences" prescribed
by this map. Arriving in Rome in 1869, James registers the responses of
the Tourist Ecstatic or what might be called the High Achiever in the
touristic mode: "At last--for the first time--I live!...I went reeling
and moaning thro' the streets in a fever of enjoyment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of this hyperbolic account, but
even James is occasionally aware, amidst his gaping and moaning, that he
is having an intensely personal version of an experience that has been
culturally framed. In an 1870 letter to Charles Eliot Norton, his early
patron and the chief American exponent of the high-cultural conception of
Europe and the aesthetic, James makes clear that the Italy he is learning
about derives its shape and value from a Norton-affiliated American
conception: "I find myself tending more and more to become interested in
the things for which you have said so much--art and the history of art
and multifarious Italian matters" (<I>L,</I> 262). That James--like the
young Howells--also used his Italian initiations to improve his American
cultural position goes without saying. In the letter to this editor and
cultural arbiter he admires "Our friend Tintoret" (<I>L,</I> 260): our
shared love of Italian painters, he tells Norton, creates a bond between
you and me.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have argued elsewhere that in his highly elaborate construction of his
authorial career, James laid the foundations for the artistic identity
he erected by taking in, and taking yet more seriously, a number of the
creedal notions of con-temporary high culture: the idea of value-graded
aesthetic hierarchy, the idea of the Master, the idea of the classic, and
so on.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Here it could be added that James made Italy, taken at
its official estimate as Home of Art or terrestrial Seat of the Beautiful,
into another career-supporting article of personal faith. Already in his
1872 review of Howells's <I>Italian Journeys</I> James has enlisted in
the church mili-tant of the contemporary religion of Italy:

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We go to Italy to gaze upon certain of the highest achievements
of human  power,--achievements, moreover, which from their visible
and tangible nature, are particularly well adapted to represent to the
imagination the maximum of man's creative force. So wide is the interval
between the great Italian monuments and the works of the colder genius
of neighboring nations, that we find ourselves willing to look upon the
former as the ideal and perfection of human effort, and to invest the
country of their birth with a sort of half-sacred character.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Italy of late nineteenth-century American high culture receives what
may be its single most eloquent definition in this passage, where it is
made to embody the height of human creativity or what might be called
the cultural sublime.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When James put his Italian travel essays together into the volume
<I>Italian Hours</I> in 1909 he wrote a late, self-revisionary update to
an 1873 piece he had done on Siena that gives an idea of the continuing
authority of this conception of Italy in his career. Writing in implicit
criticism of an "earlier poor judgment" now discerned to have "fallen
short," James notably fails to criticize the most obvious omissions of the
earlier piece. Operating within the coordinates of the touristic-aesthetic
conception, James had written of Siena as if Italy were its classical
past, a "sweetly-stale grain from the wondrous mill of history," not a
still living society with a history still forming in the present. He
had also written as if Siena were a set of sights to "look well" at,
not a social world of living people. (James's main human contact in
1873--what better proof of the touristic nature of his involvement?--is
a waiter he chats up.) But these are not the deficiencies he identifies
in 1909. Instead the inadequacies he measures are ones marked as lacks
within the touristic-aesthetic conception itself: he did not on his first
visit attend the Palio, and he did not then take the "extra credit"
side trip to "the pictured convent of Monte Oliveto" (the place where
Berenson had converted to Catholicism) to see "those extraordinarily
strong and brave frescoes of Luca Signorelli and Sodoma"--works that
again exemplify the secular mystery of High Art: "the great sheltered
sun-flares and colour-patches of scenic composition and design where a
couple of hands centuries ago turned to dust had so wrought the defiant
miracle of life and beauty that the effect is of a garden blooming among
ruins."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The touristic-aesthetic frame does not appear without self-criticism in
James's &#156;uvre; but it is important to discriminate the form this
self-criticism takes. The 1877 essay "Italy Revisited" is perhaps James's
most brilliant exercise in distancing himself from the preconceptions I
have been describing. Noting the disjunction between Italy's unaesthetic
"modern crudity" (to touristic eyes) and the richly aesthetic "relics
of the great period," James here chooses against "thinking of Italy as
historical and artistic," preferring "to think of her, for a while, as
modern, an idea supposed (as a general thing correctly) to be fatally at
variance with the Byronic, the Ruskinian, the artistic, poetic, aesthetic
manner of considering this fascinating peninsula."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 James's
labor here is to recognize the different, actual, contemporary life
effaced by touristic expectation, in order both to gain some sense
of its human reality and to expose the touristic-aesthetic schema as a

<B></B>

fiction of perception, a "manner of considering." In a characteristic
bit of self-mortification, he thus recalls encountering in the countryside
near Genoa a handsome young Italian who sings as he walks. By habit, he
reads this sight aesthetically, apprehending the youth like "a cavalier
in an opera" and musing that "such a re had been exactly what was
wanted to set off the landscape." But entering into conversation with
him, James learns that this picturesque re is in fact a "brooding
young radical and communist,...an unhappy, underfed, unemployed young
man, who took a hard, grim view of everything, and was operatic only
quite in spite of himself." So known, the re becomes a harsh rebuke
to the outlook that had negated his human reality:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
This made it very absurd for me to have looked at him simply as a
graceful ornament to the prospect, an harmonious little re in the
middle distance. "Damn the prospect, damn the middle distance!" would
have been all <I>his</I> philosophy. Yet, but for the accident of my
having a little talk with him, I should have made him do service, in
memory, as an example of sensuous optimism! ("IR," 52-53)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Our observation in any foreign land is extremely superficial, and
our remarks are happily not addressed to the inhabitants themselves,
who would be sure to exclaim upon the impudence of the fancy-picture"
("IR," 51). This is the sweeping condemnation James builds the case for
in "Italy Revisited"; but we should beware of concluding that James has
therefore escaped from the touristic-aesthetic point of view. After
all, the unhappy young man is known only fleetingly in this scene,
certainly not in the deep, sustained, interactive form we could label
"intimacy." In any case his rhetorical function in the essay is not
to become interesting in his own right but to permit a self-exposure
of the aestheticizing approach: so far from leading truly outside the
touristic-aesthetic mindset, he appears only with respect to that mindset,
which continues to organize the possibilities for perception even when
that perception takes the form of self-critique. (The similarity of this
passage to Howells's critique of Basil March's obliviousness to real
others suggests that this form of self-criticism is not neces-sarily
a break <I>from</I> but perhaps a regular by-product <I>of</I> the
touristic-aesthetic frame, a self-consciousness this habit of vision
regularly generates.) The chief confirmation that this framework of
perception has been complicated but not eluded in such a passage lies
in the rest of the essay, which, after bouts of self-censure and feints
toward potential interest in Italian industrialism, proceeds to readopt
the touristic-aesthetic approach: "the river-front of Florence" is thus,
seen as a "delightful composition" ("IR," 58); the (unknown) inhabitants
of villas "disposed upon the neighbouring hills" are seen as "res
in an ancient, noble landscape" ("IR," 60); and James resumes a charmed
wandering "from one corner of Florence to another, paying one's respects
again to remembered masterpieces" ("IR," 69).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Except for a few glancing references, for instance the mention of
"the children

Bostonians,</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 James's writing largely fails to register the
immigrants who came to America during the years of his expatriation. When
he does confront this presence, notably in his report on his 1904-1905
exile's return, <I>The American Scene,</I> it is striking how much his
response is organized through the foreigner-as-intruder image also taken
in from American gentry culture: an image he heightens and hyperbolizes
just as he did the same culture's ideal of high art. Ross Posnock, the
critic who has written most discerningly on this subject, has argued that
James shows surprising curiosity about the immigrants he finds in his old
home, and an equally surprising willingness to question the native-born's
right to "own" the world they now share with others.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

Posnock may be right about where James's musings eventuate (especially
his musings on Jews); but it would seem worth adding that if James puts
a certain distance between himself and gentry-class prejudices, this
distance is effected after a strong initial investment in something
very similar <I>to</I> those prejudices, and carries its weight as a
swerve from an initially adopted line of thought. When this real-life
Basil March takes to the streets, he sees around him "the ubiquitous
alien," "the inconceivable alien," "gross aliens," "gross little aliens,"
"millions of little transformed strangers" caught in "the first grossness
of their alienism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 His baroque or even byzantine flights of
ration link this alien, with an almost zany extremity of imaginative
enforcement, to highly familiar terms of prejudicial slur. The immigrant
thus appears in <I>The American Scene</I> as physically indecent, a human
equivalent of the greasy spoon: "[in seeing New York] do we not feel
ourselves feeding, half the time, from the ladle, as greasy as he chooses
to leave it for us, that he holds out?" (<I>AS,</I> 118); as the product
of vomit-in-reverse: "it is a drama that goes on, without a pause, day
by day and year by year, this visible act of ingurgitation on the part of
our body politic and social" (<I>AS,</I> 84); as linguistic monstrosity or
destroyer of intelligibility: "it is as if the syllables were too numerous
to make a legible word. The <I>il</I>legible word, accordingly, the great
inscrutable answer to questions, hangs in the vast American sky, to his
imagination, as something fantastic and <I>abracadabrant,</I> belonging
to no known language" (<I>AS,</I> 121-22); as uncanny dispossessor:
"a ghost in [my] supposedly safe old house" (<I>AS,</I> 85).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Italians appear in <I>The American Scene,</I> as they do with
some frequency, they are focused through imagery of the sort just
described. When James revisits the Boston Common, he thus finds Italian
immigrants to be its chief occupants, and so the chief usurpers of "'my'
small homogeneous Boston": "the people before me were gross aliens to
a man, and they were in serene and triumphant possession" (<I>AS,</I>
231). When he revisits Salem and seeks directions to the great nativist
mythological landmark the House of the Seven Gables, uncompre-hending
aliens--for a change here called "flagrant foreigners"--turn out to have
taken over this world too. "At Salem, when, wandering perhaps astray,
I asked my way to the House of the Seven Gables, the young man I had
overtaken was true to his nature; he stared at me as a remorseless
Italian" (<I>AS,</I> 265). This foreigner, who

<B></B>

not only does not
know who Hawthorne was but cannot even understand James's question,
embodies "the other, the smoky modernism" that has displaced "the small
original Hawthornesque world" (<I>AS,</I> 270): he is the Italian as bad
modernity, the Italian as air pollution and eroder of old forms. Elsewhere
the Italian appears just as the irremediable other. Visiting a "large
new rural resi-dence" being thrown up on the Jersey shore, a part of
the conspicuous con-sumption of the turn-of-the-century leisure class,
James finds the soon-to-be-hidden <I>labor</I> of construction being
done by "groups of diggers and ditchers," in short by a manual working
class. These workers are "Italians, of superlatively Southern type,"
and what happens when James and his wealthy host meet them is simply
nothing. They are so estranged that they can only stand in "staring
silence" as if understanding that contact between them "were out of the
question" (<I>AS,</I> 118-19).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As in <I>A Hazard of New Fortunes,</I> James's mental interrogation of
the Italian immigrant reaches a kind of climax in a scene set in mass
transit. In "the electric cars," James like Basil March finds himself
reduced to a minority status, surrounded by an "alienism unmistakable,
alienism undisguised and unashamed" that leaves "the observer" to
"gasp with the sense of [his] isolation." Before the "face after face"
of these foreigners paradoxically so much "at home" (<I>AS,</I> 125),
James begins to muse on the process of their assimilation, the process
by which immigrants begin to lose the socializations of their culture
of origin and to take on the new lives of a new land. James continues:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
There are categories of foreigners, truly, meanwhile, of whom we are
moved to say that only a mechanism working with scientific force could
have performed this feat of making them colourless. The Italians, who,
over the whole land, strike us, I am afraid, as, after the Negro and the
Chinaman, the human value most easily produced, the Italians meet us, at
every turn, only to make us ask what has become of that element of the
agreeable address in <I>them</I> which has, from far back, so enhanced
for the stranger the interest and pleasure of  a visit to their beautiful
country. They shed it utterly, I couldn't but observe, on their advent,
after a deep inhalation or two of the clear native air; shed it with a
conscientious completeness which leaves one looking for any faint trace
of it. "Colour," of that pleasant sort, was what they had appeared, among
the races of the European family, most to have; so that the effect I speak
of, the rapid action of the ambient air, is like that of the tub of hot
water that reduces a piece of bright-hued stuff, on immersion, to the
proved state of not "washing": the only fault of my image indeed being
that if the stuff loses its brightness the water of the tub at least is
more or less agreeably dyed with it. That is doubtless not the case for
the ambient air operating after the fashion I here note--since we surely
fail to observe that the property washed out of the new subject begins
to tint with its pink or its azure his fellow-soakers in the terrible
tank. (<I>AS,</I> 128-29)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just as the 1909 hymn to Monte Oliveto marks the climax of his involvement
with touristic-aesthetic Italy, this passage can be taken to represent
the culmination of James's involvement with the Italy of immigration, and
its ingredients need to be

<B></B>

specified fairly subtly. Present with
an almost obscene lack of embarrassment here are some mental derivatives
from the coarsest strains of contemporary prejudice: does the notion
of Italians as "the human value most easily produced" mean that they
are shamelessly prolific, or "only" that their life isn't worth much
whatever their numbers? Present too is the expectation that these people
should be more appealing or agreeable, an expectation bred by touristic
experience of "a visit to their beautiful country." At the same time,
without fully freeing itself from these preconceptions, the passage
also dramatizes an authentic movement of curiosity in the direction of
the immigrants' lives--but a movement (like Basil March's) that, by its
nature, never crosses out of self-involved speculation. Where has the
homeland manner of these immigrants gone, James wonders? How exactly
has their reacclimatization changed them? The question expresses James's
powerful imaginative sympathy with those he sees, a real will to grasp
the operative conditions of their lives, but his answer stays shut up
in the playful patterns of his mind. Italians are like noncolorfast
garments only within the conceit of the hot washtub (witty variation on
the melting pot), and the further thought that bleached-out ethnic colors
do not "run" onto other fabrics in the "terrible tank" is generated
through a further turn of the observer's verbal re, not a further
knowing of the men and women before him. We are back where all the most
protracted literary interactions with Italy lead in the American Gilded
Age--to a spectatorial act of mind that appreciates the visual drama of
con-temporaneity in complex ways on the understanding that no interaction
with real others is about to take place.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Considered in a longer temporal prospect, Howells's and James's
mass-transit scenes point forward to many similar scenes in the writing of
the early twentieth century: moments in the  metro in Pound, Crane, and
T. S. Eliot; encounters with Italian immigrant aliens in Dos Passos's
<I>U.S.A.</I> and Faulkner's <I>The Sound and the Fury;</I> and so
on. More largely, Howells and James give a review of that inten-sified
yet contradictory disposition toward the foreign--the conjunction of
cosmopolitanist Europhile attraction with various shades of anti-immigrant
repulsion (anti-Semitism is one)--that recurs in American modernist
writing. In this context, the Gilded Age forebears do more than supply
a frisson of structures of sentiment yet to come. They suggest that
this doubleness in its specific early twentieth-century American forms
came out of a certain social-historical set-ting--the high-cultural
upper-class <I>habitus</I> the American moderns were either born to or

the foreign was formed, there, through the interaction of elements made
neighbors in that milieu: love of the foreign regarded as aesthetic;
dread of the foreign as insurgent native presence; and a habit of
pictorializing, derealizing "appreciation" highly useful at home but
first practiced in touristic initiations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this essay, I shall explore the functions of natural language as a
"secondary medium" in visual art, as it appears in the polyphonic work of
Marc Chagall. Language is here part of the private "fictional world" that
Chagall constructed in his paintings in counterpoint to the languages
of the avant-garde. It conveys some of the images and perceptions of
a local culture and carries the "thick knowledge" of a periphery that
Chagall brought to the centers of modernist art. I shall focus primarily
on the role of Yiddish language and literature, which have the deepest
roots in his conscious world.

1. The Semiotics of Chagall's Modernism
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Innovations in modern art and science claimed general validity and
were accepted in the general canon, yet the context of their discovery
was narrowly local and depended on a specific combination of national,
linguistic, social, and personal forces and circumstances. The opposition
between "Western European" and other cultures, as emphasized in recent
criticism, may divert our attention from the fact that European culture
itself has been time and again formed by an awareness of the differences
among national cultures and their reciprocal oppositions, interactions,
and influences.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most prominent outsiders nestled within the European world were the
Jews in their traditional, religious society. In the heart of Europe--in
recent centuries, primarily

<B></B>

Eastern and Central Europe--they
maintained a religion that stood in opposition to the dominant
Christianity and a culture based on the teaching and interpretation of
an ever growing library of texts. Though influenced by the folklore and
beliefs of their neighbors, and often multilingual (using Slavic, German,
and other languages), they maintained tightly knit communities with their
own social and educational network and an internal multilingualism in
three languages of their own: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Yiddish. In Eastern
Europe, and especially in the "Pale of Settlement" of the Russian
Empire, where until 1917 over five million Jews were kept in a huge
geographical ghetto (comprising most of Poland, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and
Lithuania), the Jewish masses were concentrated in small towns (called
<I>shtetls</I>). Two-thirds of the population of a typical <I>shtetl</I>
was Jewish (67% in Chagall's family town of Lyozno), and <I>shtetl</I>
life was dominated physically by a towering Church and politically by a
Russian administration. It was a more or less self-contained island amid
a sea of Christian villages. In the larger towns, Jews constituted half
the population (52.4% in Chagall's Vitebsk), and in several big cities,
about one third. It was a polka-dotted map, a powerless Jewish empire
within an empire, unified by a voluntary cultural network--from the
spread of authoritative books and Hasidic sects to modern ideological
parties, educational systems, literature, and newspapers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was in this context that the Modern Jewish Revolution erupted at the
end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century: a veritable
explosion of modernity within one or two generations, entailing both a
massive transformation of millions of Jews, and their influx into the
centers of European and American culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Jews eagerly joined
the "general" modern culture in manners both extrinsic and intrinsic;
while many took up the languages and entered the cultural institutions
of the extant European nations, others created a European-type secular
culture of their own in Hebrew and Yiddish, accepting European genres and
modes of discourse and infusing them with elements transformed from the
Jewish tradition. Unlike writers, however, who had to choose either an
intrinsic or an extrinsic language (either I. B. Singer or Franz Kafka),
painters could simultaneously participate in both.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chagall (1887-1985) was a typical child of this Modern Jewish
Revolution. He was the first of many siblings, born to religious,
Yiddish-speaking parents of limited education in Vitebsk, the capital of
a province or <I>gubernia</I> (in today's Byelorussia), in the Russian
Pale of Settlement. He moved rapidly from Vitebsk to St. Petersburg,
Paris, Berlin, Moscow, and again France, the U.S.A., and France; he lived
through three Russian revolutions, two World Wars, the Holocaust, and
the rebirth of Israel; he embraced modern secular Yiddish literature, the
Russian language, the achievements of the Russian and French avant-gardes,
as well as the tradition of earlier Christian painting. The impact of
his unusual art in France and Germany was evident from the beginning:
Guillaume Apollinaire, Blaise Cendrars, and Kurt Schwitters wrote poems
about him before World War I, when Chagall was still in his twenties;
in 1914 Herwardt

<B></B>

Walden organized a one-man Chagall show in Berlin
that strongly influenced the German Expressionists; and in later years
there were major Chagall exhibits in New York, Paris, and London. Werner
Haftman, a historian of twentieth-century art, has written, "We think
of Chagall as the painter-poet of the twentieth century. He shares this
distinction only with Paul Klee."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chagall was influenced by most of the contemporary art trends of his
time. In his paintings we can find quasi-geometric articulations of forms
derived from Analytic Cubism; Orphism's predilection for circles in space;
a fauve-inspired exuberance for colors that overflow the boundaries of
objects; the precise chromatic shapes of Suprematism; the dynamic movement
and strong diagonal gestures of Futurism; pre-Expressionist deformations
of human faces and res; a dreamlike arrangement of objects in
represented space, anticipating surrealism; and even minute and multiple
decorative ornaments typical of the Russian <I>Mir Iskusstva</I> (World of
Art) movement from the beginning of the century. In many of his paintings,
several seemingly disparate components fuse into a functional unity, often
in an asymmetrical, uneasy, but ultimately justified balance, perhaps most
typically in his brilliant <I>Introduction to the Yiddish Theater</I>
in Moscow .
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Each painting is masterfully constructed
with a dynamic interplay of several centers of gravity: in some areas
of the canvas, geometrical forms are independent and conspicuous, while
in others representational res are dominant, creating a thematic
and situational polyphony; in between, unrelated animals and vignettes
inhabit some secondary space. The tensions between those heterogeneous
forces endowed his work with its peculiar power. Often Chagall suggests
depth, perspective, and theme, yet disrupts the continuities of space,
time, and perspective. Individual res are presented in disproportion
and deformation, removed from realistic continuity, functionality, or
causality, and left floating in a two-and-a-half-dimensional space. Thus
the connection between his res and objects has been perceived as
enigmatic, surreal, or poetic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chagall rarely painted from nature. The typical Chagallian
representational vocabulary is made up of modular units repeated time
and again in various trans-formations and combinations overlapping or
interrupting each other. Such units were derived from heterogeneous
sources: the traditional Eastern European Jewish world with its
parareligious folklore, Russian provincial life, emblems of Paris, his
beloved wife Bella, his array of animals, and so on. What unifies all
those elements is not coherent, logical, or representational continuity,
but Chagall's own constructed biography, a world that a viewer must know
to understand his paintings. Indeed, Chagall himself supplied such a
text, <I>Mein Leben,</I> known in English as <I>My Life.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chagall, in other words, created his own fictional world, derived from
the multicultural domains encountered in the course of his life, yet
combined and unified by the accidents of his biography. Fictional worlds
are typical of literary works,
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 and Chagall has often been
accused of being a "literary" painter. Yet in literature, a discrete
fictional world with separate characters may be created in

<B></B>

each
novel, while all his life Chagall seems to have evoked one and the same
fictional world, dwelling in his "naive" or "poetic" imagination. The
represented domains themselves appear in grotesque or ironic distortions,
enabling a retrospective look homeward that is nostalgic, yet not, until
late in his career, sentimental. Over time, the repeated representations
transform them into a private language of art, acting in counterpoint
with formal devices drawn from the prevalent languages of modernism. This
was well understood by Chagall's friend in Paris, the poet Cendrars. In
his poem about Chagall, he wrote:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->

         With all the

<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chagall rarely added new elements to his basic vocabulary, yet when his
own fictional world was exhausted (partly by repetition, and partly by
its disappearance into the past), he resorted to the fictional worlds
of literature, illustrating Gogol, Abraham Lyesin, La Fontaine, or the
Bible. In his own fictional world, however, res become more and more
stenographic, emblematic, and sentimental; exuberant colors take over, the
tension between the painterly and the representational forces disappears,
and he loses his edge. Chagall becomes predominantly a colorist.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In sum, Chagall responded to modernism in painting by employing cubist,
surrealist, Suprematist, and fauvist principles and techniques, but
restrained their dominance with the counterweight of his fictional,
symbolically representational world. Thus, on the one hand, realism was
subverted and deformed, while, on the other hand, formalism was harnessed
to poetic and social representation. A similar tension between those
two forces has given life and eclectic--or polyphonic--originality to
Latin American modern painting and fiction. Indeed, this complex and
rich style may be seen as eclectic in a negative sense only from the
point of view of an ideal of purity, or one might say, the poverty of
purity. Chagall may not have invented his individual stylistic features,
but he did invent the treatment of human res, the gravity and social
(dis)continuity, the multicentered composition, and the language of his
modular fictional world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Understanding the semiotics of Chagall's art enables us to see the
importance of his cultural background not just for the biography of the
painter as a person, but for the understanding of his paintings. If a
substantial part of his language of art is drawn from a fictional world,
the components of this world are essential to reading his art. Chagall
never intended to be an exclusively "Jewish" artist, but an artist
in the European and modernist sense of the word. The lost world of
Eastern European Jewish folk life was part of the material from which
he molded his

<B></B>

paintings; it reflected the earliest layers of his
consciousness and provided the concrete and unique substance of his
fictional world and surreal moods. From this base, he reached out to
modern Yiddish literature, themes from contemporary Jewish history, and
the "universal" Bible. Just as Faulkner's or Joyce's origins do not make
them provincial, exclusively southern or Irish writers respectively, but
provide the rich specificity in which their universal art is embedded,
the social locus of their fictional worlds, so does Chagall's Jewish
background. Though Chagall's use of cultural connotations that are
rooted in Jewish literature and folklore has often been discussed in
recent criticism, treatment of it has been marred by misunderstandings
and ignorance, for even fine scholars do not know to what extent that
world and its language have disappeared into history.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
<!--_a-head-->
2. Natural Language in Modern Art
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As is well known, the effect of a painting is dependent not just on the
immediate impression produced by its own painterly language, but also on
natural language, narrative knowledge, and the semiotics of culture. Some
of these elements are indicated in the painting itself, while others are
part of its wider context. A painting is created in a cultural, and yet
at the same time private, chamber of resonance: and when that chamber of
resonance is no longer common to our whole culture, we have to reconstruct
the particular chamber of each artist in order to "read" his work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The role of natural language in the reading of painting can take on
several different forms:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Language describing the ideology or poetics of art. The dependence
of paintings on their declarative poetics became crucial in the various
trends of modernism; we have to read the manifestos and theoretical
writings of the painters and their peers, or the theories constructed from
these texts, to be guided in our mode of "reading" the actual art objects.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Language describing the nature of the represented world. In Chagall,
our understanding is guided by the knowledge of his own constructed
biography and those domains of Eastern European life he evokes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Language as a secondary medium or a subtext attached to specific
paintings or their details. Marcel Duchamp's <I>The Bride Stripped Bare
By Her Bachelors, Even</I> makes little sense without the specific texts
he jotted down for this work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 It is clearly a two-tiered
work of art, where the primary medium is painting and the secondary is
a specific written text, including its variants, crossed-out versions,
and accompanying drawings. Though these are less moving, and operate only
behind the scenes, they guide the signification of the visual units and
inform the entire work of art. In Chagall, subtexts of this kind are
provided by idioms, proverbs, dead metaphors, and literary images of
Yiddish language and literature. His private fictional world draws on
collective stereotypes, and Yiddish culture represents that collective
consciousness.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Language incorporated in the paintings themselves. In many modern
paintings, pieces of words and texts appear, often deformed or extracted
from their normal context and everyday purposes. These fulfill many
functions: they represent the textual nature of modern culture in general,
the plethora of words surrounding us; they signal the crossing of the
boundaries of visual art and language art, painting and textuality; they
represent two-dimensional surfaces, along with wallpaper, thus motivating
the foregrounding of the two-dimensional canvas; and they serve well in
collages, representing the daily, journalistic, practical, or political
world, as tram tickets do in Kurt Schwitters's work. They may also serve
specific thematic functions in each concrete case, either referring to
another object on the canvas, providing a title for the painting as a
whole, teasing its topics with contradictory meanings, or alluding to
another text and its denotations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chagall was an early practitioner of language use in paintings, and
a variegated and prolific one. Since his late teens, Chagall tried to
assimilate the Russian language and culture, and later the French. Yet
he lived in a Yiddish-speaking world at least until the age of twenty,
and then again in Moscow in 1920-22, and in New York in 1941-48. He also
communicated and corresponded in Yiddish with Yiddish writers throughout
his life, and wrote poems, essays, and speeches in Yiddish. From an early
age, he absorbed its imagery in his conscious and subconscious mind,
absorbing with it the foundations of his fictional world. He read the
classics of Yiddish literature, and in Yiddish he read the Bible. These
cultural sources combined in his work with his subsequently acquired
Russian and French languages and painterly models, yet his linguistic
base was in popular Jewish culture.

Many seemingly unreal scenes and gestures in Chagall's paintings can be
explained by the use of Yiddish idioms and proverbs,
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 as well
as by archetypes developed in modern Yiddish literature. In his memoirs,
written in 1922-23 and first published in Yiddish in 1925, Chagall
writes that his mother told him "just now" (she died in 1916) about her
father, who had disappeared years before on holiday. They searched for
him everywhere, and "it turned out that in the nice weather he climbed on
the roof, sat on the chimney [sic!], and ate <I>tsimes</I> [Jewish sweet
carrot stew]." Chagall adds: "Not a bad picture." Chagall domesticated the
fantastic situations of his paintings in events that presumably happened
in his own life. Some critics have taken him seriously and thereby made
him into a realist, defusing the surrealist effects of his work. Yet
Chagall himself knew perfectly well that his grandfather in the story
had enacted "not a bad picture"--the picture is primary--and added: "And
perhaps I dreamt it all" (i.e., the event, the <I>tsimes,</I> and mother's
story too).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Chagall made a drawing of his grandfather's story
that was published in the album <I>Mein Leben</I> by Paul Cassirer in
Berlin

<B></B>

<B>[Begin Page 58]</B>

(<A HREF="1.2harshav_1.html"> 1</A>). In a later lithograph,
moreover,
he embedded this drawing in a frame being painted by young Chagall in
a clown's uniform, with his head half inside the white drawing, half
outside, in the blue frame (<A
HREF="1.2harshav_2.html"> 2</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Most important,
Chagall
had already placed a man on the edge of a roof (prototype of the "fiddler
on the roof") many years earlier, in <I>The Dead Man</I> (<A
HREF="1.2harshav_3.html"> 3</A>). For
Chagall, his grandfather's story demonstrates the strain of positive
craziness and creative freedom that ran in the family. All three works,
moreover, present a realization of the Yiddish idiom <I>meshugener,
arop fun dakh!</I> (you're crazy, get off the roof!)--a phrase that
is said to someone who is not on a roof at all but who "climbed high"
only metaphorically, someone who is not clinically insane but pursues
an unrealistic, unattainable, or absurd idea.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An idiom is a fixed cluster of words, some or all of which have lost
their independent meanings, while the whole means something more and
often very different from the sum of its components.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Like
a dead metaphor, an idiom incorporates a frozen rative situation or
its derivative (e.g., only a crazy man would sit on a sharp-edged roof;
hence, if you think or say such-and-such, you must be crazy;

<B></B>

get off
the roof!). When we use an idiom, we may even visualize or contemplate
its ral aspects or imagery, though they have no ontological status
in the real world; but when we think of its general meaning, we do so
with reference to a given situation. In contrast, a realization of
an idiom in literature or painting inverts this relationship: what
was a mere expression in language becomes a real object or event in
the presented world (a man actually sits on a roof). The image now
denotes, while the idiomatic meaning (he's crazy) has become merely
a potential connotation. rative language is replaced by immediate
objects. But when placed in the presented "reality," such objects or
events are often out of place, creating an unrealistic, grotesque,
or poetic fictional world, as in Kafka's famous metaphor of a person
becoming an insect. Literature and art of this sort are not metaphorical;
they transfer metaphoricity from the level of style to the fictional
world itself, and by so doing, make it "irrational," "surrealistic,"
"fantastic."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To return to the crazy man on the roof: in Yiddish the word for crazy,
<I>meshugener,</I> is often used as a positive epithet, a warm appellation
with affectionate connotations of idiosyncracy, unpredictability, and
creativity. This polysemy (which includes a tension between craziness
and creativity) is based on the biblical <I>meshuga ish ha-ruah</I>
(crazy is the man of spirit, i.e., the inspired person, the prophet;
"The prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad." [Hos. 9:7]) and on
the proximity of <I>shigazy</I> (craziness) and <I>g(cr</I> (genius),
in Yiddish (Hebrew-derived). Genius is even phonetically embedded in
craziness (in every <I>shigniu</I> lies a <I>gies</I>), supporting the
popular belief that genes of craziness and of genius run in the same
family. And other idiomatic expressions further complicate the painting's
allusions: If somebody tells you a lie or an absurd and unbelievable
story, you may retort in Yiddish, <I>a ku iz gefloygn ibern dakh</I> (a
cow flew over the roof, meaning, "Sure!" "Get real!"); or in full: <I>a
ku iz gefloygn ibern dakh un geleygt an ey</I> (a cow flew over the roof
and laid an egg).
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 All three works, in other words, include
a gesture that subverts the realist continuity and social functionality
of a world that is, nonetheless, very "real" in the painter's memory.

The famous painting <I>Over Vitebsk</I> (<A
HREF="1.2harshav_4.html"> 4</A>) features a Jew hovering
above the buildings and churches of the city. He is the embodiment
of the fantastic <I>luft-mentshen</I> (people of the air), created in
Yiddish literature by Mendele Moykher Sforim and Sholem-Aleichem: they
are people who have no income from productive work and live "on air" as
well as "in the air," with no ground under their feet, unlike a healthy
nation rooted in its own soil. This expression became a key image of
self-criticism of the Jewish diaspora existence in most Jewish ideologies,
from Zionist to Socialist, as well as by Western Jews in Berlin or New
York vis-&agrave;-vis their Eastern brethren. Kafka described them as
a special race of miraculously surviving "soaring dogs" (in his story
"Investigations of a Dog"). It is no accident that Chagall's hovering
Jew carries the attributes of a traditional, religious, old Jew, with
his beard, hat, and typical black garb; there was no iconography to
represent the Jewishness of Chagall's young, secular generation. The

<B></B>

image itself is a realization of an idiom: <I>er geyt iber di hayzer</I>
(literally: he walks over the houses) which simply means in Yiddish, he
is a beggar.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 It is often used as a euphemism, to describe
somebody's profession or state of affairs. <I>Iber</I> (literally:
over) here means to walk from house to house, from door to door (as in
the English expression, "to go over some papers"); but literally, the
word means over something, higher than or above; whence the image of a
man walking above Vitebsk. In Chagall's painting, the worn-out spatial
metaphor of "over" was returned to its original literary sense and
visual image.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet this is only the beginning of an interpretation; other literary and
cultural images are grafted onto the idiom. The so-called "Grandfather
of Yiddish literature" Mendele Moykher Sforim (Mendele the Book Seller,
pseudonym of Sh. Abramovitsh, 1837-1917; abbreviated M&eacute;ndele),
wrote one of the seminal books of modern Jewish self-understanding,
<I>The Short Travels of Benjamin III.</I> A Jewish Don Quixote, Benjamin
the Third, guided by fantastic books and numerous Hebrew quotations,
departs with his companion, Senderl the Woman, from their backward
<I>shtetl</I> to find a way to Eretz-Israel. A grotesque clash between
imagination and reality ensues: they mistake a swamp for a great sea;
they cannot even communicate with their Slavic neighbors; eventually they
are caught and conscripted into the Russian army, only to be released
as good-for-nothings. The world is topsy-turvy, reality doesn't match
the quoted texts, and

<B></B>

 the Zionist dream is a flop. In his mock
introduction, the narrator tells us that every person has his guardian
angel:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The symbol of this voyage is the ubiquitous <I>the s</I> (sack), and the

just a beggar's sack he carries on his back, but a mishmash of various
and sundry food, peddler's merchandise, books to guide him on the road,
and whatnot. It is a symbol of the "unproductive" existence of the Jews,
their beggars' predicament, their essentially parasitic and "unreal"
peddler life, combined with the image of the "Wandering Jew" going into
exile. Mendele coined the phrase <I>kol Isroel--eyn their</I> (all [the
children of] Israel--are one sack), i.e., the quintessence of Jewish
existence is the <I>tall [</I> you are a beggar, a <I>shnorer</I> and a
nomad, whether you are poor or "rich." Yet whereas Mendele foregrounded
degrading poverty and lack of productive work, Chagall stressed the
connotations of Exile and Jewish destiny that were also potentially a
part of the whole image.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "Eternal Jew" or "Wandering Jew," a traditional image of Christian,

re, larger than life, condemned to exile, yet eternal. Bella Chagall
used to sing the popular song "A Goles Marsh" (A March of Exile) by the
American Yiddish poet Morris Rosenfeld (1861-1923), which begins thus:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chagall's painting has the legendary image, but without the pity. Indeed,
this was a key image throughout Chagall's life and work. On 28 July
1948, before leaving New York for France, he writes in a private letter
to his friend, the Yiddish novelist Y. Opatoshu,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was neither exile from America nor a tragic trip to Europe, where
major exhibitions and fame awaited him, but simply a stereotype, a
central symbol of Chagall's self-perception as a homeless Jew.

Here realization of an idiom is a direct bridge that links the painting
with a whole cultural conceptual world. Without that cultural cluster--in
our case, the movement above the houses, the religious garb, the stick and
sack--the defiance of gravity may have a different meaning altogether. The
painting <I>Over the Town</I> (<A
HREF="1.2harshav_5.html"> 5</A>), ostensibly similar to <I>Over
Vitebsk,</I> does not include the element of walking, indispensable
for the idiom, or any other attributes of the Eternal Jew; instead it
features two lovers flying weightlessly above Vitebsk. In the mural
entitled <I>Music,</I> the towering re of a Jewish fiddler looms
above the little houses and church--evoking not the Eternal Jew but the
soaring power of music that is not bound to mundane reality. In some of
Chagall's soaring characters, the idiom loses its relevance; in others,
we observe realizations of various expressions, not exclusively Yiddish,
that lift people or objects above the force of gravity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

Chagall, as soon as he discovered the principle, turned it into an
unmotivated device that signals the irrationality of his fictional
world, using it almost anywhere. Furthermore, it is a device for making
familiar objects strange, as well as an imprint of Chagall's authority
over the painting. Thus the fantastic, absurd, or

<B></B>

poetic world
in the painting, even though it may be derived from Yiddish idioms
and literature, is perceived both as a departure from reality and as
its most authentic expression. Chagall himself, for example, said that
Lenin stood Russia on its head like res in a Chagall painting (and
depicted him standing on his head in the painting <I>Revolution</I>).

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
<!--_a-head-->
4. Yiddish Literature
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A major influence on Chagall's perception of the Jewish world was
Sholem-Aleichem, ostensibly a good-natured humorist, who exposed the
irrationalities and absurdities of Jewish life and--through it--life in
general. For Sholem-Aleichem, irrationality lies both in the dangerous
unworldliness of Jewish existence and in the endearing quality of the true
folk person, who sees the abyss yet does not want to see it, glossing
over it with a smile. Chagall adopted this stance in his depiction of
reality in his early paintings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yiddish literature also influenced Chagall thematically. Mendele's
<I>seyfer Habeheymes</I> (The Book of livestock) can be quoted at length
in this connection; cows, horses, goats, and especially the touching story
of a calf, are all echoed in Chagall's world. Mendele's introduction says,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
As I got to know my animals better, as I saw that they were like humans,
flesh and blood, like people with all their senses, with feelings,
and as I seriously observed their situation, their miserable life, how
they are in Exile, suffering from the small humans in the world--the
feeling of pity drew me toward them...<I>and their language,</I> as
strange as it seems, is often more intelligible than the over-clever,
artificial, bookish language that was intentionally invented to screw
your brain and remove the slightest thing from any logic. [Emphasis
in original.]
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP> <B></B>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Chagall had little connection with animals in real life, yet
he constructed them as parts of his culturally stereotypical but
private fictional world, elements of a universe he had imbibed from
his childhood reading. Animals for him could represent the warmth and
endearing quality of a living being, symbolize the inarticulate impact
of nonverbal communication, or epitomize the ideal of human living in
close contact with nature, an ideal that many Jewish contemporaries saw
as specifically Christian because of the patent contrast between the
<I>shtetl</I> and surrounding Christian villages, and consequently an
ideal that came to play a major role in the Modern Jewish Revolution,
with its emphasis on a return to the land, to nature.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another theme that Chagall derives from Mendele is connected with
childhood. "The children of Kesalon (Fooltown) are old Jews in every
respect: in their clothes, the sadness, the worry, the fear, the caution
registered on their faces, except that they are little, have no beard, and
do not procreate....[They are] Children without a childhood."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

This image appears in <I>The Holy Family</I> , which places a
Christian theme within a Jewish family setting. The child is depicted
with a beard, because he, too, has been born "an old Jew." Though not as
gloomy as Mendele's, Chagall's vision reflected a melancholy existential
perception.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="6" HREF="1.2harshav_6.html">
<IMG

ALIGN="LEFT"
SRC="button/1.2harshav_6b.gif"></A>

We also find many traces of Sholem-Aleichem's children's stories in
Chagall's worldview. "The Enchanted Tailor" is a story about a poor
tailor who has bought a milk goat in a distant town, but who is surprised
to discover, while staying overnight in an inn, that his milk goat is
repeatedly conjured away from him and exchanged for a billygoat. The
tailor and his goat appear in <I>Rain</I> (<A
HREF="1.2harshav_6.html"> 6</A>) and other paintings;
and the goat is ubiquitous in Chagall's work, especially since it is
proverbially the most elementary bread-earner in Jewish poverty. No
less ubiquitous is the image of the violin, which also is derived from
Sholem-Aleichem's short story, "The Violin." In this work, the child
recounts, "The desire to play the violin grew together with me." The
violin, we know, was the most widespread prestigious instrument of music
in traditional Jewish society:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A violin, you understand, is an instrument older than all instruments. The
first violinist in the world was Tuval-Kain, or Methuselah, I don't
remember precisely....The second violinist was King David. And there was
a third one, Paganini was his name, also a Jew; all the best violinists
in the world were Jews.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chagall himself dreamt in his childhood about becoming a violinist (before
he transformed that dream into the "non-Jewish" art of painting). The
animal and the violin--both nonverbal communicators--merged in his
imagination, and there is a close empathy between the painter and all
these characters.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The big grandfather clock is also a conspicuous re in Chagall's
world, recalling Sholem-Aleichem's story "The Clock," which begins
thus: "The clock rang thirteen..." and continues somewhat later, "I
swear, it's a crime that a clock is not a living thing, a mute tongue,
speechless: he would have had to tell and

<B></B>

 tell!..." In the story,
the clock dominates the life of the town: the father tries to prevent
it from ringing thirteen, and hangs more and more weights on it, until
the clock collapses with an unbelievable noise, and everyone mourns it
as a dead person. The boy internalizes the experience:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The whole night afterward, clocks crowded my head. I imagined: our old
clock lies on the floor, wearing a white shroud. I thought the clock
was alive, but, instead of the pendulum, a long tongue, the tongue of
a human being, swings back and forth, and the clock does not ring but
sighs, and each sigh takes away a piece of my health....And on the
face, where I am used to see a twelve I suddenly see thirteen, truly
thirteen--believe me!

The dominating clock appears, with its enigmatic, blurred face, swinging
diagonally, along with a flying fish and a fiddle (alliterative in
Yiddish: <I>fish, fidl, fligl</I> [wing]) and a pair of lovers on a
riverbank, in Chagall's <I>Time is a River Without Banks</I> (<A
HREF="1.2harshav_7.html"> 7</A>). Of
course, there are two banks to the river, we see indications of a town
on both, and we are reminded of Chagall's early encounters with Bella on
the bank of the Dvina river, as described in Bella's memoirs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this painting, too, Jewish proverbs may be at work again. There is a
Hebrew expression, widely used in Yiddish: <I>yam ha-talmud,</I> "the sea
of the Talmud,"

<B></B>

 or better, "the sea of learning," which indicates an
inexhaustible, endless body of knowledge. You can swim in it--a related
idiom, describing a learned person and astute scholar, is "he swims in the
sea of learning"--but you cannot reach or see the other shore. Several
additional proverbs are related to it:  the rhymed couplet: <I>der
yam on a breg, di toyre on an ek</I> (the sea has no shore, learning
no end);  <I>di toyre hot nit keyn breg</I> (literally: learning
has no shore).
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Indeed, <I>breg</I> (shore, riverbank) and
<I>ek</I> (end) rhyme in Yiddish and are interchangeable; the dictionaries
translate the word <I>breg</I> (shore) also as <I>ek</I> (end). Thus, "a
river with no shore" actually means "with no end," and, in our context,
"timeless." Yet Chagall revives the primary meaning of <I>breg</I> and
thus paints two shores. Hence, the paradox of the pictorial and verbal
aspects of the picture: the river has no shore, yet in order to be a
river in a painting, it must have two shores. The young love scene is
placed in the shadow of this paradox; the tune is played by Chagall-fish,
the artist-fiddler; and the rest is in the hands of color.

5. Jewish Art and Jesus Christ
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chagall was not an ideologue; and though at some points in his life he was
close to programmatic Jewish art circles, he never joined them. Through
the years, he maintained contacts with both Jewish cultural circles and
French intellectuals. Even in his most "chauvinistic" statement, "Leaves
from my Notebook," published in Moscow in a Yiddish journal in 1922,<SUP>
</SUP>he states, "Beginning with the Renaissance, national arts began to
decline. Boundaries are blurred. Artists come--individuals, citizens of
this or that state, born here or there (blessed be my Vitebsk)--and one
would need a good registration or even a passport specialist (for the
Jewish desk) to be able to 'nationalize' all the artists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

He is proud of what the "little nation" of Jews has achieved: it gave
the world Christ and Christianity, Marx and Socialism, and it will
"show the world some art." But he refers to Art in general, measured by
international standards, rather than "Jewish art." Indeed, there was
no identity crisis here since in the minds of young intellectuals on
both sides of the Modern Jewish Revolution, general culture and Jewish
culture coexisted in one consciousness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because Christianity was central to the European cultural tradition,
it attracted many Jews in the modern period: Edmund Husserl, Gustav
Mahler, Alfred Doeblin, Roman Jakobson, and many others converted
to Christianity. Chagall was not one of them, since he was deeply
connected with a Jewish folk sensibility; but culturally, the Christian
world was a tangible reality in his work and life. His friends in
the interwar period, Raissa and Jacques Maritain, actively propagated
conversion of the Jews. Raissa, herself a Russian Jew who converted to
Catholicism, also wrote a book about Chagall.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Hence the
many fusions and confusions of Jewish, Russian, and Christian elements
in Chagall's paintings; they interact, coalesce, and represent each
other, just as other modular individuals

<B></B>

--man and animal, or man
and woman--do. He presents the sacrifice of Isaac in the form of a
Michelangelo <I>Piet&agrave;,</I> or he potrays the Holy Family with
a bearded, "old," little Jewish child; he paints himself as a Christ
child along with his parents in the famous <I>Golgotha.</I> Some Jewish
critics were puzzled, even outraged by the use of Christian motifs in
the works of a Jewish artist like Scholem Asch or Chagall. But Christian
art was the mainstream of the European art tradition and was part of
Chagall's intellectual world: as Buddha and Zen Buddhism may appear in
the writings of a Christian writer, so did Martin Buber discuss Buddhism
along with Hasidism in his writings; and such, too, was the openness of
modern Jewish literature in Hebrew and Yiddish.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A special case is the re of Jesus Christ. His image was part of
the modern gallery of Jewish literature. Dr. Yosef Klausner, a native
of Russia, editor of the flagship of Hebrew literature in Europe,
<I>Ha-Shiloah,</I> and the first professor of Hebrew Literature at the
Hebrew University in Jerusalem (between 1925 and 1949), devoted many
years to the study of Jesus of Nazareth and his time. Similarly, Uri-Tsvi
Grinberg, the Expressionist poet who wrote in Yiddish and Hebrew and who

edited the avant-garde Yiddish journal <I>Albatros</I>, used the re
of Jesus prominently in his work. There can be no doubt that Chagall
knew <I>Albatros,</I> for it was a major organ of the <I>Khalyastre</I>
(Happy Gang), a group of Yiddish Expressionist poets, who also published
the journals <I>Khalyastre</I> and <I>Literarishe revi</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

Grinberg had been a frontline soldier during World War I, had deserted,
and lived in hiding. After experiencing a pogrom in his hometown
of Lemberg (Lvov), he became an ardent Zionist who firmly believed
(already in 1924, in Berlin) that the earth was burning under the feet
of the Jews in Europe, and that one day they would be gassed. In 1924 he
left for Palestine, where he became a prominent Hebrew poet and extreme
nationalist. In 1922 he wrote a Yiddish "concrete" poem in the form of
a cross, which was entitled "Uri-Tsvi Before the Cross / INRI" (INRI
printed in large Latin letters; <A

"Uri-Tsvi Before the Cross" and in the long poem "In the Kingdom of
the Cross," Grinberg addresses Jesus as "our brother," symbol of Jewish
suffering, hanging on crosses all over Europe for two thousand years. I
will quote a few lines pertinent to Chagall:

Such was the Jewish context of Chagall's <I>The White Crucifixion,</I>
which included Jesus wearing a <I>talis,</I> as well as the context
of similar images in later paintings responding to the Holocaust. Of
course, unlike Grinberg, Chagall did not paint it with an Expressionist

did his painting evoke responses from inside Jewish culture. Here is a

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was written in Yiddish after the Holocaust by the President of Israel
Zalman Shazar, a Hebrew scholar and former Israeli Minister of Culture,
who was born in Byelorussia two years after Chagall. Given their shared
cultural background, the calf may be more appropriate than the ox in
the painting's title.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Naturally, Chagall had ideological hesitations about crossing religious
boundaries in his paintings. As a young man of twenty, before leaving
for St. Petersburg to study art, he went with his mother to Lubavitsh
to see the head of the Chabad Hasidic sect and ask for his advice;
characteristically for that time, the Rebbe told him he must judge for
himself. And half a century later, Chagall wrote to the first Israeli
President Chaim Weitzmann, invoking the traditional authority of the
Rebbe, and asked for advice from "the highest Jewish authority" about
whether to accept a commission for a Christian church. According to
Chagall, who felt apologetic toward his Jewish friends, Weitzman, too,
answered that Chagall must decide for himself. And he did.

6.  Texts and Quotations in Paintings
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Chagall's art, writing plays a conspicuous role. To be sure, words
or parts of words were used by Picasso and his followers in France and
in Russia (for example, Kazimir Malevich). Chagall, however, often uses
long texts, and the textual engagement of his paintings are usually
complex. This was plainly a function of Chagall's origins and interests
in Jewish culture, which had been a profoundly textual culture. The
Jews had no cathedrals filled with art objects (even though synagogue
art--limited as it is--was extolled in Chagall's generation). Their
"otherness" was fully embodied in their "other" letters, their writing
in the "opposite" direction, and their "other" and essentially private
library. In Chagall's works, texts fulfill a global function, representing
the culture of his fictional world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The quoted words also fill numerous specific functions, often
simultaneously. They serve as synechdoches, a part of objects in the
represented world (for example, inscriptions in a cemetery); they issue
multimedia signals, suggesting nonvisual aspects of the represented
frame of reference (referring, for example, to the song "Bridegroom's
Voice, Bride's Voice" with the image of the Dancer in the theater mural
<I>Dance</I>); they offer titles for some of the other material in
the painting; they present allusions that bring in additional frames
of reference that are otherwise indiscernible in the painting proper
(biblical quotes and references to biblical events); they serve as a
metalanguage that shows the artist's interference in his presented world
(such as the tiny names of his family members inserted in longhand in
<I>Introduction to the Yiddish Theater;</I> and they fulfill a design
function within the composition of the painting.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chagall often writes a text and subsequently erases part of it, leaving
the full content as his own private knowledge--a mystifying gesture that
appears on other levels of his paintings as well. Further, he deforms
words and texts, just as he does other represented objects, perhaps
because he originally had in mind two different audiences but increasingly
lost the audience that could read the Hebrew and Yiddish inscriptions. In
spite of his acculturation and his shift to speaking Russian or French,
most of the texts in his paintings are in Hebrew letters, whether the
language be Hebrew or Yiddish. Russian rarely appears as an independent
text, but as an object within a represented reality: a sign on a store,
a newspaper headline (<I>War!</I>), or a quotation from a revolutionary
slogan in the early Soviet years (such as Lenin's slogan <I>War on the
Palaces!</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Although most of Chagall's long texts are
biblical quotations or quotations of Hebrew inscriptions, they are always
set within the world of Yiddish; there is no independent Hebrew text or
sentence composed by him in his &#156;uvre.

One example of Hebrew text appears in <I>The Cemetery Gate</I>
(<A HREF="1.2harshav_1.html"> 11</A>), apparently a realistic
painting from nature made in his
"Vitebsk period." The colors, however, are not realistic at all. The
upper part is treated in a cubist manner, while the lower half, almost
photographic, offers an unrealistic textual collage.

<B></B>

On each of the
two pillars of the gate is a long indecipherable text, such as may be
found on a tombstone, precisely written out and then obscured, as if worn
away with time; at the heads of both pillars, in large letters, are Hebrew
dates, equivalent to 1812-1890. These cannot indicate the opening and
closing dates of a real cemetery (certainly not of an ancient cemetery,
as Vitebsk had), but must refer to a person's life. Chagall has apparently
transferred them from an individual gravestone. Most likely, Chagall, when
in Vitebsk, discovered the gravestone of his paternal grandfather, whom he
admired for his learning, and was happy to place his date of death, 1890,
on a Star of David set upon the peak of his imaginary gate. We know that
the grandfather from Lyozno, who had a house in Vitebsk, had died when
Chagall was a child, whereupon the family sold his house "in the sands"
and moved to a neighborhood in Vitebsk proper. If the dates indeed refer
to this grandfather, Marc was three years old when David Chagall died.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The text on the top triangle is from Ezekiel's vision in the Valley
of Dry Bones, and here it may speak as much of the resurrection of his
grandfather as it does of the resurrection of the Jews, according to a
Zionist interpretation. The absent context is: "Then He [God] said unto
me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they
say, our bones are dried, and our hope is lost:
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 we are
cut off for our parts" (Ez. 37:11). The text on the gate reads, from
midverse (Ez. 37:12): "Behold, I will open your grave[s] [and cause] you
[to come up] out of your graves, my people / And bring you onto the land
[of Israel] [here verse 13 is missing and some text is obfuscated] [and
shall put] my spirit in you, and ye shall live."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 However, the
first two clauses are placed in the reverse direction, as in Russian: the
first half on the left side, then switching to the right. There is only
one change in the biblical text and it is significant: on the horizontal
plank, instead of<IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav01.gif"> = <I>admat Israel</I> (the
soil of Israel), he wrote <I>eretz</I> (the Land), as the Zionists
affectionately referred to Palestine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Furthermore, he
misspelled <I>eretz,</I> as if it were Yiddish (<SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav02.gif"></SUB>, beginning
with an <I>ayin</I> instead of an <I>alef</I>), indicating a contemporary
response. Finally, one may see in the soaring blue sky the Zionist colors.

<I>The Jew in Bright Red</I> (<A
HREF="1.2harshav_2.html"> 12</A>), depicts a weary, ancient Jew
with a fiery red beard, clad in black, who sits with his back to a red
house. Half-rising, his re suggests that he is about to leave the
cluster of <I>shtetl</I> houses immediately behind him, while still
looming beyond the house we see a massive yellow halo, like a globe
or a sinking sun, covered with a biblical text. The text opens with
<I>lekh-lekha:</I> "Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of
thy country and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a
land that I will show thee" (Gen. 12:1). In the original, this chapter
promises a "Zionist" vision of going to the Holy Land and becoming a
great nation. In folk semiotics, however, and in the Yiddish language, the
expression <I>lekh-lekho</I> (get thee out) symbolizes the expulsion of
the Jews. This section of the Bible is called <I>parshes lekh-lekho</I>
(the chapter or episode of banishment); and it acquired a metaphorical
meaning: "Now it is time for the Chapter of Banishment" means not the
weekly reading,

<B></B>

 but its contemporary implementations. Indeed,
"Lekh-Lekho" is the title of the last chapter of Sholem-Aleichem's
<I>Tevye the Milkman,</I> referring to the expulsion of the Jews from all
Russian villages in 1892. But in this painting, no doubt, it refers to
the expulsion of a million and a half Jews who had to leave their homes
within twenty-four hours, as ordered by the Russian army in the areas near
the German front in 1914. Related to the painting, there is a drawing
in gouache, india ink, and pencil on paper, titled <I>Remembrance</I>
(<A HREF="1.2harshav_3.html"> 13</A>). Though the Gug-genheim
Museum catalogue marks the date as
"ca.1918," the drawing has an inscription in Chagall's handwriting:
"Erinnerung 1914" (on top of an earlier pencil mark "Chagall 914"). No
doubt the inscription was made when Chagall was in Berlin in 1923
(for German is rare in Chagall's texts), and the date 1914 refers to
the expulsions (and perhaps the date of his original plan for this
painting). This is amply confirmed by the painting's subject, which
shows a banished Jew who takes his mother's home with him, on his back.

which depicts a whimsical superimposition of a series of houses

cycle entitled <I>Troyer</I> (Grief) by the young Yiddish poet Dovid
Hofshteyn (published in Kiev in 1922), with "cover and illustrations by

Chagall." It is an avant-garde poem, written in
response to the pogroms in Ukraine in 1919, that explores the paradox
and absurdity of the twin birth of Jewish tragedy and world renewal,
with a hyperbolic tone, modernist imagery, avant-garde graphics, and
futuristic rhythms. The last poem of the cycle reflects the poet's visit
to the recently devastated towns. Destruction and emptiness are covered
with the lucid air of autumn, and the poet concludes, "What do I need the
lucidity, the clarity / that leaks into the cracks of ruins?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

In Chagall's <I>Walking Village,</I> a tiny re pops out of a window
with an accusing finger and hurls Hofshteyn's memorable iambic pentameter
line into the empty world: <I>vos darf ikh zi di loyterkayt di klore</I>
(What do I need the lucidity, the clear, transparent lucidity?), while
the reader and the text supply the next line and the full context. In
the original drawing itself, we see something like male genitals between
the two big legs (this was subsequently erased in the Soviet printing),
evidently a popular conception of the psychoanalytical version of the
irrationality of this world. The drawing piles on a series of empty,
blank houses (ironically, like Suprematist white squares and triangles),
with only one sign of life: smoke in the last house. Human legs create a
portmanteau image: the body of houses may be seen as a human body leaning
unnaturally backwards, smoking a pipe. It may also be the reverse: a
town walking.

The received title of this drawing, <I>Walking Village,</I> is rather
misleading. In translating the term <I>shtetl</I> people often confused
two very different administrative concepts, "village" and "town": in
Russia, villages were settlements of Christian peasants who worked
the land, places where Jews did not live; while Jewish towns generally
had little to do with farming. Since <I>shtetl</I> (small town) is a
diminutive of <I>shtot</I> (city) in Yiddish, it would be natural (though
misleading) for Chagall, a newcomer in France in 1910, to derive "village"
from "ville." But in the context of the poem it is safe to assume that the
title is <I>The Town is Walking,</I> which is a Yiddish idiom (<I>di shtot
geyt</I>) meaning "the whole town goes"; all the Jews are leaving their
hometown, fleeing from pogroms into exile. Indeed, the book opens with a
carter and his wagon leaving home (or carrying it away?), depicted on top
of a child's head, where we read the inscription, in a child's longhand:
"To all those slaughtered before their time" (<A

7. Typefaces and Spelling:  A Multicultural Play
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accounting for all the language elements in Chagall's paintings
would require an annotated edition that deciphers all the texts and
allusions and explains their different cultural levels. Apart from the
referential gestures exemplified above, Chagall was a sophisticated user
of the language material itself. He treated language as he treated other
representational elements in his fictional world and other formal elements
on his canvas: deformation and polyphony of voices were his guiding
principles, allusion and whimsical twists his constant devices.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chagall used Hebrew, Yiddish, and Russian texts, but often confounded
their respective spellings and direction of writing in a multicultural
manner. As we know, Hebrew is basically spelled with consonants,
while Yiddish evolved a European-type spelling system, including all
vowels. Hebrew words within Yiddish, however, use the Hebrew consonantal
spelling, to separate the Holy Tongue from the mundane language. After
the Communist Revolution, the Hebrew (or "clerical") spelling of Yiddish
words was abolished and all words acquired vowel letters. Thus in <I>Mein
Leben</I> the inscription on his mother's tombstone reads <IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav03.gif"> = <I>ShGL</I> (capitals represent the actual letters; <I>Sh</I> is one letter in Hebrew) while in the same book his father's tombstone reads <SUB><IMG SRC="symb
ols/1.2harshav04.gif"></SUB> = <I>ShAGAL,</I>   with all vowels filled in.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 His mother
died in 1916 and his father after the Revolution, in 1921. The artist
adopted the Soviet spelling and used it throughout his life for his own
name and in private correspondence. But in his paintings he played with
the differences and their cultural connotations. On several occasions,
he signed his paintings in consonants only:<IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav05.gif"> = <I>MShH
SGL</I> (pronounced: <I>Moyshe Segal</I>), invoking the Jewish art
pedigree of an eighteenth-century synagogue painter Chaim Segal. In
the painting <I>Rain</I> ( 6), a Russian word is even spelled in
consonants: <IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav06.gif"> = <I>LVK</I> (for <I>lavka,</I> "store" in
Russian), perhaps to indicate Jewish ownership. On the other hand,
in the midst of a holy text in <I>The Jew in Green</I> , we
find a Yiddish insert, <I>der slutsker magid</I> (the preacher from
Slutzk). "Preacher" is a Hebrew term for a religous profession, normally
spelled <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav07.gif"></SUB> = <I>mgid;</I> by inserting the vowel
<I>a,</I> Chagall indicates that the preaching was done in Yiddish.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The interactions between Hebrew and Cyrillic letters often hinged on
the direction: Hebrew and Yiddish read right to left, while Russian
goes from left to right.

<B></B>

 Sometimes he changed the direction of
a Hebrew text, as we saw in <I>The Cemetery Gate.</I> In one case
he even changed the order of the two tablets of the Ten Commandments,
indicating his double-directed culture. He signed a painting <I>MARC</I>
 <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav08.gif"></SUB>= <I>MARC [LAGASh]</I> (here, the Yiddish letters are represented in
square brackets, as they read in their normal Yiddish order, but when read
in reverse they sound <I>ShAGAL</I>). On the stage design of a train, in
Sholem-Aleichem's "Agents," he wrote 
<SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav09.gif"></SUB> =
<I>FAR REYKHER[ers] LK III</I> (for smokers [lk III]); when read in the
reverse direction, it says: III cl[ass], mixing Yiddish with Russian.

An interesting case appears in the mural <I>Introduction to the
Yiddish Theater,</I> which depicts Efros, the literary director of
the theater, bringing Chagall to the stage director Granovski. In a
preliminary study for this painting (<A
HREF="1.2harshav_6.html"> 16</A>), the Yiddish inscription
above the res, reads <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav10.gif"></SUB> = <I>IKSVVONARG
LAGASh  EFROS</I>. Efros, a Hebrew name traditionally spelled <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav11.gif"></SUB> =
<I>APRT</I> receives an outrageous Soviet spelling, <I>EFROS.</I> The
other two names are inverted; if read in the Russian direction, they read
"Shagal Granovski."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 This is similar to the reversible rhymes
(<I>perevertini</I>) in Russian Futurism, but it also expresses the
multicultural symbiosis of Chagall's generation. In the actual painting,
moreover (<A HREF="1.2harshav_7.html"> 17</A>), Chagall deletes
a letter in both his and Efros's
names and inserts miniature drawings of a literary critic and a painter
instead, thus achieving a double-media denotation. Further, in writing
in the director's name, he changes <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav12.gif"></SUB> = <I>S</I> into <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav13.gif"></SUB> =
<I>T,</I> and repeats the first syllable twice: <I>IKTIKTVNARG.</I>
When read
in reverse, we get <I>GRANV</I> (only half of the Yiddish <I>VV</I> is
left; the rest is redundant), but when read from left to right we get
<I>IKT IKT,</I> the Russian acronym of Granovski's theater as spelled
in Yiddish: "Ievreyskyj Kamernyj Teatr" (Jewish Chamber Theater). This
is a double characterization that combines the name of the director and
his theater, also underlining the fact that the director of the Yiddish
theater spoke not Yiddish, but Russian.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similar close attention to cultural details can be seen in the use of
typefaces in Chagall's paintings. In the Ashkenazi religious tradition,
which he knew from his childhood, Hebrew letters appeared in several
socially determined categories of typefaces:  The so-called square
letters (mostly based on straight lines or round backbones but with the
thickness elaborated in curvaceous forms and ornaments) were obligatory in
handwritten Torah Scrolls and in printings of the Bible, having an aura
of "holy text." In the Bible, the letters were accompanied by markers of
vocalization and syntactic-musical reading accents, in the form of tiny
dots, dashes, and other markers below, above, and inside letters. 
Moderate square letters were used as normal typefaces in printed Hebrew
and Yiddish, usually printed without the vocalization markers. Typically,
in engravings on a tombstone, the curvaceous embellishments could be
moderate, as imitated by Chagall in <I>The Cemetery Gate</I> or as later
developed by him in casual floating biblical names in his stained-glass
windows.  <I>Rashi</I> letters were used for commentaries printed on
the margins of a Bible or Talmud: a commentary must never be confused
with the holy text itself.  <I>Vayber-taytsh,</I> (women's typeface)--a
special script between printed and cursive--was used for books for women
on religious topics in Yiddish. All Hebrew words within the Yiddish,
however, are printed in Hebrew square letters, and placed in parentheses
in

<B></B>

midsentence, between the feminine words, not to mix the feminine
and masculine.  <I>Written letters</I> were used for writing in
longhand: for personal correspondence, manuscripts, and the like (with
"childish" and "adult" varieties).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chagall used square letters to indicate textual quotations from
religious texts, and moderate square letters for other "serious"
purposes. He--and the whole secular movement--would rarely use the
second-class <I>Rashi</I> or the women's scripts. He often used "written"
letters for the painter's personal message (e.g., the list of his siblings
and parents in <I>Introduction to the Yiddish Theater)</I> or to indicate
a character's personal statement ("I am an acrobat," "I am frolicking,"
written on the belts of the clowns standing on their heads).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet he also used the following types:  Modern printed letters,
which were developed in Yiddish and Hebrew secular literature; 
Geometrical letters, which reduce all letter shapes to straight strokes or
semicircles, as developed in the modern movement. Such letters were used
in Constructivist designs of book covers and in secular Yiddish schools
and institutions--for headlines, front pages, invitations, posters, etc.,
and were often given fancy geometrical forms and three-dimensional bodies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="8" HREF="1.2harshav_8.html">
<IMG
ALT=""#660066" 18. "
ALIGN="LEFT"
SRC="button/1.2harshav_8b.gif"></A>

One example is the cover of the Soviet Yiddish literary journal <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav14.gif"></SUB>
= <I>ShTROM</I> (<A HREF="1.2harshav_8.html"> 18</A>) ("stream" or
"torrent," connoting both the
torrential stream of the Revolution and the slogan of "going with the
stream," accepting it). The title is drawn on a diagonal bias, a favorite
device of Chagall. The first letter <I>Sh</I> is fully geometrical, but
inverts the traditional manner: in "square" letters, the base is thick and
the three diagonal strokes are thin; while here the base is just a line,
whereas the right side is thick. The body of the side stroke and the heads
of the two others are of a precise, quadrangular form, rather than the
traditional curving sides and heads.  The geometrical bodies are used as a
background for "construction" themes. The second letter, <I>T,</I> has a
geometricized imitation of the traditional rounded upper part. The third
and fourth letters <I>(R, O)</I> are modern, simplified, and stylized
imitations of square letters, whimsically Chagallized. The fifth letter,
<I>closing M</I> (used only at the end of a word) is again geometrically
"square" in its sides and in its overall closure--yet the parallel lines
move slightly apart, making dynamic the whole. The rectangle head has a
symbolic dollop on top. Thus Chagall uses his "demonstrative eclecticism"
repeatedly to evoke juxtapositions and surprises inside each letter and

cultural connotations are not lost on the reader.

Furthermore, the sides of the letters can be used as backgrounds for
Chagallian little res and shaded spaces. In the rectangular base of

Soviet spelling, "monthly journal."

The written letters,
however, have an unusual thickness that is rendered sometimes as a white

to the Constructivist <I>ShTROM,</I> like a personal letter to the reader;
yet the Constructivist part itself has been softened and humanized in
the middle (which El Lissitzky, taking Constructivism seriously,

<B></B>

would never have done) through the portrait of the head of a high school
boy, one of Chagall's emblems indicating general (Russian) education.

A very different cover was made two years later in Paris for the Yiddish

indicate "the Jews (Yiddish literature)

"beautiful" (with his thick, "feminine" lips) Peretz Markish hangs
down the top of the Eiffel Tower, holding the title <I>Khalyastre</I>

a written letter, with the others printed, yet rounded and moving in a
written direction. By juxtaposing typefaces, subverting and mixing them,
Chagall turns them into malleable graphic bodies; he uses their social
functionality, ironizes it, and foregrounds its problematic nature.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Throughout his career, Chagall has evoked interest in major centers of
art by means of his exotic pictorial world and surreal compositions. Yet
the extent to which his work owes its density of meaning to his local
culture has not been fully explored. Oversights and mistaken readings of
Jewish texts and subtexts are routine in recent criticism of Chagall,
even in the work of excellent scholars who have contributed greatly
to our understanding of his &#156;uvre. A recent book on Chagall in
Russia, for example, reproduces an illustration to a Yiddish children's
tale in verse by Der Nister, and subtitles it "The Sleeping Man and the
Cockerel"; yet inside the drawing itself there is a Yiddish inscription
in large, childish letters: "Little Grandma died"--a reference to the
poem, which plainly should have been read.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 In another book
the black hole on (the open-mouthed) grandma's face is interpreted as
a beard, producing the title <I>Man in Bed and Rooster.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An eminent Chagall specialist claims that in Chagall's milieu they "used
Hebrew mainly to talk to rabbis, preachers, and wandering men of God,"
while in fact no one, including the rabbis and preachers, spoke Hebrew
at the time. The same scholar identifies the painting <I>Feast Day</I>
as taking place on <I>Purim</I> instead of the serious <I>Sukoth,</I>
as the fruit (<I>ethrog</I> and <I>lulav</I>) in the man's hand and
his solemn posture indicate; it would be like confusing Halloween with
Christmas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Yet another important Chagall scholar discusses
two versions of <I>The Pinch of Snuff</I> based on a reading that assumes
one has an inscription "Life" and the other "Death"; but actually the
inscriptions (on the curtain of a Torah Scroll) read <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav16.gif"></SUB> = <I>HI</I>
(abbreviation of God's name), not <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav17.gif"></SUB>= <I>XI</I> (alive) and <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav18.gif"></SUB> =
<I>ST</I> (Torah Scroll) not <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/1.2harshav19.gif"></SUB> = <I>MT</I> (dead).
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>

Even specialists on Jewish art make similar mistakes. Hebrew and Yiddish
cultures parted company at the turn of the century, and living in
Jerusalem does not guarantee a deep knowledge of the Yiddish world. As
the Hebrew saying goes, "This is a discipline and it requires study."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ziva Amishai-Maisels, who has written several detailed Chagall studies,
has developed what amounts to a conspiracy theory, in which Chagall
appears as a great manipulator who inscribed his personal grudges (against
Malevich, Lissitzky, Granovski, the Christians, the Jews) as crossword
puzzles in his paintings. In her "In-Jokes" paper she claims that Chagall
"purposely [sic!] used Yiddish idioms and other Jewish sources in his
early works in a manner which made them incomprehensible to the Christian
world." And in the second version of her interpretation of "Chagall's
Murals for the State Jewish Chamber Theater,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 she accuses
Chagall of duplicity. On the one hand, "by visually translating Yiddish
idioms,"

<B></B>

 "which would be understood neither by Russian nor French
Christians...he could even assail with impunity the Christian religious
paintings which influenced him." On the other hand, "he showed his
discomfort with Judaism by utilizing modern formal elements which he felt
Jews would be less likely to understand." But Chagall hardly needed to
show discomfort with Judaism: his Jewish milieu and viewers were secular
atheists who also admired the formal innovations of modern art. Nor is
the use of Yiddish idioms an intentionally anti-Christian act. No evidence
in Chagall's writings or private correspondence supports such a view.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such claims are based on an essentialist ideology of racial "identity,"
which runs counter to the cosmopolitan, ambivalent, and polyphonic
consciousness of secular Jews in the twentieth century. Maisels's
references to Chagall's "identity-pendulum" and "the constant
oscillations in Chagall's [national] self-image"
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 are based
on the assumption of univalent ethnic identities (either Jewish or
French), and yet even her periodization of Chagall's identity cannot
be sustained. When, in her view, Chagall allegedly "returned to full
assimilation within the French world in 1923-35,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 he,
at the same time, made some forty illustrations to three volumes of
Lyesin's Yiddish poetry,
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 illustrated the Bible from a
Yiddish translation, corresponded with Yiddish writers, published
Yiddish poetry, and appealed to the YIVO (<I>yidisher visnshaftlekher
institut</I> [Yiddish Scientific Institute]) in Vilna in 1929 to erect
an international museum of Jewish art. At the same time, he complained
that Jews did not appreciate or commission art, and himself did little
work directly treating Jewish topics. In theoretical terms, moreover, the
artist's private pronouncements are not necessarily identical with the
complexity of his art; Freud, Kafka, or Einstein were more concerned with
their Jewishness in private correspondence than in their creative work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Was Chagall a "Jewish artist"? Or was he a Russian, French, or modern
artist? Is Salman Rushdie an Indian, Iranian, Muslim, or British
artist? Is Gauguin a Tahitian painter? Imposing a contemporary need for
exclusive racial identity on Chagall only brings him back to the ghetto he
strove to escape, and inadvertently excludes him from the more universal
canon of major modern artists. Today, we know much more about the role
of culture in art, and can understand that most creative work is done at
an intersection of several cultural strains. All Third World cultures
exhibit this daily. But identifying blood with form does not help. The
importance of cultural density and its interaction with formal problems
requires our knowledge of all cultural sources. An essentialist definition
of an artist is unnecessarily reductive and largely counterproductive;
only a perspectival cluster of several constructs will do justice to a
body of art as complex and multivalent as that of Chagall.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tensions between local culture and the new languages or arts were
fruitful for many artists of the period. Thus a recent major exhibition of
Joan Mirce to a body of art as complex and multivalent as that of Chagall.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">e of all cultural sources. An essentional Catalan."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

Jewish language and literature represent the earliest, linguistic
layers of Chagall's consciousness and are an essential part of his
private fictional world. It is no accident that the oral subtexts are
primarily in the "oral" language, Yiddish, and the written texts are
in the "Holy Tongue," Hebrew. Russian and French literary subtexts were
added in his illustrations when emanating from specific books, such as
the exquisite Russian provincial world of Gogol's <I>Dead Souls.</I> And
all those were perceived through painterly conceptions of the European
avant-garde and interacted with their stylistic tendencies: at first,
Russian Neo-Primitivism, the Russian reception of the Fauves, and the
"World of Art" decorative style, then cubism and Suprematism. In its
sources, Chagall's art represents cultural and stylistic eclecticism. Yet

<B></B>

eclecticism was a salient hallmark of many modernist artists. Since
the invention of cubism by Braque and Picasso, most artists felt impelled
to negotiate new combinations between cubist and other elements. Indeed,
the history of culture is a history of eclectic combinations and
recombinations. There is no reason to privilege a "pure" style over an
"eclectic" style, or, as we may call it, a polyphonic style; nor should
Malevich (though historically important and easily definable) be ranked
above the richer and more imaginative Chagall.

are, however, many mistakes and omissions in her reading of the Yiddish

For the illustrations to the Bible that Chagall made in
1930-31, he used the brilliant Yiddish translation of the Bible by the
American Yiddish poet Yehoash (sent to him by his friend Y. Opatoshu
from New York) and the images of the patriarchs are perceived in Eastern
European Jewish terms. Chagall had no Hebrew beyond Bar-Mitzva, and in

December 24, midnight--Christmas dinner. The European tradition
was imitated in everything: the music, the large illuminated pine
tree adorning the back of the drawing room and even in certain
delicacies: chestnuts, dates, apricots. This lack of authenticity
irks the purists of customs, who demand a tropical expression
of the Christmas celebrations. I don't know whether they're
right and if a substitution is really possible. I'm inclined
to believe that all this might even be more powerful, here,
than in its countries of origin.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Antropofagia</I> (cannibalism), an iconoclastic movement within
Brazilian literary modernism, drew upon the theme of cannibalism
as a central motif for its theoretical and artistic program in
the insouciant <I>Revista de Antropofagia (Cannibal Magazine)</I>
(1928-29); its principal res, the writer-intellectual Oswald de
Andrade (1890-1954) and the painter Tarsila do Amaral (1886-1973),
have long been recognized as powerful artists of major significance
and international status. Brazilian cannibalism created one of the most
innovative theories to be derived from the modernist fascination with the
primitive,
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 and was characterized by its mocking appropriation,
inversion, and local application of European

<B></B>

models, among them the
rhetoric of manifestos and the primitivist discoveries of the European
avant-gardes, both transposed to the spaces and races of Brazil's vast
interior. <I>Antropofagia</I> exploits its avant-garde posture to address
the question of Latin American cultural autonomy in dialogue with the
primitivism then attracting attention in Europe. Vitally engaged with
the question of Latin American cultural autonomy, <I>Antropofagia</I>
was a bold, provocative, if also ambiguous, attempt to respond to
the conflicting imperatives of cultural nationalism and pluralist
cosmopolitanism in a post-colonial context. Yet ever since the movement
was first formed in the late 1920s, and continuing to the present,
their work has been repeatedly taxed with charges of impurity and
inauthenticity, with being essentially a derivative imitation of the
European avant-gardes and lacking genuine roots in the soil of Brazilian
culture. Moreover, since the revival of interest in "cannibalism" in
the 1960s, <I>antropofagia</I> has been accused of failing to offer
a cultural program with serious social or political consequences for
Brazil, a charge that indirectly reinforces the earlier complaints about
cosmopolitan uprootedness. While these claims usefully acknowledge certain
limitations inherent in <I>antropofagia</I> from the beginning, they also
slight the genuine ambivalence of the movement's responses to European
culture and neglect the complexity of the Brazilian socio-cultural
setting in which that response was formulated. The choice that faced the
cannibalists was not so much between imported art and indigenous practice,
or between cultural colonialism and native resistance, but between one
version of nationalism, itself already saturated with European notions
of the telluric and soon to prove all too amenable to the spurious
nationalism of the Vargas regime, and another more nuanced sense of
cultural autonomy that explored the cross-relationship of primitive
Brazil with modernist Europe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 <I>Antropofagia</I> owed
little to ideas of recovering a lost authenticity and instead adopted
a more self-reflective and theoretical concept of national identity as
constructed difference. Largely forgotten, or even studiously neglected
by official cultural authorities in Brazil, this notion of identity may
prove to be a strategy of enduring value. Moreover, it may also help
us reconsider the increasingly reductive dichotomy between European
derivatives and indigenous authenticity. In the fractured world of post
colonialism, the choice is not between purity and its opposite, but
between competing kinds of impurity whose values are inseparable from
settings and circumstances.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To be sure, the origins of <I>antropofagia</I> are inseparable from
contemporary European fascination with the primitive. One of the crucial
lessons the Brazilians learn from the Parisian movements is how to value
the ethnic diversity and racial heterogeneity that would allow Brazil
to claim a primitivism of its own. The modernists from S&atilde;o Paulo
assert the primacy and superiority of man and nature in the New World,
in a reversal of nineteenth-century ideas about race and climate. Their
position is strengthened from their Parisian vantage point, where Amaral's
studio is a center of euphoria and exoticism in the world of primitive art
in the 1920s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Surveying Brazil from their urban and erudite
perspective, they come to equate indigenism, folklore, and ethnicity with
an authentic national

<B></B>

cultural definition. Although not indigenous
or folkloric themselves, the artists find it natural to incorporate
indigenous and folkloric themes into their works and to claim them as
their own, as equally valid representations of Brazilian reality. In
Paris, the Brazilian artists appropriate the expressive qualities of
European primitivism and <I>art n&egrave;gre,</I> and especially the
themes of excess and appetite that they recognize as apt for Brazil. They
use the forms provided by the plastic arts, the manifesto, Freudian
theory, and primitivist ethnology aesthetically to model these themes
into their own "primary materials." Through a calculated reformulation
of these common forms and themes, the Brazilians place themselves in a
position both to rewrite their national history and to cast themselves
as the rejuvenated descendants of the "sad races"--a term popularized
by poet Olavo Bilac that reflects the late nineteenth-century social
Darwinist and racialist theories of inferiority that had been applied
to Brazil's non-European and multiracial population. Tarsila do Amaral
and Oswald de Andrade embody the modernists' counterconception of racial
diversity as strength in the re of the cannibal who sits at the origin
of natural philosophies, perfectly in harmony with them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Antropofagia</I> will be described here in terms of avant-garde
aesthetics as an avenue to postcolonial intellectual autonomy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

The cannibal artists reject an intermediary identity that would cross
Europe with Brazil, and instead rebel against Europe, while at the same
time, paradoxically, drawing on their European experiences and education
to define Brazil as pure difference. In the cannibal, the Brazilian
group finds an aggressive symbol capable of subverting the primitivism
then in vogue in Europe, in order to rewrite colonial history and invert
the relationship between center and periphery. They exploit primitivism
conceptually by constructing a wild cultural and philosophical theory, in
which primitivism reconstructs national identity. <I>Antropofagia</I>
replaces the predominant colonial models with primal, indigenous,
Amazonian scenarios.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The central document of the cannibalist movement is Andrade's "Manifesto
Antropofago" (Cannibal Manifesto),
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 which begins by declaring
that the birth of logic was never permitted among the cannibals. The
manifesto follows a disorienting method of inversion, incorporation, and
metamorphosis, by which any entity can become its other by subjection
to the cannibalistic metaphor of ingestion, symbiosis, and change:
"Cannibalism.... The world's single law. Disguised expression of all
individualisms, of all collectivisms. Of all religions. Of all peace
treaties." The dynamic is one of transformation, in which the concepts
of race and ethnicity are ultimately brought to bear on questions of
identity, legitimacy, and authenticity. By allying themselves with
cannibalism in a gesture of playful exuberance, Brazilian avant-garde
artists reinvent primitive society from a New World perspective. They
explore cannibalism as a metaphor, broadened to include other ritual
practices, in a theory of national autonomy and development opposed to
Europe. First, they reverse colonial Brazilian historiography: "Down
with all the importers of canned consciousness. The palpable existence
of life. And the pre-logical mentality for Mr. L&eacute;vy-Bruhl to
study."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 They question the

<B></B>

ethics of discovery: "Down with
the antagonistic sublimations. Brought here in caravels. Down with the
truth of missionary peoples." Second, substituting periphery for center,
they propose indigenous society as a mythical locus for renewing Western
social philosophy, ethnography, and art: "We already had Surrealist
language. The Golden Age. Magic and Life." The cannibal occupies a
remote site to which the West is perennially and unconsciously returning
in search of social and economic utopias. Thus, <I>antropofagia'</I>s
rediscovery of the primitive New World is also placed in counterpoint with
colonial texts of discovery. Working with an avant-garde vocabulary, they
devised a clever point-counterpoint that was influenced by the logic of
anti-art manifestos.

Two artworks, separated by four centuries, introduce and orient the
interpretation of <I>antropofagia</I> in the 1920s, with respect to
both its effort to recast national cultural history and its attempt
to establish a complex, reflexive relationship with Europe and the
European avant-garde. The first work consists of fifty-six woodcuts
printed in the original 1557 edition of the travels of Hans Staden,
a German adventurer who was captured during his first trip to Brazil
by the cannibalistic Tupinamb&aacute; tribe. The woodcuts illustrate
Staden's experiences during his eight years with the tribe, which he
called wild, naked, fierce, and cannibalistic. Several woodcuts depict
an orgiastic banquet in the central ground of the village, where tribal
maidens are greedily devouring roasted body parts (<A
HREF="1.2jackson_1.html"> 1</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

The primitive style of the woodcuts enhances the impression of barbarity
given by the cannibal scenes. While some victims are being dismembered
and devoured, others are shown awaiting their fate, creating an account
that could be called "black" anthropology. In Brazil, these scenes
were reprinted and popularized in a deeply ironic vein in the first
"dentition" of the <I>Revista de Antro-pofagia</I>, used to illustrate
the first printing of Andrade's manifesto.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second work is a painting by Tarsila do Amaral, dated 11 January
1928 and titled <I>Abaporu</I>; see cover illustration).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

It depicts in brilliant colors a featureless savage with crossed legs,
a large foot, and a small head sitting in a stylized tropical landscape
of cacti and sun. With their static forms and dynamic undercurrents of
color, Amaral's paintings suggest a neoclassical modernity of simple
yet excessive elements that is visibly linked to her apprenticeship
with Fernand L&eacute;ger. The indigenous res are depicted as pure
form and volume without movement, as massive sculptures of bodies that
are all color and shape, and possess a neoclassical balance. Excess
is conveyed aesthetically through giant forms that defy the canvas's
capacity to contain them, and is expressed culturally in the symbol of a
prolific nature, a lemon slice of sun. Prepared for her husband Oswald de
Andrade's birthday, Amaral's canvas becomes the most significant piece
in her <I>antropofagia</I> phase and, predating the manifesto, founds
the icon-ography of Brazil's avant-garde primitivism, anticipating the
ideological tenets of Andrade's literary manifesto.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The relationship of these two works epitomizes the creative tensions
governing <I>antropofagia.</I> Staden's cannibalistic story, embedded in
Brazil's colonial background, foregrounds the modernists' paradoxical
relationship with European

<B></B>

 culture, from distaste to fascination,
and shapes their reception of European primitivist currents.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

Through primitivism, the Brazilian modernists resolve an intellectual
dilemma that concerned Latin America in general: the desire to maintain
close connections to European intellectual culture, and to preserve
the racial and cultural heterogeneity that characterized their own
societies. <I>Antropofagia</I> carves out a space between these desires,
claiming descent from two primal fathers, Staden and <I>Abaporu:</I>
the new primitivists would take pleasure in reading Staden's diary
while eating him. Andrade would later write,  "Since Bilac, we are
internationalists and junior Portuguese."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 The manifesto's
outrageous claims against Europe acquire an uncanny verisimilitude
because of Brazil's dual nature as a primitive and independent New
World and as a colonial vice-world of Portugal. In the ritual banquet
of incorporation, the <I>abaporu</I> absorbs the sacred enemy to
assimilate his virtues.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 For the modernists, the symbolic
meal is gratifying yet ultimately ambiguous, since it represents both
overcoming and becoming Europe.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If cannibals belonged to Brazil, the cannibal text had originated
in Europe;
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 since Montaigne and Staden, cannibal tales
have been a prime source for the

<B></B>

Western imagination, documenting
indigenous barbarism with judgments and perspectives ingrained in most
of Brazil's elite. The desire of <I>antropofagia</I> to affirm cultural
autonomy, political decolonization, and emancipation from European
literary traditions leads the learned cannibals to invert the primitive
banquet text. Andrade quickly perceived in the near devouring of the
German traveler a liberating metaphor that would, if inverted to the
Tupinamb&aacute; per-spective, exorcise the national appetite for all
things European. The goal of his inversion, in its shock effect, is to
replace the oppressive patriarchal system identified with Europe, which
Andrade saw both as legacy and disease, with the utopian matriarchy
of the tribe: "The paterfamilias and the creation of the Morality
of the Stork.... In the matriarchy of <I>Pindorama</I> [a Tupy word
referring to the land now known as Brazil]." Through this substitution,
the cannibal not only appropriates the technology of the discoveries
through ingestion, but at the same time remains a mythical source for
these positive qualities of civilization that Europe had lost: "Joy is
the proof by nines." European primitivism is therefore marshalled against
itself, its meaning inverted in favor of Brazil. <I>Antro-pofagia</I>
repatriates the cannibal library, while posing as a pseudocatechism of
salvation. In view of Brazil's lack of pre-sixteenth-century history,
<I>antropofagia</I> further provides a subtext for the missing mythical,
epic fable of national origins. <I>Abaporu</I> is Ulysses posing as
ethnographical hero. The savage hero, an explorer invented in Europe,
returns as the native son of a more original civilization, organized from
the heartland and governed by the powerful icons of nature's luxuriance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though European paradigms and intellectual traditions are explicitly used
as reference points in the formulation of Brazilian modernist theories,
much of their work also derives from unsung antecedents in their national
historiography. These include works on ethnography, Tupy-Portuguese
grammars, early religious drama, sermons, travel accounts, writing about
the Amazon, and epic poems on Indianist themes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 One can also
perceive in <I>antropofagia</I> a recasting of stereotypes of romantic
Indianism and Amazonian exoticism, both remote enough from contemporary
awareness to be mythical. Is the <I>abaporu</I> not a distant relative
of the noble savage Peri, hero of Alencar's novel <I>O Guarani</I> and
Carlos Gomes's opera?
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Does the utopian matriarchy of
<I>Pindorama</I> in the "Cannibal Manifesto" not suggest the myth of the
Amazons, rumored in texts of discovery to be a jungle tribe of female
warriors who sacrificed their male offspring? Interest in the Amazon
is shared in works by other Brazilian artists in Paris.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 In
this sense, primitivism is a national movement that could be equated with
traditional symbols of an autochthonous Brazilian culture, located in the
timeless, vast interior, and emanating from the racial and geographic
diversity of the population. Primitivism, seen as a higher form of
regionalism, is thus placed at the service of ethnology, while the
assertion of the superiority of miscegenation and cultural diversity
replaces an earlier prejudice concerning the racial inferiority and
degeneracy of Brazilians on a national level.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Motifs representing vastness and fecundity, long a part of national
histor-iography, are reformulated as part of an ambitious aesthetics of
excess. "In a radiant land live three sad races," repeats the S&atilde;o
Paulo intellectual and planter Paulo Prado in his 1928 "Portrait of
Brazil," as if it were a truism. Prado's phrase first invokes references
to radiance, grandiosity, and sensuality commonly used by Portuguese
chroniclers to describe the qualities of the newly discovered land,
which the modernists themselves still considered pure, inexhaustible, and
ahistorical.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 In contrast to the races saddened by history
and genetics, nature's radiance contributes to the Brazilian modernists'
aesthetic of excess. The implications of this concept are crucial to our
understanding of the role of the non-European intellectual in constructing
a peripheral primitivism. First, excess is an aesthetic that is derived
from the European avant-garde movements themselves, in their rejection
of the past and the status quo. Through primitivism, <I>antropofagia</I>
transforms this relationship to the past into an enhanced, imaginative,
and paradoxical treatment of national primitivism, whose aggressive
components are turned against their European sources. Furthermore, in a
move that is decisive for the aftermath of the movement, the Brazilian
cannibals seek to associate avant-garde primitivism with national identity
through the metaphor of devouring. Finally, this move also strengthens the
idea that Brazilian or Latin American art is fundamentally characterized
by excess, whether it be found in colonial chronicles, in the whimsical
local baroque style of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in
modernist manifestos, or in the graphics of concrete poetry. Excess is
linked with themes of utopia and libertinism, both of which apply to
readings of Andrade's literary cannibalism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Antropofagia</I> locates excess in a telluric primitivism,
and illustrates it in the extravagance of its ringing claims:
"Down with the vegetable elites. In communication with the
soil.... Before the Portuguese discovered Brazil, Brazil had
discovered happiness." To promote a different historical awareness,
the manifesto also ridicules the prophetic texts of Western discovery:
"Routes. Routes. Routes. Routes. Routes. Routes. Routes. The Carib
instinct." The "Cannibal Manifesto," with its extravagant claims, becomes
the Brazilian avant-garde's epiphanic recapitulation of epic texts
such as the colonial chronicles that recount miraculous and unexpected
discoveries. The cannibalists' critical writings displace the chronicles
and reclaim the land in the name of indigenous cultures. Language itself
is also carried to excess, whether in the invocation of untranslated Tupy
verse garnished from Couto de Magalh&atilde;es ("Catiti Catiti / Imara
Noti&aacute; / Noti&aacute; Imara / Ipej&uacute;")
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 or in the
reduction of Shakespeare to comic paranomasia: "Tupy or not Tupy, that is
the question." The destruction of the colonial text through parody and
rewriting wipes out colonial historiography and amounts to an atavistic
declaration of independence, whether in the name of indigenism or of
avant-garde techniques. By appropriating the metaphor of discovery, the
cannibal modernists create a new tropical vocabulary and a mythology of
nature's riches that are shaped by the indigenous cultural perspectives
they have invented.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prado's lyrical description of the sadness of Brazil's native Americans,
Africans, and Europeans recapitulates the synesthesia of a verse by
poet Olavo Bilac (Brazil's music was the "amorous flower of three sad
races"); both reflect different degrees of assimilation of the racial
theories and concerns prevalent in Brazil since romanticism. Various
theories exist to explain racial sadness: perhaps it stemmed from
existential anguish resulting from a history of conquest and slavery;
or it was the result of "scientific" racialist theories of inferiority
and degeneracy that had been applied to the majority of Brazil's
multi-racial population.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 The racial ideals and attitudes of
the modernists, in spite of their explicit alliance with indigenism, were
of necessity imbued with the positivism, materialism, and evolutionism
that were widespread in Brazil after 1876. Centered in the Recife school
of Tobias Barreto, materialist theories fed a reaction against Catholic
humanism and in favor of applied science, through readings of Comte,
Darwin, Taine, Renan, and Haeckel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Skidmore notes that
positivism was attractive to a largely white elite interested in economic
development without social change, and was bolstered by the general
belief that the historically multiracial society of Brazil was free of
racial prejudice (<I>BW,</I> 13, 22). Miscegenation and evolutionary
processes, it was thought, were acting in favor of "civilization" through
a successive "whitening" of the general population over time, a result
of the long-term effects of European immigration; racial fusion, whose
end result would be a unified Brazilian population, could be promoted
because of confidence in eventual white predominance. As Andrade dryly
observed in his poem, "Capital of the Republic":

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Liberal ideas of the late nineteenth century, however, were propounded
in a society not essentially different from what it had been in the
early days of the century (<I>BW,</I> 27). A contradictory state of
affairs was created whereby liberal reformers first advanced theories of
social Darwinism, and many intellectuals were affected by categories
of scientific racism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Brazilian intellectual circles
were in fact dominated by concerns with backwardness, inferiority, and
degeneracy that had been put forth in racialist theories of Brazil, found
in the works of such European and North American res as Henry Thomas
Buckle, Arthur Comte de Gobineau, and Agassiz or the Argentine Jos&eacute;
Ingenieros. Critic and essayist S&iacute;lvio Romero, while unsure what
miscegenation would ultimately contribute to the nation's future, gave a
pessimistic assessment of the three major racial groups: "the senility of
the Negro, the laziness of the Indian, the authoritarianism and miserly
talent of the Portuguese had produced a shapeless nation with no original
or creative qualities" (<I>BW,</I> 36).
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Partially echoing Romero forty years later, M&aacute;rio de Andrade's
multiracial character Macuna&iacute;ma,
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 emperor of the jungle
Amazons, is vaunted as a new national

<B></B>

 symbol in the novel's subtitle,
"a hero without any character," even though his talent for racial
metamorphosis and his sexual prowess are presented as magical, positive
qualities. Through Macuna&iacute;ma, modernist primitivism asserts that
indigenous societies lack a history or a blueprint for the future, and
occupy a space that is vacant of organized culture, save what repeats
or replies to the West.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The primitive is conceived through
difference and inversion, qualities vocalized in Macuna&iacute;ma's
endearing cry of pleasure, "Ai! Que pregui&ccedil;a!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

Macuna&iacute;ma serves M&aacute;rio de Andrade's desire to satirize
modern culture by subjecting it to the Amazon hero's critical eye. In the
chapter "Letter to the Icamiabas," for example, Macuna&iacute;ma writes
from S&atilde;o Paulo to his subjects, the Icamiabas, using the latinate
language of Lisbon and signing himself "Imper-ator." Playing on the themes
of culture and barbarity, Macuna&iacute;ma reveals to his female subjects
that they are spuriously called "Amazons" by the uncultured inhabitants of
the city. Parodying discovery texts, the letter cast Macuna&iacute;ma in
the role of classicist, defending the humanism of the Amazons against the
nascent materialism of S&atilde;o Paulo's industrial modernization. Thus,
while modernists such as M&aacute;rio de Andrade brought folklore into
being as a discipline in Brazil, indigenous traditions and cultures
were at the same time inevitably read with modernist eyes and shaped
by the literary desire to transpose and filter the primitive hero into
Western terms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">M&aacute;rio de Andrade begins his novel by describing Macuna&iacute;ma
as "the hero of our people, born in the depths of the virgin jungle
as black as the son of the fear of night." Racial difference in
<I>Macuna&iacute;ma</I> is profoundly connected both to nature and to
mythology; it is not a fixed quality, but rather is subject to sudden
transmutation. In the chapter "Piam&atilde;," M&aacute;rio de Andrade
constructs a modern myth of race and society. When black Macuna&iacute;ma
and his brothers Jigu&ecirc; and Manaape leave the jungle village of
Tapanhumas on their way to S&atilde;o Paulo to recover the goddess Ci's
magic amulet, they encounter a river in which Macuna&iacute;ma spots
a massive rock in midstream, creating a pond shaped like a gigantic
foot. Shouting because the water is so cold, Macuna&iacute;ma reaches
the grotto and takes a bath, not knowing the water is enchanted because
the footprint was made by a saintly missionary who had been evangelizing
the Indians. The water's effect leaves Macuna&iacute;ma white, blond,
and blue-eyed. When Jigu&ecirc; witnesses this magical transformation,
he too rushes to enter the water. But so much blackness has been washed
off Macuna&iacute;ma that the dirty water leaves him only bronzed. When
Manaape goes to bathe, there is so little water remaining that he
is able only to wet the soles of his hands and feet, which become
reddened because of the holy water. While as a result of this episode
Macuna&iacute;ma is the best prepared to enter "civilization," Manaape
is said to be the true son of the Tapanhumas: a combination of black and
red. Racial "whitening" as an ideal is parodied as the occult desire of
Catholic evangelicals to change indigenous peoples into themselves. The
saint's gigantic foot, ironically, finds an unexpected ally in the
cannibalistic metaphor of Amaral's <I>Abaporu,</I> whose enormous foot
symbolizes being in nature. M&aacute;rio de Andrade's command of the
primitive,

<B></B>

magical powers of metamorphosis brings mythology and
linguistic virtuosity into contact with the magical transformations
of the folktale. Notwithstanding the flaws of their times, these
modernist writers and artists succeed in counteracting the pervasive

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oswald de Andrade's "Brazilwood Poetry Manifesto"  and the
volume of <I>Brazilwood Poetry</I> ,
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 illustrated by
the colorist, geometrical "brazilwood"-style paintings of Tarsila do
Amaral, are crucial predecessors to the "Cannibal Manifesto," for they
attempt to redefine Brazil by assimilating mechanical modernization to
telluric ethnicity. When Andrade proclaims, in his first manifesto, the
symbiosis of "the forest and the school" in a new Brazilian society, he
places shamans alongside military airfields and electric turbines in the
National Museum. In a modernist world, Brazil's savage territory is the
most modern of all, drawing deepest both from nature and mechanization
and ultimately demonstrating their interdependence. European traditions
are more deeply felt in Brazil because their coexistence with indigenous
and Afro-Brazilian cultures brings them closer to the dark heart of
their own primitive origins and occult meanings, where their symbolism
is made more glaringly apparent as ritual and artifice. The 1924
manifesto, for example, reacts against the false erudition of the Empire:
"Misfortune of the first white brought over, politically dominating the
wild wilderness. The alumnus. We can't help being erudite. Doctors of
philosophy. Country of anonymous ills, of anonymous doctors." Pero Vaz
Caminha's letter of discovery of 1500, quoted in Andrade's poetry, relates
how European food and eating habits were imposed on the astonished
Indians, who had no interest in Portuguese fowl; the raising of a
giant cross on shore with the participation of the Indians convinces
the conquerors that religious conversion was all but complete. In this
world of assimilation, European customs are taken out of their milieu
and melded with indigenous and African practices. The Afro-Brazilian
religion, <I>condombl&eacute;,</I> unites African, indigenous, and
Catholic religious practices and beliefs. Macuna&iacute;ma performs a
<I>macumba</I> ritual in order to punish the villain who possessed his
magic amulet; and M&aacute;rio de Andrade quotes widely in his novel
from the <I>cordel</I> literature of Brazil's Northeast, a literature
that was printed in popular chapbooks, and combined features of the
medieval Iberian folktale, the chivalric epic, and performed lyric
verse. Such fusions yield a nationalized tropical folklore, later claimed
and authenticated by the purists of local tradition mentioned by Osman
Lins.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "Brazilwood Poetry Manifesto" advances an iconography of cultural
transformation whose modernizing ambitions are confirmed in Amaral's
paintings, and whose purpose is, in Andrade's terms, a general
reconstruction of society. Their shared vision flashes exuberantly with
the bright colors observed in popular society: "shacks of saffron and
ochre in the green of the Favela, under Cabralin blue." Tropical nature
and a hybrid culture, colored by race and ethnicity, generate images of
ostentation and excess that incongruously unite opposites and appear
out of context: "Rui Barbosa: a top hat in Senegambia.... Negresses
at the jockey club. Odalisques in Catumbi." Brazilwood poetry,
agile and candid like a wandering kodak--to borrow its own striking
simile--was to be the country's first exportable structure in a new poetic
mercantilism. Promoting a national style through a program of simplicity,
irony, ingenuousness, and naturalness, this new perspective humorously
describes and justifies what amounts to an excessive penetration of
modernity into land and society at all levels. Brazil's past, epitomized
by a lawyer citing Virgil to the Tupiniquins, becomes but a painful and
anonymous memory; the present, under the slogan "barbarous and ours," is
constructed from a synchronic cultural perspective using the techniques of
modernist art: synthesis, invention, and surprise. Both as a way of life
and as a modern style, Brazilwood's carefully constructed naturalness
cultivates a self-conscious tropicality: "<I>Pau Brasil</I> poetry is a
Sunday dining room with birds singing in the condensed forest of cages,
a thin fellow composing a waltz for flute and Mary Lou reading the
newspaper. The present is all there in the newspaper." Those cultural
images that had been selected to constitute the modernist style are
transformed into enduring scenic and sensual icons of tropicalized Brazil:
<I>carnaval, sert&atilde;o,</I> and <I>favela.</I> Andrade locates the
luxuriance of Brazil's modernity partly in its open ethnicity, from the
<I>vatap&aacute;</I> of Afro-Brazilian cuisine to the dance, and partly
in "brazilwood" nature: the silent, tranquil energy of botanical and
mineral wealth under an enervating sun. Ethnicity resembles nature in its
sensual, energetic, and indolent wisdom; the portraits of the glad races
are redrawn using the pure lines and colors of modern art.

One of Amaral's finest works is <I>Carnival in Madureira</I> (<A
HREF="1.2jackson_2.html"> 2</A>),
another canvas in the style of geometrical cubism that she learned
in Paris from L&eacute;ger and used to depict cultural landscapes
that document Brazil's modern identity as it was being theorized in
<I>Brazilwood Poetry.</I> Amaral employed this style in some forty
paintings from 1923-27, known as her <I>Pau Brasil</I> phase. The painting
succeeds in creating a particularly rich fusion of European structural
elements (geometric cubism) and American realities (folklore, popular
culture, rustic folk from the interior), with the resulting incongruities
that give the work its characteristic <I>Pau Brasil</I> identity. The
scene of a popular Brazilian rural celebration of <I>carnaval</I>
by the town's black inhabitants, a world summarized by the shapes
and colors of a village of the interior, is invaded by a strange and
overpowering central structure that we recognize as the Eiffel Tower
with its geometric cubism. It overshadows the only other re rising
above the village houses and hilltops, a palm tree representing tropical
nationalism. The tower was perhaps built by the

<B></B>

celebrants as a
carnivalesque fantasy originating in the village. But as an allegory of
the carnivalesque imagination, its strangeness suggests a transposition
of the technological, civilized city of its origin to the animated space
of the primitive village of mulatto or black Brazilians. In the same
fashion, the villagers carry their Afro-Brazilian and primitivist roots
to the European carnival, itself transposed to a propitious environment
of tropical excess. In an inversion justified by the "Brazilwood Poetry
Manifesto," the native women dominate the Eiffel Tower by appropriating
its geometry, in the shape of an inverted <I>V,</I> for their own
bodies. In the foreground, an extremely tall, thin woman assumes the same
position as the tower, which now becomes a popular projection of tropical
playfulness and folkloric nationalism. There are still other levels of
significance and irony, in the choice of the Eiffel Tower. Paris had
been the center of Brazilian cultural aspiration since colonial times
and, further, was the source of inspiration of Amaral's painting. The
painting's excess stems from the incongruity of its juxtapositions,
whatever historical and cultural antecedents may justify them; for the
viewer, this creates an effect of ethnographic surrealism, as a modernist
icon is transformed into a fetish that infiltrates and dominates both
imagination and society.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Language is also subjected to brazilwood simplification and
synthesis. Andrade's goal is to Brazilianize the Portuguese language,
rejecting archaisms

<B></B>

and erudition while proclaiming the naturalness
of neological forms, which should come into everyday usage from contact
with languages such as Tupy-Guarani and Yoruba. Taking a position against
normative linguistic rules and Jesuit grammars, Andrade praises "the
millionaire contribution of all mistakes." He thinks popular speech will
contain the mythical truths of indigenous lore, which should be capable
of totemizing mystery and death when uttered by the glad races as pure
sound. In the poem "Brasil," the nation is defined by ethnic speech that
conveys meaning exclusively through chant, rhythm, and incantation:
"Tetteray tettay Keez&aacute; Keez&aacute; Kaysay!" (the Guarani);
"Uuh! Uah! Uuh!" (the jaguar); "Canyem Bab&aacute; Canyem Bab&aacute;
Cum Cum!" (the Negro). In the manifesto, the excessive, sensual, and
alogical qualities of pure language express the two symbolic extremes
of human activity: carnival and prayer.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crucial role of Afro-Brazilians in modern society is another
central theme of Andrade's manifesto and his poetry: "You have the train
loaded, ready to leave. A Negro churns the crank of the turn-table
beneath you. The slightest carelessness and you will leave in the
opposite direction to your destination." The black engineer supplies
not only the physical labor for this allegorical train ride into the
interior but also guides the controls that will keep it on track and
determine its destination.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  In the poem "sabar&aacute;,"
the name of a colonial city in the mountains of Minas Gerais, Andrade
contrasts the sun and the metallic gold of the streams to the black
wave of human slaves whose mythical strength was continuously sifting
the riverbed: "There used to be black men lined along the shore, to
siphon the metallic river." "Combat" brings to life a match between
black and white prizeters: "Benedito attacks and lands / right-hand
punches / He's pushed the white man against the ropes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 In
"On the Plantation," "a ro&ccedil;a," Andrade ties the strength of the
slaves to the linguistic rhythm and musicality of their food (lost in the
English translation): "os cem negros da fazenda / comiam feij&atilde;o e
angu / Aban against the ropes."erbed: "There usema roda de carro / Nos
bra&ccedil;os" (The plantation's hundred negroes / Ate beans and mush
/ Chickory squash and squash greens / They could pick up a wagon wheel

of Negro civilization during slavery, with all its attendant mixture of
horror and humanity, seen in "Incident,"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first declaration of the "Cannibal Manifesto" in which cannibalism
is extolled as a universal metaphor for societies at large is its
most excessive and subversive: "Cannibalism alone unites us.... The
world's single law." The "Cannibal Manifesto" sets forth an ideological
framework for the Brazilian avant-garde, borrowing from the language
of European manifestos in order to proclaim a new Brazilian cultural
cannibalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Jumping across boundaries--whether the law,
the text, or society--is a practice directly advocated by the metaphor
of cannibalism, in that it evokes a contagious, ritual, and obsessive
devouring of limits. Since the cannibal had been relegated to the status
of alien by Western society because of his forbidden yet hypnotizing
taste for human flesh, Andrade strikes a sensitive chord in probing the
forbidden, consuming desires sanctioned by cannibal "law," which becomes
a central point in the modernist critique of society, psychology, and
art. The Brazilian is incorruptibly indigenous, Andrade hints, and has
always harbored primitive impulses under a playful veneer of European
politics and vestments: "The Indian dressed as senator of the Empire." The
perverse intermingling of racial boundaries implicit in Staden's
woodcuts--indigenous eaters and European victims--becomes a matter of
justice in the "Cannibal Manifesto." Cannibal justice is even more eagerly
applied to questions of gender through the supremacy of matriarchy. An
unsublimated sexual instinct is the revenge of the matriarchs; it is
also the sublime limit of the cannibalistic metaphor that symbolizes
a Brazilian utopia that is carnal both in the undressed flesh of the
tribe and in the dressings of the banquet. The cannibalistic metaphor
thus becomes an aesthetic that reaches across the boundaries of race,
gender, and ethnicity by representing the nature and laws of the glad
races through their difference from colonial realities.

In Amaral's 1929 painting, <I>Antropofagia</I> (<A
HREF="1.2jackson_3.html"> 3</A>) primitivism
is an aesthetic, a theory, and the source of a modernist national
mythology. This canvas in effect synthesizes the forces of her earlier
treatments of ethnicity and cannibalism, <I>A Negra</I>  and
<I>Abaporu</I> . Amaral works with forms that are icons in the
semiotics of tropical indigenism as rediscovered in its modernist
luxuriance. Her 1923 portrait of a black woman is already a complete

realization of the <I>antropofagia</I> style: a gigantic sitting re
occupies a landscape of geometrical forms and colors, dominating the
foreground with her outlined presence. She is all shape, with a few large
features symbolizing race and social function. A prominent breast with
nipple is draped over her arm; thick, protruding lips and a broad nose
intimate African ancestry. The woman is almost pure form, sitting in her
habitat in an eternal pose. The painting <I>Antropofagia</I> repeats
the gigantic images that threaten to overflow the margins with their
volume and presence. Once again, the black woman is a plain re whose
only attributes are a small head, an enormous foot, and one suspended
breast, but now she is accompanied by the <I>abaporu,</I> whose giant
foot crosses her own. The sun, now overwhelmed by monolithic forms of
green tropical foliage, is a more clearly drawn lemon slice than in the
previous painting.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everywhere the painting gestures toward excess--the energy in
the gargantuan forms; the power of natural forces conveyed in the
serendipitous hyperbole of form and concept; and the tiny heads and
enormous feet that represent a rejection of ideas and a oneness with an
exuberant nature. Out of the jungle's "spectacular tranquillity"--to
quote <I>Pau Brasil--</I>comes an irrepressible vitality. Eternal and
depersonalized, the human res are icons of primordial space and
embodiments of the newly discovered "primitive mentality." Cannibalism
vitalizes the serene iconography into a visual and "theological" feast,
an appetite for an ethnographical ambrosia of flesh, sun, nudity, and
foliage. Color, like language in poetry, connects force with simplicity,
and in this painting, it is revitalized through the radiance and excess
of a constructed tropical purity. Containing parody, stylization, and
habitat, the painting is self-reflective about its construct-ivist
and postcubist borrowings. Tropicalization of form, space, and color
adds to the myth of excess and to the ideology of luxuriant emptiness
that characterizes primitive space and culture in the modernist
imagination. Like the subsumed cannibal banquet, the painting is a
celebratory ritual of voracious and predatory expansiveness; the scene
orates an epic fable of erotic, exotic, and unconscious geographies. Being
and acting instinctually, the black and the Indian look out of the
painting at the Western observer, not with the longing of <I>saudade</I>
(a medieval Portuguese word, considered untranslatable, conveying a
kind of intense longing and melancholy), but with what the observer
imagines to be unalienated joy, ritual fulfillment, and unrepressed
appetite. Amaral's iconography enhances <I>antropofagia'</I>s portrait
of the primitive as a young, glad, racially mixed Brazilian.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two Europeans, Bishop Sardinha and Hans Staden, serve to set the

<I>homo ludens. Antropofagia</I>, like the French Revolution, establishes
a new calendar dating from the devouring of Bishop Sardinha (Sardine)
by the Caet&eacute;s in 1556; Staden's woodcuts and narrative give the
revolutionary dinner ethnographic credibility. In view of its debt to
Staden, the "Cannibal Manifesto" can be read as the transatlantic bridge
between a New World "savage utopia," rooted in the body and developing as
an erotic perversion of origins, and a traditional pagan neoclassicism,
represented in the earthly paradise. It is a dialogic banquet of culture
and food, eating and reading, raw and cooked, speech and text, in which
one discursive domain passes into another.

In these synthetic, capsule inscriptions, Andrade cannibalizes European
cultural and theoretical statements and opposes the rationality that
sustains them; <I>antropofagia</I> digests its European referents. The
voices of the glad races call out from the depths of Brazil's interior,
at once echoing and correcting Europe with the newly found authority
of primitive and mythical origins: "I am only concerned with what is
not mine. Law of Man. Law of the cannibal." Excess and allusion are the
subversive tools used to invert European practice and replace it with
a revolutionary primitivism based on nature and instinct: "We want the
Carib Revolution. Greater than the French Revolution. The unification of
all productive revolts for the progress of humanity. Without us, Europe
wouldn't even have its meager declaration of the rights of man." Andrade's
goal is modernist autonomy not only in literature but in society as well.

In an imagined "Carib Revolution," the glad, strong races, secure in
a sane land isolated from Old World diseases identified by Freud, mock
Europe while appropriating the occult objects of its desires. Freudian
psychology, in fact, is Andrade's main source for describing the defects
of the European mind: "Down with the dressed and oppressive social reality
registered by Freud." His task is a complex and utopian rediscovery of
origins and rewriting of history: "reality without complexes, without
madness, without prostitutions and without penitentiaries, in the
matriarchy of <I>Pindorama.</I>" Whether read socially, economically,
philosophically, or ethnographically, the cannibalistic metaphor cuts
across all boundaries. It answers Europe's dialectical obsession with
heavens and hells by combining in the Tupy feast of cannibal rhetoric
the leisure and eroticism of natural luxuriance, the joy incarnated
in an icon or a totem, and the technology of social and psychological
machinery. Primitive gladness replaces Western themes of utopia and
salvation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Antropofagia'</I>s program stages an attempt to use modernity for the
purpose of subverting European primacy and paradigms. For the Brazilian
cannibals, the primitivist idea is a useful catalyst for changing the
relationship between national literature and art and their European
background. As a program for local authenticity, however, the cannibal
enterprise contains inherent contradictions and paradoxes--limited
contact with Brazil's racial and geographical diversity, the manifesto's
dependence on literary sources, and the use of cosmopolitan models to
construct a national modernity out of Brazil's primitive world of the
interior. Although one of their major contributions is to legitimize the
positive values of race and ethnicity as lasting components of national
identity, the modernist program as a prototype for contemporary art can be
criticized for an excessive confidence in its ability to speak for native
peoples; the massive destruction of ecology and extinction of tribes in
Amazonia since 1960 shows that the modernists never questioned the ability
of the tribal primitive--the new heart of national identity--to survive
the forces of modernity and modernization that they endorsed. They
are neither sufficiently aware of the implications of their highly
centralist and reductionist concept of national autonomy, nor wary
of the power of cannibalism to consume Brazil's own interior. Albeit
ingenious, the movement's position was thus inauthentic because, to
use Clifford's terms, it was "caught between cultures, implicated
in others."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Perhaps this is simply to say that it was
international. It was, after all, in the rebellious atmosphere of the
continental avant-garde movements that Amaral and Andrade learned to value
primitivism as part of their Latin American domain. The tensions in their
intellectual position, denoting constant exchange between self and other,
reflect their own historical moment. The dynamic but unstable dialectical
system of <I>antro-pofagia</I> is likewise descriptive of Brazil's own
past, which had depended upon both telluric and metropolitan traditions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Referring to North American authors who portray another race, John
R. Cooley condemns the simplification of the primitivist subject, the
lack of regard for the reality of primitive life, and the exploitation
of the primitive as a sounding

board for the writer's own
perspectives.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  In the Brazilian case, although the writing
ascribed to the primitive voice from the outside is similarly feigned and
inauthentic, the illogic and surreality of a cannibal's manifesto falls
within the spirit of Andrade's project and thus constitutes a convincing
text. Andrade seems keenly aware of the irony of his appropriations as
an outsider; he justifies them by changing European prime materials
into a different language, a savage discourse: "Children of the sun,
mother of the living. Discovered and loved ferociously with all the
hypocrisy of <I>saudade,</I> by the immigrants, by slaves and by the
<I>touristes.</I> In the land of the Great Snake." On a rhetorical level,
the manifesto can be defended both as a parody and as the apotheosis
of the genre. It begins by mocking Marx--"Cannibalism alone unites
us. Socially. Economically. Philosophically"--and ends by suggesting
the rediscovery of an actual pagan paradise through cannibalism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet the limitations of avant-garde indigenism are betrayed by a
superficial familiarity and romantic identification with the tribal
primitive. Why do the Tupinamb&aacute; cannibals eat so much European
food? Staden is necessary to authenticate the description of a national
cannibal (re)past that, for <I>antropofagia,</I> had no historical
presence. Given the founding role assigned to his "fieldwork," one may
ask whether <I>antropofagia'</I>s symbolic modernist ritual is really
a barbarous transgression or just a synthetic, if also subversive,
self-renewal. In this sense, the elite urban cannibals never really escape
the ambiguous heritage of their colonial education, since by adopting
the characteristics of Europe's imaginary other--albeit in an aggressive
ingestion--in order to define their new self, they tacitly accept the
identity that the West has foisted upon its primitive other.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

Acts of supposed anticolonial incorporation or devouring, in effect, leave
the Brazilians in a position more equivocal than ever before.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>

Situated between cultures, <I>antropofagia</I> runs the risk of erasing
the narrating self by removing the distinction between self and other,
between subject and object. What remains is only the tedious vagueness
and timelessness of an "artificial Sugar Loaf" para-dise. Ironically,
by consuming the pristine interior of Brazil, the modernist can-nibals
are eating their own hearts. From our contemporary perspective,
the enduring contribution to modernity of this movement in favor of
indigenous artistic autonomy resides less in its dynamism and more in
its instability--the tension of its double desire to situate cultural
autonomy in Brazil's ethnicity and to stand at the cutting edge of the
cosmopolitan avant-garde.

from a philosophical perspective, see Eduardo Jardim de Morais, <I>A
Brasilidade Modernista</I> (S&atilde;o Paulo: Graal, 1978). There are
two lines of development that treat similar material in different ways:
the <I>Pau Brasil</I> or "Brazilwood" group of 1924 is a precursor of
<I>Antropofagia</I> (1928-29), while the <I>Verdamarelo</I> (Green Yellow)
faction, taking its name from the colors of the national flag, is followed
by the <I>Anta</I> (Tapir) group. The split between a theoretical, in
the first case, and a literal reading of primitivism, in the second,
becomes apparent in an analysis of the manifestos published by each group.

<A NAME="FOOT4" HREF="#REF4">4</A>. Tarsila do Amaral returned to Paris in 1922 after the S&atilde;o
Paulo Modern Art Week, where she studied with L&eacute;ger and exhibited
her paintings at the Galerie Percier. Amaral introduced Oswald de Andrade
to Blaise Cendrars, Jean Cocteau, and other avant-garde res who
frequented her atelier. The interdisciplinary and international dimensions
of this Brazilian style come to light through paintings, poetry, and music
developed by Brazilian and French artists who were in contact in Paris in
the early 1920s and shared an aesthetic interest in Brazilian culture. Of
a large group including Paul Claudel, Darius Milhaud, Cendrars, Heitor
Villa-Lobos, Anita Malfatti, and Amaral, the Swiss-French poet Cendrars,
who was to travel to Brazil in 1924, had the greatest influence on
the nascent Brazilian style. Amaral and Andrade led an elegant life
among the artistic and literary elite. Their collaboration included her
illustrations for Andrade's <I>Brazilwood Poetry,</I> published in 1925,
and a corresponding "brazilwood" phase in her own paintings. See Stella de
S&aacute; Rego, "Tarsila/Pau Brasil: Her Sources in the French Avant-Garde
and the Significance of Her Work in the Context of Brazilian Modernism,"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June 1912 members of the American Academy of Medicine gathered in
Atlantic City for a conference on medical problems of immigration. Among
the papers presented that year was a Marine Hospital officer's account
of "The Medical Examination of Arriving Aliens." Dr. Leland E. Cofer
described the screening procedures administered to the three to five
thousand immigrants--mostly Italian, Russian, Slovak, and Polish--now
landing daily at New York's Ellis Island:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In the case of the large stations...it has been necessary to effect an
organization by which the mentally sound immi-grants can be eliminated
from the line.... On the average line...there are never less than two
men on duty, and usually                  three or four.... If one of the
medical examiners sees one of the stigmata of mental degeneracy, a certain
mark is put in white or colored chalk on the immigrant's clothing. Every
other medical examiner noticing this as the immigrant comes down the
line knows the meaning of it. The next medical examiner may discover some
deformity, in which case another check mark is placed on the clothing of
the immigrant. Finally the examiner detailed for the eyes may discover
a...defect...in which case another mark is placed on the clothing of
the immigrant, so that when he is pre-sented later in a private room for
further examination, no less than three men are called upon to demonstrate
the                     presence of the disease....

"the stigmata of mental

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Asked once about her work's layout and typography, Marianne Moore claimed
never to have planned the odd shapes of her trademark syllabic stanzas:
"Words cluster like chromosomes, determining the procedure."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

The genetic metaphor is certainly an important one for the kind of
poetry Moore was writing during the first decades of the century; but
her answer to Donald Hall was an artist's evasion. Moore's verse was
crafted. By the early twenties the poet was known for her practice of
sifting through various printed materials--natural histories, travel
guides, Protestant divine tracts, magazine ads and feature articles--and
singling out sentences and phrases, circling words that rhymed, and then
connecting these with penciled lines. From splices in paraphrase and in
quotation she sometimes then patterned out rhymed syllabic stanzas, and
sometimes buried her rhymes in free verse. "When the poem reached a stage
that pleased her, she turned to the typewriter, often making multiple
carbons of a draft. Each carbon was an opportunity for revision, some
bearing signs of six or seven reworkings with different colored inks
and pencils. Colored pencils had another role: Moore often marked her
'a,' 'b,' and other rhymes with different colors to facilitate proper
repetition of the pattern throughout a poem."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Even at its
unruliest during the period just after the war, Moore's verse was always
carefully pieced together from a variety of sources.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's democratic combining of all types of textual materials, both
literary and popular, is a practice with intricate historical roots,
particularly in view of the poet's countervailing claim to "the eagle's
perch" of artistic selectiveness. But it was this mixture of the
common with the highbrow that distinguished Moore among her modernist
peers. Early detractors like the poet-critic Pearl Anderson, who branded
Moore's poems "hybrids of a flagrantly prose origin," objected to the
classical prose locutions that filled out her stanzas; but critics
were equally disturbed by her quirky variety of diction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

Colleagues like T. S. Eliot, on the other hand, admired Moore for her
"impeccable" rendering of "clenches and

<B></B>

clevelandisms" into an
"aristocratic" "American language" that merged "the jar-gon of the
laboratory and the slang of the comic strip."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 For William
Carlos Williams, the metrical and syntactic dexterity with which
Moore combed seventeenth-century English prose rhythms toward modern
journalism's "promotional prose" was rendered vital with a "swiftness" of
"transit" through an "intensely, intentionally selective" manipulation
of materials.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Democratic but not indiscriminate, Moore's
red-pencil habit of picking and choosing from among "all these phenomena"
was from the beginning portrayed as a radical aesthetic re-conration
of the place and the practice of the modern American poet.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By referring to clustering chromosomes as a structuring principle for her
stanzas, Moore was not locating the origins of her modernist technique
and aesthetic in such sociohistoric issues as immigrant screening and
eugenics. But her reference to genetics does suggest that the poet's work
was shaped in something other than a purely personal and idiosyncratic
remoteness from her time. Moore's most important formal practices,
including her broadly inclusive diction and her overburdened syntax,
were rather the outcome of a self-conscious reflec-tion on the nature of
language and poetry, a reflection grounded in an ongoing engagement with
a network of contemporary debates about genetics, immigration policy, and
the nature of "American" language in her time. Moore's poems and essays,
and her reading notes from the late teens and early twenties especially,
evince not only a direct knowledge of and involvement with genetics and
eugenics, but a deliberate adaptation of the conceptual foundations of
these sciences to language and writing. In developing her own modernist
aesthetics, Moore was explicitly concerned with how the generational
transmission of life forms might address the transmission of meaning
in language.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's manner of elaborating formal practices from contemporary social
debates has broad critical significance insofar as it challenges basic
assumptions about modernism, not least among them the assumption that
modernist poetic practices turn on a dichotomy between radical contingency
and a reactionary insistence on stable linguistic reference. Moore's case
shows us that, although postmodern models may be useful in describing some
varieties of modernist contingency, the roots of this feature lie in the
anti-rationalist moments of philosophical pragmatism, an epistemologically
"evasive" philosophy based in part on paradigms drawn from evolution
and eugenics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Pragmatism resembles post-modernism in its
rejection of a firmly grounded presence behind words, but it diverges from
many postmodernist positions by asserting that contingency of meaning
can in fact produce the ethical certainty that funds both personal and
political commitment and action. Guided by pragmatist mentors William
James and John Dewey, Moore derived from modern genetics an aesthetic
based on semiotic contingency that enabled her uniquely to confront
the essentialist logic of modern eugenics, or the science of racial
engineering. In semiotic contingency, Moore found something other than a
deconstructionist's challenge to conventional structures of meaning and
power. Instead, contingency left Moore



with an understanding that
ethical positions were powerfully significant not when they were written
in stone, but when they were adopted as choices. The route from semiotic
contingency to ethical certainty in Moore's work is one that cuts across
the lines of the dichotomies most critics construct to chart modernism
and modernist writers. And Moore's own placement of modern genetics and
eugenics at the conceptual center of her ethical aesthetic of accident
challenges long held critical assumptions that modernist aesthetics, and
especially Moore's, were formed in isolation from public and political
considerations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contemporary critics who pay warm or cool homage to the aesthetic
directives of modern poets might themselves urge that we historicize
Moore's sampling of eclectic materials by viewing it as a typically modern
aestheticizing of such historical phenomena as the practice of immigrant
screening, wherein the massing of aliens at Ellis Island Station restages
for American poets the exotic rush of new European aesthetics into the
poem on the page, or the clamor of mass taste and opinion. But either of
these aesthetically-based historical approaches to Moore's writing would
serve mainly to color in existing critical assumptions regarding modern
American poetry. And both approaches would overlook the role that Moore's
study of biology played in shaping her writing. For Moore, readings
in natural history and hybridization supplied a unique perspective on
the issue of immigration, particularly as new steerage from eastern and
southern Europe raised debates over race and heredity during the teens
and early twenties. Moore's aesthetic of inclusive selection, and her
distinguishing technical features--her elaborate stanzas, complex nominal
compounds, abrupt lineation, and the strong tendency in her poems toward
punningly metonymic modes of reference--these formal and rhetorical
qualities can be usefully seen as a biologist-poet's response to the
nativist controversy over immigrant selection. Merging her studies of
evolution, genetics, and eugenics into a modernist aesthetic through the
conceptual lenses of philosophical pragmatism, Moore developed a writerly
practice that should distinguish her poetry from that of modernist peers,
particularly Pound and Williams.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Dr. Cofer went on to describe them, medical checks at Ellis Island
in 1912 were both a liberal cultivation of "the generic opalescence of
humanity in...our immigrants"
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 and an exercise in racial
selection. In an effort to streamline mass screenings, examiners
scanned aliens for those "racial characteristics" that might index
potential diseases (<I>MPI,</I> 37-38). According to the Marine Hospital
doctor, "proven" and "trustworthy" physicians knew that "dangerous
and loathsome diseases preponderate" in the citizens of particular
European countries. The "ability to recognize nationality immediately
upon the line" was pronounced "a necessary factor in this examination"
(<I>MPI,</I> 39, 38). With a premium placed on the spot detection of
ambiguous "Class A-I diseases"--"idiocy, imbecility, fee-ble-mindedness,
epilepsy, insanity and tuberculosis" (<I>MPI,</I> 32-33)--the screenings
mandated by 1907 law appear to have been driven by racial concerns.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Distinguishing among the "racial characteristics" even of various
European immigrants, Cofer invoked a modern conception of race that
divided Europeans into several distinct categories: long-headed Teutonics,
stocky round-headed Alpines from central and eastern Europe, and slender
Mediterraneans. Cofer's polygenist conception of European races was
rooted in essentializing taxonomies of multiple racial stocks such as
those set forth in 1899 by the American economist William Ripley in
<I>The Races of Europe.</I> Such popular racialist schemas as Ripley's
were attractive to Americans who wanted to distinguish between the
modern "new immigration" from eastern and southern Europe and the old
one from the British Isles, Germany, and Scandinavia.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 If
the Marine Hospital doctor was shading his talk on immigrant screening
with racialist assumptions, however, the medical screening procedures he
spoke of could only have been applauded by his colleagues as gestures at
racial selection. During the first two decades of the twentieth century,
steerage swelled to nearly one million newcomers per year. Physicians'
chalk marks were cosmetic in the face of such numbers. With immigrant
families accounting for up to 80 percent of the populations of America's
largest cities, demographers began to speculate that the declining birth
rates of old-stock Americans could be attributed to growing fears of
future economic competition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Newly discovered genetic principles--like the law of hybrid
reversion--were hastily adapted to polygenist notions of race, feeding a
growing nativist fear of American "race suicide" in the early twentieth
century. Popular studies like Madison Grant's <I>The Passing of the
Great Race</I> of 1916 charged that the new immigration was weakening
the nation's gene pool in a biological analog to America's democratic
transfer of power from old-stock "Nordic" Americans to inferior European
races.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Tabulations from immigrant intelligence tests and
from two million Alpha and Beta tests administered to Army recruits
would soon confirm a widespread tendency toward feeblemindedness in
the swarthier European races (<I>SL,</I> 156).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 President
Coolidge added fuel to the racist restrictionist campaign in 1921,
writing in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> of the proven degenerative effects
of mongrelization on America's Nordic genetic legacy (<I>SL,</I>
318). Eco-nomic unrest, combined with postwar isolationism and the
statistical fruits of eugenists like the mental tester Robert Yerkes,
provided potent summons for more comprehensive port restrictions. In
1924, with the issue of racial engineering debated openly in Congress,
the National Origins Act was passed and signed into law by Coolidge,
implementing quotas that maintained a constant influx of Nordic stock
while cutting to less than one fifth the numbers previously flowing from
countries populated by Mediterranean and Alpine races (<I>TE,</I> 177-78;
<I>HA,</I> 155-57).
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the late teens and early twenties, amid controversy over quotas
and Bolshevism and labor agitation, the nativist literary critic Van
Wyck Brooks railed against the "weak and sickly" condition of the arts in
America, complaining that



commercialism and an attendant "immigration
from without the Republic" had wrecked efforts to build a cultural
"nest" for literary development.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Radical cultural critics
like Randolph Bourne were meanwhile cautioning against the puritanical
foundations of the "cultic" "superstition" of "eugenics" and "racial
perfection."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 John Dewey's writings on immigrant culture
as a source for American art suggest that early modern calls for the
renewal of language through "a freshly evolved localized personality in
modern poetics" may have been sounded as a reaction against the popular
"middle class" nativism that pushed Ku Klux Klan membership to peaks
of two and a half million after World War I.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 But however
American writers and intellectuals of the teens and twenties positioned
themselves with respect to issues of nativity and immigration and
race, the National Origins Act leads us to some important extraliterary
sources for the distinctive verse that Moore and her colleagues wrote
during this period. The work of geneticists and eugenists caught Moore's
attention and shaped her understanding of how meaning is transmitted
in poetry. Poets like Williams championed a localized idiom through an
aesthetic of contact with indigenous cultural and racial material that,
"rich / in savagery," could maintain a "primal and continuous identity
with the ground itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Under the pressure of immigration
and eugenics, Moore developed a less romantic nativist aesthetic by
adapting modern theories of heredity to semantic transmission. Genetics
grounded her belief that America's material and racial foundations were
in fact hard to locate. Indigenous essences could not be fixed in words
or poems themselves; instead they flashed like meaning through language,
trailing "zigzag inscriptions" (<I>MM,</I> 35) across series of word
accidents and biological puns. The new discipline of experimental biology
showed Moore that the very contingency that determines the generational
transmission of life forms might serve as an enriching and constitutive
force in language itself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Granted an immediate political significance by the issue of immigration,
early modern models of genetic transmission might be considered as sources
for the branching metonymic associations that critics have noticed in
Moore's poetry and prose both (<I>LL,</I> 206, 233).
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 In
his 1956 study of "The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles" of language,
Roman Jakobson drew on aphasia research in formulating a distinction
between the substitutional semantic principles of romantic poetry and
the contiguous ones of realist prose. The Russian formalist recounts
"a well-known psychological test" in which children linked words of
their own choosing to the key word <I>hut.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 These
children exhibited predilections toward words that were either
semantically "substitutive" of, or "contiguous" to, the object in
question. Substitutive, or broadly metaphoric, reactions to <I>hut</I>
ranged from synonyms like <I>hovel</I> to antonyms like <I>palace</I>
to metaphors like <I>den</I> and <I>burrow;</I> while contiguous, or
metonymic, responses included <I>thatch litter</I> and <I>poverty</I>
(<I>FL,</I> 91). Situating Jakobson's antinomy within the framework of
a larger discussion of semantic transmission, Paul de Man elaborated the
formalist's "substitutions" and "contiguities" as metaphoric "necessities"
and metonymic "contingencies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 For many critics, De Man's
writings on metaphor and metonymy

<B></B>

 are more eccentric than definitive;
and his elaboration of Jakobson's terms should not be seen to mark a
progressive aesthetic continuum against which Moore can be graded as
a precociously poststructuralist modernist poet. But "contingency"
is nevertheless an apt term for the accidental procedure of Moore's
associative writing. Moore's 1919 poem "In the Days of Prismatic Color,"
for example, is motivated by contingent semantic relations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Metonymy unfolds this deeply creased statement about the seductiveness
of poetry. In the first of the passage's three segments, the floating
"principle," "throat," finds its synecdochal body as the instrument of
the smooth-voiced sophisticate. <I>Throat</I> and <I>sophisticate</I>
stand in a contiguous part-for-whole relationship much as do Jakobson's
<I>thatch</I> and <I>hut.</I> Through a metaphor of physical structure,
this throated sophisticate then becomes a serpent uncoiling from inside
its lair. Yet again, a set of synecdochal substitutions--"short legs" and
"feet" for a centipede--trigger the insect that gurgles from the snake's
skin. Lacking a central stated metaphor that links the arthropod to the
slinky medium containing it, few of the terms in this semantic chain
stand in necessary mutual relation. But the whole passage flows as an
account of how language deceives.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">De Man contends that the terms of the part-for-whole and whole-for-part
substitutions of synecdoche are organically fused, rendering them
"borderline" tropes that convey essences as well as contiguous
relations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Every throat, by this reasoning, is honeyed
with the sophisticate's oil. But if contiguous synecdochal relations
convey shades of necessity, Moore qualifies the necessity of this poem's
terms by predicating their synecdoche on puns. All of the tropes in
this passage--whether metonymic, like the sophisticate's throat, or
metaphoric, like the throat's serpent--turn on the short legs of the
centipede that springs from the snake. The bug's multitudinous feet are
themselves contiguous to the sophisticate-snake's shadowy abode, which is
fixed at the footless "antipodes" of great truths. Only through the most
flagrant linguistic coincidences--through the pairing of "antipodes" with
"centipedes"--do this poem's metrical feet flutter the shadows of verse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the accidents and contingencies that determine the particulate
shuffle of biological heredity providing a conceptual ground for Moore's
metonymic and punning verse structures, discussions of language and life
forms and native <B></B> 
identity



 in poems like "England"  point toward
local political sources for Moore's writerly aesthetic. In Moore's poems
of the late teens and early twenties, issues of essence and accident
in linguistic and biological forms are fundamental to questions of both
semantic and genetic transmission.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this poem about American landscape and language, meaning, like
poison in look-alike plants, doesn't cling to the literal form of a
word. Common sense and a knowledge of mushrooms should tell us that
messages, though conventionally determined, are inflected by semantic and
social occasions. Calling in a 1920 <I>Dial</I> essay for an awakening
of the arts in America, the pragmatist John Dewey championed democratic
localism over empty nativist standards that demanded that immigrants
"be either Americanized or...go back where they came from." Dewey looked
to immigrant quarters for a renewal of the American tongue, claiming that
semantic vitality was not dissolved, but rather hardened and faceted, in a
melting pot where citizens are "too busy making the American language to
devote much time to studying the English."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 The poet Moore
did not carry a localist imperative to the lengths of Williams's new
idiom of "the speech of Polish mothers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 But hidden among
the toadstools and mushrooms of "England" is a complaint against the
essentializing "Americanism" of racist restrictionists. The poison-fearing
enemies of dialect in Moore's poem speak pointedly to American advocates
of new standards of language and breeding. By posing a nominalistic spirit
of occasional identity against floating linguistic and biological forms,
"England" challenges the essentialism that underlies nativist visions
of a distinctive American race.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore held long to a vision of language and life forms as keys to a
fluxional native identity. Her reading diaries from 1907 onward track
the studies in biology and natural history that served to counterpoint
her readings in philosophy, aesthetics, and the arts. In notes from
her readings of 1919, shortly before "England"

<I>The Dial,</I> Moore copied passages from an 1889 edition of Darwin's
<I>Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication.</I> Darwin's
featuring of New World plant and animal forms--of the "tiger-like"
markings of "dark-brindled" caterpillars, of "candlestick-like opuntias"
and "dirty door-mat" fleeced goats--resemble the metaphors and compounds
soon to crowd the poet's lexicon, suggesting Moore's stylistic debt to
this admirably businesslike Victorian expositor of phenomena.

Of special interest to Moore as she read <I>Variation</I> were accounts

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's further attention to Darwin's comparisons of New World dogs,
cats, and boars with their counterparts in England and Europe suggests
that questions of native identity and biological form were linked for
the poet throughout her reading of <I>Variation.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among Darwin's writings, <I>Variation</I>'s broad canvas of domesticated
plant and animal forms offers indefinite answers to the question of
racial essences. While the monogenist implications of evolutionary theory
provides a logical counter to early modern notions of distinct racial
types, the Darwin of <I>Variation</I> searched among domesticated life
forms for evidence of the direct genetic inscription and transmission of
environmentally derived traits. The dirty door-mat fleece on the goat
backs that Moore culled from Darwin was a feature browned "directly"
into generations from parental exposure to the Antigua sun (1250/2;
<I>VAP,</I> 103). Such neo-Lamarckian notions of the inheritance of
acquired characteristics offered American polygenists like Ripley and
Grant a topographical ground for modern racial essences. People pressed
together in homogenizing cities could be sorted on the basis of the
genetically cast stamps of their ancestral environments.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While Moore did not look to the Lamarckian Darwin as a source
for polygenist conceptions of race, she noted something akin to a
hereditarian aesthetic foundation in Darwin's rendering of accounts such
as "Mr. Blyth's" on the origins of goldfish in China.

<B></B>

Moore's attention to Blyth's account suggests
that, for her, aesthetic essences like purity of color were linked
to the practice of selective breeding. Aesthetically remote from the
occasional shadings of partisanship, the poet's own writerly practice
might have been metaphorically conceived as a breeding of language
toward painterly truths. But if there are racialist overtones to the
breeding of decorative goldfish toward stable aesthetic essences, the
example of the MacKenzie River dogs in Darwin's <I>Variation</I> can
be said to supply Moore with sporting evidence of the hollowness of
racial essentialism. Dewey's nominalistic scolding in <I>The Dial</I>
of essentializing nativists who hold immigrants to an "Americanizing"
standard of proper English can be teased from Darwin's account of that
North American dog species which, "when brot. to Eng., never learned
to bark properly." Anglicization was happily marked for one river pup
"born in the Zoolog. Garden" who soon learned to make "his voice sound
as loudly as any other...of the same age and size" (1250/2).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's attention to the story of the MacKenzie River dogs marks her
playful awareness that culturally bound traits, such as habits of
"dialect," are not as easily graded as the redness of fish scales. The
continuum of variation that Darwin charts in his study, along with the
zigzag genetic contingency of hybrid production, helps to unravel the
ill-conceived terms of fixed formal essences. Comparisons of New World
with European dog species remind us that, lacking the gold standard of
red fish from China, our own cultural norms are fluid, ever shaped and
reshaped by accidents of transmission and by the changing complexions
of locales. American nativists are an offshoot of the stiff-lipped
imperialists who believe that their subjects should bark like the
Queen. When filtered through Moore reading Dewey and Darwin, "England'"s
rendering of "pure English" shows that nativist versions of American
racial identity are lacking in culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Moore gathered evidence against linguistic and biological and nativist
essences from readings of Dewey and Darwin, her modern understanding of
the instability of generational transmission provided a distinguishing
model for the kinky semantic chains that the poet fashioned especially
during the teens and twenties. The metonymic unfolding of "England"'s
lesson on resemblance and identity is finally more descriptive of Moore's
adaptation of genetics to poetry than the lesson itself. "England" is
prismatically a poem about America, with its musings on the nature of
wild and tame forms splintered from an overall account of nation and
nativity. Toadstools and a New England accent and temperament follow
from an evaporating catalogue of American character and tone.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cats and dogs; psalms, calm, and candles; mushrooms and poisonous
toadstools; heat, haste, mettlesomeness, and appetite. All these phenomena
materialize here not as the conceptual components of an overarching
metaphor of identity and resemblance, but as surveyed and surveying
features of a national character and landscape. Meaning proceeds by
fundamental leaps and skips in Moore's poetry; and these are leaps
both of contiguous surveillance, and of accidents of language. The same
punning directive that pushes contiguity to contingency in the metered
centipede of "In the Days of Prismatic Color" conditions the metonymic
logic of "England." Does it follow from the 'a' in candle that, because
there are poisonous toadstools, mushrooms are dangerous? Yes, but only
because scaled against "continents of misapprehension," toads perched
on stools describe an attitude of purists who watch over "calm." The
literal frog in Moore's mushroom is yet another false poison, but it is
one that affects a fortuitous identity in "England."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">William Carlos Williams might have been speaking of the frog-pedants of
"England," or of the "humbug"-"hummingbug" of "Picking and Choosing," when
he described the "unbridled leaps," the semantic collisions that result
in Moore's verse from "a multiplication of impulses" "crossing at all
eccentric angles" ("MM," 59, 53). Modern visual art forms like collage
set edges and fragments into arrangements that sharpened particular
qualities by foregrounding distinctness rather than blending parts into
a whole (<I>FL,</I> 92). A similar crispness resulting from Moore's
"lack of connectives" led Williams to describe her work as a procedure
geared to restore a natural freshness to fragments of language. Moore's
poetry was predicated on a radical removal of word pieces--"cutting them
clean out"--from their disease-ridden sources. Removed "bodily" from the
"greasy contexts" of sense and sentimental attachments, old words were
then "treated with acid to remove the smudges" and reassembled into
structures that invigorated them as resonating terminals of artistic
intelligence (<I>CCE,</I> 57-58). It was in the "porcelain garden," the
"primitive masonry" ("MM," 58) of Moore's apple-edged ("MM," 55, 59)
"unstandardized" "units" that new meaning moved "easily and completely,"
enabling "the thought" to reveal "the 'thing'" otherwise masked by the
stale fragrance of reason ("MM," 58). In his 1925 appraisal of Moore,
the imagist Williams implied that words were somehow innately vibrant
and meaningful, but that they lost their discrete vitality within the
rationalist thought systems that support the enervating principles of
humanism. Poems performed a service to words by wrenching them from
common conventional sense. A textual

<B></B>

collage practice like Moore's
worked both to restore the intrinsic vitality of words and to juice them
with life by placing them within the artist's intuitive new circuitry
of relations ("MM," 52-54, 58). The freshness of Moore's language was
both natural, or necessary, and accidentally, or contingently, wrought.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While philosophical pragmatism, with its burrowing into "the particulars
of experience,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 was a likely support for the imagistic
standard of "things" Williams brought to Moore's "insoluble" writings
(<I>LL,</I> 161; "MM," 58), it was for Moore herself a conceptual
conduit channeling Darwin's theories of evolution and even Mendelian
genetic theory into the aesthetic of semantic collision at work
in her writings. Charles Molesworth reads Dewey as a source for the
poet's broadly modern concern with "the dialectic between tradition and
innovation, between the stable form and the individual act" (<I>LL,</I>
161). But pragmatism also supplied Moore with a conceptual route
between Darwinian notions of species and fluid Emersonian appraisals
of language, as well as a foundation for her aesthetic elaboration
of genetic contingency. Moore shared something of Williams's imagist
aesthetic of presence in poetry, and she may have drawn this as well from
nominalistic and "structuralist" relational moments in the philosophies of
Dewey and James. But the more rigorous attention to semantic contingency
that distinguishes Moore from her peers can finally be traced to the
pragmatists' philosophical and semiotic adaptation of the lessons of
natural history and genetics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's favorite teacher at Bryn Mawr was Theodore de Laguna, a philosophy
and government professor who wrote on the impact of evolutionary theory
on pragmatism (<I>LL,</I> 41, 54).
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Shortly after graduating,
around 1910, Moore made a note of de Laguna's new book <I>Dogmatism and
Evolution</I> in her reading diary;
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 and then seven years
later she made careful study of the pragmatist Dewey--as if in prelude
to her 1919 reading of Darwin's <I>Variation.</I> Pragmatist tenets
themselves bear directly on the relations between Moore's aesthetic
and those of Williams and Pound. Passages from Dewey's <I>Essays
in Experimental Logic</I> and <I>Democracy and Education</I> that
Moore noted in her reading diary of 1917 express an imagist poet's
contempt for literalists who assume "that wherever there is a name,
there is some reality corresponding to it" (1250/2). Moore saw that the
Dewey of <I>Essays</I> blamed reason for the pettiness and pedantry of
literalists. Engulfed in abstract thought systems, those who trafficked
excessively in theories reduced "truth," or the "correspondence of idea
and fact," to a "static, inert relation," wanting a pragmatist's attention
to the "lead[ing]" and "guid[ing]" function of thought (1250/2). The
colorful dig at Bertrand Russell that Moore had earlier copied from an
issue of <I>The Nation</I> echoes a pragmatist emphasis on the mechanics
of contingency that momentarily joins, but finally distinguishes the
biologist-poet from her avant-garde American peers: "I should say that the
symbolic reals are about as truly representative of life and experience
as a bishop whose activities were confined to diagonal squares would be
representative of the archbishop of Canterbury...." (1250/1). For Moore,
the verbal sorcery that swaps the archbishop for a chess piece is an
illuminating lesson itself, one that beams

<B></B>

on Dewey's nominalist
caution: "the barest glance at human history shows that mistakes have
been the rule...." (1250/2).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Moore in 1917 found in the writings of Dewey philosophical support
for the imagist aesthetic of presence that she tentatively shared with
modernists like Pound and Williams, it may have been because she could
situate Dewey's nominalism within the context of her earlier interest in
pragmatism and language. During her student years at Bryn Mawr, the young
poet read William James appreciatively, absorbing more or less directly
his Emersonian vision of a language not of substantives, but of fluxional
relations (<I>LL,</I> 50, 70).
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 In his well-known 1890
essay, "The Stream of Thought," James contrasted the syntactic parcels
of Western language with his vision of a unity between the "substantive"
and "transitive" aspects of fluxional thought.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Asserting
that the "transition between the thought of one object and the thought
of another is no more a break in the <I>thought</I> than a joint in a
bamboo is a break in the wood," James reckoned that we "ought to say a
feeling of <I>and,</I> a feeling of <I>if,</I> a feeling of <I>but,</I>
and a feeling of <I>by,</I> quite as readily as we say a feeling of
<I>blue</I> or a feeling of <I>cold"</I> (<I>PP,</I> 240, 245-46).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In poems of the "National Origins" period of the late teens and
early twenties, Moore appears to have aesthetically realized James's
substantiation of the transitive tissue of speech through quotational
collages forcing a modernist compression of syntax. Compression of syntax
is a distinguishing characteristic of much American poetry written during
the period after World War I, and its debt to avant-garde visual and
conceptual arts has been discussed at some length.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Partly
from a wish to obscure, and partly in an effort to foreground what
James called the "shadings" of conceptual conjunctions, poets like Mina
Loy wrote dense poems that eliminated the pragmatist's <I>and, if, but,
by,</I> so that reading her work was, in one poet's words, "like walking
through granite instead of air."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 In her free-verse collage
poems of the early twenties, however, Moore restores transitive shadings
to language through more complicated varieties of compression that extract
not just the connective tissue of speech, but such integral indexes to
meaning as subjects and verbs. Amid the breakdowns of syntax that attend
the densest of Moore's documentary collages (in poems like "An Octopus"
and "Novices"), dislocated phrases--many of them wrapped in quotation
marks --themselves emerge as the Jamesian linguistic "substantives,"
assuming the semantic burden of key syntactic referents. The quotational
object-poems that Moore composes in this manner are deceptive. Retaining
many of James's <I>and</I>s, <I>if</I>s, <I>but</I>s, and <I>by</I>s, they
have the tendrilly appearance of syntactically overfed prose. But they are
as conceptually austere as many imagist verses. Set in forbidding

<B></B>

juxtaposition, Moore's "substantive" quotational phrase-objects are
rendered "transitive" not by syntax but by the raw performance of
metonymic and metaphorical transactions among them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The stamps of natural selection and modern genetics that distinguish
Moore's collage practice and her nativist aesthetic from the work of
her peers can be partly deciphered through James's and Dewey's appeals
to Darwin and to his modern genetic predecessors. In <I>Dogmatism and
Evolution,</I> Moore's teacher de Laguna wrote explicitly of the impact of
Darwin on pragmatist philosophers Peirce, James, and Dewey;
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

and as a student of biology, the young "Individualist" Moore must
have been particularly intrigued by James's Darwinian polemic against
Spencerian environmental determinism in her reading of <I>The Will
To Believe</I> (<I>LL,</I> 50, 70). James saw natural selection as a
powerful antidote to an enervating belief in a continuous identity between
individuals and societies and their environmental situations. Darwin's
significance to zoology and sociology alike lay for the philosopher
in the Victorian evolutionist's distinction between the causes that
produce variation and the causes that maintain it in the process of
selection.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Environment played a small role in selection,
but the greater generative production of variables, a bounty based on
"internal molecular accidents," was itself an unknown (<I>WB,</I> 223).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James's freefalling ovum is an antiquarian oddity, but his account
of biological reproduction as determined by an infinitesimal ferment
of a ferment anticipates the variable shuffling and reshuffling of
modern genetic combination. In his 1906-1907 lectures on pragmatism,
the philosopher went on to blend language study with life sciences in
appraising the evolutionary findings of "geologists, biologists and
philologists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Here James argued that natural history,
and studies of natural selection especially, had engendered wide
philosophical and linguistic repercussions. By showing us "the power of
chance happenings to bring forth fit results," "darwinism has once and for
all displaced design from the minds of the 'scientific,'" recommending to
the "contemporary imagination" "some kind of an immanent or pantheistic
deity working <I>in</I> things rather than above them" (<I>P,</I> 111,
70). Lecturing just as cytologists were beginning to demystify Darwin's
account

of natural selection, James tagged pragmatism itself "a
genetic theory of what is meant by truth" (<I>P,</I> 65-66).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dewey's account of Darwin's intellectual legacy was specifically concerned
with life forms and the rationalist underpinnings of teleology. In
a 1909 <I>Popular Science</I> essay entitled "Darwin's Influence upon
Philosophy," Dewey historicized the significance of biology to philosophy
and ethics. For Dewey, nature itself, with its tendency to generate like
forms "distant in space and remote in time," implanted and cultivated
notions of "type" in the minds of the Greeks and the scholastics: "the
conception of <I>eidos,</I> species, the fixed form and final cause, was
the central principle of knowledge as well as of nature."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

Perceptions of orderly biological design supported an Aristotelian
faith in intelligent systems of classification; and modern thought,
Dewey cautioned, still glints with a garden variety of reason.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James's and Dewey's grafting of "genetic theory" and "experimental
ideas" onto pragmatism, in 1906 and 1909 respectively, is noteworthy
considering that the term genetics had not been adapted to modern usage
until the biologist William Bateson garnered it for the new science in
1906.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Dewey's allusion to "genetic and experimental ideas"
suggests that natural selection for him, as for James, was

<B></B>

filtered
through the fresh discipline of "experimental biology" sweeping Europe
and America just after the turn of the century (<I>TE,</I> 15-25).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Moore's understanding of both the fluidity and contingency of plant
and animal species, and hence the fluidity and contingency of racial
identity, was philosophically and linguistically mediated by her readings
of James and Dewey, her knowledge of the genetic principles that support
these qualities was largely post-Darwinian. Moore's reading diary of
1919 ignores many of the bizarre Darwinian accounts of the transmission
of acquired mutilations--ranging from cracked cow horns to circumcised
foreskins--that James glossed over in <I>The Will To Believe</I> (Darwin,
<I>VAP,</I> 466-70; James, <I>WB,</I> 222). But lecture notes from biology
courses at Bryn Mawr indicate the poet's familiarity with "pangenesis"
and "gemules," baroque components of the somatic "blending" theory of
heredity that Darwin elaborated from antiquity in <I>Variation of Animals
and Plants under Domestication.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Eight years after the
1859 publication of <I>The Origin of Species,</I> Darwin was challenged
by colleagues to explain how single mutations might survive the swamping
that awaited their mixture with the mass of population.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

At this time, Gregor Mendel's statistical study of hybrid inheritance,
though published in 1865, was still awaiting wide readership. A Moravian
monk isolated from Europe's scientific circles, Mendel spent two
years crossing and recrossing the offspring of twenty-two varieties of
garden peas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Tracking the disappearance and reemergence of
isolated traits--greenness, yellowness, wrinkles, roundness--he concluded
that physiological characteristics were not actually fused in sexual
reproduction, but that they were in fact  particulate, preserved intact
and passed on as discrete entities, in dominant or recessive forms,
to subsequent generations. Because Darwin lacked such a handy defense
as Mendel's against the swamping challenge to natural selection, he
reverted to a Lamarckian notion of the inheritance of acquired traits:
environment, he would argue in <I>Variation,</I> played a direct and
persistent role in producing variations in species.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The neo-Lamarckian view that life forms were categorically determined
by ancestral environments was used to support American polygenist
conceptions of race like Coolidge's in his Nordic miscegenation tract in
<I>Good Housekeeping.</I> Conservative social planners struggled against
the conceptual challenges of those Darwinian notions of variational
contingency that James and Dewey located in <I>The Origin of Species,</I>
and sought instead to preserve the socially stratifying imperatives
of environmental determinism. Disparities of wealth and station were
justified by the idea that natural stresses strengthened a people's
genetic fiber, weeding out failures and programming successes directly
into future generations. And for Americans like Coolidge and Madison
Grant, the polygenist implications of environmental origins provided
modern racial fodder for the red tooth of "fitness." If the inheritance
of acquired characteristics fostered social visions that were narrowly
programmatic in the eyes of "individualists" like William James in
<I>The Will to Believe,</I> contrary hypotheses like August Weismann's
1890 theory of the germ plasm as an inviolate reproductive material
threatened

<B></B>

even colder extremes of biological determinism. The
notion that acquired characteristics might be more or less directly
inherited had at least supplied Americans of the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries with a theoretical basis for melting-pot visions
of race-in-formation. In the image of the melting pot, Lamarckianism
provided a progressive outlook on what was seen as a necessarily mixed
racial American heritage and future: immigrants of various shapes
and shades could be both socially and biologically "Americanized,"
with their material adaptation to the New World leading more or less
directly to their genetic assimilation into a single "American race"
(<I>REC,</I> 245).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the turn of the century, American eugenists emerged to adapt current
biological and sociological imperatives, as well as the principles
of engineering, to this new race-in-formation. Lacking the mediating
term Franz Boas would gradually formulate as "culture," Lamarckian
eugenists "tended to assume the physical inheritance of...complex
mental characteristics" (<I>REC,</I> 251). Habit was embedded and
passed forth as instinct (<I>REC,</I> 247). Culture was conveyed
in the blood (<I>REC,</I> 253). Yet Weismann's theories of the germ
plasm, and the rediscovery in 1900 of Mendel's study of hybrid garden
peas, did not precipitate an immediate dismissal of Lamarckianism in
American biological sciences. Rather, in the first two decades of the
century, biology was caught between extremes of holdover Lamarckian
environmentalism and the early biological determinism of geneticists
who had yet to map what Hamilton Cravens calls the "contingent" effects
of populations and surrounding environmental factors on the process of
genetic combination (<I>REC,</I> 253-54; <I>TE,</I> 171). Not only did
hereditarian biologists lack the mediating findings of later population
geneticists from within their own discipline, they were also resistant,
in a growing climate of nativism, to the more sophisticated models of
biological and cultural identity that eventually emerged in the twenties
and thirties in the form of Boasian cultural anthropology (<I>REC,</I>
299-302). The eugenics movement, which flourished in leading universities
during the teens and twenties, sprang from what we recognize now as an
improbable hybridization of Lamarckian social thought and hereditarian
biological tendencies. But in the pre-Boasian climate of the times, its
innate contradictions were not so immediately apparent.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea of particulate inheritance held special appeal to early modern
scientists who wished to merge biological with social sciences under the
technical aegis of engineering. Charles Davenport was sanguine regarding
the utilitarian implications of a particulate genetic constitution when
he addressed members of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science in 1904.

as well as leading biologists, sociologists, and psychologists--including
the mental tester Yerkes--known for their pioneering work in mental
inheritance, feeblemindedness, and criminology (<I>HA,</I> 62, 64-65).
Among the committees that Davenport oversaw was one on immigration
headed by Prescott Hall and Robert DeC. Ward, leaders of the elite and
influential Boston-based Immigration Restriction League. Fellow Brahmins,
and former Harvard mates of the pedigreed puritan Davenport, Hall and
Ward posed the issue of immigration in starkly polygenist terms. They
drew from Ripley and from the New York society lawyer Madison Grant in
adapting to racial engineering distorted "Mendelian" principles such as
the notion that crossbreeding inevitably leads downward toward reversions
to more "primitive" ancestral types (<I>REC,</I> 68, 324n). At immigrant
stations like Ellis Island, Ward and Hall argued, Americans must choose

directly against such patrician proponents of Nordic supremacy as Hall,

Burbank with his suncraft is a demystifying model for the collage writer
of lab notes and advertisements who affected to map her own handiwork
with quotations and notes. As a "designer" of nature, however, Burbank's
practice with plants resounds with topical eugenist premises, politically
flavoring his canonization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's praise of the colorful Burbank in 1925 as a great modern
"educator" appeals to the racist foundations of the National Origins Act
not only through the metaphorically volatile concept of horticultural
"design," but through the celebrated hybridizer's direct involvement
with the eugenics movement. A national hero during the early decades
of the century, Burbank was sought after by journalists for his views
on subjects ranging from diet and meditation to evolution and school
reform. The California gardener was an early advocate of Chinese immigrant
exclusion, and his only book-length publication was on the subject
of eugenics (<I>GTG,</I> 160, 156). Appearing initially in 1906 as a
long essay in <I>Century Magazine</I> (then edited by the young poet
William Rose Ben&eacute;t, a childhood neighbor and lifelong friend
of Moore's), <I>The Training of the Human Plant</I> won praise from
temperance advocates like the poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox, who proposed
that the government distribute a copy of Burbank's book to every mother
in the nation (<I>GTG,</I> 161). The tract began with a chapter on
"The Mingling of Races," which contained a demographic breakdown of the
752,864 immigrants who entered the U.S. in 1904. In the face of such a
"colossal example of the crossing of species," Burbank proposed to adapt
"the principles of plant culture and improvement in a more or less
modified form to the human being."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 An admirer of Darwin's
<I>Variation in Animals and Plants under Domestication</I> (<I>GTG,</I>
33) Burbank was at this time an anomaly as a eugenist who believed that
"environment is the architect of heredity"; and his prescription for the
melting pot buried racist and classist anxieties beneath vague calls for
"supervision and selection" and a glowing emphasis on nurturance and
educational reform--namely fresh air and sunshine and no school for
children under ten.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore may or may not have had the hybridizer-educator Burbank in
mind when she wrote, late in life, of students as "foster plants
of scholarship" (<I>LL,</I> 32); but she was clearly tracking his
horticultural and sociological innovations in her reading diaries of the
early twenties. During the 1922 family trip to Mt. Rainer that led to
her long twin poems "Marriage" and "An Octopus," Moore copied passages
from an interview with Burbank from the July 16 <I>Seattle Times.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the scientific periodicals Moore skimmed during the National
Origins fervor was <I>The Journal of Heredity,</I> the leading forum for
American eugenists throughout the teens and twenties. Noting articles
on the "Inheritance of Mental Traits," "Twinning in Brahma Cattle," and
"The Ancestry of Abraham Lincoln," the poet copied passages such as this
one on heredity and criminality from a 1924 article on "Behavior and
Gland Disease": "In disease as in health, the man of the gutter will
behave according to his world and the man of the peaks in keeping with
his."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Moore's interest in heredity and hereditarians may
have been as aesthetic and skeptical as sincerely scientific, but in
the context of praise for Burbank, it seems to signal at least a tacit
support for eugenics. If Moore partook of the sanguine spirit of racial
engineers like Davenport, indirectly celebrating new racialist steerage
restrictions with her praise of stoneless plums and sweet lemons,
however, she also anticipated flaws intrinsic to the science of human
selectivity that Burbank set forth. In the margin of her transcription
of the <I>Seattle Times</I> interview with Burbank, Moore queried
"(What about recessive traits [indecipherable mark] Elizabeth Tuttle
[indecipherable mark] Edward's grandmother)" (1250/3).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore's cryptic dialogue with Burbank can be read in two ways. On the one
hand, eugenist judges had begun by 1925 to accept "Mendelian recessives"
as grounds for the mandatory sterilization of the promiscuous daughters of
feebleminded mothers--the same poor and uneducated women already being
sterilized by court order in twenty-five states (<I>HA,</I> 138-39,
133-37). Moore's quarrel might then be with the softness of the plant
breeder's program of selection. The hybridizer who had called in <I>The
Training of the Human Plant</I> for laws "to prohibit in every State in
the Union the marriage of the physically, mentally, and morally unfit"
(<I>HA,</I> 58) seemed now to be peddling an overly positive program, one
which accented "selection of the best" while evading the question of how
to weed out the worst. In the context of Moore's pragmatist leanings and
poetic practice, however, her own reference to recessive traits seems
to constitute a more fundamental criticism of Burbank the eugenist. By
using Mendelian terms to challenge the horticulturist's na&iuml;ve
hereditarian approach

<B></B>

 to social issues, the poet begins to align
herself with the more contemporary discoveries of population geneticists.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thomas Morgan and his Columbia University lab partners bred fruit flies in
milk bottles during the late teens and early twenties, establishing that
genetic transmission was a far more complex and contingent affair than
eugenists like Davenport--and the <I>Seattle Times'</I>s Burbank--had
conceived it to be (<I>TE,</I> 171). Mendelians had erred first by
assigning single corresponding genetic units to discreet somatic features:
one gene unit for eye color, one for hairline, another for width of
jaw. They assumed that biological reproduction involved a one-on-one
matching-up of gene units that resulted in various combinations of
dominant and recessive traits. Eugenists then elaborated from this
miscast framework a similar correspondence between genetic units and
particular character traits, such as laziness and wanderlust (<I>TE,</I>
164, 172: <I>HA,</I> 67-68).
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 The second mistake of the
Mendelians--their hereditarian determinism--was related to the first. In
order that heredity might be arithmetically cast, the process of genetic
combination was abstracted from contaminating local environmental
contexts. Morgan's fruit fly populations showed that environmental
pressures did indeed play a role in the pairing of chromosomes (<I>TE,</I>
171-72). One of the fundamental contradictions of racist eugenicism was
its joining of a Lamarckian polygenist essentialism--which used geography
and climate as grounds for racial essences--with a neatly manipulable
hereditarian determinism (<I>SL,</I> 152-53; <I>REC,</I> 324n). In her
eugenical reference to recessive traits, Moore asks Burbank how trait
selection can engineer the many randomly hidden units of genes. Although
the question itself reflects a unit conception of genetic material that
was already under challenge by Morgan, the poet was implicitly suggesting
that the designing of Americans might be a chancier enterprise than the
designing of roadsters. Against deterministic selection, Moore invoked the
sort of Jamesian fermentation of environment and heredity that population
geneticists were recognizing as essential to biological reproduction.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the National Origins Act lent a political immediacy to Moore's interest
in horticultural design and genetics, then the modern American science
of racial engineering might be indirectly traced to Moore's writerly
aesthetics. Bonnie Costello has noted that a number of Moore's poems
treat questions of aesthetic representation through the thematic lenses
of biological and artistic reproduc-tion. In Moore's "Nine Nectarines,"
for example, the genealogical impulses attendant to natural history and
art history provide, in their "infinite regress," a formal account of
Moore's own multiply-authored quotational poems.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Moore's
crossing of natural history with mythology and aesthetics in her 1935
poem about a Chinese porcelain painting, however, suggests the role of
genetics as a complicating factor in her distinctive modernist practice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moore knew from readings of Darwin and the Swiss botanist Alphonse de
Candolle that the origins of the peach and the nectarine were a subject
of nineteenth-century contest. Among the more tantalizing clues to the
origins of hybridized, or specifically crossed, plants like Victorian
nectarines were accounts of sudden reversions to aboriginal forms
(<I>VAP,</I> 398, 439). Darwin's <I>Variation of Animals and Plants under
Domestication</I> cites many reports of nectarine trees springing from
peach parents, as well as abundant instances of "sports," or mutated
nectarine clusters on peach-tree limbs, and occasional "half-and-half"
fruits. But seed reversions and bud-variations pointed the other way
too, with cases of "nine peaches on a nectarine" providing evidence for
each tree as the specific parent of the other (<I>VAP,</I> 361). Through
centuries of back-and-forth crossing, the hybridization of nectarines
and peaches seemed so thorough that neither fruit could remember where
it began. If there was anything to be learned from genetics, it may have
been located in the humility of the meticulous de Candolle.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

I laid stress, in 1855, on other considerations in support of the theory
that the nectarine is derived from the common peach; but Darwin has

any longer upon this point, and I will only add that the nectarine has
every appearance of an artificial tree.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mendelian recessives and Darwinian bud-variations are important components
of Moore's modernist aesthetic because they illustrate the fundamental
instability of life forms in transmission.  By naturalizing accidents in
generational carriage, the saltations of particulate inheritance enrich
the relational aesthetic of modern poetry in the same way that postmodern
semiotics give depth to the formalist distinction between substitutional
and contiguous tropes. Admired through the gates of Dewey's "garden of
life," the blushing contrast between nectarines and peaches grafts its
still-life contiguity onto the tree of knowledge itself. The nectarine
beside the peach becomes the nectarine behind the peach, displacing the
conceptual agency that determines the genesis and transmission of both
life and meaning. Within the framework of biological transmission,
"substitution" becomes generational "necessity," and positional
"contiguity" becomes a variety of transmissive "contingency." The very
particulate contingency of modern genetic combination that accounts
for such marvelous sports of hybrid reversion as Darwin recorded in
<I>Variation</I> is what enables Moore to transfer the laws of genetics
to both the particulate nominalist and relational aesthetics of modern
imagist and ideogrammatic poetry. Applied to poetry, genetic contingency
shakes the semiotic burden of natural generation not only from the
primitive index of things in words, but from the structuralist standard
of foundational relations upon which poems like the <I>Cantos</I> and
<I>Paterson</I> come to rest. Developing her own metonymically strung
semantic chains toward the contingency that conditions hybrid production,
Moore used an image of nine nectarines on a peach tree as a metaphor
for the generative displacement of meaning that distinguishes her poetry
for contemporary readers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the DNA molecule was finally "solved" in the fifties, its codings
revealed a relational complexity far greater than counts of garden peas
or even fruit flies had indexed (<I>HA,</I> xi). Scientifically-minded
Americans commonly recognized that, notwithstanding new ethical
imperatives, nature was so full of surprises, of tics on the order of
recessive traits and bud-variations, that eugenists were left finally as
helpless in their attempts to fix future races as were Victorian botanists
in their efforts to trace the origins of fruit. Early twentieth-century
population geneticists who mapped the contingency of chromosome pairing,
discovering that its chemical intricacy was then further tensed by
environmental pressures, had comprised a sort of modernist vanguard
in recognizing that, as a science, eugenics could offer at best a
succession of natural and unnatural accidents. "The facts in themselves
are curious," wrote Darwin, "concerning evidence on the origin of the
nectarine" (<I>VAP,</I> 361).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accidents were never anathema to Moore; and her praise for "prudent
de Candolle" should probably not be read as a retrospective swipe at
an American scientific movement that was beginning its retreat in the
thirties (<I>TE,</I> 180). The

<B></B>

examples of peaches and nectarines
in Moore's poem, however, show that it is not only the mechanics but
the premises of racial engineering that are flawed. As "Nine Nectarines"
ends with an image of a mythological creature eating one of the fruits
hanging from the branch in the porcelain, a complex correspondence
between biological and cultural transmission begins to emerge.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Laurence Stapleton has resourcefully accounted for the Chinese kylin
as the mythological Asian unicorn who emerged from the Yellow River
with the first Chinese written characters on its back.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>

As a "small cinnamon-brown, common / camel-haired unicorn," Moore's
hornless pony is itself an ideogram composed of linguistic components
as fresh and impure as that of the "puce-American-Beauty pink" blush of
the nectarine, a derivative fruit that adapts to the "hardiness" of the
North American vernacular and climate alike (<I>VAP,</I> 360). Browned
into the Chinese unicorn, "cinnamon" and "camels" invoke the history of
the animal's hybridization, the ancient east-west trade routes along
which legends and fruit stocks moved, linking points from old Rome to
Ispahan to Pekin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Language, like peach stones, confuses
the East with the West and the Old World with the New. It serves as
a barrier to origins and as a cultural frame. We don't find essences
in the philological substance of words; but language roots us in its
half-moon arcs of inflection. Moore's Chinese are pragmatist sages. They
make stories, not studies, of origins.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Genetic variability provides the semiotic ground that distinguishes
Moore's modernist imagist aesthetic from that of her colleagues. If
a pragmatist resistance to syntactically braced systems of language
supports the semantic freshness that Moore achieves through compression,
hyphenation, and slip-disc lineation, this freshness is animated
by semantic renderings of principles like Mendel's recessives and
Darwin's aboriginal reversions. "Nectarine" holds the nectar that
feeds the animus of language.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 This is not a painterly
pun native to the peach-eating kylin, but an accident of nature and
of translation which structures Moore's vision of language. In the
best of her writing, an aesthetic of accident and semantic collision
keeps her ever-awakening phrases away from the snares of truisms and

<B></B>

clich&eacute;s. Like the imagist poets of the early modern
period, Dewey recognized the power of the modern Ptolemaic tendency
toward universalization, and he grounded its political register in the
"Americanizing" imperative of racist restrictionists. Moore too saw the
local political stakes of the snake-charming lure of racist truisms, and
her poetics are perhaps all the more radically Copernican for her own
work's witness to such common flaws in herself. "It was a Chinese / who
imagined this masterpiece." Didacticisms like this one display Moore's
own susceptibility to untried essences, a common weakness that keeps us
watchful today of our own language and politics, despite the hovering
lessons of modern history. Paired with her admiration for eugenists like
Burbank, Moore's predilection for the very commonplaces against which
she wrote pushed her outside the realm of common aesthetics toward an
aesthetic of renewal. Life sciences provided a semiotically enriched
dadaist model for semantic transmission that was as yet uncommodified by
the discourse of aesthetics. Emerging ever so slowly, the laws of genetics
were rawer and yet more rigorously antirationalist than the Continental
aesthetics of F. T. Marinetti or Tristan Tzara. Fundamentally fluid
yet sharply particulate, and immediate yet complex in their pragmatic
admission of local environmental influence, genetics gave Moore a ground
that was more vividly indeterminate than the ethically procreative
economies of Pound or the wilderness wedding beds of William Carlos
Williams. Attuned to a pragmatist's insistence on the leading and guiding
function of accidents themselves, however, Moore was not merely the most
rigorous of the modernist harbingers of indeterminacy. More than her
modernist peers, and more than many of her postmodernist successors, she
found in semantic contingency a practical foundation for the declaration
of ethical truths.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Sunday, 3 June 1934, African artists and intellectuals, American Board
Missionaries, liberal whites associated with the Joint European/African
Council, and an educated, predominantly African audience gathered at
the Bantu Men's Social Centre (BMSC) in downtown Johannesburg for an
Emancipation Centenary Celebration, commemorating the abolition of
slavery in the British Empire in 1834.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The Celebration
included speeches by American missionaries and leading Africans, such
as R. V. Selope Thema (editor of <I>Bantu World)</I> and A. B. Xuma
(later President of the African National Congress [ANC]); performances
of Handel's <I>Messiah;</I> hymns composed by Europeans, Africans, and
Americans; and "Negro spirituals." It culminated in a "dramatic display,"
the subject of which was not the emancipation of slaves in the Empire,
but rather the lives of slaves in the United States. Incidental music
was written by Reuben Caluza, known for composing and collecting Zulu
folk-songs, and the text by his cousin Rolfes Dhlomo. The evening's
performances were organized and directed by Herbert Dhlomo, Rolfes's
brother and a dramatist in his own right.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Drawing on the variety format of Edwardian pageants and the music hall,
the performance also borrowed freely from the speeches of Lincoln and
Frederick Douglass and the portrayal of the "life of the lowly" in
<I>Uncle Tom's Cabin.</I> The "dramatic display" itself, including a
slave auction, labor in the fields, and the coming of freedom performed by
adults and children in chorus, highlighted the pathos of the

<B></B>

lot
of both slaves and ex-slaves: "the suffering of the American Negroes on
the slave market, in the cotton fields and at home, until the joyful news
of the liberation";
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 and the "feelings of joy and relief, which
the right ending of the struggle for freedom had brought."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

Although these reports in <I>Bantu World</I> and <I>Umteteli wa Bantu,</I>
the major African papers, give us no details about the music accompanying
these scenes, it is likely, given Caluza's international reputation
as a composer of nationalist hymns and Zulu folksongs (recorded by His
Master's Voice in London in 1930), that it drew on his "sorrow songs"
about the dispossession of South African blacks.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Likewise,
the dramatic interpretations of key speeches such as the Gettysburg
Address, delivered by Griffiths Motsieloa, leader of the minstrel troupe
the Darktown Strutters, and the record company Gallophone's answer to His
Master's Voice, probably resonated with the audience differently from the
praise heaped on British and American emancipators in the African press.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Politically charged as this event certainly was, it had nonetheless no
single political meaning. Permitted by the neocolonial state and applauded
by white liberal paternalists, it was enthusiastically received not
only by the members of the BMSC but also by the more diverse--and more
disaffected--audience at the Eastern Native Township performance. This
occasion thus eludes the familiar dichotomy between white colonial
hegemony and the oppressed black masses (or between high English culture
and clearly identifiable working-class practices), a dichotomy that has
long pervaded South African criticism and underlies key formulations of
current postcolonial theory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 In this schema, members of the
New African elite, the small intermediary class of clergymen, teachers,
and other professionals who organized events such as the Emancipation
Celebration, are distinguished above all by their attachment to European
civilization and thus by their alienation from the masses of black
people, whether this alienation is read as the irredeemable result of
their colonial assimilation and distance from popular African cultural
expression
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 or as a measure of the obstacles to their attempts
at representing either African concerns in general or the interests of
an emerging working class in particular.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 This retrospective
judgment carries some weight in present-day debates about South African
cultural politics but it does not fully acknowledge the fluidity in 1934
of these class and ethnic affiliations, or the volatility of New African
identification with "European civilization." To be sure, the editor
of <I>Bantu World</I> joined the American Board Mission in urging his
readers to beware of the unChristian tactics of the Bolsheviks and to
"honor the great emancipators" such as Livingstone or Lincoln, whose
examples show the way to "rescue [the world] from the thraldom of
nationalist and racial passions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 He did so, however, with
the knowledge that other New Africans were disputing European claims to
represent Christian civilization on the grounds that the South African
state's treatment of most of the population, a century after emancipation,
betrayed Christian ideals and universal rights.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The imperial decorum of the missionary school syllabus, which supplemented
the great tradition of Shakespeare and the post-Romantic poets with the
likes of

<B></B>

Kipling and John Buchan, was in its turn challenged by
American and African American popular culture ranging from abolitionist
melodrama and political rhetoric to a popular mixture of jubilee
singing, ragtime, jazz, and minstrelsy, all of which reached a wide
African audience in venues that ranged from the BMSC to the slumyard and
dance halls frequented by city workers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 New Africans saw in
the metropolitan, modernizing impulse of the New Negro an alternative,
on the one hand, to neocolonial retribalization and the essentially
anti-urban complexion of English culture in the mission schools and, on
the other, to the allegedly degraded forms of jazz and minstrelsy, which
the African elite saw as corrupting the <I>abaphakathi</I> (the people in
between--neither assimilated to "European" modernity nor any longer at
home with indigenous custom).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Even in the 1930s, after the
New Negro star had faded, the distance travelled by African Americans from
slavery to visible (if uneven) participation in American life--as well
as the distance still untravelled--provided a crucial point of reference
for criticizing the curtailment of civil rights for black South Africans.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite their identification with the African American elite, the
"talented tenth," in W. E. B. Dubois's phrase, New Africans were compelled
to acknowledge the appeal of African American popular culture, including
jazz, if only in response to African American assertions of pan-African
affiliation. Thus, musician and critic Mark Radebe uses a Garveyite term,
"Africans in America," to pay homage to African American inflections of
popular American music and to "the enormous influence of Bantu rhythms on
the world's music."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 New African negotiation of these African
American currents thus complicates any received dichotomy between British
imperialism and African resistance, between imported art and indigenous
practice or, indeed, between modernity and its apparently premodern,
"savage" other.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New African exploration of the territory marked out by these oppositions
was both contradictory and productive. It involved often passionately
inconsistent appropriation of English cultural artifacts, American
popular entertainments, and indigenous traditions, in which the
transformation (but not the destruction) of "Africanness" through
colonization formed the basis for a thoroughly modern hybridity. In
the performance of hybridity--in drama, pageants, and national
commemorations--any distinction between a degraded missionary literature
"produced under imperial licence"
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 and the irony, parody,
or "sly civility" of postcolonial (post)modern writing is thoroughly
blurred.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Postcolonial criticism, as exemplified by the
influential anthology, <I>The Empire Writes Back,</I> acknowledges this
blur when it uses "the postcolonial to cover all culture affected by
the imperial process from the moment of colonization to the present-day"
(<I>EWB,</I> 2).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 It also admits that the difference between
"licensed missionary writing" and "postcolonial appropriation" is not
simply a matter of the mastery or appropriation of literary form but
rather the effect of the colonial institution of literature, in which a
narrow range of normative models is promoted and in which publication,
patronage, and reception fall under the control of the colonial authority
(<I>EWB,</I> 6). Acknowledging that constraints on cultural production
under colonialism

<B></B>

 or a neocolonial regime such as South Africa's
include the inculcation of European literary norms as though they were
universal does not, however, lead the authors of <I>The Empire Writes
Back</I> to challenge the norm of the "literary" as such, whose central
value as an exemplary form of (post)colonial culture is not self-evident
in societies in which universal literacy was not and still is not
the rule.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The presupposition of literacy, indeed of a highly developed mastery
of English or other European languages, as the necessary condition for
postcolonial culture betrays the metropolitan and literary orientation of
postcolonial criticism. Even if it draws from writers and theorists who
are not metropolitan in origin, it grants pride of place to the knowing
self-reflexive texts of the contemporary cosmopolitan (such as Salman
Rushdie or J. M. Coetzee) and treats the work (textual only in part) of
less mobile, less recent (post)colonial subjects as colonial imitation or
immature approximations of postcolonial hybridity. By using literary norms
to test (and discredit) cultural production from places and periods quite
different from the contemporary metropolis, postcolonial criticism tends
to treat the complexity of hybrid performance practices as insufficiently
sophisticated writing and thus to subordinate local histories, cultures,
and politics to the dictates of a present-day cosmopolitan hegemony.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This postcolonial avantgardism has a contradictory relation to the
history of imperialism (and anti-imperialism) on which it rests. On the
one hand, it acknowledges "the continuity of preoccupations throughout the
historical process of European aggression" (<I>EWB,</I> 2). On the other,
it asserts, rather prematurely, that "the postcolonial world is one in
which the destructive cultural encounter [of colonization] is changing
into an acceptance of difference on equal terms" (<I>EWB,</I> 36). Far
from "dealing with the problem of transmuting time into space," theories
that associate postcoloniality with a mode of reading (<I>EWB,</I> 163)
or even identifiable discursive features (<I>EWB,</I> 193), rather than a
condition defined by the cultural, political, and economic negotiation of
the shifting--but by no means receding--conditions of metropolitan power,
exacerbate the problem. By treating the uneven developments and parallel
but decidedly unequal histories within a particular political terrain
as a spatial relation between center and margin or between different
but equal discourses, postcoloniality threatens to <I>recolonize</I> the
tangled partial and unsynchronized histories of neocolonial culture and
society
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 and, in so doing, to disavow its own roots in this
uneven development.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stepping back from the brink of the beyond, the "trope of the 'post'"
that Homi Bhabha has identified as the sign of our times,
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

or what I would call the abstract finality of the postcolonial, we
ought to begin by looking at how the New Africans came to terms with the
institutions within which they emerged and against which they struggled
to represent themselves as legitimate South African subjects. New
Africans were indeed marked by an "imperial licence" in the form of the
missions and their schools, state surveillance of African newspapers,
and leisure organizations sponsored by European philanthropists, as well
as the more

<B></B>

overt racial discrimination of the self-governing Union
(since 1910), but they were not completely controlled by it. At a moment
when political rights for even elite Africans were curtailed, culture,
whether seen as arts or entertainment, became a crucial site for the
contestation of the legitimacy of African participation in public. As the
Emancipation Celebration and other "pageants" commemorating important
dates in a New African calendar suggest, theatre in the broadest sense
(dramatic representations for an audience) was a primary site of
contestation. Marginalized in a general South African public sphere
defined in racially exclusive terms, New African theatre articulated
what might be called a <I>virtual public sphere,</I> a discursive
and social field within which alternative representations of South
Africa could be entertained without direct exposure to the wrath of
the state.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a virtual public sphere, theatre operates in the subjunctive rather
than indicative mood. It skirts the dangerous field of immediate
political action in order to gain a testing ground for competing
representations of the nation. At stake here is the attempt to seize
the idea of modernity--citizenship, emancipation, individual and
collective agency--from its prevailing colonial representation; the
attempt, in other words, to "deploy, deform, and defuse" neocolonial
institutions and formations so as to make "many modernities" out of
colonial modernization.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to understand the terms of this virtual public sphere, we should
specify the character of neocolonial domination in South Africa in the
1930s. These were years in which the South African state dramatically
increased restrictions on the economic, political, and cultural mobility
of Africans through legislation such as the Urban Areas Act  and
its amendments in the 1930s: the Slums Act , which allowed for
the clearance of urban slumyards while restricting African access to
property or residence in urban areas, and the Native Representative Act
, which was to eliminate the last Africans from the Common Voters
Roll. It was also a period of political and cultural fluidity among
urban and urbanizing Africans in which different modes of resistance to
and negotiation of this dispensation were played out. Conflicts between
the modernizing drive of the state and its increasingly segregationist
ideology, between chiefs keen to maintain traditional ways and the
"civilizing" ambitions of the missionaries, and between African
nationalist and communist interpretations of the risks and benefits of
modernization for the black majority made for fractious and unstable
allegiances among different dominant and subaltern groups. The partially
transracial class solidarity among industrial workers in the 1920s was
giving way, under pressure from demands for the reservation of skilled
work for "poor [Afrikaans] whites," to class divisions on racial lines,
while the African National Congress, the Communist Party of South Africa,
and other groups that were to galvanize the population in the 1940s and
1950s were not yet mass organizations with effective political force.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beset by internal disputes, African Nationalists struggled in vain to
present a united front against the state. The conservative ascendancy
in the ANC, led by Pixley ka Seme and John Dube (president of the
Zulu-dominated Natal branch), tended to see in the state's program
of "separate development" an opportunity for what might be called
<I>retraditionalization.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Retraditionalization implies
not so much a return to premodern rural life as a reappropriation
of clan authority and custom as the means to a tangible if limited
autonomy, consolidating the power of the chiefs eroded by the emergence
of the New Africans on the one hand, and the mass migration of landless
blacks to the cities on the other.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 It was thus not so much
a rejection of modernity as an attempt to appropriate certain aspects
of modernization, especially vernacular literacy and the technological
reproduction or recording of traditional practices and artifacts, so
as to reinvent habitual tribal affiliation as a "natural" respect for
traditional authority.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This retraditionalist tendency collided with the habits and convictions
of New Africans in the cities, especially Johannesburg, who by and large
held to the belief that the benefits of modernization would ultimately
outweigh the disruption of communal life and tribal loyalties caused by
colonization. The editor Selope Thema, for instance, defended African
appropriation of the benefits of European civilization, such as literacy
and individual rights, while acknowledging the value of traditional
communal organization.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Revaluating the authority of the
chiefs, in particular the legendary power of the Zulu king Shaka over
a now scattered Zulu nation, Herbert Dhlomo argued that those invoking
Shaka defended the glories of a Zulu past rather than civil rights in the
present and were advocating a "new kind of tribalism...[that] encourages
non-progressive institutions among the people and [makes] the government
the supreme chief and dictator."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 And, in his only published
play, <I>The Girl who Killed to Save</I> , the exhortations of the
Xhosa prophetess Nongqause, who in 1856 urged the Xhosa to kill their
cattle in anticipation of divine wrath being visited on the colonizers,
and the consequent starvation of the clan are ultimately rered and
the deaths redeemed as the price paid for civilization.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet an editorial published almost a year before the Emancipation Centenary
Celebration remained sceptical of European intentions to honor the promise
of universal rights: "it is true that Natives can no longer be bought and
sold...but they are still in bondage as a people and there is a determined
stand by Europeans against the grant to them [<I>sic</I>] of that full
liberty to which all men are entitled.... Natives are not slaves, but they
are not freemen."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Emphasizing the entrenchment of racial
prejudice despite formal freedoms, the editorial draws on the insights
of W. E. B. Dubois's <I>The Souls of Black Folk</I> to combat the notion
of separate development under segregation accepted by Seme, Dube, and
others influenced by the example of Booker T. Washington.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

Profoundly suspicious of European definitions of the authentically
African that were promulgated by apologists for development along the
"Native's own lines," this and other editorials urged readers to bring
together African and European traditions by participating

<B></B>

 in cultural
institutions such as the BMSC, the Gamma Sigma debating societies, or
the Eisteddfodau, festivals of choral singing and dramatic monologues
loosely based on Welsh (and British imperial) models.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At its most instrumental, culture became a form of social control. Mining
industrialists argued that monitoring their employees after hours
meant a "good business investment" in the "moral and physical health
of the workforce."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Missionaries hoped to curb social and
economic unrest and the "swaggering, sweeping claims of Communism" by
"moralizing the leisure time of the natives";
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Ray Phillips,
author of the assimilationist <I>The Bantu are Coming</I> , for
instance, appealed to the Chamber of Mines to fund activities ranging
from the elite BMSC to Chaplin evenings for mine workers. More subtle,
perhaps, were the aspirations of the African retraditionalists such as
Dube, Caluza, and others who saw in the state's interest in preserving
"native ways" an occasion for reestablishing a coherent ethnic inheritance
from rural practices fractured by colonization. In the space between the
instrumentalization of culture in the production of modernized subjects,
whether among the mine and other industrial workers or in the black
intermediary class, and the evocation of culture as a retraditionalized
refuge from the ravages of modernization, the ambiguous notion of the
disinterestedness of culture offered an escape, at once compelling
and imaginary, from daily humiliations. This relative autonomy could
and did give cultural production an affirmative cast, in Marcuse's
sense of reinforcing the status quo by providing an imaginary refuge
from it,
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 but it also offered at least the framework for a
virtual public sphere, as I have defined it, as a site for the subjunctive
enactment of an African agency.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The variety of theatre by and for Africans in 1930s Johannesburg suggests
the contemporary persistence as well as the limitations of oppositions
between elite and popular, imported and indigenous, literary and oral
culture. <I>She Stoops to Conquer,</I> the Bantu Dramatic Society's
inaugural production , was perhaps closest to the English genteel
culture of the mission schools, but the "tribal sketches" of the Lucky
Stars and the All African Eisteddfodau, which combined European and
African theatrical and musical forms, were also indebted to missionary
education. They in their turn inspired the commercially successful
African "revues" and pageants by the popular Darktown Strutters and their
successors, De Pitch Black Follies, whose leader Griffiths Motsieloa also
participated in the Eisteddfodau. On the other hand, the Bantu People's
Players' 1936 version of <I>The Hairy Ape</I> (which was to have been
the Bantu Dramatic Society's first production) combined the agitprop
skills of Belgian socialist Andre van Gyseghem (then in South Africa as
Director of Pageants for the Empire Exhi-bition) with the local resonance
of Fanagalo, the pidgin used by miners and their bosses, to produce
a more emphatic representation of social and economic injustice. The
Bantu Dramatic and Operatic Society's production of <I>Moshoeshoe,</I>
Herbert Dhlomo's dramatization of the charismatic nineteenth-century
Sotho

<B></B>

leader, attempted to bring together the "tribal sketch," the
history play, and the Eisteddfod recital in a dramatic response to the
ascendancy of segregationist ideology by the end of the decade.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hybrid character of these experiments resides not only in their use of
form but also in the tensions between form and occasion of performance,
especially in the representation of African tradition in the modern
European medium of naturalist drama. The reconstruction of a legitimate
(rather than verifiably authentic) folk culture in this period relies
heavily, as Veit Erlmann has demonstrated in his account of South African
music, on the invention of tradition and a "usable past"
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

"out of the disparate remnants of a shattered rural order" (<I>AS,</I>
150). In the creation of an African National Theatre, as in that of an
African music, finding a usable past was not so much an act of pure
discovery as a process of collection, recollection, and invention,
of grafting together African and European material in ways that would
resonate with performers and audiences. The strict correspondence between
actor and embodied character, and the naturalist convention of situating
the actor's expression of interiority in a set designed to represent a
particular exterior or interior environment, both characteristic of the
early twentieth-century metropolitan mainstream, had little in common with
the more fluid and more overtly rhetorical relationship between performer,
character and location in the praise-songs, folktales, and community
dancing characteristic of southern Bantu performance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of language, the hegemony of literary culture and genteel
norms, and the weakness (relative to music) of an African American
mediating term made the development of an African National Theatre more
complicated than its musical counterpart. The central site for this
"invention of tradition" was paradoxically also the crucible for elite
modernization: the mission schools, such as Lovedale, Amanzimtoti--later
Adams--College, or the Ohlange Institute, John Dube's counterpart
to Tuskegee. Institutions such as these had long encouraged school
performances of dramatic sketches, sometimes on English subjects, and
often as "reconstructions of tribal life" (<I>AS</I>, 64).
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

These sketches, in combination with exposure to metropolitan literature
and music, provided the inspiration for the Lucky Stars, founded in
1929 by the Mthethwa brothers, who were educated, like the Dhlomos,
at Amanzimtoti College. Their sketches portrayed such subjects as
<I>Ukuqomisa</I> (courting) or <I>Umthakathi</I> (the sorcerer) and often
concluded with a rousing dance finale. Although formed in large part by
an elite place and occasion (mission schools, the BMSC, and the like),
the Lucky Stars were enthusiastically received by black workers and those
on the fringes of the formal economy, especially in less industrialized
Natal, where audiences found these "idealized images of a rural past" a
welcome escape from their double alienation, in racial and class terms,
from "civilization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet claims that the Lucky Stars offered an early but unmistakable
instance of critical or satirical black theatre
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 and
should therefore be seen as forerunners of the anti-apartheid protest
theatre of the 1970s,
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 should be treated with caution. The
origins of the sketches in the folkloric recuperation of the missions
did not

<B></B>

prevent them from being appropriated by a diverse popular
audience, but the ethnic emphasis, even exclusiveness, of the sketches
was problematic; it reflected as much the Zulu pride of the performers,
most of whom came from the Zulu-identified Amanzimtoti College,
as the desire to challenge the social and economic discrimination
against all Africans. Since they were performed in the Zulu language
and in historically reconstructed Zulu costume (rather than the mixed
traditional and modified attire worn in rural Zululand at the time), the
alleged satirical intent of the sketches would have been only partially
recognizable to speakers of other Bantu languages who saw the shows,
whose responses may have been affected as much by the music (itself a
hybridization of urban and rural forms) and the tangible presence of
African actors as by the sketches' authentic details. The account of the
Jewish South African impresario, Bertha Slosberg, who promoted the group
from 1933 through its crowning appearance at the Empire Exhibition in
1936, emphasizes the spectacular as well as the folkloric dimension the
thrilling dancing as well as the need "to salvage from European influence,
the remaining power, the native simplicity, the splendid savage grandeur
of a dying pagan land."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Banishing "Natives" after 8 P.M. and
thus excluding them from "entertainments for Europeans,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

the Exhibition marginalized the urban African who might disturb the
ethnographic entertainment for white audiences. This arrangement fostered
primitivist nostalgia among whites anxious to preserve "images of native
domestic life," but did not prevent the performance from "influenc[ing]
Johannesburg Location productions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Lucky Stars were praised by white spectators of the Empire
Exhibition for their displays of rural life, their successors attempted
to capitalize on the appeal of the sketches for urban black audiences,
while deploying the form to somewhat different ends. Although De Pitch
Black Follies were, like the Lucky Stars, dependent on the benevolence
of white city officials and white capital (including the patronage of
Gallophone), they did not limit their performances to the "coon songs"
<I>(izikhunzi)</I> implied by their minstrel label and popular with
working-class audiences, or to the Zulu folksongs and sketches that formed
the repertoire of many of their mission-educated members such as Motsieloa
(<I>AS,</I> 164, 171), and which appealed more to the sensibilities of the
retraditionalists. A description in <I>Bantu World</I> of De Pitch Black
Follies performing "Africa--a revel pageant" in 1940 suggests an emphasis
on evolutionary modernization, "depicting the march of progress among the
Bantu, from the primitive stage right up to that of the 'Upper Tenth,'
the academic class, with a didactic climax--the necessity of 'Unity in
Diversity' in Bantudom."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Performed in the state-administered
"community hall" in Western Native Township, the sketch would have had
an audience that included industrial and service workers as well as
intellectuals, but probably few <I>abaphakathi.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This description of "Africa" echoes the aspirations of the Emancipation
Centenary  rather than the primitivist nostalgia of Slosberg's
"dying pagan land" , insofar as it reiterates the evolutionist
views permeating the earlier event. The format of the "revel pageant,"
however, recalls the Empire

<B></B>

Exhibition's presentation of the Lucky
Stars. Like that performance, this one included spectacular displays of
"African traditional dance" as well as comic skits from the minstrel
repertoire. This motley combination of uplift and self-mocking
exaggeration, familiar from the vaudeville revues throughout the
decade, was regarded with some concern by New Africans, who feared,
as one commentator wrote, that excessive exposure to jazz and other
distractions would "deafen our appreciation for art," including the
"greater beauty and entertainment" of drama.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Herbert
Dhlomo, regarded by himself and other New Africans (and some whites) as
a spokesman for an "African tradition grafted onto the European," was
critical not only of the commodification of African tradition as "exotic
crudities"
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 but also of its embalming as "static museum-like
plays."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Like the New Negro who challenged white society's
"sentimental interest" in black traditions and the "double standard" of
the "philanthropic attitude" among white American liberals,
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

the New African was suspicious of those who expressed concern for
"native" traditions while remaining either indifferent or hostile to
black aspirations to transform society as a whole.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even prominent critics of retraditionalist rhetoric such as Herbert
Dhlomo were nonetheless obliged to recognize its usefulness in addressing
an audience caught up in the contradictions of colonial modernity. In
the period between his first play, <I>The Girl Who Killed to Save</I>
(written in 1934), and the 1939 production of <I>Moshoeshoe,</I> Dhlomo
moved closer to an emphasis on "tribal drama" and traditional forms. An
early version of an essay entitled "The Importance of African Drama"
indicates the prospects and the pitfalls Dhlomo saw in the idea of an
African National Theatre:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Modern drama is not a mere emotional entertainment. It is a source of
ideas, a cultural and educational factor, an agency for propaganda and,
above all, it is literature. What part will the new African play in
modern drama? On its physical                  side, he can contribute
strong, fast rhythm, speedy action, expressive vigorous gesture
and movement, powerful dramatic speech--no small contribution when
modern plays drag so tediously.... We want African playwrights who
will dramatize ...African History. We want dramatic representations of
African Serfdom. Oppression, Exploitation, and Metamorphosis.... The
African dramatist...can expose evil and corruption and not suffer libel
as newspapermen do; he can guide and preach to his people as preachers
cannot do. To do this he must be an artist before a propagandist; a
philosopher before a reformer, a psychologist before a patriot; be true
to his African "self" and not be prey to exotic crudities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dhlomo defends the priority of literary drama, yet he insists that the
strong performative dimension of African oral traditions should inform
any African National Theatre. He calls for the dramatic representation of
social injustice, but also argues that the modern African dramatist should
be artist before propagandist. This inconsistency certainly expresses the
tension between the precepts of

<B></B>

Dhlomo's missionary education (which
defended the timelessness of art against the contingencies of politics)
and the pressures of the historical moment that push him and his peers
towards commitment, but it also speaks for the concept of art, in this
case theatre, as a form of negative critique or virtual public sphere.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The appeal to art before propaganda therefore should not be read as
a capitulation to imposed norms of gentility. Rather, it attempts to
use the notion of artistic autonomy to negotiate cultural space for
the contestation of oppression in an environment in which more direct
action (from political mobilization to adversarial journalism) was
increasingly curtailed. Framing the revitalization of tradition in
the generalizing terms of African nationalism, Dhlomo challenges both
white and black separatists when he argues, in a 1939 essay entitled
"Why Study Tribal Dramatic Forms?" that this revitalization should
transform not only African forms but also modern drama as a whole by
"infus[ing] new blood into the weary limbs of the older dramatic forms
of Europe" ("WST," 35). The hint of deference is more than offset by the
critical reference to the "weary limbs...of Europe" or, in the earlier
essay, to the "tedium" of modern (by implication, English) plays. This
disdain for the "acting plays" of the commercial theatre in favor of
"literary drama" ("WST," 39) that might also propagandize for social
change echoes the aspirations of the advocates of the "new social drama"
(G. B. Shaw, John Galsworthy, and their contemporaries) in Britain, but,
like them, stops well short of a radical abolition of aesthetics in the
manner of Brecht's <I>Lehrst&uuml;cke</I> or the proletarian agitprop
in both the United States and Britain during this period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The example of metropolitan social drama, its attempt to be both literary
and engaged, independent of the pressure to make a profit yet able to
draw an audience, exercises a significant but not overwhelming influence
on Dhlomo's reflections on drama and the African. Whereas Dhlomo's
suggested themes may confirm the influence of Shaw or Galsworthy, his
ideal institution of theatre differs from that of the metropolitan
"new drama," whose producers relied on a modified version of the
commercial theatre. Against this commodification of drama, Dhlomo
envisages performance legitimated as an occasion in the social life of a
community. In "The Nature and Variety of Tribal Drama" , he points
to the close relationship between the occasion of performance and the
commemoration of significant events, rites of passage, seasonal festivals,
and the like and argues that traditional African drama shares with the
classical Greek its integration into the social fabric.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 This
evocation of a theatre of ritual power, of "sympathetic magic," does not
entail a nostalgic revival of tribal community, but rather the reverse:
"The African artist cannot delve into the Past unless he has first grasped
the Present. African art can grow and thrive not only by...excavat-ing
archaical art forms, but by grappling with present-day realities" ("WST,"
40). Instead of "static museum-like drama based on primitive tradition and
culture" ("WST," 39), Dhlomo envisaged an African National Theatre that
might appropriate those African performance forms that lent themselves
to a critical engagement between past and present.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While highlighting the public character of these forms, however, he
insists that they be evaluated as "ends in themselves," in aesthetic
as well as functional terms ("NVT," 27). He appropriates the courtly
tradition of <I>izibongo</I> (praises--usually of the king or noble),
rather than the more demotic convention of <I>izinganekwane</I>
(folktales), and suggests a desire to legitimate a tradition of high
culture as universal as Greek tragedy in the European pantheon; but his
appeal to tradition rests on the distinctly modern invention of a term,
<I>izibongelo</I>, to bolster his claim that this panegyric form contains
within it traces of dramatic structure and that its function, like that of
drama, is to "tell the story of the nation" ("NVT," 23, 35).
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These essays thus record the impact of retraditionalist rhetoric. They
appeal to a "sacred inheritance" ("WST," 37) as the "ground on which a
great original African drama can be built" ("NVT," 35), even as they
speak to New African scepticism of the "museum-like" construction of
ethnicity as a display in ethnography's exhibition of discrimination. They
also register the strain in New African faith in modernization through
Europeanization. The ineffectual response of most white liberals to
the disenfranchisement of Africans and enforcement of the pass laws,
the state's indifference to the protests of the All African Convention
(AAC) held in December 1935, and the spectacle of European savagery in
Spain and Ethiopia, undermined the authority of "white civilization" as
such. As D. D. T. Jabavu, convener of the AAC, had it:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
After hearing a great deal for twenty years about the rights of small
nations, self-determination, Christian ideals, the
inviolability of treaties,...the glory of European civilization, and so
forth, the brief history of the last eight months [since the summoning
of the Convention in December 1935] has scratched this European veneer
and revealed the white savage hidden beneath.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Tim Couzens and Martin Orkin have pointed out, Dhlomo's dramatic
writing in this period responds more directly than before to the
contradictory impulses of colonial modernity, if not quite with the
ferocity of Jabavu, then in the more cautious spirit of Selope Thema:
"tribal life is not a peculiarity of the African race; it is a stage
through which the great nations of today have passed ...we have a right
to decide our own destiny and to make our distinctive contribution to
the world's civilizations."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 The play most often cited in
this context is <I>Cetshwayo</I> (1936-37). Portraying the betrayal of
the last autonomous Zulu king in the 1870s by Theophilus Shepstone,
Governor of Natal, and his ally John Dunn, "English adventurer"
gone native, <I>Cetshwayo</I> is Dhlomo's most explicit indictment of
segregation and disenfranchisement conducted in the name of civilization
and Empire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 For all the argument for African forms and
conventions, however, the dramaturgy of <I>Cetshwayo</I> is thoroughly
Aristotelian or, more precisely, Schillerian, in that it focuses on a
national hero whose inability to see through the machinations of his
enemies brings about his tragic defeat;

<B></B>

African motifs, especially
<I>izibongo</I> of the king, tend to be subordinated to the forward
drive of the plot. Drawing on the Schillerian history play in its
English derivation as well as the conventions of Victorian melodrama,
especially in its treatment of the "white Zulu" Dunn, <I>Cetshwayo</I>
makes for stirring reading today. We can, however, only speculate on
the contemporary effect of this play, since it was neither published
nor publicly performed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Moshoeshoe</I>, written in the same period, was performed by the
Bantu Dramatic and Operatic Society at the BMSC in May 1939, in honor
of Moshoeshoe Day.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Less adversarial than <I>Cetshwayo,
Moshoeshoe</I> portrayed the wisdom of the legendary Sotho statesman,
revered both for his ability to resolve conflicts between his
subjects and refugees from the Difecane (the mass migration caused
by Zulu expansionism in the 1830s), and as a model African leader
whose perspicacity was sadly missed a century later. By placing at
the center of his play a <I>pitso,</I> or people's assembly, Dhlomo
called to mind the current disputes of the ANC and AAC. The play's
emphasis on Moshoeshoe's criticism of ethnically divisive custom and
the temptations of dictatorship highlighted the relative success of the
Basutoland Protectorate's resistance against attempts at incorporation
and retribalization by the South African government.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The significance of <I>Moshoeshoe</I> does not lie solely in an
allegorical representation of a modern African state in embryo,
however. Equally important is the play's attempt to negotiate a new
association of form, content, and occasion of performance. Form, in
particular language, appears to have been the most problematic. Although
the play was praised in the African press for portraying an exemplary
African leader, its evocation of Sotho custom and its entwinement of
"legend and reality, action and philosophy,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 the attempt
to render Sotho praises, proverbs, and dialogue in English received a
mixed response. Whereas the <I>Bantu World</I> reviewer praised the play
as the first indigenous drama combining the efforts of Zulu (Dhlomo and
the composer Caluza) and Sotho (the choreographer, A. P. Khutlang, and
songwriter, Salome Masoleng) and justified the flowery verse and choppy
syntax by claiming that the play's "chief charm lies in the dialogue which
is a literal translation from the language in which it was originally
written,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 his <I>Umteteli</I> counterpart maintained that
"there was too much of the refined" in the dialogue and accused the actors
of not being "typically Masotho." Songs in Sotho rather than English, he
argues, "would have contributed much to making the play a strong living
drama of a significant episode in our national life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 This
dispute reflects the strain in the language of the play between a desire
for idiomatic authenticity and an aspiration to poetic language that would
transcend local specificity and "find the changeless in the changing,
the fundamental in the ephemeral."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 It also suggests that
the question of authenticity was itself subject to dispute and could
not be resolved in terms of form or stable literary value, but rather
in terms of the significance of the occasion of performance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The occasion of the performance was likewise subject to strain. Although
the play was performed at the BMSC and not, for instance, in the setting
dominated

<B></B>

by the mountain Thaba Bosiu, where Moshoeshoe held his
<I>pitso,</I> or its namesake in Pimville, near Johannesburg, where
political meetings were held,
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 its loosely linked scenes--the
<I>pitso</I> at the center, framed by suitors' quarrels and encounters
between the Basotho, a wandering bard, and refugees from the Difecane,
and ending with a harvest festival--suggest a recurrent commemoration
rather than a unique story. The music for the performance, like that
for the Emancipation Centenary, would have at least alluded to melodies
already familiar from Caluza's songs of national sorrow such as "iLand
Act" and "Elamakosi," which lament African dispossession and appeal to
the chiefs for guidance. Dhlomo would have liked to legitimate his play
in the eyes of an African public by drawing on the immediate authority
of the Convention as well as the comparison with numerous Moshoeshoe
Day rallies, but this legitimation was far from secure. While reviewers
picked up the contemporary resonance of the <I>pitso</I> and readers and
audience alike would have made the connection between the <I>pitso</I>
and the rallies, the harvest festival that concludes the play does not
quite bring in the yield. The festival envelops but cannot incorporate
the missionaries who praise Moshoeshoe's genius only to cast doubt
on the enactment of his legacy: "Moshoeshoe...a man consumed by the
smouldering and devastating fire of...great expectations unfulfilled,
of plans and ambitions whose very attainment would give birth to plans
and ambitions never to be attained."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 This ambiguous praise
strikes a cautionary note against the soaring <I>izibongo</I> at the
end; the allusion to the citadel of Thaba Bosiu and to "Moshoeshoe the
man-mountain, the mountain-mind" has the status of tradition but not
the force of historical inevitability.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In dramatizing the discrepancy between the celebration of the African
exemplar and the implied deflection of his legacy while not providing
a resolution, <I>Moshoeshoe</I> represents the historical impasse faced
by the New Africans. In 1934, the Emancipation Centenary Celebration was
still able to sustain the legitimacy of liberal paternalism, bolstered
by the conviction held by the promoters, participants, and many in
the audience of the necessary conjunction of emancipation, modernity,
and European civilization. In 1939, however, this quintessen-tially
New African conviction was evaporating in the white heat of European
savagery at home and abroad. In the decades to follow, a revitalized
African nationalism was to break this impasse and galvanize resistance
to the segregationist state. <I>Moshoeshoe,</I> with its juxtaposition
of incompatible elements and its lack of resolution--in short, its
<I>in</I>authenticity--does not offer a model for the protest literature
that was to accompany (but not necessarily reflect) this resistance
and that was to characterize much black South African writing from the
1940s to the present. The flaws and fissures in the text of the play,
however, and the occasion of its performance speak more truly than any
tragic catharsis or resounding fictional triumph to the pressures of the
historical moment, the aspirations of New Africans, and the fundamental
incoherence of colonial modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aporia at the heart of colonial modernity consists most obviously in
the incommensurability of the promise, on the one hand, of universal
rights and

<B></B>

emancipation--in short, modernity--and, on the
other, the practice of liberal paternalism and limited civilization
under neocolonial tutelage. What is at issue, however, is not simply the
details of a particular South African history, but rather the character
of modernity in general or, more concretely, modernity historically and
presently generalized from the metropole to the margins. New African
interpretation of what Clifford Geertz has called the "dispersions and
discontinuities of modern life" is in part "local knowledge," but it is

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New African hybridization of the dramatic and critical repertories
disseminated by missionary schools and other neocolonial institutions
may be historically distinct from current postcolonial hybridity but is
nonetheless structurally comparable to the appropriation of metropolitan
discourses in other colonial and postcolonial environments, including
the current one of <I>The Empire Writes Back.</I> The authority of this
text and others like it depends on a paradoxical inheritance: on the one
hand, postcolonial critics draw on metropolitan modes of interpretation
historically disseminated and deformed in local institutions--from mission
schools to universities--which are at best only partially accessible to
colonized subjects like the New Africans or their descendants. On the
other hand, these critics owe the legitimacy of the field to precisely
those local knowledges and particular histories that have so far eluded
appropriation. If postcolonial theory is to take seriously its own
assertion that "the inauthentic, the marginal," rather than practices
legitimated by either traditional or metropolitan authority, "is the
real" of postcolonial writing (<I>EWB,</I> 41), then it must begin by
acknowledging this ambiguous relation to its objects of study and, with
it, the debt of postcolonial (post)modernism to the contradictory legacy
of colonial modernity.

"African" commonly refers to Bantu-speaking people of reputedly
complete African ancestry, whether habitual speakers of English or the
vernaculars. The official government equivalent was "Native" until
the 1950s, when it was replaced by "Bantu." "Black" (as opposed to
the official term "non-European"), used since the 1970s to designate
all those disenfranchised by apartheid, is thus a term of political
rather than simply racial or ethnic identification, since it includes
those of mixed (so-called "Coloured") and Asian descent, who do not
regularly speak Bantu languages. "European," until recently synonymous
with "white," is a sign not so much of origin as political and cultural
hegemony and therefore implicitly intersects with "American" as well as
"English" society and culture.

primarily African, and ranged from the African intelligentsia to mine
workers. Most, but not all, writers were African. The lead articles were

Xhosa, Tswana) focused on local issues, they also included news and

Robert Kavanagh's <I>Theatre and Cultural Struggle in South
Africa</I> (London: Zed Books, 1985), a key text in the field, sets
the tone by emphatically distinguishing between the state and its
intermediaries on the one hand, and the "fundamentally oppressed masses"
(xv) on the other; Martin Orkin's more recent <I>Drama and the South
African State</I> (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1991), as
its title indicates, follows this paradigmatic division, although Orkin
allows space for the ambivalence of res such as Herbert Dhlomo. For

As historians of leisure in South African cities have indicated,
class distinctions between elite and popular or petit bourgeois and
working class were solidifying in this period; but there were no "class
cultures" as such, as Belinda Bozzoli points out in the introduction
to <I>Town and Countryside in the Transvaal: Capitalist Penetration and
Popular Response</I> (Johannesburg: Ravan, 1983), 40. While those present
at the BMSC version of the Emancipation Celebration, for instance, were
reluctant to be associated with the alleged immorality of the marabi
dance and music culture of the slumyards but may have gone to minstrel
shows, the audience at the Eastern Native Township (not a slumyard) was
more likely to go to a marabi dance than to the Bantu Dramatic Society's
production of <I>She Stoops to Conquer</I> at the BMSC. The classification
of tastes according to class is here further complicated by the fact
that much of the minstrelsy and ragtime that arrived in South Africa in
the form of recorded and sheet music as well as touring companies was
"more 'white' than 'black' in terms of its musical components, but what
mattered was the way in which it was appropriated as an object of black
cultural pride in South Africa" (<I>AS</I>, 18).

the modern South Africa"  highlights the intermediary and therefore
ambiguous class position of this formation. He points out that the New
Africans' scorn for the <I>abaphakathi</I> was not without irony, since
they too had come up through assimilation (36-37).

Homi Bhabha's <I>The Location of Culture</I> (London: Routledge,

of postmodernism and post-colonialism.


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT14" HREF="#REF14">14</A>.
The strength of <I>The Empire Writes Back,</I> with its rather
foreshortened focus on those postcolonial texts that also display a
postmodern discursive play, lies in the elucidation of the more recent
writing of the "settler cultures" of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada
(the authors' points of origin and reference). Its comments on South
African writing tend either to be sketchy and one-dimensional, as in the
simple designation of Mofolo's <I>Chaka</I> (published in Sotho in 1910)
as "missionary literature" or elaborately out of time and place, as in
the reading of the exile Lewis Nkosi's <I>Mating Birds</I> , which
proceeds without engaging either the text's anachronism (the version
of apartheid in the novel bears scant relation to its implied time
and place) or its refraction by unmistakable American influences (most
obviously, Amiri Baraka's play, <I>Dutchman</I>). Despite these (and
other) moments of local blindness, or perhaps because of them, the book
has been remarkably influential, especially in metropolitan institutions;
it is for this reason that it is the primary focus of my critique.

As Negt and Kluge have argued in response to Habermas's classic
conceptualization, publicity includes not only physical space for public
activity but also the civic and cultural mobilization necessary if
the popular majority is to emerge as the public. It also acknowledges
the experience of exclusion from public action that might precede such
mobilization. See Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, <I>Public Sphere and
Experience,</I> trans. Peter Labanyi, Jamie Owen Daniel, and Assenka
Oksiloff (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993). For a more

modernization; V. I. Mudimbe redeploys the concept, in <I>The Invention

While the rhetoric of separate development appealed to chiefs
keen to maintain their ebbing authority and also to rural Africans
wary of living conditions in the cities (despite extreme rural poverty
brought about by the government's legalized land grab--the Land Act
of 1913), there can be no doubt that the government's interest in
segregation, although rationalized by contradictory assertions about
African self-determination and the vulnerability of the "child race,"
was firmly grounded in "European interests," especially in the desire
for a labor reserve uncontaminated by the "usual antagonism of class
war"; see Saul Dubow, "Race, Civilization and Culture: The Elaboration
of Segregationist Discourse in the Inter-war Years," in <I>The Politics
of Race, Class and Nationalism in South Africa,</I> ed. Shula Marks
and Stanley Trapido (London: Longman Publishing Group, 1989), 71-94. In
"Patriotism, Patriarchy, and Purity: Natal and the Politics of Zulu Ethnic
Consciousness," in <I>The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa,</I>
ed. Leroy Vail (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989), Shula
Marks notes that ethnic consciousness in South Africa "has been the
product of intense ideological labour by the black intelligentsia and
white ideologues" , as the close ties between the Natal ANC, the
Zulu Cultural Society (founded in 1937), and the Department of Native
Affairs confirm.

In her classic account, <I>Oral Literature in Africa</I>

"while dramatic elements [such as impersonation, props, costume, and
the representation of interaction among characters] enter into several
different categories of artistic activity in Africa..., there are few or
no forms which include all these elements" . She argues that South
Bantu conventions in particular favor the sequential impersonations by
the storyteller or praise poet, rather than the dramatic imitation of
several characters, each by a designated actor.

enthusiasm to a series of dance numbers in a show at the Drury Lane called

performance for the Imperial Press Conference that included mineworkers
doing <I>ingoma</I> (Zulu "war" dancing) and choruses singing hymns
and shebeen songs, she urged white South Africans to learn from the
"black races" ("There was Real Acting at Wemmer," <I>Bantu World,</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">E. J. Hobsbawm opens his book <I>Nations and Nationalism since 1780</I>
with an anecdote about "an intergalactic historian" who lands after a
nuclear war and, going through the archives, concludes that "the last
two centuries of the human history of planet Earth are incomprehensible
without some understanding of the term 'nation' and the vocabulary derived
from it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 I take Hobsbawm's appeal to this not otherwise very
entertaining anecdote as an illustration of how contradictory the general
understanding of nationalism has become. If he has to ascend into outer
space in search of an observer who will look at nations and nationalism
with an alien eye, it is presumably because everyone on earth during
these two centuries has been so much <I>inside</I> them, incapable of
breaking free from their categories and assumptions. So ubiquitous and
deep-rooted is the nation, Hobsbawm implies, that no perspective that
is truly alien to it could be discovered any closer to home.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The central argument of <I>Nations and Nationalism,</I> however,
would seem to suggest just the opposite. Appearances to the contrary,
nationalism is in fact no longer nearly as important as it once was,
Hobsbawm argues, for--to speak schematically--the globalization
of multinational capitalism in the postmodern era has undermined
it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Nationhood can now be bestowed on even the tiniest,
unlikeliest claimants, in much the same way that (as Wlad Godzich has
remarked)
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 the status of "culture" can suddenly be shared
equally between the "high" and the "low," because neither term is crucial
any longer to the projects of capitalist development. It would seem to
follow, then, that a skeptical, distanced view of nationalism, something
like Hobsbawm's own Olympian perspective--a perspective for which the
"intergalactic historian" is a rather transparent disguise--would be
common to a great many observers all over the planet. (Empirically,
this seems indeed to be very much the case.) But if so, then why
does the extra-nationalist perspective have to be incarnated by an
extraterrestrial? Why does Hobsbawm imply on the one hand that nearly
everyone stands outside nationalism, and on the other that nearly no
one does?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this paradox can be reformulated as a riddle--who is it that represents
nearly everyone and nearly no one?--then its answer may lie unexpectedly
near to hand: in that re of modernity whose self-appointed mission
has been to speak for the many, but whose social situation has been that
of a privileged few. Taking our cue from the suspicious redundancy of
the space-traveling researcher, that is, we can perhaps read Hobsbawm's
hesitation between a ubiquitous and a nonexistent supra-nationalist
perspective as a report on the structural contradictions of the
metropolitan intellectual. Intellectuals, Hobsbawm seems to suggest,
must be and yet cannot be, cannot be and yet must be, cosmopolitans.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Dreyfus Affair, which is often cited as the origin of the term
<I>intellectual,</I> exposed the category's immediate vulnerability to
charges both of class pride and privilege vis-&agrave;-vis "ordinary
people" and of treason to the fatherland. The latter charge has more
frequently been reversed since the era of national liberation struggles
and decolonization: while cosmopolitan intellectuals are still accused of
serving their own self-interest, they are now accused not of betraying
their nation, but of serving their nation, and the West, all too
well. But intellectuals themselves are often the first to make both
of these accusations--and this fact offers striking evidence of their
contradictory relation to nationalism. For where do such accusations
originate if not in an implicit claim to cosmopolitan <I>detachment</I>
from the nation?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Linked both to social hierarchy and to the guilty history of Eurocentric
universalizing, cosmopolitanism has been out of fashion. Metropolitan
intellectuals, feeling themselves newly accountable to a public sphere
stretching beyond the NATO alliance, have urged themselves to rediscover
their own particularity and their situatedness with respect to gender,
race, class, and, of course, nation. It has been widely assumed,
accordingly, that a truly supranationalist or even supra-national
viewpoint--the extent of the difference remains controversial--can
exist

<B></B>

 only as science fiction, a disembodied fantasy of quasi-divine
ubiquity and omniscience. Yet at the same time, I would argue, this
state of intergalactic alienation remains inscribed in the protocols of
even the most multicultural discourse. In part, this is a paradoxical but
necessary result of the same sense of accountability to a newly expanded,
less Eurocentric public opinion. According to metropolitan intellectuals,
Eurocentric universalizing discourse has been an unconscious way of
"speaking as," that is, speaking from within our best defended perimeters
of belonging. This is precisely why a <I>conscious</I> way of "speaking
as," a mode of address that anticipates and recognizes the diversity of
readers and colleagues, demands a degree of self-alienation. Despite
all the lip service paid to the humble acceptance of location and all
the sarcasm lavished on fantasies of disembodied mobility, therefore,
the fantasy or convention of geographical self-distancing is one that
academics and other intellectuals implicitly identify with and act out,
on a daily basis, through the whole range of their routine choices
of viewpoint and attitude, comparison and evaluation. To be sure,
genuine changes in the politics of scholarship have occurred since the
age of Matthew Arnold and Max Weber. It is clear that nationalism is
often a deep (and sometimes a necessary) inspiration for intellectual
work; if Julien Benda thought intellectuals were distinctively and
constitutively supranational, Weber described them as "predestined to
propagate the 'national idea.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Yet the abstraction of the
self from the nation remains a fantasy or convention without which the
form and even the content of intellectual life as we know it would
be unrecognizable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 In our heart of hearts, do we really
believe there can be a historian worthy of the name who is <I>not</I>
intergalactic?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unluckily, this is not merely a puzzle for intellectuals themselves. Both
points of this contradiction have become weapons in the continuing
attacks on U.S. teachers and other cultural workers, especially
though not exclusively from the right, that have been called the
"culture wars." The double charge is of course "Third Worldism" on
the one hand, "elitism" on the other. The right has presented its
opponents as traitors to European civilization, a new set of misguided
palefaces rapt with admiration before Third World redskins; it has also
presented them as coddled children of the 1960s, elitists out of touch
with American values, "tenured radicals." There is just enough truth
in each charge to give extra sting when they are consolidated by the
right's paradoxical appropriation of "class" as a weapon against the
left. Both charges are also translatable into a lack of concern for the
national welfare, and both lend themselves to a growing backlash, in
favor of teaching and against research, posed in the seductive terms of
national responsibility and democracy. In the interest of self-defense as
well as self-knowledge, then, intellectuals seem called upon to rethink
their narratives of where they come from and to propose some alternative
account of their undeniable yet perpetually denied cosmopolitanism, an
account that will help them to mediate between the charge of elitism
(one of postmodernism's accusations against modernism) and the charge
of nomadic, touristic delectation of distant cultures (modernism's
corresponding accusation against postmodernism).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once we are alerted to this state of contradiction, we can suddenly
appreciate that a certain amount of intellectual effort has already
gone into trying, however obliquely, to resolve it. For example,
ever-proliferating scholarship about nationalism offers the occasional
slender insight--most often implicit and in passing, yet all the
more valuable therefore--into the history of that which is <I>not</I>
nationalism, the apparently oxymoronic and troublingly reflexive question
of where cosmopolitanism might come from. (I offer two examples at the
end of this essay.) There has also been a more explicit move to salvage
the concept from its associations with class and Western privilege
by demonstrating the existence of a sort of demotic, non-Western or
non-elitist cosmopolitanism. James Clifford has emphasized the traveling
that is always already part of the non-European cultures investigated by
European ethnography; for Clifford, the phrase "different cultures" can
thus be replaced by the phrase "discrepant cosmopol-itanisms."

 In two interlocking

 Summing up a distinct tendency, evident in

as the older <I>Transition,</I> the South African critic Benita Parry
writes in the latter, "there is a recognition that the 'global flows' of
transnational cultural traffic have issued in 'public cultures' productive
of an emergent <I>postcolonial</I> cosmopolitanism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Thus
extended both geographically and socially, the term <I>cosmopolitanism</I>
now includes an Indian slave sent by a Jewish merchant to transact
business around the Persian Gulf in the Middle Ages, African servants of
British travellers in the 1800s, African American travellers in modernist
Europe, and European or Caribbean or Asian au pairs in the contemporary
U.S., as well as the more obvious Third World intellectuals operating
out of metropolitan centers, like Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Edward W. Said,
and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To bring together the latter two groups--Third World intellectuals and
au pairs--is to raise, finally, the more restricted question I want
to explore in the remainder of this essay: namely, what to make of
a cosmopolitanism whose agents or participants are non-Western, but
whose movement is toward the "advanced" or "developed" West and can
thus be described as a form of upward mobility. Critics like Parry,
Tim Brennan, Aijaz Ahmad, and Spivak, among others, have wondered with
various degrees of alarm whether Third World fictions and careers
(including careers in the making and reading of fictions) that were
aimed at, and were embraced by, the metropolis could ultimately signify
anything other than an opportunistic affirmation of the metropolis. Spivak
makes a pointed parallel between the current First World enthusiasm for
Third World writers

<B></B>

and the earlier divide-and-conquer strategy of
colonialism, which simultaneously served the interests of the colonial
power and of a native-born "aspiring elite." Do we see here again, she
asks, "the old scenario of empowering a privileged group or a group
susceptible to upward mobility as the authentic inhabitants of the
margin"?
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Any critic writing in the metropolis today seems
obliged to reflect on this as well as on some further questions. Is it
possible that this diagnosis might itself repeat earlier charges against
"rootless cosmopolitanism" (like Rousseau's above)? Does cosmopolitanism
from the margins neatly duplicate that of the center? Does it leave
the metropolitan center precisely as it was? What does it tell us
about the center that it produces both narratives of upward mobility
and impatient critiques of those narratives, including our own? Is it
possible or desirable to produce political criticism that does not refer
to <I>some</I> narrative of upward mobility, feasible progress, personal
and collective development?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The double focus of these questions, referring at once to literary texts
and to critical careers, finds one revealing object of investigation
in the budding pre-Nannygate subgenre I call au pair narrative, as
in Bharati Mukherjee's short story (and novel) entitled "Jasmine" and
Jamaica Kincaid's novel <I>Lucy.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 I propose to begin
investigating the genre, in a preliminary and provisional way, through
the suggestive problematic offered by Spivak's essay "Three Women's
Texts and a Critique of Imperialism." In that essay, Spivak interprets
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s <I>Jane Eyre</I> as a double allegory: an allegory
of the role of empire in the canonical literature of the nineteenth
century, and an allegory of the twentieth-century "bourgeois feminist"
critic. Spivak suggests that Jane's upward mobility, marked by her final
replacement of Bertha/Antoinette as the rightful "Mrs. Rochester," is
achieved only by economically exploiting and symbolically destroying
res who represent Europe's colonial possessions. Jane's mobility,
moreover, has been mobilized in turn by recent feminist readers in the
metropolis, who find in it a legitimizing myth of feminist criticism's
parallel rise to institutional authority, this time at the expense of
postcolonial subjects, especially women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What does this brilliant and influential argument (I have commented on
it at length elsewhere)
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 tell us about au pair narratives,
twentieth-century refunctionings of the <I>Bildungsroman</I> that
have Third World women of color as their protagonists? Like <I>Jane
Eyre,</I> both <I>Lucy</I> and "Jasmine" can be seen as allegories of
upward mobility. In each, the nineteenth-century domestic's move from
the provinces to the capital is transposed into a transnational move
from the periphery to the metropolitan core.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Structurally
or at least geographically, the genre seems therefore to flatter the
metropolis as inevitable destination and saving source of freedom and
happiness. In a sort of female Naipaulism, the personal trajectory from
the Caribbean to the metropolis becomes paradigmatic of a Hegelian passage
from primitive unselfconscious barbarism to universal civilization, thus
relegating those who remain behind to a familiar sort of colonial stasis
and inferiority.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taken to the museum by her employer, Kincaid's Lucy finds an image of
herself in

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
some paintings by a man, a French man, who had gone halfway across the
world to live and had painted pictures of the people he found living
there. He had been a banker living a comfortable life with his wife
and children, but that did not make him happy; eventually he left them
and went to the opposite part of the world, where he was happier. I
don't know if Mariah meant me to, but immediately I identified with the
yearnings of this man; I understood finding the place you are born in
an unbearable prison and wanting something completely different from
what you are familiar with, knowing it represents a haven. (L, 95)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though Lucy does not seem to seek the material comforts that the painter
has fled, her non-European inversion of European escapism looks very
much like the metaphysical and political error that is involved,
Spivak says, in taking "Eurocentric economic migration as moment of
origin." Metropolitan readers may not welcome a genre that literally
advises the entire population of the Third World to emigrate, but
they are seldom averse to hearing that the Third World is a prison
and the First World a haven. The warm reception of the genre among
metro-politan readers (if not among academic critics) must therefore
be greeted with some misgiving. As Spivak warns, "the struggle of the
marginal in metropolitan space cannot be made the unexamined referent
for all postcoloniality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lucy, immediately after identifying with the Gauguin-like painter,
remembers her differences, that is to say, her additional disadvantages:
"I was not a man; I was a young woman from the fringes of the world, and
when I left my home I had wrapped around my shoulders the mantle of a
servant" (<I>L,</I> 95). Yet all of this might also be said, without much
distortion, about Jane Eyre, and at least in Spivak's reading it does not
sufficiently extenuate Jane's complicity with the imperial project. Is
anything altered by Lucy's handicaps--a list from which race is notably
missing--if the trajectory of her narrative nonetheless resembles so
closely the "great expectations" formula of the nineteenth-century
European bourgeoisie? For the metropolitan readership that gratefully
climbs the rising curve of Lucy's story, does it offer anything more than
a suitably displaced opportunity to reexperience that primal thrill? And
for critics in particular, is Kincaid's moral significantly different
from the one Spivak reprimands in <I>Jane Eyre?</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are differences, I think, but they show only because of further
similarities. <I>Lucy</I> and the two "Jasmines" share other narrative
structures with <I>Jane Eyre:</I> notably, the narrative perspective of
the servant/governess in the master's house and the motif of transgressive
trans-class sexuality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Again like <I>Jane Eyre,</I>
these narratives stage their upward mobility around the servant's
erotic energies. They associate those energies with the privilege of
narrative perspective on the one hand, and on the other with a threat
to disrupt the couple formed by master and legal wife. The short story
"Jasmine" ends with the au pair willingly seduced by the paterfamilias
(a professor of biology), while his wife, a

<B></B>

performance artist,
is away on tour. In <I>Lucy,</I> the opening chapter ends with the au
pair telling the husband and wife a dream in which the husband chased
her, naked, through the house, while the wife urged him on. And in the
last chapter, the couple breaks up and, apparently neither as cause nor
as effect, the protagonist departs, though the husband's adultery has
not been with her and her own sexual explorations have not been with
him.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here then is a large difference: marriage between master and servant,
which has served to re the reward of the servant's upward striving
at least since <I>Pamela</I>, is apparently no longer on the agenda. By
this means Mukherjee apparently resists (though this is less true in
the novel of the same name) the narrative of a migratory elite's upward
mobility. The last line of the short story runs as follows: "His hand
moved up her throat and forced her lips apart and it felt so good,
so right, that she forgot all the dreariness of her new life and gave
herself up to it" ("J," 135). The ambiguity of "it"--lovemaking as re
for the new life--along with the forcing of the lips and the dreariness
of the life seem to point to a moral: perhaps the moral of the book's
<I>Village Voice</I> reviewer, reprinted as a sentence fragment on the
paperback: "Particularly chilling because the heroine has no idea she's
being exploited." Unconscious exploitation would of course give a twist
to the <I>Pamela/Jane Eyre</I> story of upwardly-mobile eroticism. Here,
one might say, a Third World sunk in ever-deeper impoverishment finds
its re in the cheery immigrant woman whose sexual transgression
with the master can no longer be cashed in for any enduring social
advantage.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet Mukherjee clearly has trouble holding to the allegory of a Third
World class or collectivity that is <I>not</I> rising. The idea of
Jasmine's life as "dreariness" in the last line comes as something
of a surprise. Up to this point she has not seemed to mind her work
at all. In short, Mukherjee seems to be making a last minute effort to
impose a moral on her story, a moral that the story defies. Many readers
(not only those who have political doubts about her) will recognize that,
like her heroine, Mukherjee is clearly more than half in love with the
heady new Americanness of Jasmine's life. For example, Jasmine likes it
that in Ann Arbor men do the cooking, that her employers encourage her
to take courses at the University of Michigan and to be "more selfish"
("J," 131), that a mother's helper isn't like a servant, but "seemed
to be as good as anyone" ("J," 128). Mukherjee and Kincaid both seem
to buy into the American dream of self-invention from nothing. "I was
inventing myself" (<I>L,</I> 135), Lucy says, and while making love at
the end of the story, Jasmine thinks of herself as "a bright, pretty
girl with no visa, no papers, no birth certificate. Nothing other than
what she wanted to invent and tell" ("J," 135).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are we thus left, after all, with an allegory not of seductive
exploitation but of celebratory Americanization? Perhaps the options
need not be so symmetrical. It would be provincial of American readers
to recognize a disparity between American dreams and American realities
in these stories, yet to see nothing else here <I>but</I> American
reality--as if the reversals of the social order Jasmine knows are
of no significance except as an affirmation of American values; as
if nothing

<B></B>

about Jasmine's new life could possibly be preferred
over her old one by her own, non-American criteria. And it would be
provincial not to see that adding race to Bront&euml;'s class and gender
terms is bound to produce (as Bront&euml; herself already produced)
more complex relations between characters and collectivities than a
zero-sum allegory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 It is clear that these texts prolong and
appropriate the <I>Jane Eyre</I> allegory; it is not clear that, in so
doing, they are obliged to accept the zero-sum linearity of the social
ladder, with its implication that my rise is necessarily your fall.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the novel <I>Jasmine,</I> published one year later, the au pair
protagonist--this time an immigrant from India rather than from the
Caribbean--again falls in love with her employer, or rather with "what
he represented to me, a professor who served biscuits to a servant"
(<I>J</I>, 148). Unlike her namesake, she is given narrative room to end
up successfully (if not yet legally) displacing the first, white, legal
wife. Yet it is unclear how much the displacement really signifies. The
wife has initiated all this by seeking her own happiness with someone
else. And for Jasmine, bonding with her former employer seems to mean
responding less to him then to "the promise of America." Like the heroes
of such modernist <I>Bildungsromane</I> as <I>Sons and Lovers</I> and
<I>A Portrait of the Artist,</I> she reaches a conclusion, "greedy with
wants and reckless from hope" (<I>J,</I> 213-14), that is less a union
than a fresh departure.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Keeping closer than the short story to the <I>Jane Eyre</I> materials,
the novel even includes, in the series of men it offers its au pair
heroine, an older, prosperous, and allegorically crippled husband. But
this Jasmine leaves behind her cripple, a banker shot and paralyzed by an
angry client, along with his prosperity, which is shown to be complicit
with the bankruptcies and suicides of surrounding farmers. Indeed, she
makes this decision soon after his child (again, as in <I>Jane Eyre,</I>
foreign and adopted, and like Jasmine a refugee from the explicit but
unexplained horrors of Third World violence) also decides to leave. "The
world is divided," she says, "between those who stay and those who leave"
(<I>J,</I> 203). Is Mukherjee saying that the only way up is to leave,
and the only way to stay is to be crippled? I cannot entirely disagree
with those who read her in this way, but to do so is to miss other
and more interesting things that she is also saying. Crucially, she
is displacing the <I>Jane Eyre</I> narrative's emphasis from an upward
to a <I>lateral</I> move. Her biscuit-serving professor and his (also
adopted) daughter belong, no less than the banker, to the class of those
who can afford to pay for personal rather than institutional childcare. In
choosing them, the former au pair is not making any visible or significant
sacrifice of economic privileges or life possibilities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

Allowing Jasmine to move within one social level rather than between
levels, Mukherjee displaces the narrative interest onto a choice between
modes of being: between, specifically, a mode of staying that, like
the banker's, slowly chokes those who are similarly forced to stay on
their land, and a mode of mobility, not profitable but pleasurable, that
is committed to no positive or alternative values, only to not being or
doing or submitting to <I>that.</I> Leaving, which occupies the concluding
space of marriage, identifies the ending as a

<B></B>

choice between being
a victim and being a victimizer while it also evades that choice; Jasmine
could as easily be the latter as the former, it suggests bravely, but it's
better to be neither. If Mukherjee's answer is mobility, in other words,
it is not necessarily <I>upward</I> mobility, except in the sense that
"upward" might refer to moral rather than social hierarchy. If opting
between different middle-class attitudes toward social injustice is not
opting out of social injustice, neither is it the luxury of perpetual
cosmopolitan tourism or the frivolity of free erotic choice without
social consequences.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same evasion or reinterpretation of upward mobility informs the
ending of the short story "Jasmine." The story's concluding ambiguity is
not technically subtle, but its very willedness--rough, unprepared for,
tacked on abruptly at the end--might be said to foreground the question
of will, especially Jasmine's own will and the value the reader will
place on it. This Jasmine, even more than the novel's, is presented as
smart, active, ambitious, choosing her fate--and choosing to make love
with her employer. Can consensual sex be interpreted, like money, as
the object of a zero-sum calculation? Placed in a uniquely determining
position, can sex function effectively as the stakes in a race, class,
or gender allegory? The heavy weight that Mukherjee drops onto Jasmine's
consenting consciousness in the moment of sexual relation transforms that
consciousness (or unconsciousness), like Pamela's, into a crucial space
of interpretive ambiguity, a battleground where conflicting allegories
collide. At this moment, is she an unconscious representative of her race
or class? A conscious representative of her sex?
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Neither of
the above? By ending in an ambiguous instant of silencing and pleasure,
stopping short before the social consequences of the lovemaking can
appear--a decision reflected in the generic difference between short story
and novel--Mukherjee opens up the possibility of an allegory that would
aim neither at marriage and displacement of the lawful wife (sex as gain),
nor at exploitation (sex as loss), but at some other conclusion, including
the pure provisionality of pleasure seized for its own sake in and despite
hierarchical power. Given the booming transnational sex trade, it is a
morally risky business, but Mukherjee does not preclude the option that
sex may not in itself mean <I>anything</I>--that it can be a possession or
a gift; can belong to an economy of scarcity or an economy of abundance;
can be an act of hostility toward the wife, or irrelevant to her; can
be an allegory of class, or of gender, or of neither.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 She
suggests that in striking off athwart the <I>Jane Eyre</I> structure of
marriage-as-social-microcosm, this text does not <I>fail</I> to achieve
<I>Jane Eyre'</I>s social ambitions or its allegorical centrality, but
rather <I>succeeds</I> as one allegory of a society of multiple subject
positions where there <I>is</I> no such center. It poses as a question,
in other words, the zero-sum model according to which there can only be
one (male) master, and one master's wife.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here it is instructive to compare the place of sex and marriage in
<I>Lucy</I> with their role in the preceding story. Lucy does not sleep
with her
employer, although as I said, much of the <I>Jane Eyre</I> structure is
still intact: above all, the breakup of the master/wife couple coinciding
with the erotic and professional rise of "the

<B></B>

young girl who watches
over the children" (<I>L,</I> 7). The parallel seems deliberate. "In my
own mind," Lucy says, "I called myself other names: Emily, Charlotte,
Jane. They were the names of the authoresses whose books I loved"
(<I>L,</I> 149). Like Jane Eyre, Lucy reacts strongly against people
who are physically beautiful; she plays out some of the same opposition
of birth and merit that makes <I>Jane Eyre,</I> among other things,
a reading of the French Revolution. Sex, unlike beauty, can be aligned
with merit, and Lucy takes a serious interest in it. It signifies various
things for her: an achievement wrested from a bleak place, a rebuke to
her mother's morals, a proof of her independence: "life as a slut was
quite enjoyable, thank you very much" (<I>L,</I> 128). It is an object
of competition: a girl who has had an experience that might be described
as "sexual abuse" makes her jealous; she wishes it had happened to her
(<I>L,</I> 105). But for Lucy sex is precisely <I>not</I> a way to rise
to the social achievement marked by upwardly mobile marriage. Marriage,
like sex between master and servant, does not interest her; wanting not
to be married is one of her most conscious motives.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Though
she records and presides over the breakup of her employers' marriage, and
though she unloads much of her anger on the wife, Lucy shows no conscious
desire to replace her in the arms of her too-handsome husband. One might
say that for her, too, sex is lateral rather than vertical. In not needing
or wanting sex from the married couple she serves, in not bonding with
them in a trans-class marriage plot, Lucy retains the negative, critical
side of that plot while taking her own story off on a tangent.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generalizing a bit recklessly, one might make this a sort of postmodern
allegory--an allegory of a decentered society in which one woman's rise
is <I>not</I> necessarily another's woman's fall, and in which the
multiplicity of subject positions suggests that significant movement
may be neither rise nor fall. I add that it is possible, in comparison
to <I>Jane Eyre,</I> to see the broken and incomplete marriages, the
inconclusive and lateral sex of these texts, as very much a step up, or
at least a step in the right direction. A reviewer of Kincaid in <I>The
Nation</I> remarked that much of the unease she seemed to inspire
in readers came from the "protagonist's failure to accede to white
people--i.e. power--as a determining factor in her life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

Such remarks remind us that the exhaustive closure of zero-sum allegory,
even if that allegory captures in microcosm a struggle with white power,
can serve as a sort of consolation prize to that power, a backhanded
means of insisting on its illusory centrality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this sense, Kincaid's strongest revision of the <I>Jane Eyre</I>
story is her commentary on the theme of the Other Woman versus the
Lawful Wife. Brimming with anger, Lucy aims much of it at the First World
middle-class feminist who cannot understand her and drives her wild with
rage when she brags not so subtly of having "Indian blood." "How do you
get to be the sort of victor," Lucy asks herself, "who can claim to be the
vanquished also?" (<I>L,</I> 41). It is this anger, I have suggested, that
finds an indirect expression in the smashing of the marriage, which Lucy
catches, marks, and joins in an unforgettable moment with her camera: as
if unaware of what is going on, she tells the

<B></B>

miserable, quarreling
couple on the couch, "Say cheese!" (<I>L,</I> 118). But for all this, the
contrast with <I>Jane Eyre</I> is striking. The wary, hesitant friendship
between the two women survives the breakup of the household, as it also
survives the wife's sense of betrayal when Lucy breaks her contract and
leaves. Some of the inconclusiveness of sex and marriage in <I>Lucy</I>
is there perhaps because the real story has shifted to the women. The
struggle is not over occupying the male position, that is, but over their
own vexed and difficult solidarity. The upward mobility of the Third World
au pair may not require the displacement of, or eternal antagonism to, the
First World upper-class feminist and/or professional woman. The wife may
be something like a class enemy to Lucy, but is her gender ally at the
same time. Because there is no one central contradiction in society, no
one linear path of historical development, the logic that links multiple
actors must be complex.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this seems an unnecessarily roundabout way of repeating the platitude
that class is not primary, not the single ultimately determining
instance, it does not mean, of course, that class can be ignored. If
sex has become lateral, it is in part because the class a writer like
Mukherjee represents has indeed made a lateral move. Her particular
diaspora, from the Indian subcontinent, is largely middle and upper-middle
class, arriving in the U.S. with well developed, saleable skills and/or
a certain capital.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 In a sense, then, Mukherjee is doing
nothing but projecting her particular class experience onto the au pair
narrative. At the same time, laterality is a fact of the postmodern social
formation that no left-wing analysis can afford to ignore, a fact recently
characterized by the controversial term <I>post-Fordism</I> to designate
the dominant or emergent regime of economic accumulation. Even critics
of this term seem to accept a new flexibility in assigning the workforce
to its tasks, a widespread use of temporary and part-time labor, and a
blurring of the line between conceiving and executing tasks and between
skilled and unskilled labor--in short, a shift away from Fordism's "rigid
division of labor" and "extreme fragmentation of tasks."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Not
that this so-called "flexible specialization" represents a utopian impulse
bent on ending poverty, unemployment, and social contradiction; it is
simply a non-negotiable condition under which social contradictions will
be played out, or fought out, in the near future. As a result, the au pair
version of the <I>Jane Eyre</I> plot may be less eccentric than it seems.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Domestic service remains one of the major sources of employment for
women displaced by the international division of labor and traveling from
country to city, whether across national borders or not. Yet, as all of
these texts take the trouble to note, the au pair, like the governess
before her, cannot simply be labelled a domestic servant. The term comes
from <I>pair,</I> meaning equal, as in equality of exchange of currencies
between countries. Strictly speaking, according to Larousse, to be "au
pair dans une maison" (the noun form is a spinoff) means "&ecirc;tre
log&eacute; et nourri sans appointements, en &eacute;change de certains
services."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 The experience of travel, with its implicit
promise of cultural capital, is bartered against nonwage domestic
services. This not only keeps the care of children, and

<B></B>

the women
who provide it, protected from the risks and opportunities of the wage
economy; it also keeps them apart, at least potentially, from class
difference.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The protagonist of Mukherjee's short story is
the daughter of a doctor. Like Mukherjee herself, she can be seen as
seeking to reproduce her class position, rather than seeking to rise
out of it, in the hostile territory where Third World middle class can
all too easily become First World lower class.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, it is understood that this work will be temporary, a brief
stage in the life of a woman who might well go on to pay, or already be
paying, another woman to take care of her own children.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 The
class indeterminacy of the au pair, who can be an educated, relatively
privileged re or on the contrary a domestic servant forced to do the
dirtiest, most isolating, and most poorly remunerated job, is in a sense
no more than the multiple logic of a time when gender and race identities
cannot be reduced to class terms, when the so-called new social movements
that do not define themselves in national terms have been globalized,
when a certain social indeterminacy has therefore been generalized by the
international division of labor. In the ending of <I>The Country and the
City,</I> which might be described from one angle as a meditation on the
geography of the <I>Bildungsroman,</I> Raymond Williams tries to extend
his previous argument into the larger world of the British Empire and
the global neocolonialism that has followed it--to do, that is, what the
au pair narrative does with <I>Jane Eyre.</I> The country, he says, is
now the Third World, while both the city and the country that Williams
has been discussing--British city and British country--suddenly become
the imperial "city" to that country.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The difficulty is the
"suddenly." In fact, this new division goes back through much of the
history the book has traversed. The British country has been part of a
global city, that is, for two or three centuries. To see the country/city
opposition in the context of the international division of labor is
thus to relativize it dramatically. And the same is also true for the
categories of class, race, and gender that the <I>Bildungsroman</I>
and the au pair narrative graft onto the geography of country and
city. Relative to the massively exploited Indian textile workers whose
industries were closed down before English textiles replaced them, the
British working class is not simply a working class. And the reverse
is also true: in the international division of labor, native elites are
not simply elites.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Freely adapting a well-known saying, Spivak has occasionally described
the imperative behind her work as follows: "Promise them anything, but
give them the international division of labor." It is a very artful
line: the flippant allusion to perfume quietly undercuts the appeal
to an ultimate foundation that the international division of labor
might otherwise seem to be making. And this stylish undercutting is
not frivolous. For the point of invoking the international division of
labor is precisely and concisely to insist, without a laborious trotting
out of additional social categories of the injured and excluded, that
even the gravest social injustices are never completely reducible to
a simple class allegory. As a transnational re, the literary au
pair stands in for global capitalism's systematic destabilization of
local class divisions, which is by no means the effacing of

<B></B>

those
divisions. And this is perhaps how to understand the au pair's distinctive
class indeterminacy. The industrious artisans of the 1820s and 1830s
could stand at once for those above and those below them in the social
hierarchy, for the factory owner as well as the factory operative; thus
they did the work of political representation--which is never reducible
to the reflection of any specific constituency--while both running its
risks and exercising its powers. The au pair of the 1980s and 1990s runs
no less visible risks, among them the risk of being read as a postcolonial
fetish that magically obliterates the domestic injuries of class. But
attention must also be paid to the potential powers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is above all those left behind on the periphery who oblige us
to distrust the exemplary value of the au pair's tale. One cannot
straightforwardly conclude that a story of the displacement of the white
First World wife is actually aimed at displacing people of color who have
not left home. To be sure, making a new life in the metropolis cannot be
the story of the postcolonial subject as such, as Spivak points out. But
once we agree that there <I>is</I> no such single paradigmatic story, it
may become easier to see that, through the mediations and displacements
that all reading presumes, the au pair narrative does in fact possess
allegorical, generalizing powers that need not be ruthlessly curbed or
renounced. The trope of one-way travel need not mean, after all, that
nation and race are merely skins to be shed in the interest of quicker
acculturation. If race can stand for that which should not be left
behind, it is also that which Lucy brings with her and makes her mission
to communicate, especially to her feminist employer. As a genre, the au
pair narrative seems devoted on the one hand to spurning uplift or worldly
success in strictly economic terms, on the other to finding expression
for explosive, even unconscious anger. Offering a story of resistance to
assimilation as much as a story of assimilation, the genre simultaneously
questions racial difference (as a metropolitan obstacle to be overcome),
insists on racial difference (as a historically sedimented experience),
and, as much as either of these, reinscribes and even reinvents racial
difference within the new, shifting social landscape of the metropolis,
a landscape populated by Irish nannies and Vietnamese refugees and white
middle-class feminists who have no predetermined place in pre-migratory
binary categories. These reinscriptions and reinventions, with their
newly discovered hostilities and tentative internationalist solidarities,
would be enough to give the genre a real claim to represent an alternative
upward mobility, an imagination of unrealized social progress.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an essay called "Whose Nation?" historian Linda Colley argues that
in the period from 1780 to 1830 the British state did not encourage
nationalism, as one might have expected, but actually tended to
resist it. It did so, at a time when the word <I>patriot</I> meant
a dangerous subversive, because nationalism was seen as a cover for
dangerous self-assertion and upward mobility on the part of the lower
classes. "For many social conservatives," Colley writes, "placing a
premium on service to the nation was opening the door dangerously wide
to a meritocracy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 It follows from Colley's argument
that, conversely, a more democratic state might

<B></B>

well be more
nationalistic, and this is precisely what one finds in Disraeli's
Crystal Palace speech of 1872, a speech that is often credited with first
uncovering England's imperial mission. England would "have to decide,"
Disraeli said, "between national and cosmopolitan principles. The issue
is not a mean one. It is whether you will be content to be a comfortable
England...or whether you will be a great country--an Imperial country--a
country where your sons, when they rise, rise to paramount positions,
and obtain not merely the esteem of their countrymen, but command the
respect of the world."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Through the rising sons, nationalism
offers the working and middle classes a field for upward mobility. More
surprisingly, the elitist cosmopolitanism that Disraeli sets against
them is a source of resistance to imperialism itself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These liberal mid-century cosmopolitans, not so distant ancestors
of Hobsbawm's intergalactic historian, are far from an imitable
ideal. The same evolutionary assumptions that qualified their support
for nationalism--nations were, in Hobsbawm's paraphrase, "a second-best
to world unity" (<I>NN,</I> 31)--also provided the very prototypes of
academic racism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Yet Hobsbawm is right, I think, not to
dismiss them out of hand. For one precedent they set is the resist-ance to
democratization and mass politics--Disraeli's mobilizing of mass support,
in the name of race and nation, for imperial rivalry--in the name of a
larger and higher notion of democracy. Cosmopolitan intellectuals refused
to be paralyzingly accountable to a national public opinion geared up for
imperialism, yet they were no less accountable to the wider though merely
potential public of imperialism's victims. If they refused Disraeli's
appeal to upward mobility, they did so not by refusing upward mobility
as such, but rather by offering another version of the story, a story
of upward mobility with another, more populous collective subject.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hidden away within the laziness of democratic pieties, as we know, are
all the strenuous problems of minorities and majorities, of contradictory
loyalties to multiple and overlapping social units and identities. It
would clear the air somewhat if, instead of the usual breast-beating,
there were a corresponding recognition that elitism is inevitably as
various, fissured, and problematic as the versions of democracy to
which it is contrasted. Most obviously, the intellectual who refuses
the effort to become a national voice may thereby become a member of
a smaller, "elite" collectivity--say, a professional one--and at the
same time may be claiming or seeking democratic participation in a
much larger collectivity that stretches beyond the nation. The modes
of belonging and participation are unlikely to be identical on these
different scales--but this is all the more reason not to bring to bear
on them a single standard of political judgment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fate of the nineteenth-century story of upward mobility as it is
reappro-priated and refunctioned by Third World writers would seem
to demand the same sort of discrimination. If, like cosmopolitanism,
terms like <I>progress</I> and <I>modernity</I> lend themselves to
metropolitan self-flattery, it would be more metropolitan self-flattery
to believe that this one usage always and everywhere defines their
political meaning. Those who urgently need to "change their lives"

<B></B>

do not speak lightly of progress, even if they rightly distrust
the universalized inevitabilist gradualism that has been its frequent
ideological form. While it presents itself as metropolitan self-critique,
the unreflective scorn for modernity among Western intellectuals actually
functions as metropolitan self-aggran-dizement. Like a certain left-wing
anti-professionalism, aimed obliquely at the new place made for themselves
in the academy by women and people of color, this apparent self-critique
denigrates precisely that which, in the metropolis, is now being desired
and demanded by intellectuals on the periphery. This is kicking away the
ladder one has climbed oneself; it ensures that the necessarily higher
ground from which the critique emanates remains in metropolitan hands
and defines the metropolis's continuing superiority.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps conferring the honorific of cosmopolitan on the au pair can
be interpreted as the same kind of self-legitimizing move on the
part of today's transnational intellectuals that Spivak diagnosed
in establishment feminism's use of <I>Jane Eyre</I>--the professors
serve the biscuits to the servants and eat them too, as it were. But
if so, isn't it equally likely that metropolitan purposes are served
by making Spivak's point, and my own? No reference to the purposes
of the metropolis as a whole can resolve disputes within it. A wider
political standard is needed--and that, I would argue, is just what
would-be cosmopolitan critics can legitimately take from the parallel
offered them by Mukherjee and Kincaid. For critics, as for au pairs,
the crossing of national boundaries is less a step up in the world than
a destabilization of the world. One aspect of that destabilization
is an imperfect yet peremptory match between new privileges and new
responsibilities. Critics, like au pairs, bring the international
division of labor into the intimacy of metropolitan space, and thus become
vehicles for anger and con-frontation as well as possible participants
in the fashioning of fragile new trans-national solidarities. Both the
anger and the solidarity are indispensable steps in the transnational
stretching of criticism's public accountability, its acknowledge-ment
that the public sphere in which it must now participate extends beyond
the circle of its past interlocutors--in short, its cosmopolitanism
in the most positive sense. From this perspective, the metropolitan
anger that has greeted academic criticism's transnational extension of
interests is perhaps a sign that some work of representation is in fact
being done. Among its other referents, then, upward mobility is perhaps
also a narrative re for the surplus value added by this work, a
value that has its own impersonal but ultimately progressive trajectory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Edward Said's negotiation between the metropolis and Third World
intellectuals in <I>Culture and Imperialism</I> offers a useful
concluding paradigm. Said's metropolis is newly but now ineluctably
self-divided. As a result of "adversarial internationalization in an age
of continued imperial structures," opposition has arisen in the modern
metropolis, an opposition that emerges out of the precarious coalition
of personal mobility and impersonal representativeness: "anti-imperialist
intellectual and scholarly work done by writers from the peripheries who
have immigrated to or are visiting the metropolis is usually an extension
into the metropolis of large-scale mass movements."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 In
one of his many provocations

<B></B>

 to the established protocols of
scholarly disillusionment, Said allows what he calls "the voyage in,"
the story of how these visitors and immigrants have both integrated
themselves into and transformed metropolitan culture, to supply an
unexpectedly and incongruously cheerful undertone to the book. The
collective <I>Bildungsroman</I> of Third World intellectuals who have
come to live and work in the metropolis, repeating in transnational
terms the country-to-city journey of the nineteenth-century novel,
also works its way into Said's innovative treatment of the novel
of disillusionment. In an indirect reply to Franco Moretti's darkly
Lukacsian view of the genre, Said appreciatively displays Third World
reversals of <I>Heart of Darkness,</I> like Tayeb Salih's <I>Season of
Migration to the North.</I> Moretti sees the genre dying a modernist
death when European men, losing faith in their own projects, have tired
of it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Said's insistence on its continuing vitality in the
hands of Third World men and women would appear on the contrary to express
the intelligent optimism of a stratum or category that is still rising,
energetic, confident of its powers. Or if optimism seems too strong,
call it by the neologism coined by another great Palestininan writer:
"pessoptimism."

The amount of allegorical "give" in a narrative like <I>Jane

Cynthia Enloe, in the final chapter of <I>Bananas, Beaches,
and Bases</I> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989), is
extremely insightful on the relation between the history of feminism and
the history of domestic work, as well as on the correspondence between
racial difference and the hierarchy of childcare workers. According
to her scheme, white professional nannies who do no housework are on
top; on the bottom are women of color who "are available for household
chores as well" and who "are not thought of as professionals." Racially
heterogeneous but more often white, au pairs, who see their work "as a
short-term job, a way to travel and learn another language before moving
on to more serious commitments,  are in the middle, and thus partake
symbolically in both upper and lower social worlds.


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT31" HREF="#REF31">31</A>.
It has been argued that feminism itself could come into
existence in the West only because middle-class women in the First
World, unlike middle-class women in the Third World, did <I>not</I> have
access to affordable domestic servants. Thus the relation between Third
World au pair and First World feminist professional becomes even more
complexly allegorical, and it becomes even less clear that the move to
the metropolis is simply a move up. See Martha Gimenez, "The Dialectics
of Waged and Unwaged Work," in <I>Work without Wages: Domestic Labor
and Self-Employment within Capitalism</I> ed. Jane L. Collins and Martha

The quotient of allegorical play or "give" in this narrative,
which lends itself to the diverging imaginative agendas of readerships
or constituencies that are not composed of Third World au pairs, is
not the same as literariness itself, but like literariness it has a
history. One can speculate that this quotient may have shifted along with
post-Fordism's regime of flexible accumulation or flexible specialization,
which is often taken to distinguish a characteristically postmodern from
a modernist sense of identity. According to this reasoning, modernism's
Fordist refashioning of the producer/consumer self would have given way to
less control over a more multiple selfhood, more free to be different and
yet also less able to touch or influence the veiled, dispersed forces that
continue to constrain it. In this sense, the au pair narrative could be
said to offer itself to the hopes and desires of more types of readers,
while it also offers each of them less of a vicarious victory: while it
persistently equivocates, that is, between the suggestion of an upward
movement and the suggestion of a merely lateral movement. How much can
be won, what indeed is "winning" about, from the moment when there is
no center to occupy?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A few words suffice to let the incidents speak for themselves when
writing about Marinetti as father, poet, human being, or intimate
friend. Marinetti--that was how his friends called him, and my mother,
too; <I>pap&agrave;</I>--an affectionate father, humorous, considerate,
and a deeply devoted companion to Beny (Benedetta). Me--Luce, the third
daughter. As my father was no longer quite so young, my mother, who was
much younger, liked to keep me close by. After his first heart attack
he dubbed me his little "nurse."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From the day he passed away, real and unreal accumulate in the effort
to rediscover and understand him better, and not just in memory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He introduced me to a very large world. When I was a little girl he would
respond to all of my curious questions. Very simply, he would explain
his poetry, Futurism, his philosophical and social principles, and he
would read his poems, teaching me the importance of declamation. Taking
my hands, he loved to draw sketches of Futurist architecture, which had
been prevented from being realized during the <I>ventennio</I>,
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 and thus he taught me the essential importance of line and space, always
 with his optimistic and enthusiastic desire.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He took extreme pains to appreciate and give guidance to young people
who turned to him, not just by encouraging them, but above all by
believing in them. From my earliest childhood I would sit and listen to
him, enchanted and hypnotized. He possessed a gift for describing every
episode and every detail of his adventurous past with such a variety of
images that he seemed to be living them right then and there. I came to
understand how much he had adored his own mother

<B></B>

when, with deep emotion, he recounted the long walks he took together
with her on the beaches of Alexandria in front of their house by the sea.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He liked to be by himself near the sea and always selected houses that
were remote and isolated, whether on Capri, Levanto, or Elba, perhaps to
rediscover the same Mediterranean landscapes and relive his childhood:
his mother, his father, his brother Leone, who had died so young. Capri
became our special island, and pap&agrave; termed it "the reclining
chair of the Mediterranean." Every time we approached it together on the
steamer I could sense by his very words that his poetic vigor was being
magically infused with the Mediterranean sun of his childhood, and my
childish mind was filled with turbulence, love, poetry, and beauty.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At Capri, when not writing, he amused himself by going down with us to
Marina Piccola among the rocks and the sea, watching us dive into the
water vibrating with sun and color. In the afternoon, after a brief
pause for silence and concentration, he invited me to join him in long
walks. It was during one of our last stays on Capri that he came along
with me to Mount Tiberio on the back of a donkey. From the top of the
mountain, where the rocks plunge directly into the sea, we could view
the entire gulf of Naples and the coast of Amalfi, and this colorful
triumph of nature provoked the most profound emotions. He talked to me
about his campaign for the defense of the natural landscape of Capri in
the twenties, and he explained to me the fascinating game played by the
rocks, which seem so cruel to me, when they plunge straight into the
sweet warm sea--and thus he brought me to understand the dangerous and
seductive link between life, good, and evil.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We used to stop in Naples in the interval between the arrival of the
ferry and the departure of the train, and we spent a great deal of
time in Don Gaspare Casella's bookstore at Largo Castello. Don Gaspare
was an intellectual, a collector of manuscripts and autographs, and a
publisher. His shop was a meeting place for great minds, a place for
intellectual encounters; dropping in at the bookshop-cum-work-shop on
any given day, you might see Bontempelli, Bragaglia, Malaparte, Edwin
Cerio, or Cangiullo.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 And every time we stopped in Naples <I>pap&agrave;</I> seized the
 opportunity to visit his friend. I used to come along, happy and
 curious. A social visit could suddenly be transformed into a fencing
 match: they discussed concepts, plans, and projects, delighting in
 their debates, and a ferment of ideas would arise and I would listen
 with fascination, so that every visit became a theater in which the
 actors were grand yet familiar res.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our summers were quite long, our winters brief: Capri was an international
drawing room, a source of imaginative inspiration, a <I>cenacle</I> of
creative, daring minds. <I>Pap&agrave;</I> loved to swim. Water was the
source of life for him, a prenatal poetic analogy; he used to stop and
look into the depths of the water with its thousand colors and shades,
at once dark and crystalline. He taught me to swim, and to observe the
shadings of the water, in order to understand art and life. Thus he
taught me to defy the world without hesitation, and at the same time to
seize whatever is beautiful in life and exalt it. We would go to places
that only he knew how to find, grottos with magical reflections of light,
and we would swim among the rocks and eat shellfish and gather seashells
and starfish.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When we went back to Rome and our house on Piazza Adriana, which was
also the Headquarters of the Futurist Movement, we returned to life
at a dynamic pace--travels, telephone calls, Futurists, secretaries,
comings and goings. The walls were painted in a variety of colors,
and the big sitting rooms overlooked the gardens of Castel S. Angelo,
the Tomb of Hadrian. The sun-yellow walls recalled the reflections of
the Roman sky and the colors of the nearby houses at sunset. The blue
sitting room was furnished with Arab furniture that marked the presence of
<I>pap&agrave;'s</I> childhood and house in Alexandria. In the other rooms
and halls, Futurist sculptures were our lifelong companions, Futurist
paintings rendered the walls dynamic, and together they formed a stage
that served as the chorus for visitors and special guests. The presence
of the Arab furniture mirrored the spirit of Marinetti even more, in its
sublime contrast between past and future, in a deep cultural foundation
necessary to actualize a new world of creativity and feeling.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the part of the house opposite the vast entrance was the lounge
that opened into the dining room designed for Marinetti by Enrico
Prampolini. From the back of the entrance hall ran a long hallway
that served as a library and led to <I>pap&agrave;'s</I> study and the
bedrooms. I used to love that hallway: the bookshelves ran all the way
up to the ceiling, filled with colorful books suggesting stories that
would never end, and I used to climb up the tall ladder in defiance of
<I>pap&agrave;'s</I> orders when he was searching for a book. I would
follow him from one bookcase to another and amuse myself by pursuing
the tiny book-eating insects that were impertinently running from one
part of the shelves to another and which <I>pap&agrave;</I> was always
trying to eliminate, even though he also tried to justify them in my
eyes by calling them the only really persistent readers!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Over by the opposite wall was the stark study: a large desk filled with
papers; a glass-doored wardrobe that guarded his writings; papers and
newspapers everywhere, piles of letters that his secretary would send
off every day; and the voice of <I>pap&agrave;</I> giving dictation--a
pure and metallic voice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Towards evening the sitting rooms would fill up with artists, writers,
composers, friends, all of them familiar presences for me. My mother
would urge me to return to my studies, while I would try to escape from
our German housemaid, hiding behind the curtains.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I was born in Rome beneath Boccioni's painting <I>The Soccer Player</I>,
now in the Museum of Modern Art in New York; <I>pap&agrave;</I>
decided to call me <I>Luce</I>, which means "light" in Italian, an
unusual name that for him was the symbol of a new era, swifter than
sound. First memories? The balcony that overlooked Piazza Adriana,
where <I>pap&agrave;</I> would pause at length in contemplation of
Hadrian's tomb and its gardens. He became rather less contemplative
when his glance fell upon the Palazzo degli Invalidi, constructed by
the architect Piacentini
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 in 1928, and a typical expression of architecture during the
 <I>ventennio</I>; excitedly he would cite various manifestos and theories
 of Futurist architecture, showing me designs by Sant'Elia and Marchi
 and explaining their significance to me. I began to understand what he
 had struggled for.

<B></B>

Later, as if still in pursuit of that magical moment of contemplation, he
would sit down in front of the old harmonium brought from Alexandria; he
used to love to play and compose, and without a score he would fluently
play Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin...precious Chinese vases were sitting
atop the large musical instrument while lights, filtered through the
great oriental lamps that had inspired the first Futurist manifesto, were
playing mysteriously over the inlaid work of the furniture brought from
Alexandria; Persian rugs covered the floors, one atop another, creating
an atmosphere so different and so intimate that I seemed to be living in
a dream world, and even the paintings and sculptures made by cultivated
guests would grow respectfully silent and listen. Together we would go
back in time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My mother, a Piedmontese who was reserved and severe, decided that we
shouldn't grow up in an atmosphere so continually agitated: our house
was open to everyone, and outside the entrance door was a plaque that
read: FUTURIST MOVEMENT. So we were registered as day students at the
School of the Sacred Heart at the Trinit&agrave; dei Monti in Rome. I
didn't like this decision.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When I took my first Communion, I also had my first important
confrontation with my father. After preparation and retreat prior to
Communion, the "Mothers," for so we called the Sisters, had asked us
to urge our parents to receive the sacrament as well. I didn't yet
know the meaning of "a book on the Index" and even less the meaning
of "excommunication." Coming home that evening, I waited until after
dinner. As usual there were many visitors, and I felt drawn this way and
that about the request of the Mothers. Intuition or fear? Certainly a
problem difficult to resolve, and I felt ill at ease. <I>Pap&agrave;</I>
was surprised when I asked to speak with him, and looked at me with an
inquisitive expression. Our conversations had always been very natural,
and he clearly intuited that something was disturbing me. As soon as we
were alone in his study, the request came gushing forth out of my mouth,
as if I were extracting something from inside me that was oppressing
me...I noticed that <I>pap&agrave;</I> was deeply ill at ease, and his
face had turned red...he waited a little while before replying. To me
it seemed an eternity. I was already reproaching myself for having done
what the Mothers had asked. Then he took me by the hand and made me
sit on his knee. He explained to me the significance of being a poet,
he explained to me the significance of imagination and suffering, when
agony and spirituality are united to overflow in analogies that go beyond
the human and beyond the stars...he
<BR>
recounted the history of Italy to me with its anticlerical struggles,
which did not necessarily mean that one was antireligious. He spoke to
me at length about God. I was angry at the Sisters who had brought me to
this pass, but later I was happy: their mistake was a coarse one, but it
had brought about an unforgettable encounter with <I>pap&agrave;</I>. I
used to be amused when my father would tell me about the <I>serate
futuriste</I>, or Futurist evenings, identifying the people who
had surrounded him and declaiming his words-in-freedom poems, all
theatricalized by his formidable gifts as a mimic and his extraordinary
voice, modulating words from sonorous to metallic to explosive. I used to
see him on the stages of Italy and abroad, unflappable, lucid, terrifying,
witty, waging battle implacably against whatever was static in all forms
of life, deliberately

<B></B>

involving the spectators in order to dislodge them from intellectual
lethargy: "a revolutionary in black tie." For me, at any rate, it was
far more fascinating and amusing to listen to him than to play little
theatrical games by myself in my room, among the puppets and the furniture
designed by the Futurist painter Giacomo Balla.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From early on I understood that <I>pap&agrave;</I> had a gift for
transforming the difficulties of life into play, into challenge, into
happiness. One time, in Bologna, the entire family had come together on
the occasion of a Futurist performance that was being given in a private
theater attached to the villa of a friend. We were staying at the famous
Grand Hotel Baglioni, a place charged with historical associations,
one that had traditionally hosted the most celebrated personalities of
the time. In the morning when we ordered breakfast, it was apparent
that the waiter was deeply moved by the presence of Marinetti, and
as he began to bring in the food he had difficulty balancing the two
large trays brimming with cups, teapots, coffee, chocolate, brioches,
and marmalade. <I>Pap&agrave;</I>, observing his acrobatic maneuvers,
whispered in my ear, "It looks like a Futurist dance!" But as the waiter
approached our table his shoe got caught in an impertinent crease in
the carpet and, doing a pirouette as he tried to save the trays and
their contents, he fell to the floor: an explosion of tea, coffee, cups
and glasses, chocolate, brioches...my father was soaked with all these
tidbits. There was silence, and a panic-stricken expression on the face
of the poor waiter, blushing with embarrassment. Then came an explosion of
laughter from my father, who added: "Bravo! Good fellow, you've performed
a perfect and very theatrical form of Futurist aviation!" Reassured,
the hapless waiter left the room.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After my father had a hernia operation in 1941 we spent the summer at
Forte dei Marmi, Viareggio, along the coast of Tuscany, staying in a
dependance of the Villa Pellizzi, where the road skirting the sea cut
across the space between our garden and the shore. A grove of pine trees
alleviated the summer sultriness, and <I>pap&agrave;</I> often thought
back nostalgically to the crags of Capri. He amused himself by visiting
the village market once a week. He would stop to observe the carts
loaded with so many multicolored straws and the colorful nets that the
women would entwine and use as belts. Perhaps in his mind's eye he was
still observing the fireworks of Piedigrotta at Naples. The fourteenth
of August was my mother's birthday, and that year my father asked me to
go with him to help choose a gift. "Not just poems and poetry!" he said,
for in fact it was his habit to dedicate poems to her. We came back with
purses, lit-tle wallets, hair brushes large and small. Mother
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 was a bit vain, and she would surely love them. But so many! And all
 alike! I didn't dare say a word to him, for he was like a child who
 had gone crazy in his desire to please her with a surprise. And when
 he gave them to her she was deeply moved and smiled warmly. A little
 over a year passed, and then my father had a difficult operation for an
 ulcer, performed by the magical hand of Dr. Raffaele Bastianelli, a dear
 friend of <I>pap&agrave;</I>. When he left the hospital he had to remain
 immobile in bed, but his vigor was still such that he wanted to continue
 receiving his friends, poets, writers, musicians, notwithstanding the
 doctor's firm orders for absolute rest. So the first sitting room was
 organized as his bedroom,

<B></B>

near the entrance, so that he could receive guests without having
to move. When not receiving visits he would write, dictating to his
secretary or jotting down his thoughts in the tiny notebooks that followed
him throughout the course of his life, from trains to battlefields:
reflections on his state of mind, notes about meetings, plans, theories,
bits of writings, words-in-freedom, scenes for plays, drafts, political
opinions, always just at hand in his pocket.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite the prohibition of Bastianelli, <I>pap&agrave;</I> wanted to go as
a volunteer to the Russian front in 1942, during the Second World War. So
that our thoughts would always be with him, my sisters and I sewed his
name on the inside of his personal belongings, adding the word POET (he
had requested it). We accompanied him all the way to Verona, where the
military transport train was scheduled to depart. It was a torrid day
in July, and <I>pap&agrave;</I> helped to keep up our spirits, despite
the sad occasion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
His letters from Russia were brief and affectionate, and always
contained a flower that he had gathered on the steppe, always a message
of encouragement. He returned in the beginning of 1943 on the last
train to leave before the great retreat, looking like a shadow in his
large mantle. His first heart attack occurred after a lecture at the
Italian Academy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the following months his condition worsened. His immense sorrow at
seeing Italy divided into two parts weighed heavily on his health and
spirits. Doctor Bastianelli suggested trying to find a quieter city.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In October of 1943 we moved to Venice, where we occupied an old palazzo
on the Grand Canal. To the left was the Rialto, and opposite us on
the other bank were the vegetable and fish markets. We learned that
our building had once been occupied by Aretino, the famous comedian,
poet, man of letters, and adventurous spirit of the high Renaissance,
and <I>pap&agrave;</I> was highly amused.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
His study overlooked the Grand Canal and had a little terrace. He wrote
or dictated day and night, without pause. In his poetic imagination the
Grand Canal was being transformed and the dimensions of Venice altered. He
wrote his last words-in-freedom poem, "A Convention on the Grand Canal":
the "slow luxurious vaporetto" became a rapid train; the Rialto became
a Nordic railroad station; he gathered together the languid smiles of
the Venetian women...and urged Venice to stop lamenting the past and
her memories, and to begin to live with hope, as the Futurists did.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti used to pass many hours on the balcony, intently observing
the traffic of the little boats that slowly made their way up the Grand
Canal, filled with produce, heading toward the market to unload whatever
fruits and vegetables the war still permitted. The winter was cold, humid,
hostile. Only a handful of friends came to visit him now. Foodstuffs
were scarce, and water, too. The bridge uniting Venice with the mainland
had been bombed. By turns we would fill up large bottles with water,
after a long wait at one of the small <I>campielli</I> that had a public
fountain. Our house was damp and cold because of the lack of heating,
the certainly this did nothing to help my father's state of health.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One evening, it must have been very late, <I>pap&agrave;</I> was
correcting his latest writings in his study, while my sisters and I were
studying; suddenly there was an insistent

<B></B>

ringing of the doorbell, coming from the large door that gave directly
onto a narrow street. Under the Portico Dolfin, voices with a foreign
accent; forceful knocking--two German officials entered the house and
asked for Marinetti. My mother stopped them at the door. Even now I can
see <I>pap&agrave;</I> leaving his study wearing his long full robe. He
ordered us to go to our rooms with a gesture and a look. He stepped into
the long entrance hall, keeping his hands in his pockets. He exchanged
only a few words with the officials...they wanted to search the house,
but after a brief discussion my father brusquely showed them the door.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the end of July 1943 we left Venice, stopping for two months
at Sal&ograve; on the shores of Lake Sirmione, where we stayed
until 20 September. The memory of those days is hardly a happy
one. <I>Pap&agrave;</I> was suffering and growing steadily worse. My
mother attempted to resolve our logistical problems, but it was an
extremely difficult time and there were financial problems. My father
had offered various newspapers his collaboration, but his proposals were
rejected; he received nothing from the Academy; and his books were no
longer being published. He tried to use optimism in order to combat the
deep sadness that was increasingly perceptible in his face. Though his
health was plainly worsening, he never complained and he continued to
work on a number of different projects at the same time, as if intending
actually to accelerate the rhythm of his life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On 19 September my father, mother, and I had to leave Sal&ograve;
for Como, where my sisters were awaiting us. By now my father had to
remain lying in bed because he was so tired, and his pulse was far
above normal; my mother and I would always be in his room to keep him
company. Somebody sounded the bell at the door of the villa; but the
gate, which was at the head of the entrance drive, had been left closed
and was difficult to climb: it was very high, and the wall that enclosed
the substantial garden was surmounted by a crest of cement containing
pieces of broken bottles interwoven with barbed wire. The garden, which
surrounded the entire house, ended at the back in a little inlet of the
lake, with a small dock for boats. The alarmed expressions of my mother
and father increased my fear; I understood that something serious was
happening. They both approached the entrance door, and an agitated
dialogue ensued between the parties on the two sides of the door. My
parents asked the visitors their identity; standing farther back from the
door, I couldn't understand their reply, except for one word: Open. My
mother asked me to telephone a friend of ours, gave me the number, and
I went to get help. <I>Pap&agrave;</I> did not feel well and had to lie
down, and I stayed close to him, counting his pulse and keeping track
of the increase in his heartbeat. In one hand he was holding a revolver.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mother went to the phone to make sure that help had really been
sent. Outside, beyond the door, there was absolute silence. I managed
to quiet <I>pap&agrave;</I>. The bell rang from the main gate that
opened onto the street. The house was separated from the street by a
long driveway that was flanked by tall trees. My mother asked me to go
and open the gate. I walked down the long dark driveway alone, hearing
creaking sounds everywhere, and once again I silently thanked my father
for encouraging me to walk around the house in the dark when we lived
in Rome, a way to conquer my

<B></B>

fears and learn to have a greater "tactile" sensibility. Finally I arrived
at the gate and could hear voices...excited voices...then two shots, and
I hid in the shrubbery...and at last I heard the password and I opened
the gate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Upon my return, <I>pap&agrave;</I> seemed much quieter.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At five in the morning, Mr. Hidaka, the Japanese ambassador, came to
bid farewell to his friend the poet, and later, with a car and escort
furnished by the Japanese embassy, we left the villa, scraping together a
few final possessions, especially <I>pap&agrave;'s</I> papers. During the
journey my father smiled reassuringly. Late in the afternoon we arrived
at Lora, on Lake Como. It had been a long journey, and often we had to
stop to take cover in ditches excavated alongside the road to escape the
machine-guns of the airplanes. I was happy to see my sisters and for us
all to be united once more.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The days weighed on our spirits, and the atmosphere was destructive,
obsessive. <I>Pap&agrave;</I> fought against our gloomy mood with
poetry. It was like magic, and we listened to it and loved it. After a
pause of a few days we departed for Cadenabbia, also on the lake.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was in that odd and out-of-the-way place, so rarely visited by my
father, that I had the good fortune to discover part of the world of his
childhood. In a home that lodged elderly people in a beautiful villa on
the lake there lived one of <I>pap&agrave;'s</I> aunts; to me, a child,
she seemed to be more than a hundred years old. She was dignified, a
bit stiff, affectionate in a limited way once thought suitable for the
haute bourgeoisie; she wore a velvet choker at her neck, was delicate,
slim, with long and beautiful hands, and with white hair arranged in a
chignon at the back of her neck; she seemed a creature from an unreal
world. I had never met close or distant relatives of my father, nor had
my mother, who was much younger than him. It left a great impression on
me when <I>pap&agrave;</I> hugged this slender woman who called him "Tom."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was the world of his childhood, of which I had heard him and others
speak often, now reappearing for the first time in a strange and tragic
context, as if the end were linking back up with the beginning; I
was observing <I>pap&agrave;</I>, who was deeply moved. Egypt and his
childhood were returning to him with all their power: his father, his
mother, his brother.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After a few days we moved from Cadenabbia to Bellagio, where we stayed
in two rooms of the Hotel Splendido, offered by ambassador Hidaka. The
machine-gunning from the planes was growing more common, and ferries
and steamers would arrive from the lake badly shop up, transformed into
collective biers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I continued my studies in a school on the hill in back of Bellagio,
and it was because of an ugly fall on the gravel in one of the many
ball games that we played that I came to spend my last days with
<I>pap&agrave;</I>. Mother had to go away, and I was to take on the role
of "the little nurse," as father had christened me. For some time already
I had been familiar with simple ways of slowing down his accelerated
heartbeat. I used to sleep in his room, not far from him. Even when he
was sleeping, <I>pap&agrave;</I> would apparently be creating poems,
which he wrote down the next morning. Sometimes at night he would light
a lamp to jot down some notes, and if I were

<B></B>

awake he would read them aloud to me. I was fascinated, but also afraid
that he would become agitated and then tired. He was always seized with
great emotion when he would read aloud, especially in the final days when
he was correcting his last poem, dedicated to young people. I lived for
two final days beside him, days full of affection, tenderness, and love.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A week later he left us forever.

in the manner of Carducci, he was transformed by his war experiences
into an advocate of the avant-garde and Futurism. He became a member of
the Futurist political party in 1918-19 and from early on an adherent of
fascism. In 1926, together with Curzio Malaparte, he founded <I>"900"
Cahiers d'Italie et d'Europe</I>, an international quarterly with
surrealist tendencies. He was made a member of the Italian Academy in

Futurist photography in 1911, though his work aroused resistance from
some of the Futurist painters. He directed several films and in 1918
founded an art gallery in Rome that sponsored exhibitions of works by
Balla, Boccioni, De Chirico, and the Dadaists, eventually totaling more
than 275 shows. In 1922 he founded the Teatro degli Indipendenti, which
performed new works by Marinetti, Pirandello, Soffici, Schnitzler, and

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With Johannes R. Becher the Germans have a gifted and spirited poet
whom they have not yet appreciated; neither the poems of his developing
period (1912-26) nor the documents of his extraordinary life (1891-1958)
have been read enough. Here and there (apart from a few praiseworthy
exceptions)
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 people are busy suppressing the memory of his early works as well as
 his real life story; and thirty years after his death there is still no
 biography that would show us how the wild young man transformed himself
 into the Comrade Minister of State who came to censure himself. European
 literary history has yet to admit that J. R. Becher, the first Communist
 Minister of Culture in the GDR, in his earlier and poetically most
 productive years was more thoroughly attracted to the Italian Futurists
 than any other German poet of the war generation, and enthusiastically
 seized on Futurist rhetoric, usually considered protofascist in its
 ideological implications, in the most effective Leninist poems ever
 written in the German tongue. Becher himself attempts to interpret and
 bend into shape the years of his youth and early manhood (at the end,
 he quotes Stalin's essay on language against the poems of his youth);
 and he is also a victim of the pedantry of a Germanist, which in its
 exclusive zeal of its interpretive and metatheoretical strivings, on
 the Left and the Right, has forgotten that poems, especially good ones,
 are sensual creatures that anarchically pierce the flatness and grayness
 of our everyday speech.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is difficult to describe how the idealistic Munich highschool student
revolted against his father, the highest judge in the kingdom of Bavaria,
and how at age seventeen, in a romantic suicide pact, killed a part-time
prostitute and attempted to

<B></B>

kill himself (his father rescued him, pleading insanity). He
never finished his studies and was repeatedly treated for morphine
addiction. Commuting between Munich and Berlin, a bohemian of the
gutters, he lived strangely unharmed through the years of the war and
his own confusions (he was not called up because his suicide attempt
that lacerated his lungs). He longed for salvation by soulful women and
beautiful young men, studied the writings of mystical nuns, Gorky, and
Lenin, and was readily welcomed in the best salons, or what was left of
them. After the war, he made his slow way to the all-forgiving Communist
party, the activism of the orthodox functionary (he had his part, together
with Georg Luk&aacute;cs, in undoing the Left avant-garde) and exile in
Moscow, where he never intervened for anyone accused of treason by the
Secret Police. He returned, by special plane of the Soviet Army, to his
devastated fatherland; and was later photographed at the massive desk
of his ministry, surrounded by joyous schoolgirls who presented bunches
of roses to the loyal poet of the new national anthem. It is a German
life: strange, unique, and beyond comparison.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Becher's works resist clean divisions, and even Norbert Hopster, in his
praiseworthy dissertation, is not altogether happy with his chronicle of
its changes and motifs. The two merge, and the literary loyalties, from
Richard Dehmel to Walt Whitman and from Rimbaud to Futurism, blur together
and transcend the borders of ideological transformations; even in the
final Leninist <I>Maschinenrhythmen</I> (Machine rhythms; 1926) Becher
works, for the last time, with Futurist ideas and language patterns.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The years 1912-13 and the beginning of the war pushed the schoolboyish
admirer of Richard Dehmel and Waldemar Bonsels into radical modernism. In
his collection of poems <I>Die Gnade eines Fr&uuml;hlings</I> (The grace
of a spring; 1912) he still published neoromantic songs in praise of Mary
("burningly my mouth arms itself / for you, Mary, sweet life"--this,
incidentally, also in protest against the Protestant father),
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 or pastoral lyricism ("so childyoung / the air makes me, so
 soulblossoming").
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Already one year later in <I>De Profundis Domine</I> 
 and <I>Verfall und Triumph</I> (Decay and triumph; 1914) the
 impressionistic and playful elements are gone; the influences of Georg
 Heym and Jakob van Hoddis, two young expressionists, draw Becher and
 his poems into urban Berlin, where everything happens in feverish
 simultaneity. Nightcaf&eacute;s, cinemas, and gigantic train stations
 are the new sites of experience: "Locomotives! / Steep-faced with the
 viaducts' momentum of the most rapid whores."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 He is fascinated by the war, and after paying tribute like so many of his
 writing contemporaries to the general patriotic enthusiasm with a cycle
 of sonnets, Becher, who was never a soldier and who later loved to be
 photographed in the uniform of the <I>Roter Frontk&auml;mpferbund</I>,
 creates his own myth of war; activated masses, brutality, steely,
 destructive technologies, and mutilated humans or, as he says,
 "<I>Menschenm&uuml;ll"</I> (human garbage).
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 War: at first as the possibility of destroying the bourgeois tradition
 and the tyranny of the fathers; then, a little later, war as the advance
 of a holy socialist army against the satanic enemies of humanity, and
 finally the Leninist war as bloody class struggle, in Germany and in
 the Soviet Union.

<B></B>

For a long time, this personal myth of war as "the only true hygiene of
the world"
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 is supported by Futurist motifs and rhetoric,
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 at first in the asyntactical <I>parole in libert&agrave;</I> and later
 mainly by Becher's Futuristic analogies, whose intensity and linguistic
 power far outreaches Marinetti's tests.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A 1915 text published in the <I>Wei&szlig;e Bl&auml;tter</I> signals
Becher's Futurist rhetoric, as well as the chronic attraction that the
technological brutality of modern warfare had for him. Historically, it is
not the first signal (that is to be found in the poetry and earlier), but,
by emulating the Italian model, has a particularly massive force. Becher
calls his text "Vorworte zum Tagebuch italienischen F&auml;hnrichs Georgio
Quadro" (Prologues to the diary of the Italian cadet sergeant Georgio
Quadro) and refers to the writings of a young Italian officer. The
diary was found after Quadro's death in the Austrian trenches at Krn
and published in the <I>Berliner Tageblatt</I> on 19 July 1915.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Becher sees the experiences of the patriotic officer, previously a
 civilian employee at a bank, as symbolic of all the young men of Europe
 who were pushed into the trenches with big words. In hymnic prose
 he continues the political education of the young Italian and leads
 him to the brink of political understanding, before the Austrian bomb
 tears him apart. Becher's realization of the moments in which Quadro
 takes sweet leave from the world of peach are written according to
 Futurist rules: "Sweat and tears. Gardens for you summer-shepherded,
 adria-blue and marble-wilderness, gardens: (most soft, most delicate,
 most flowery) for you creators in mourning rainbow-colored made up
 girls bend. Mother-of-pearl little faces long-oval."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The syntax is all but destroyed, with Futurist analogies instead of
 traditional comparisons. Indeed, Becher uses, or rather invents for
 himself (the only German example that I know of) the "semaphoric"
 function of adjectives, as Marinetti had demanded in his manifesto of
 11 May 1913.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Adjectives follow nouns and refer parenthetically to earlier nouns,
 bypassing the immediate antecedent. The <I>parole in libert&agrave;</I> 
 and their distaste for the verbum finitum (which here sometimes ossifies
 into a participle) dominate the many passages of the "Prologues" in
 which Becher confronts the reader with the fragmentation of humans and
 landscapes: "Exploding Colonel Lazzoni of the Fifth Carabinieri; with
 turned-out face; on it intestines, teeth, a throat all intertwining." Or:
 "Fever. Thick air. Lungs tear. Dripping horse-corpse. Arms farmerboys
 hacked to pieces. Hair, intestines, flesh--: one pulp.... Bloodily
 backed knife whipped. Ditches chlorinechalkpale filled."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Such images return in Becher's poetry almost monotonously for years,
 but not in the spirit of pacificism; rather, they appear with a zealous
 conviction that the old war would have to change itself into the new,
 no less aggressive war against everything old before the total dawn
 of paradise.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If there were a reliable biography, we would have an answer to the
questions of when and how Becher first became acquainted with Futurist
texts. After the literary projects of his publisher-friend Heinrich
Bachmair had failed (including the journal <I>Die Revolution</I>, where
Hugo Ball had published his early hymn on Futurist painting), Becher moved
on, like Ball, to the circle of writers around the journal <I>Aktion</I>,

<B></B>

and it was the translator Else Hadwiger who inspired him, like Ball,
to read the Futurists. A letter dated 18 March 1916 from Becher to the
publisher Ernst Sulzbach of Berlin confirms, at any rate, that he has
read the Futurists Marinetti and Paolo Buzzi--that is, just those authors
whom Hadwiger translated for <I>Sturm</I> and <I>Aktion</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Personal issues are of some significance here: after the death of her
 husband, the Prague symbolist poet Victor Hadwiger who had published
 a great deal in <I>Aktion</I>, Else Hadwiger did not withdraw from
 social life. She became sympathetic to increasingly radical ideas, and
 was also often to be seen in the company of the translator Fritz Max
 Cah&eacute;n in caf&eacute;s and literary assemblies,
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 as well as with the Wilmersdorf publisher R. A. Meyer, who had published
 her translation of Marinetti in a limited edition. They met in Meyer's
 apartment at the Bayrischer Platz or in her own spacious flat, at that
 time not far from the S&uuml;dwestkorso and Ludwig Meidner's studios
 (Meidner often stayed with her). Becher, I have no doubt, was closely
 connected to Hadwiger, regardless of his other liaisons. He sought
 refuge with her, both literally and spiritually, whenever his Munich
 exhaustions led him to Berlin. Even later, when the hectic affair of
 1914-15 was over, Hadwiger, who had already sacrificed part of her
 fortune for her husband, went on, together with the Princess Mechthilde
 Lichnowsky and Katharina Kippenberg, the wife of the Leipzig publisher,
 to support the morphine-dependent poet-vagabond (Harry Graf Ke&szlig;ler
 did his share too).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Love poems are not reliable biographical documents, but at least they
testify to how certain processes, internal and external, articulate the
writer's ability to experience; and in this respect Becher's Berlin poems
"Ekstasen der Z&auml;rtlichkeit" (Ecstacy of tenderness) and "Ein Ende"
(An end), both of them explicitly "dedicated to Frau Else Hadwiger," are
revealing. The one can be found in the collection <I>Verbr&uuml;derung</I>
(Fraternization; 1916) and the other, originally dated 1915, in the
collection <I>P&auml;an gegen die Zeit</I> (Paean against the time;
1918). The cycle "Ekstasen der Z&auml;rtlichkeit" consists of four pieces
introduced by the highly suggestive verses by Alfred Mombert: "You are the
one who understands me / and who is reconciled / to my burning crimes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 The poet professes an absolute feeling of love; Else is mother, Holy
 Virgin, lover, "unfolded like a flower" and "protectress"; a world lives
 in the "mirror" of her "oval nails"; "young men boiling / poured dying
 themselves over the planks of [her] hips"; and the world speaks only
 of her: "you are meant by the homecoming of noisy soldiers... / the
 banners shine your name / you, every cinema's loud poster."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 In the other poem, "Ein Abschied" (A farewell)
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 is constituted of two pieces: the first is agitated and, in spite
 of all the Futurist analogies ("<I>Nacht-Ozean</I>" [night-ocean]),
 an unsettled mixture of realism and confessional hymn; the second is
 more relaxed, simultaneously classical and lyrical, the stanzaic sound
 reminiscent of the old Goethe. The first part depicts the scandal of
 a violent farewell: someone else has gained the favor of the woman
 ("O woman! Chestnutbrown"), and the writer feels abandoned amid
 alienation and threats: "blessed was he. Sweet. At home. / Now fly
 bridges...knives...bombs...!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 While lost in the streets, he finds only bragging, naive, and evil
 words for the past: "the other may seize you--... / powerful

<B></B>

marches explode like a gun / Bursting apart your bed's mudlake."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The second part is cooler and more collected; the writer has found
 himself again, speaks words of comfort to himself: "Yes --, now he is
 drifting again, / only for a short while bound to her."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 This lover was home to him, but the moment of leavetaking is a new
 beginning:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Becher's acquaintance with the work of the Futurist Paolo Buzzi is,
however, of little significance for the development of his own Futurist
leanings. Becher refers to Buzzi's "I reclusi," a little imprecisely, as
"Gedichte aus den St&auml;dten" (Poems from the cities) in a letter to
the publisher Ernst Sulzbach. That choice of wording reveals that this
cycle of six poems, whose original title Else Hadwiger had translated in
the 7 November 1914 edition of <I>Aktion</I> more precisely as "Das Lied
der Eingeschlossenen" (The song of those confined) had impressed upon
him--contemporaneously with Heym and Hoddis--the dangerous and demonic
nature of the metropolis instead of the aspect he chose to emphasize, at
least in his Buzzi imitations: the accentuation of new technology. In
his "Reclusi" cycle Buzzi himself, in spite of his personal loyalty to
Marinetti, was not so much a Futurist in the sense of the early manifesto
as a late or ironic romantic or symbolist; the Futurist element lies
exclusively, or almost exclusively (as with the early Marinetti) in
the free verse, as it was programmatically cultivated in the journal
<I>Poesia</I>, which Buzzi helped found. "Das Lied der Eingeschlossenen"
consists of elegiac role poems, in which the victims--the forgotten,
those who had been forced from their cities into secrecy--speak in
chorus of their sufferings, longings, and hopes "Aus den Kl&ouml;stern"
(From the monasteries), "Aus den Bordellen" (From the brothels), "Aus den
Hospit&auml;lern" (From the hospitals), "Aus den Gef&auml;ngnissen" (From
the jails), "Aus den Irrenh&auml;usern"  (From the mental hospitals), and
"Von den Friedh&ouml;fen" (From the graveyards). (In Else Hadwiger's
translation, part 3 of the Italian cycle, the chorus of the soldiers
from the barracks, "Dalle Caserne," is missing.) The forgotten speak
calmly, movingly, and simply like the monks: "clean the little cell,
full of roses the small garden,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 or the whores: "we write home and stitch fine linen lace / ...don't
 know why they despise us outside,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 and only rarely in helpless irony like the sick in the hospitals, who
 complain about the tedious holiday visitors: "On Sundays the masses
 stream here like to the graveyard, / knock at the beds and dirty the
 carpets in the hallway / and bring us unhealthy sweets."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Futurist elements, in the sense of the ideological and rhetorical
 demands of the manifestos, are present only at a distance, for example
 in the anger of the mad: "we have been procreated by the green anger
 of the innermost organs" (reminiscent of Marinetti's romantic cult of
 the creative insane in the second manifesto), or the bizarre images in
 the litany of the dead, who

<B></B>

Becher replies with his own poems to Buzzi's "Das Lied der
Eingeschlossenen (I reclusi)," but the noteworthy element of his
reply is the fact that he contradicts the Futurist poet by being more
Futurist. The later poems of the German poet are well ahead of Buzzi's
early poetry in their radical quality. Buzzi's thematic accusations are
taken up and reshaped by Becher in his poetry collections <I>Verfall und
Triumph</I> and <I>P&auml;an gegen die Zeit</I> (for example in the poems
"Krankenhaus" [Hospital] and "Bordell" [Bordello]); and I suspect that
even poems like "Die Armen" (The poor), "Die Huren" (The whores), and
"Aus den H&ouml;fen" (From the courtyards) are in accordance with the
suggestions by Buzzi.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Becher had been acquainted with Hadwiger's Buzzi translation from
 the beginning, and his own hospital poems (Becher had had his own
 experiences, in the Landesanstalt Haar, a psychiatric hospital near
 Munich) demonstrate how he takes up Buzzi's perspective and tone and
 then emancipates himself from them only a little later. In "Krankenhaus"
 , especially in the second of the four pieces, he, like Buzzi,
 lets the sick speak in chorus; Buzzi's soft and melancholy elements
 are not wholly absent:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the later version of "Krankenhaus" , to which Becher himself
applies the term "variation," Buzzi's melancholy and soft irony are
destroyed by the dithyramb; the poem no longer speaks for and with the
sick, but instead presumes to change their world through the released
word: "I enforce their dissolution into wonderful May creatures."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The opening of the poem, line one, partly alludes to Buzzi/ Hadwinger's
 "qui si muore in fila"/"hier stirbt man reihenweise" (here one dies in
 rows [<I>WIF</I>, 256]) and turns into "hier w&auml;lzt sich's frei"
 (here it wallows itself free [<I>WIF</I>, 329]) in Becher's text,
 which then goes on to revel in its usual way in horrifying images of
 pus and blood. The syntax is cryptically reduced: "pointy steel from
 temples shrinking thunderstorms"; metaphor takes the form of Futuristic
 analogies: "slime-seaweed," "clip-skeletons," "shepherd-doctors"; and
 just as the Futurist manifestos demanded, the cities are "overgrown
 with electric streams."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Here Becher is the real Futurist, not Buzzi.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his later writings, which contain more than one confession about
the creative experiments of his youth or, as he puts it, "special Don
Quichotteries,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Becher the state minister thinks back nostalgically to the readings and
 contemporaries of his youth and touches on a basic idea of Futurism,
 which he ascribes to a friend from that period. In his reminiscences of
 what he calls expressionism (the minister now shies away from the word
 "Futurism," part of his vocabulary in 1914) and of his early poems,
 the poetic, if not even ontological, principle of simultaneity plays
 an important

<B></B>

part. Simultaneity and a modern "<I>Weltgef&uuml;hl</I>" (world sentiment)
were the same for him (and for the Futurists), and when he speaks of
"<I>Simultanismus</I>" (simultanism) he quotes a term that did not fail
to make its impression, even on him.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 In <I>Sturm</I>  Herwarth Walden had published Umberto Boccioni's
 essay on the "Simultan&eacute;it&eacute; Futuriste" (Futurist
 simultaneity) (in which the painter claimed the term for the Futurists
 and against the Frenchman Robert Delaunay), but the later Becher
 ascribes the demand for simultaneity to his unhappy friend Jakob van
 Hoddis, who was in the habit of publishing his poems in <I>Sturm</I>
 in the years 1911-13. Hoddis claimed, the later Becher writes, that
 "the sense of simultaneity"
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 is already intact in Homer (and therefore not only with
 the Futurists or their French colleagues, who articulated
 simultaneit&agrave;/simultan&eacute;it&eacute; as a modern
 program?). Becher adds that he and his friends were willing to realize
 this sense of simultaneity as an "immeasurable world-wideness,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 as Hoddis had done in his famous two verses of "Weltende" (End of
 the world)
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
--"the great is mixed in with the small and vice versa, nothing is able
to last separately by itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 The call for simultaneity (which also appears in the diary of Georg Heym)
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 withered soon, according to Becher, to a "stencil," and "bureaucratic
 verse-products were generated, which were mathematically calculated,
 so that each sentence had to be followed by an antithesis."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Whether entirely calculated or not, in Becher's early praxis this
 simultaneity is often signalled by a strong Bavarian "<I>Derweil</I>"
 (meanwhile), which connects even the most contradictory events and
 experiences "in the spirit of an expressionist pantheism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 The minister of state does not, however, remember that in a 1923
 letter to the editors of the cultural section of the <I>Frankfurter
 Zeitung</I> in which he attempted to explain his prosody, as a
 Marxist he connected even the unusual typography of his verses
 and his idiosyncratic punctuation (as stopsigns against the flow of
 syntax) with <I>simultaneit&agrave;</I>. He wrote at that time to the
 <I>Frankfurter Zeitung</I> that the antisyntactical precautions transform
 "the consecutive" "with a dialectical manoeuvre into a parallel" and
 added that the poem thus is put into "the sphere of simultaneity" and
 indicates "also externally the rapid speed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 It is of less significance whether Becher owed this connection
 of simultaneity and speed, <I>simultaneit&agrave;</I> and
 <I>velocit&agrave;</I>, to Hadwiger or Boccioni, than the fact that,
 whether he wanted to or not, as a recently converted Leninist and
 enthusiastic partisan of communism, Becher was a poetic ally of the
 Futurists.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All arguments for or against Becher's entanglement in Futurism would
be farfetched if they could not be supported, as has been demonstrated
in detail by Hopster and also partly by Carmine Chiellino, by shared
features of thematics and rhetoric and indeed by their integration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Among the expressionists there were many city and war poets, but only
 a few who were as attracted by modern technology and its destructive,
 purifying effects as Becher was. With its reduced syntax in which
 the noun and simultaneity reign, the way in which he describes the
 metropolis, as simultaneously horrendous and the paradisiacal site
 of utopian beginnings, and the ideal war, as an at once violent and
 hopeful destruction of old worlds, is closer to

<B></B>

Italian Futurism than any other German poems of the era. No other German
poet wrote poems like "Auf ein Maschinengewehr" (To a machine gun) or
"Lokomotiven" (The locomotives) simultaneously with "Die neue Syntax"
(The new syntax).
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Had he written in Italian, Becher would have become a towering poet
 of European Futurism in the years 1913-19 and even later, with his
 Leninist <I>Maschinenrhythmen</I> . The decisive elements are not
 so much the movable parts of the Futuristic technology--the racing cars,
 airplanes, trains, and the complete war arsenals: battleships, torpedoes,
 shrapnel, the phallic cannons (as in Marinetti's "Schlacht" [Battle]
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
) and the spewing bayonets--but rather their linguistic presence in
a reduced syntax, in "<I>befreiten Worten</I>" (liberated words), in
simultanism and in the analogies and analogy chains, which correspond to
Marinetti's programmatic demands. Even if Hadwiger and van Hoddis had
not related things Futurist to him, Becher would have invented his own
Futurism under the irrepressible compulsion of his explosive imagination.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Each of the German authors who grappled with Futurism accentuated in his
own texts a different element of the Futurist rhetoric; and while Alfred
D&ouml;blin dealt mainly with the <I>parole in libert&agrave;</I>,
and August Stramm and Ball (to simplify things here) dealt with
the structure of the syntax, Becher, unlike anyone else, worked with
analogies and chains of analogies. In Marinetti's poetic program, which
gives precedence to the image over the sentence, the "analogies," a word
he derives from Edgar Allan Poe, number among the significant features
of the new rhetoric. He explains in the "Technical Manifesto" and in its
"Supplement," as they could be read in <I>Sturm</I> in 1912 and 1913,
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 that the modern "<I>aviatische Schnelligkeit</I>" (aviatic speed) of
 our "<I>Weltkenntnis</I>" (<I>la conoscenza del mondo</I> [knowledge
 of the world]) demands its correspondence in a speedy metaphoric;
 no more leisurely comparisons using "as" or "just as," but instead,
 lightning-like "doublings" that "pull the object into one characteristic
 word with the image evoked by it,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 i.e. man-torpedo-boat (<I>uomotorpediniera</I>), woman-gulf
 (<I>donna-golfo</I>), crowd-surf (<I>folla-risacca</I>), and so on.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Marinetti does not hesitate to distinguish between bad, good, and
 still better analogies; basically an anticlassical <I>concetto</I>
 (conceit) is hidden in each analogy, and therefore Marinetti
 demands "<I>Steigerungen</I>" (increases) of the analogies, which
 for their highest effect bind together "<I>fernstehende</I>"
 (distant), "<I>verschiedene</I>" (different), and "<I>Feindliche
 Dinge</I>" (antagonistic things) in such a way that they replace the
 merely mechanical and threadbare elements of the language with the
 unexpected, the surprising, and the effective. When a writer compares
 a fox terrier with a small thoroughbred (Marinetti's example), he has
 not yet done much to break through the expected; that only happens
 when he connects the image of the terrier with the agitated bubble
 of boiling water. Marinetti's sketch is not content with the single
 analogy (his text "Schlacht" is the first to show that); the whole
 world is in rapid motion, and therefore the "<I>aufeinanderfolgenden
 Bewegungen</I>" (successive movements) require a "<I>Kette</I>" (chain)
 or a "<I>Netz</I>" (net) of analogies, "which one sinks into the sea
 of the appearances."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Nothing would be more desirable, Marinetti says, at least theoretically
 and without any concern for the reader, than to leave the first
 members of

<B></B>

these chains of the analogy out and to bind together only the second
ones in a mysterious poetic text, in pure images.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Becher's endeavor to create word combinations, which were supposed to
enable him to intensify the expression and to lessen the necessities
of typical syntactical construction, has a long history that begins
with his earliest poems, is in danger of solidifying into a rhetorical
mannerism in the last years of World War I, and finds its end in the
1926 <I>Maschinenrhythmen</I>. Those special noun constructions using
hyphens, which one may call Futuristic analogies, cannot be found
before the end of 1912 / the beginning of 1913, that is, before the
publication of Marinetti's "Technical Manifesto" and "Supplement" in
<I>Sturm</I>. In <I>Die Gnade eines Fr&uuml;hlings</I>, Becher still
writes in the neoromantic mode: "the glow of the evening rose" pushes in,
"the evening sky plays completely blue, shinysunkenblue," and when he
is really adventurous, Becher also imitates Arno Holz's morphological
monsters, and the sunbeams sit on the "skyandcloudglowingdowndrinking"
backs of the roofs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 In <I>Verfall und Triumph</I>, which contains the poems written between
 December 1912 and November 1913, the sentiment is expunged once and
 for all; Becher works with frequent noun combinations, which the German
 language easily tolerates as neologisms, for example "gold-trombones"
 and "mould-moon," or he connects adverbial and adjectival notions with
 hyphens: "reeling-crazy," "deathly-shrill," "drunkenclose," in a pattern
 he will rely on for a long time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 The poem "Die Armen" (The poor) constitutes the obvious exception to
 this pattern, in which we see signs of Becher's future development;
 we find the first, awkward attempts to form analogies like "civil
 servant-snout," more effective examples in the call to Christ as
 "diseasehoard," and anticipations of the future with "brain-beams."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Even the first attempt to unite two analogies in a single verse is here:
 "when smell-seas softly caress our endurer-bodies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Becher's poems written during World War I (published in various volumes
and often suppressed) are characterized by the frequent repetition
and boldness of the analogies; some are closely related to Marinetti's
standard (for example, "shrapnel thicket,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 "woman-slough,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 and "human-ant"
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
), but in Becher's livelier moments and before the process ossifies
into a mannerism, they show an unforgettable poetic spontaneity and
mysteriousness, as in "nonsense-litany," "tarantula-Christ," and
"places-pimples."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Sometimes they lock into incredible chains of analogy that are
 unparalleled in even the most adventurous expressionist poetry of the
 era: for example, the snow in its "nail-whip-flight," "O forehead-rabble
 slipping: snow-accord," or the line "trombone-taiphoo-thunderstorm from
 lip-coasts rage."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 This all goes far beyond the poems of Marinetti and his friends.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Becher's analogies might be more closely defined by a process that not
only observes the basic patterns of his combinations but also helps to
separate spontaneity from mannerism. Most noticeable are those forms
of the analogies in which the human body or one of its parts forms a
semantic element. Statistically, those forms in which the corporeal
functions as a basic term predominate, which suggests that Becher very
often only feigns analogies by forming composites according to the

<B></B>

grammatical rules of the German language (Marinetti does not have this
possibility in his languages) and separating them again with a hyphen,
as in "torpedo-bodies," "flag-arms" (or "lasso-arms"), "flag-hairs,"
"hill-hip," "rock-knee," "moss-lips," "forehead-dam," "pulp-head,"
"drum-belly," or "bayonet-arm."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Statistically more frequent than these pseudo-analogies (which twist
 the possibilities of German morphologies apart and are reminiscent of
 baroque composites) are those in which the bodily element appears first
 and massively increases the imagistic power of the analogy through the
 inversion, for example in "finger-rake," "neck-towers," "lip-ruin,"
 "eyelash-moon," or "muscle-viaducts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 A third pattern, one which tends to degenerate into mannerism, can
 be found when a physiological aspect, such as blood or a secretion,
 functions semantically as a basic word, for example "pus-moon" (Becher
 shares Marinetti's dislike of <I>la luna</I>), "excrement-cloud,"
 "blood-night," "pus-fog," and "excrement-cities."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 My observations are unfair insofar as they tend to focus on repetition
 rather than the singular, the mannerism rather than the uniqueness;
 but in the work of a poet, one cannot be defined without the other,
 and without being aware of what mannerism Becher develops, I cannot be
 completely clear as to his originality. An analogy like "craziness-salt,"
 found in <I>Maschinenrhythmen</I>, exceeds all statistical analyses,
 which inevitably find repeated patterns because they are meant to find
 them; an interpretation of the unrepeated, the unrepeatable, has the
 larger claim.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>

I intentionally have not quoted from Becher's <I>Maschinenrhythmen</I>
, because I think that it belongs to the key texts of the
radical Left German literary avantgarde, just as a little later Brecht's
<I>Heilige Johanna der Schlachth&ouml;fe</I> (St. Joan of the stockyards;
1929-30) does. Becher's collection of poetry was forgotten because
it positions itself against traditional ideological prejudices. One
knows only too clearly what is Left and what is Right, rhetorically and
politically, and one finds oneself disturbed by poems in which a visionary
Leninism articulates itself in a poetic idiom in which a tendency toward
Futurist themes and rhetoric once more, and for the last time, goes
to the extreme of linguistic self-destruction, stammering, feverish,
fragmented. These poems, including the violent "Hymne an Lenin" (Hymn
to Lenin), read as if possessed, with the class war as the only power
of salvation in the world:

Gramsci will later judge Futurism differently, but his Lunatscharsky
commentary explains and positions Becher's remarkable mixture of Leninist
dogma and Futurist rhetoric in their own historical moment. In their
respective beginnings, Futurism and fascism were not as inseparably linked
as the impatient generalizations of later ideological criticism makes out,
and it would be productive to ask the question of whether the national
anarchism of the early Futurists does not in fact clearly anticipate
elementary features of the German national Bolshevism of the Weimar era.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In public Benito Mussolini seldom acknowledged his debts to the cultural
movements that had contributed to fascism's formation. In private,
however, he was often quite explicit in issuing generous certificates
of recognition, especially to the avant-gardes of the early twentieth
century, chief among them the Futurist movement and the group that been
centered around the journal <I>La Voce</I>. His encounter with <I>La
Voce</I>, Mussolini confided to his preferred biographer, had been
a revelation for him, giving him the certainty that he was a man of
destiny, someone "called upon to announce a new age."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 And with equal generosity <I>il duce</I> spoke of his debts to Futurism:
 "I formally declare that without Futurism there would never have been
 a fascist revolution."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even apart from Mussolini's statements, which are hardly negligible
in their own right, it is difficult to deny the participation of the
avant-garde in the formation of fascist political culture. Collaborators
and important readers of <I>La Voce</I> became fascist militants; the
principal exponents of Futurism were among the founding fathers of the
fascist movement and firmly adhered to the totalitarian regime, actively
collaborating in the creation of its culture and the diffusion of its
ideology; and some, such as Marinetti and Sironi, remained faithful to
Mussolini and fascism into the years of the Republic of Sal&ograve;. Yet
the overt participation of avant-garde culture in the generation and
the fortunes of fascism has never sufficed to prevent the rise of a
lively debate, begun already in the early 1920s, about the nature of
their relation, especially in the case of Futurism. In 1923 Giuseppe
Pressolini, for example, denied

<B></B>

that there was any ideal connection between Futurism and fascism
as it had come to be in power, for Futurism was antitraditionalist,
individualist, libertarian, antimoralist, and anti-Catholic, while
fascism was classicist, hierarchic, authoritarian, moralist, and Catholic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Benedetto Croce, however, writing in 1924, urged the opposite view:
 "To anyone with a sense of historical connections, the ideal origins
 of fascism are to be found in Futurism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 And in support of his claim the philosopher listed the Futurist matrices
 of fascism: the cult of action, the disposition toward violence, the
 intolerance of dissent, desire for the new, disdain for culture and
 tradition, and the glorification of youth. Ironically, both Croce and
 Prezzolini may have been right, and, at the same time, wrong. The same
 might be said for many others who have continued to discuss this question
 in more or less the same way, sometimes accentuating the points of
 convergence or consensus between the two movements, sometimes emphasizing
 their moments of discrepancy or disagreement. Either interpretation can
 seem valid if one proceeds, as did Croce and Prezzolini, by isolating
 a single aspect or a particular moment in the relations between the
 two movements and using that as a basis for generalization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Analysis of the relations between fascism and Futurism, however, cannot be
limited to collating their doctrinal agreements or to registering, in a
sort of parallel history, their record of coalition and conflict. Though
certainly useful, ultimately such a procedure proves critically sterile,
for in practice it merely leads to the reaffirmation of what was already
self-evident to the historical protagonists themselves. We know, after
all, that Futurism was not identical with fascism on the historical,
cultural, or political levels: any such identification was repeatedly
contested by futurists who were neither fascists nor antifascists, and
it conflicts with the variety of contradictory political ideologies
that were lodged within Futurism both before and after the arrival of
fascism in power, contradictions that neither prered nor were ever
resolved within the ideology of fascism. But this recognition does not
imply that one can sustain the view, urged by apologists of Futurism
committed to minimizing its involvement in fascism, that the culture
of Futurism was of a kind that differed fundamentally in its values and
its myths from fascist political culture. Nor can the collaboration of
Futurism and fascism be dismissed with the reductive thesis that Futurist
participation in fascism was merely a matter of personal inclination,
an historical problem of secondary importance, one to be explained by
individual opportunism or ingenuity. For at the origins of that thesis
is a presupposition informing debate about the larger problem of the
relations between fascism and culture, and especially the problem of
fascism's attitude toward modernity and the role of modernist culture in
totalitarian politics. Fascism, it was long assumed, possessed neither
an ideology nor a culture of its own; it was, instead, a reactionary
movement that was fundamentally antimodern, that looked nostalgically to
the past and that sought to arrest the process of modernity in order to
stop or turn back the movement of modernity. The modernist avant-gardes,
it was likewise assumed, differed absolutely in their very essence from
the politics of totalitarianism, and on the basis of these assumptions
one could explain the widespread participation of important res of

<B></B>

Italian culture and the modernist avant-garde in both the movement and
the regime of fascism solely by motives of self-interest or political
naivet&eacute;. Avant-garde intellectuals who became fascists, it
was often insisted, did so on the basis of a profound misapprehension
of what fascism really was. Yet while personal interest or political
misunderstanding can hardly be excluded from among the motivations that
informed Futurist participation in fascism, an account formulated in more
properly historical terms would need to address other and more important
facts: that the encounter between Futurism and fascism occurred in the
period of fascism's formation, when nobody would have bet a penny on
its success; and that the Futurists' participation in fascism when in
power took place with a full awareness of what fascism was, and that the
Futurists, though disagreeing with some decisions and some orientations
of the regime, never suggested that its totalitarian politics was in
conflict with their conception of culture, with their idea of modernity,
or with their vision of the destiny of the nation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
More recently, study of the relations between fascism and culture
has entered a new stage, one that permits us to examine the cultural,
ideological, and political relations between Futurism and fascism from
a new perspective.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Few scholars now find a fundamental incompatibility between the terms
 fascism and culture, or fascism and modernity; and whereas twenty years
 ago it was considered almost blasphemy, at least within the field of
 Italian historiography, to define fascism as essentially modern, today
 it has become common to speak of fascism as an "alternative modernism,"
 or to use terms such as "modernist fascism" or "fascist modernism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Studies in this direction have been fruitful and innovative, and
 increasingly studies of fascist culture have given greater attention
 to fascism's attitude toward modernity--a theme fun-damental
 to understanding the very nature of fascism--even if not always
 with methods or results that appear wholly convincing in relation
 to the history of the relations between culture and politics in
 fascism. "Fascist modernism" has been especially studied by literary
 critics and historians of art, sometimes with notable results, often
 drawing upon the interpretation of fascism as "the aestheticization of
 politics" which Benjamin proposed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Yet however suggestive this interpretation, it can also be misleading
 if it obscures fascism's other important feature, its "politicization
 of aesthetics," which not only inspired fascism's attitude toward
 avant-garde culture, but stood at the very origin of the encounter
 between Futurism and fascism and of the participation of many modernist
 intellectuals in fascism. Such caution might seem obvious, but it is also
 necessary if we are to avoid letting emphasis on "the aestheticization
 of politics" lead to a kind of "aestheticization" of fascism itself,
 privileging only its literary, aesthetic, and symbolic aspects while
 losing sight of motivations and matrices that are essentially political
 in nature. To do so risks trivializing the fundamentally political nature
 of fascism, its culture, its ideology, and its symbolic universe. Even
 when studying strictly aesthetic manifestations of fascism, such as its
 political style, its liturgy for the masses, or its copious symbolic
 production, all of them characteristic and essential elements in the
 fascist mode of doing politics, it is important not to lose sight of
 the political dimension of fascist culture. This does not

<B></B>

mean that one should not underestimate the problem of "the
aestheticization of politics," as I have argued for some time in urging
that fascism's "politics of the spectacle" was the manifestation of a new
"aesthetic conception of political life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Nevertheless, the aesthetic dimension cannot be analyzed separately
 from the totalitarian conception of politics, for it was a consequence
 of that very conception. The symbolic production of fascism was not an
 outcome of its ideological incoherence,
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 but the consequential expression of a vision of life and politics
 specific to a political movement that was simultaneously a new secular
 religion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Seen from this viewpoint, "the aestheticization of politics" acquires
 particular significance insofar as it is a manifestation of the
 <I>sacralization of politics</I> that fascism undertook, a project
 pursued with the full consensus and active participation of modernist
 intellectuals and artists, who collaborated enthusiastically in
 the construction of the symbolic universe of fascist religion. That
 project, the search for a new form of secular or lay religion for
 modern Italy, was in turn an important aspect of various attempts
 to fashion a synthesis between nationalism and modernity which were
 pursued by the avant-gardes in early twentieth century Italy; and it
 was in the course of that search that most of the Futurists adhered
 to fascism from the beginning, viewing it as first a movement, then a
 regime that was capable of realizing that synthesis by instituting a
 political religion of the nation and creating an "Italian modernity"
 that would also be a model for a new European civilization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Futurist involvement in totalitarian politics, beyond any record of
discrepancies and conflicts, originated within fundamental cultural
connections that can be better identified if we situate the problem of
Futurism's relationship to fascism within the more ample perspective of
the problem of the relations between the modernist avant-garde and the
cultural origins of fascism. The most important connection concerned
attitudes toward "the experience of modernity" as that was perceived,
experienced, and interpreted by avant-garde culture and fascism. I will
consider only the political side of modernist culture, <I>modernism</I>
understood here as a vision of modernity, rather than a sociological
understanding of <I>modernization</I>, even though modernization processes
(industrialization, scientific discoveries, technologicasl development,
urbanization, mass society, globalization of capital, unification
of the world) furnish the scenario that stands in the background of
our analysis. By <I>political modernism</I>--using the definition of
modernism proposed by Marshall Berman--I mean those political ideologies
that arose in connection with modernization, ideologies that seek to
render human beings capable of mastering the processes of modernization
in order not to be overwhelmed by the "vortex of modernity," giving them
"the power to change the world that is changing them, to make their own
way within the vortex and to make it their own."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Futurism and fascism are both, in this sense, manifestations of political
 modernism that belong to a common cultural terrain. The "conquest of
 modernity," as we may call the aspiration to have the capacity and the
 power to master the processes of modernization, did not follow a single
 path. Political antagonism among the ideal alternatives of modernity has
 been perhaps one the most disquieting, ambiguous, and tragic features
 of the twentieth century, Many,

<B></B>

and not just the Futurists, have believed that the surest and most
rapid path toward the "conquest of modernity" was that proposed by
totalitarian movements. Perhaps we can better understand some of the
motives for their choice by examining the Futurists.

Fascism, as one scholar has perceptively remarked, represented the
"politicization of Italian modernism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Yet in reality, that politicization was already well under way long
 before the appearance of the fascist political movement, having been
 initiated by the cultural avant-garde. The affirmation of a cultural
 militancy that could wield political influence or engage in political
 action was shared across the spectrum of Italian avant-gardes at the
 beginning of the twentieth century. Prior to World War I these movements
 gave birth to a generational revolt, conducted under the banner of the
 creative role assigned to youth, that involved a radical contestation of
 parliamentary government, one in which divergent visions of modernity,
 even though posed as alternatives to one another, were aligned in a
 common front against rationalist, liberal, and bourgeois modernity. The
 laboratory of the modernist avant-gardes proposed a series of themes
 and myths of a new political and artistic culture, motifs that flowed
 together into fascism after the Great War and contributed to its
 political culture and its attitude toward modernity. This does not
 mean, however, that these movements can be defined as protofascist,
 for from the same terrain of Italian modernist culture in the early
 twentieth century there also developed other syntheses of the same
 motifs, different cultural and political movements opposed to fascism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The avant-garde cultural movements that arose in Italy at the beginning
of the twentieth century, such as Futurism and the groups that coalesced
around the reviews <I>Leonardo</I> and <I>La Voce</I>, shared a common
note of political nationalism which manifested itself in what I have
elsewhere called "the myth of Italianism," a conviction that Italy
was destined to have a role as a great protagonist and exercise a
civilizing mission in the life of the twentieth century. Toward that
end, all these movements believed in the necessity of a radical process
of moral, cultural, and political regeneration meant to give birth to
a "new Italian." Long before the birth of fascism, Futurism urged the
necessity of overcoming the barriers between culture and politics by
means of a symbiosis between culture and life, a symbiosis designed to
reawaken the intellectual and moral energies of the Italians, to endow
them with a new sense of Italianness and spur them to the conquest
of new preeminences. Artists and intellectuals were to abandon the
privileged isles of aristocratic individualism and immerse themselves
in the impetuous flux of modern life in order to become the artificers,
the spiritual guides of the New Italy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The cultural roots of Futurism and fascism intersect in the common
terrain of "modernist nationalism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 The term, which I have used elsewhere, does not refer to a specific
 political or cultural movement, but defines a state of mind, a
 sensibility, a

<B></B>

cultural orientation centered on the myth of the nation, a sensibility
that we can find in all the avant-garde movements formed in Italy during
the fifteen-year period prior to the Great War. What characterized this
nationalism was essentially its attitude toward modernity, perceived as
a new dimension in human history, within which the nation could grow
and expand its power. Modernist nationalism was not conservative, nor
did it harbor nostalgia for a pre-industrial world, nor did it dream of
turning back the clock of history. Its principal characteristic was the
frank acceptance of modern life as an era of irreversible transformations
that were affecting society, consciousness, and human sensibility, and
that were preparing conditions for the rise of new forms of collective
life, a new civilization. Modernist nationalism welcomed modernity as an
explosion of human energies and an expansion of life without precedents
in history, an enthusiasm that was united with a tragic and activist
sense of existence--an "artificial optimism,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 to use Marinetti's words, that rejected nihilism with an exalted feeling
 of new plenitude and an affirmation of vitality in the life of those
 individuals and nations who would fling themselves into the vortex of
 modernity. For this particular kind of nationalism modernity was an
 acceleration of the rhythms of time, the invention and multiplication
 of technical means for the domination and exploitation of nature, an
 expansion of energies both human and material, an intensification of
 individual and collective life through struggle, a new sense of the
 world. In the field of politics, modernity meant a crisis of traditional
 aristocracies, an epoch of new masses and the rise of new elites,
 the predominance of collectivities over individuals, renovation of
 the State, and political and economic expansion. Modernist nationalism
 opposed neither modernization nor industrialization, processes it rather
 intended to promote and accelerate in order to furnish the nation with
 the means to compete within a global economy. Instead it wanted to master
 and discipline them to consolidate the cohesion of the nation and enable
 its participation in world politics. To modernize the nation meant not
 just giving it new instruments of economic and social development,
 but regenerating it from archaic habits born during the course of
 centuries of enslavement, furnishing it with a modern consciousness by
 means of a new culture. What distinguished this nationalism, what made
 it modernist, was its intention to reconcile intellectual culture, or
 <I>spiritualismo</I> (spiritualism)--understood here generically as the
 primacy of culture, ideas, and feelings--with mass industrial society,
 an intention that aimed at opposing and avoiding the negative effects
 brought in the wake of modernity, such as materialism, skepticism,
 hedonistic egoism, egalitarian conformism, etc.--all that modernist
 nationalism identified with the rationalist and individualistic tradition
 of the Enlightenment. Toward that end modernist nationalism argued the
 necessity of accompanying the industrial revolution and modernization
 with a "revolution of the mind" order to form the sensibility, the
 character, the conscience of a new Italian who could comprehend and
 confront the challenges of modern life, who could firmly adhere to the
 superiority of the mental forces that would assure unity and collective
 identity to the nation in the face of the development of material and
 technological forces. To accomplish this mental revolution, modernist
 nationalism appealed

<B></B>

less to reason than to the energy of feelings and emotions; it sought
to reactivate the mythopoetic faculties in order to create new and
modern myths of the nation--a secular religion of the nation--to oppose
the negative consequences and disgregatory effects of the crisis of
traditional society. But even though modernist nationalism availed
itself of the mythic use of history in order to construct new symbolic
and mythic worlds in support of its religion of the nation, it never
entertained a fetishistic cult of tradition, never engaged in a nostalgic
pursuit of an imaginary past order of harmony and perfection. Instead it
participated in the changes of modernity and projected the nation toward
the future, doing so with the tragic optimism of a will to power that
would affirm itself in struggle and conquest. The instrumental appeal to
myths of past grandeur, adopted to spur the renovation of national pride,
coexisted in modernist nationalism with new myths of future grandeurs yet
to be conquered; likewise, the glorification of the nation's preeminence
coexisted with an ambition to create values and principles appropriate to
a modern civilization deemed to be universal; and likewise, again, belief
in the primacy of intellectual culture coexisted with an exaltation of
a realism based on force. For modernist nationalism, war and violence
could be necessary instruments for the fulfillment of the conquest of
modernity, the regeneration of the nation, and the construction of a
new Italian civilization for the modern age.

The confrontation between nationalism and modernity in Italian political
culture went back to the origins of a united Italy. From the Risorgimento
on, the highest aspiration of the Italian patriots had been to raise
Italy to the level of the great modern nation-states, to form a national
consciousness that would furnish a feeling of collective identity for the
various Italian peoples who, though inhabiting the same peninsula, had
remained separated from one another by profound political, social, and
cultural differences virtually since the fall of the Roman empire. The
founding fathers of a united Italy assigned the new State the task of
liberating Italians from the habits of the "old man," of turning them
into truly "modern men," as Silvio Spaventa put it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 They conceived the conquest of modernity as a process of civilizing
 the nation under the banner of a nationalism that pursued the ideal of
 "liberty and progress." Yet this ideal was also understood differently
 in the two principal movements of the Risorgimento, the liberalism
 of Cavour and the radicalism of Mazzini. For Mazzini, the conquest of
 modernity was to occur through a political and mental revolution, with
 the creation of a Third Italy that Mazzini conceived as a democratic
 theocracy founded on the faith of a people morally united in a religion
 of the <I>patria</I> (fatherland); this would be a country that would
 rapidly take its place in the vanguard of the modern nations and usher in
 a new era of civilization. Cavour and the liberals, who actually created
 modern Italy, interpreted the conquest of modernity as the nation's
 ascent toward conditions of freedom, civic life, and social progress,
 an ascent conducted under the moderate guide of parliamentary government.

<B></B>

The contrast between these ways of interpreting modernity survived the
immediate process of unification to become a permanent and defining
feature of Italian political culture in the late nineteenth century,
becoming more salient as the nation experienced a growing state of
disillusionment and dissatisfaction, especially among younger generations
who were raised under the liberal regime. For notwithstanding the progress
achieved by Italy in the social and economic fields, the conquest of
modernity appeared an arduous undertaking for a nation-state constituted
so recently, still so uncertain in its identity and unstable in its
moral cohesion, while all the while the transformations of modernity
were increasing with an accelerating rhythm. In the closing years of the
nineteenth century Francesco de Sanctis, the chief educator of a united
Italy, entrusted a new generation with the mission of achieving a moral
and intellectual reformation that would give Italians a modern national
conscience: Italians had

Italy, at the turn of the century, was once more questioning its
destiny as a nation in an era of disturbing changes produced by
modernization. Humanity had entered a new stage of modernity; new forms
of life and civilization were rising because of the "rapid and immense
development of large industry," with its repercussions felt in every
class, every society, and every nation, changes that were shattering a
"thousand year old equilibrium of the world...not only in economics, but
in politics and morals," as the sociologist Mario Morasso wrote in 1905.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Morasso was among the most typical representatives of modernist
 nationalism and he formulated many of the myths of modernolatry that
 would be echoed in Futurism. With turgid rhetoric but clear-sighted
 realism, Morasso depicted the principal processes of the enormous
 transformation that was reshaping society in the age of imperialism. Its
 effects were felt in every sector of individual and collective
 life. Modern man was living "in a new world in which unimaginable new
 forces are unfolding...which have transformed not only the bases of
 international political life and the moral conduct of individuals, but
 the entire system of economic relations." Economic relations now had "a
 preponderant influence over other kinds of relations, over man's feelings
 and habits, over human nature, over the functions of government; they
 are creating a new politics and even a new consciousness...." Large-scale
 industry was having a

Futurism glorified modern life with a Dionysian exaltation of everything
generated by modernity and its continuous explosion of energies, even its
most violent and brutal aspects. "For the first time," wrote Boccioni,

This feeling of enthusiastic adherence to modernity has often been

even by anti-Futurists, as were many of the Vocians. "To be moderns! To

The groups of the modernist avant-garde in Italy that accepted the
primacy of the nation as axiomatic also shared a principal objective,
"to reconnect the new expectations for Italian culture with the great
economic progress that we have been observing already for some years,"
as Giovanni Papini and Giuseppe Prezzolini wrote in 1906.

 Papini and Prezzolini were founders of the journal <I>Leonardo</I> and
 the extremely young promoters of the first Italian avant-garde of the

 nationalism (see <I>MSN</I>, 81-191). The intellectuals who collaborated
 on <I>La Voce</I> were still more explicit in urging intellectuals to
 unite themselves with "Lombard industrialists, Genovese shipbuilders,
 bankers and businessmen of northern Italy," to work together for the
 "success of the fatherland in the struggle among the nations that are

 Yet behind these exhortations, and behind the myth of Italianism that
 they embodied, there was also a disquieting conflict between faith
 in the innate virtues of the Italian nation, those virtues that were
 showing signs of rebirth and prompting the younger generation to wish
 to reconquer Italy's cultural primacy, and an inferiority complex that
 younger intellectuals felt when they compared Italy with the more
 advanced nations of Europe. Giovanni Amendola, the future leader of
 the anti-fascist opposition, observed in 1905 that Italy "has begun
 to take great strides and is firmly on the path to wealth, but it will
 not maintain its position if it does not simultaneously pursue the path

During the years that preceded the Great War the vicissitudes of Italian
culture can be interpreted as a competition for the elaboration and
affirmation of an ideal of modernity. The principal intellectuals and
artists who gave life to the renewal of Italian culture during these
years were all engaged in this competition, which soon seepoed into the
world of politics. Each proposed an ideal of modernity that was meant to
shape the conscience of modern Italians. Giovanni Papini admitted that
his greatest ambition was to become "the spiritual guide of younger
Italy and the Italy of the future...I would like to be the spiritual
reorganizer of this very old race."

 Marinetti and the Futurists proposed themselves as the guides of a
 cultural revolution that would forge the modern Italian, liberating
 him from all devotion to the cultural heritage of the past and the myth
 of tradition. The same ambition to shape the Italian of the twentieth
 century also inspired the cultural engagement of intellectuals who were
 not part of the avant-garde but who enjoyed prestige and influence among
 the young. Benedetto Croce, with his vast work as critic, philosopher,
 and historian, assigned himself the task of  forming "a modern Italian
 conscience that would be European and national."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Giovanni Gentile, philosopher and educational theorist, dedicated his

The idea that culture possessed a militant function, that it was
intellectual activity that formed the modern conscience of a new Italian,
was common to the different movements of the modernist avant-garde. In
common also was the conviction that to be modern meant first of all, to

the consciousness of modern man, was to take over the place left empty
by the crisis of traditional religion.

future. Destined to live in a new civilization, he feels that he has
been sacrificed, yet without having any self-awareness of the cause,
which might render him great. He feels his own tragedy, yet cannot climb
high enough intellectually to turn himself into Fate and master his own
dilemma. Whence the sense of dismay, the darkness, the nihilism of so
many souls....The individual is no longer supported by those social
barriers that separated, but also sustained, that hindered him from
rising but also protected him from falling, and every day he finds
himself faced with the alternative of becoming either a master of the
world or the last rag of flesh that a blind force has seized to sweep
the streets. Something great is being born, he senses, but the immense
labor is twisting the social body with spasms of pain.

The perception of living in a crisis of civilization was fundamental in
the experience of modernity for the younger generation. "The collective
spirit," wrote Mussolini in 1903, "is not yet entirely formed and is torn
between the old and the new, between modern ideals and ancient beliefs."

 Mixing Marx and Nietzsche, the young revolutionary understood modernity
 above all as an age of the transmutation of values, a change that would
 lead, through socialism, to an overcoming of Christian civilization
 and the advent of a new pagan culture guided by the will to power
 "which unfolds in the creation of new values, whether moral, artistic,

the sunrise. He is above all a hymn to life--to life experienced with
all our energies in a continual tension that is striving to something

The problem of constructing a new civilization, even if not always
treated explicitly, was at the center of the debate about the nature of
modernity on the part of the avant-gardes, and it shaped their search
for a new ideal of <I>total life</I>, within which the search for a
new synthesis between nationalism and modernity began to assume special
importance. Italy, affirmed Croce, "will not be spiritually great if it
will not conquer its own religious conscience, which is at the same time
a philosophical conscience."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Young avant-gardists would have had little difficulty agreeing,
 though their understanding of what the new "religious conscience"
 would be differed sharply. In effect, as Prezzolini wrote in 1912,
 all "the younger generation of Italy" felt "that a vast and serious
 movement...could not be achieved except under some total form....It
 had to have depth, ethical or metaphysical or in a certain religious
 line...the movement had to be <I>total</I>, which is to say it had
 to speak to man, to the man of today, to the Italian of today." The
 intuition that "something great was being born"

<B></B>

gave a note of messianic expectation to the search for a new total vision
of life, a note that was evident in the demand for a <I>new religion</I>,
something that the avant-garde considered indispensable for enabling
the nation to continue its pursuit of the conquest of modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The search for a new secular religion was an essentially modern
phenomenon, and in no way represented a resurgent form of older
millenarianisms or eschatological visions typical of the premodern era
(see <I>NF</I>, 31). The demand sprang spontaneously, so to speak, from
the same enthusiastic experience of modernity, which, it is true, might
be assimilated to that state of "collective effervescence" that generates
religious states of mind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 In part it emerged from the typically modernist demand to formulate a
 response to the 'death of God,' but in part it constituted a polemical
 attack against rationalist political ideologies, understood as the
 theoretical systems of understanding and defining the course of
 history which had dominated the political culture of the nineteenth
 century. Pragmatism, the new idealism of Croce and Gentile, the various
 philosophies of life formulated in the wake of Nietzsche, united in
 giving prestige to the experience of faith in the life of individuals and
 collectivities. To the culture of the avant-garde, modernity, far from
 having decreed the definitive decline of religion before the radiant
 triumph of reason, was viewed as an epoch in which the force of faith
 would regain its vigor. The death of God was inaugurating a new era of
 religious searching.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 The problem of modernity, observed Croce in 1908, was above all a
 religious problem: "The entire contemporary world is searching for a
 religion," driven by the "need for an orientation concerning life and
 reality, the need for a concept of life and reality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 In this sense all the avant-garde movements that arose in Italy prior
 to fascism aspired to be religious movements, to elaborate a new sense
 of life and the world, to propagate it through modern myths for the
 education of the masses and their integration into the national State,
 to give them the collective conscience of the nation as a community of
 values and of destiny.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The religious problem, observed Antonio Anzilotti, a young historian
 who contributed to <I>La Voce</I>, was inherent in the very nature of
 modernity, an age that had begun with an affirmation of disbelief but
 now was setting off in search of a religious faith from which it could
 draw new energies for action: "only the religious sense of life, which
 identifies the realization of the common weal with the development of
 the better part of our personality, can give absolute value to each
 individual and collective act."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 One might define the entire experiment of <I>La Voce</I> as an attempt
 to give modernity a new religious faith, an idealistic soul. Though they
 appreciated economic and industrial progress, the intellectuals centered
 around <I>La Vove</I> understood the 'conquest of modernity' above all
 as an increased capacity for man to control his own destiny. And for
 them the search for a new faith was strictly connected with the myth of
 Italianism, with the ideal of a new Italy that would be a protagonist
 in world affairs. "Italy must be intellectually great, it must give life
 to a modern civilization," proclaimed Prezzolini, the review's editor.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 His faith in Italy was wholly shared by his colleagues, all firmly
 convinced that Italy was "a great nation, a nation pressed by the
 urgency of global competition, and it has declared that it will accept
 the struggle and hope in its

<B></B>

victory."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 The goal to which the Vocians looked was the regeneration of the
 Italian character that would form the "soul" of a new Italy. <I>La
 Voce</I> championed the model of a modern Italian, who would derive
 from his humanistic faith moral energy and a capacity to live within
 "the multiform life of his age," to feel "truly with a sense of stupor,
 anger, veneration, rage, and love--the life of today."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 The Italianism of <I>La Voce</I>, nevertheless, continued to coexist
 with a humanist and cosmopolitan vision that emphasized "an integral
 and humanistic education of man" as the basis for the formation of a
 modern Italian conscience, because "education is one thing alone, the
 education of <I>man</I>....One will not create good Italians if one
 has not first created good men."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The modernism of <I>La Voce</I> did not imply a rejection of history or
national tradition, but intended to avail itself of both as pedagogical
tools for the formation of the modern Italian. A religion, even a secular
and modern religion, had to have its own universe of myths and rites, just
as the modern nation of mass society could not do without myths by which
to educate the masses according to the principles and values of modern
humanism, the cultural and intellectual foundation of a new mass national
democracy. Only "by creating a myth for modern society, a catechism, a
clergy, will it be possible to realize practical democratic reform."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 History and tradition, for the Vocians, were sources on which to draw
 for constructing a secular mythology for the "modern religion," for
 forming the conscience of the modern Italian. Universal history could
 become "the true modern myth."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 And yet the Vocians did not agree at all about which religion should
 be the educational foundation of the modern Italian. Prezzolini and
 those who were most influenced by Croce and Gentile thought they would
 elaborate a religion of modern man upon the foundations of neo-idealist
 philosophy. Others, such as Giovanni Boine, believed "that it will be
 Catholicism that will restore religion to the world."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 It was this diversity of attitudes and ideals in their understanding
 of the religious need of modern man that prevented the Vocians from
 becoming a true and genuine movement, exponents of a total vision of
 life, of a new modern religion with myths, symbols, and rites. Others
 would soon fill the gap.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The militants of the nationalist movement were considerably more united
and decisive. They wished to institute "a religion of the nation" that
would integrate myths about the nation's past glories with myths of
modern greatness still to be conquered. As a model they took Japan,
which had completed a process of revolutionary modernization without
sacrificing its national tradition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Corradini also appealed to the experience of the French Revolution to
 invoke the institution of a "religion of the nation" as a spiritual
 force uniting the individual to the collecticity, perpetuating the sense
 of national identity across the successive generations through time
 (see <I>CL</I>, 23-30). The nation had to become the modern divinity
 of a new and secular religion that was to be propagated through the
 institution of rites and symbols, celebrating the cult of ancestry:
 "we have to create symbols that can enfold a collectivity, contain the
 masses, synthesize countless isolated cases of individual energies...the
 crowd, the collectivity, these must be the substitutes for the hero in
 the regime of today."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 The highest symbols of the "religion of the nation" in mass society
 were to be the monuments

<B></B>

realized not to celebrate an individual, but as an "expression of
collective and successive thought, of a social and national ideal." As
Morasso had already observed, in modern times the monumental presupposes
"the notion of collectivity, for it is made, to use a modern phrase, by
the public and for the public; only a people can quicken it into life,
and it is a people, or rather the soul of a people, that a monument must
contain and represent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 As an aesthetic model for the modern monument, Morasso proposed the
 machine, the collective creation of "countless energies disciplined
 and directed by strong discipline and an inflexible power to one goal;
 here one sees a true profusion of forces in search of the optimum and
 the enormous."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In modernist nationalism the aestheticization of politics stemmed directly
from the sacralization of politics, the process of institutionalizing
a secular religion necessary for the spiritual unity of a mass society
that wished to confront the challenges of modernity. The Futurists,
too, could easily have subscribed to this project of a "religion of
the nation," notwithstanding their very different attitude toward
history and tradition, poles apart from that of the Vocians and the
nationalists. Though they felt that the conquest of modernity required
the violent destruction of the nationalists' cult, they agreed with
them in wishing to place "Divina Italia" (Divine Italy) on the altar of
a secular religion, in glorifying the Italian race, and in endowing it
with an innate vocation for universal cultural preeminence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Boccioni was tormented at seeing "the brutish state in which the
 aesthetic ideals of our great country have fallen, even though we have
 40,000,000 inhabitants who are considered the most intelligent in the
 world." Yet he also firmly believed that "Italy is a young and strong
 country that will become great--period. In spiritual terms, everything
 has to be remade--and therefore, in aesthetic terms."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Futurism justified its furious iconoclasm of the past precisely on the
 grounds that it was necessary to proceed with a violent modernization of
 Italy, to launch it forward in the quest for new greatness. The Futurists
 argued they were "definitely at the head of world art," living proof
 that "the constructive Italian spirit is returning to dominance in the
 art of our age."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 The myth of Italianism was their religion, and to it they consistently
 remained faithful, regardless of whether their politcs oscillated
 between the right and the revolutionary left, even during the years

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the search for a secular religion for modern Italy, the modernist
avant-gardes inevitably entered into the realm of politics, where the
antagonism between differing ideals of modernity was more glaring and
their conflict unavoidable, for interest in the question spanned the
spectrum of Italian political and intellectual life. Croce, for example,
sought to create an Italian conscience that would be "not socialistic
and not imperialistic, but would reproduce in a new form that of the
Italian Risorgimento."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 His was a rational, liberal, bourgeois ideal of modernity that he
 considered fully capable of enabling Italy to address the challenges of
 modern life, guided by a parliamentary democracy, and from the century's
 beginning he had committed

<B></B>

himself to combatting the new mentality made up of mysticism, activism,
irrationalism, aestheticism, and imperialism, which he regarded as a
diseased and pathological form of modernity to be identified first with
decadence and later with fascism. But to most of the younger generation
the liberal and bourgeois ideal of modernity, transmitted by the founding
fathers of the national state, already seemed an inadequate model; and
within the culture of the avant-gardes, criticisms against Enlightenment,
rationalist, and individualist modernity were already widely diffused,
fed by the ideas of Nietzsche, Sorel, Pareto, and Croce himself. Yet this
widespread critique did not necessarily issue in anti-liberalism, and
many continued to search for other ways of integrating the new masses into
the nation and assuring the country of a system of government adapted to
guide it on its path through the vortex of modern life. Even the myth of
Italianism, which so conditioned the thought of the Italian avant-garde,
did not always issue in authoritarian nationalism. Futurism was typical in
this sense. From its origins it was averse to parliamentary democracy,
an attitude that was transformed into genuine political commitment
with interventionism and then, at the end of the Great War, with the
foundation of the Futurist Political Party. Though glorifying nationalism
and imperialism, Futurism retained a libertarian and cosmopolitan core,
and remained ready to favor radical social reforms providing they
were formulated with a recognition of the nation's preeminence. The
principal ideological motif of the Futurist political party during its
life from 1918 to 1920 remained the anarchistic utopia of a New State
governed by Futurist artists, where the maximum of individual liberty
and cultural cosmopolitanism would be reconciled with an intransigent
religion of the nation, with imperialism, and with a cult of violence and
the glorification of war as the impetus for a perpetually revolutionary
modernity, one that would impede the crystallization of traditionalist
inertia and make Italians live fully within the realm of modernity,
leading "an adventurous, energetic, and quotidianly heroic life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Within the circles surrounding <I>La Voce</I>, too, the predominant motif
 was one reconciling nationalism with cosmopolitanism, the freedom of the
 individual with the national state. The Vocians proposed a new national
 democracy, but their concept of democracy remained rather vague within
 the diversity of understandings of it that the journal proposed, though
 it is also true that the review sometimes supported concrete reforms
 such as universal suffrage, administrative decentralization, and free
 trade. The apparent contradiction was inherent in the composite nature
 of <I>La Voce</I>, made up of an empirical reformist current and a
 revolutionary idealist current that conceived of the new politics as
 having a missionary task to regenerate the character of the Italian
 people. <I>La Voce</I> dissolved before the outbreak of the Great
 War, but many of the Vocians entered politics in order to support,
 often on different grounds, Italian intervention. Many considered it
 the true and genuine test of modernity for the nation, the proof its
 ascent to the role of a great power. Only the nationalists such as
 Corradini and Morasso elaborated a genuinely authoritarian paradigm of
 modernity. Liberal democracy, in their view, was "in contradiction with
 the movement of modern life,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 because the very process of the development of mass democracy, both in

<B></B>

socialism and the expanding economy of capitalism, led to an affirmation
of "the primacy of force and the necessity of an ever vaster and deeper
dominion, renewing some of the characteristic conditions of the ancient
civilizations based on domination."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 The development of modernization, by the very nature of modernity in
 the age of imperialism, required new forms of authoritarianism for mass
 society: "Reappearing everywhere are oligarchic tendencies, military
 dominations, systems extolling strong aristocracies of leadership, a
 government that is absolute and energetic."
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Germany and Japan were seen as models for the Italian conquest of
 modernity in a new age of despotism by 'imperial civilization,' a
 direction in which all the great nation-states were headed, according
 to Morasso.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What in political terms the militant and authoritarian nationalists of
the avant-garde shared was their contestation of the "Giolitti system,"
which was viewed as a corrupting form of parliamentary dictatorship;
and an aspiration toward the construction of a New State by means of a
'<I>rivoluzione spirituale</I>' (mental revolution) meant to produce
a political revolution as well. In part this aspiration expressed a
generational revolt conducted under the banner of the myth of youth, youth
as a force revolutionary and regenerative in itself. All the movements
that contested the "Giolitti system," and the Futurists above all, shared
a belief in the myth of youth: the struggle of the healthy and vitalist
young against the corrupt and senescent old men was a necessary phase
in the conquest of modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 The young possessed particular regenerative qualities that gave them
 the attitudes and prerogatives suitable for a new ruling class capable
 of guiding the nation through the tempests of modernity. The old ruling
 class was a caretaker of the past; the new aristocracy was the vanguard
 of the new Italians who would be "builders of the future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 The young, whether of the right or the left, were convinced that
 they possessed the ethical values and moral qualities needed to bring
 about a mental revolution that would be the premise and condition of a
 political revolution, "radically changing the entire soul of man," as
 Papini proclaimed in 1913 when he was engaged in the Futurist campaign
 to prepare "in Italy the advent of this new man."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 The Futurists, wrote Boccioni around the same time, wanted to give Italy

...a conscience that would continually impel it to tenacious labor, to

joy of feeling that they can stand by themselves alone, armed, highly

have to take a stand, incite our own passion, drive to the limit our
own faith in our great future, that faith that every Italian feels in
his deepest self, yet doesn't sufficiently desire! There will have to

The myth of regenerative violence--through war or revolution--is part
of the cultural heritage of the modernist avant-garde. What sparked
the interventionism of many young intellectuals was the conviction that
Italy, in order to reach the state of modern greatness, would have to
pass through a bloody experience of war and give

<B></B>

its contribution to the creation of a new civilization. For Italy,
participation in the Great War was the entry "into the great history
of the world," as the philosopher Giovanni Gentile argued at the end of
the conflict.
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 Significantly, Marinetti preferred to use the term "conflagration" to
 define the Great War, alluding to the Heraclitean and Stoic myth of
 palingenesis by the great fire, from which, in this case, would rise
 a new and Futurist Italy. War, in the Futurist conception, was "the
 great and sacred law of life," it was the periodic "testing, bloody
 and necessary, of the force of the people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 Though with different motivations, a positive conception of war in
 the life of the nation was predominant throughout the new national
 culture. War was an integral part of the nationalist vision of
 modernity. Corradini defended the "modernity of war."
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 Already in 1905 Morasso, with a tragically prophetic spirit,
 had announced that "the nineteenth century was the century of a
 democratic-humanitarian utopia; the twentieth will be the century of
 force and conquest....It is in the new century that force will have
 its largest kingdom, and it is in the new century that we will see ever
 more formidable armies and ever more bloody wars."
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 Amendola attributed a moral significance to war, a collective test of
 discipline and sacrifice in which the character of the individual and
 the nation were tempered and tested.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
 Giovanni Boine idealized military discipline for its sense of hierarchy

 The New Italy was supposed to be shaped though a heroic pedagogy,
 created with a spirit of sacrifice, the exercise of discipline,
 readiness for combat, the sublimation of the individual in devotion
 to the collectivity. All these elements constituted a modernistic
 <I>national ethics</I>, borrowed from the "cult of the heroic," in "an

 Oliviero Olivetti wrote.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>

 The Futurists, not surprisingly, glorified Italy's participation in the
 Great War as the necessary rite of collective initiation into modernity,
 a violent acceleration of the process of modernization. "The war will
 develop gymnastics, sport, practical schools of agriculture, commerce,
 and industry. The war will reinvigorate Italy, enrich its men of action,

The outbreak of the Great War was, in a certain sense, both foreseen and
anticipated by the culture of the avant-garde. On the threshold of the war
Italy was in a state of messianic expectation of an incumbent catastrophe
that would be palingenetic, a catastrophe that the avant-gardes were
invoking in order to realize the mental revolution necessary to regenerate
the nation and bring it to the conquest of modernity. When war broke out
the majority of the militants of the avant-garde became active supporters
of intervention. "Reality is moving with an accelerated rhythm. We have
had the singular privilege of living at the most tragic hour in the

 So wrote Mussolini on 18 October 1914, announcing his conversion to
 the cause of interventionism. His choice cost him his expulsion from
 the Socialist part, but he was hailed by the cultural avant-gardes

 Futurist painter Carlo Carr&agrave;, "there is the drama of our entire

Setting aside the specific debates and conflicts that marked the relations
between Futurism and Fascism what constituted the principal cultural nexus
linking the culture of the avant-gardes and fascism was the search for
a symbiosis between art and life, culture and politics, nationalism and
modernity--a search enacted through the myth of Italianism. But there
were also a number of other features of fascist political culture that
connect it very directly with the culture of the modernist avant-gardes
in the early twentieth century, features that constituted essential
traits of fascist political modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Above all the activist conception of life within fascism was typically
modernist. That conception, as the newspaper for the Italian Battle Fasces
explained, meant "knowing how to understand the times that we live in, to
adapt oneself to the changed atmosphere, to the events that succeed one
another, that accumulate in the panting vortex of modern civilization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 This activism was inseparable from fascism's irrationalist conception of
 politics, which affirmed the priority of lived experience over ideology
 and <I>faith</I> over theory in the formation of a political culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>
 Fascism's anti-theoretical relativism and its institutional
 experimentalism were another modernist trait within fascism, in
 concordance with an existentialist intuition of politics, which was
 now understood in its immediate and vitalistic origins as "daring, as
 attempt, as undertaking, as dissatisfaction with reality, as adventure,
 as a celebration of the rite of action."
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>
 Typically modernist, moreover, was the affirmation of the primacy of
 mythic thought--in the sense articulated by Sorel--within a politics

Modernistic, too, was the mythic use of history and tradition, and
in particular the appeal to the heritage of Rome, an appeal that was
centainly one of the major motifs of fascism's polemics with Futurism,
which protested against the fascist cult of Rome and its encouragement
of classicizing sorts of realism in fascist art. Yet for fascism,
history--beginning with Roman history, above all--was not a temple in
which to contemplate

<B></B>

and nostalgically venerate the grandeur of remote glories, carefully
preserving the memories consecrated by archaeological remains. It was
an arsenal from which to draw myths of mobilization and legitimization
for political action. The archaeological recovery of Roman ruins was not
dissociated from this exigency of the mythic construction of fascism's
symbolic universe. The cult of Romanness, in this sense, was celebrated
modernisitically as a myth of action for the future:

is indispensable that the history of tomorrow, which we assuredly want to

The appeal to Romanness had the value of a mythic foundation for a
fascist politics looking to create a new civilization for the modern
age, one as solid and universal as the civilization of the Romans.
<SUP><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></SUP>
 Like Italians of the Renaissance, the fascists viewed Rome as a source of
 inspiration for civic virtues, a sense of the State, a sacralization of
 politics, and universal organizing values--all elements for elaborating a
 modern model of a new civilization. In this sense the cult of Romanness
 was reconciled, without notable contradiction, with other elements of
 fascism that were more strictly futurist, such as its activism, its cult
 of youth and sport, the heroic ideal of adventure, and above all the
 will to experience the new continually in action projected toward the
 future, without reactionary nostalgia for an ideal of past perfection
 to be restored. To be sure, there were also fascist intellectuals
 who idealized the harmony of the good old days, such as the writers
 associated with <I>Strapaese</I> and the artists who theorized a return
 to the classical order of Renaissance art. But the principal impulse
 of fascism stemmed from its "movementist" and Dionysian feeling for
 existence, from the <I>myth of the future</I>, and not from the static
 contemplation of the past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fascism had no nostalgia for a lost paradise to be reconstructed. It
never instituted a cult of tradition as the sublimation of the past in
a metaphysical vision of inviolable order, to be preserved whole, to be
segregated from the accelerated rhythm of modern life. Fascism recognized
tradition as "one of the great mental forces of peoples"; it was not
something "sacred, immutable, and untouchable," but a "successive and
constant creation of their soul."
<SUP><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></SUP>
 The past was supposed to be a "springboard of combat from which to
 launch into the future,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></SUP>
 and the fascists considered themselves, like the Futurists, to be
 "constructors of the future." The Italian created by Mussolini, in one
 novel by a Futurist writer, was depicted as a "modern barbarian...a
 modern man stretching out toward the future with spiritual tentacles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></SUP>
 From Futurism fascism had absorbed a dynamic feeling of modernity that
 was expressed in the ideal of "continual revolution," an ideal that
 impelled fascism never to rest content

<B></B>

with its accomplishments or even to guarantee its permanence in power with
a prudent politics of conservation, but to feel itself obliged,almost
condemned, to obey the command of its original essence and to project
itself into the future, towards new realities to be constructed. "We
are always 'tomorrow.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">93</a></SUP>
 Even fascists who glorified rural provincialism, as did the writers and
 artists of the journal <I>Il selvaggio</I>, proclaimed that they were
 not opposed to modernity, but that they wanted an "Italian modernity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fascist modernism sought to realize a new synthesis between tradition
and modernity, without renouncing modernization in order to realize the
nation's goals of power. Even though fascism exalted the ideal of <I>il
buon contadino</I> (the good peasant) still tied to the land and its
traditions, fascism was not anti-industrialist and it did not reject
technological progress; technology was an instrument of the modern
civilization that fascism could never renounce without being obliged to
renounce its ambitions to power. The progress of mechanized civilization,
said one writer in <I>Gerarchia</I> (the principal intellectual review
of the regime) was "the sign of the power of modernization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></SUP>
 To wish for the disappearance of the machine, warned the authoritative
 <I>Dictionary of Politics</I> of the Fascist Party, was "ingenuous
 and crazy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></SUP>
 The advance of machines was a feature of modern society that could not be
 halted because that would mean "to halt the very path of civilization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></SUP>
 The machine was an instrument for liberating man from the servitude of
 work, a weapon of conquest for the nation's will to power. To be sure,
 there were also elements of ambiguity in the fascist attitude toward
 modernity, elements that partly attenuated the modernist enthusiasm of
 early twentieth-century nationalism. A distinction within its vision
 of modernity was introduced between "sane" modernity and "perverse"
 modernity. Reversing Croce's understanding of modernity, the fascists
 pretended to be the artificers of sane modernity and the antagonists of
 that perverse modernity that stemmed from Enlightenment values of liberal
 reason. They had discovered a new "formula for modern society," capable
 of saving Western civilization from the degenerations of industrialism,
 mechanism, and urbanism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></SUP>
  This formula, however, imposed the renunciation of individualism and
  freedom, the cause of modernity's perverse effects, under the banner of
  the absolute primacy of the national collectivity as organized by the
  totalitarian state. Though it inherited many of the motifs and myths
  of modernist nationalism, fascism recomposed and adapted them in an
  original form of political modernism that wished to bring to completion
  the conquest of modernity through the totalitarian revolution. That
  revolution, like the mental revolution of the avant-gardes, was to be a
  total revolution, affecting every aspect of individual and collective
  life, from habits to character, in order to regenerate the nation,
  forge the new Italian, and construct a new society, subjugating the
  machine to the "service of man and the collectivity as an instrument
  of liberation, not as a source of misery."
<SUP><a NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">99</a></SUP>
 Italian modernity, as constructed by fascism, was to be a society of
 man, in which humanity would recover its dominion over the society of
 the machine. The totalitarian state and the sacralization of politics,
 integrating the masses into the nation through the faith, rituals, and
 symbols of fascist religion, were the foundations of a modern order that

<B></B>

would be capable of channelling and using all the energies of
modernization to the advantage of national power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the sacralization of politics and the institutionalization of the
cult of the fasces, fascism realized, in forms that were distinctively
its own, another aspiration of modernist nationalism, the construction
of a lay religion for the nation. Artists of Futurist provenance, such as
Sironi, architects who were exponents of modernistic rationalism, such as
Giuseppe Terragni and Giuseppe Pagano, promoters of experimental theater
such as Giulio Antonio Bragaglia, faithfully and passionately contributed
to the construction of the symbolic universe of fascist religion, helping
its myths and ideals to be represented to the masses and perpetuated
through time. The fascist aesthetic of the Futurists was consistent with
their conception of the political function of art and their faith in
the religion of the nation. Futurist art, within fascism, was supposed
to express the deep forces of the modern soul through "representative
symbols of the new religious spirit that will bind together this century
and from which nobody will escape, for it is universal and lasting."
<SUP><a NAME="REF100" HREF="#FOOT100">100</a></SUP>
 The adaptation of art to the political needs of the regime did not strike
 them as inconsistent with their principles, convinced as they were that
 art achieves greatness in history only when it becomes the means for the

For fascism the synthesis of politics, religion, and ethics, or Italian
modernity, was to be actualized in new political institutions, in a new
secular relighion, and in modernization serving the aggrandizement of
national power. Above all, however, it was to be actualized as a way
of living, a <I>stype of life</I>. Style was what defined the original
and universal essence of a society and what transmitted its greatness
to future eras. Fascist modernism pursued the original impulse of
the Futurists in its search for a new and original <I>modern Italian
style</I>, deliberately privileging modern art over traditionalist
classicism in accordance with Mussolini's own desire. Among fascist
artists it was perhaps Sironi, Mussolini's preferred painter, who knew
best how to interpret and represent the political-aesthetic ideal of
Italian modernity. Sironi believed that fascism was the most advanced
political expression of modernity itself, which he saw as an "epoch of
grandiose myths and gigantic upheavals."
<SUP><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></SUP>
 Fascist art, in all its manifestations, was to create the style of
 fascist modernity, to express the "complex orchestrations of modern
 life" and the "pagan and constructive primitiveness of the modern age."
<SUP><a NAME="REF104" HREF="#FOOT104">104</a></SUP>
 Sironi's modernism integrated art and politics in an affirmation of a
 collective will to power, and it linked the artist with the political
 experiment of the totalitarian state in the creation of a new religion
 of Italianness. The fascist artist had

<B></B>

a mission: with a modern sensibility, mythically to recall the great ages
of Italian art, seeking to realize a new creative greatness, a synthesis
between the classic and the modern, an epic transration of fascist
politics. Myths and symbols, as in the great religious art of the past,
were to impress "a new impulse on the popular soul."
<SUP><a NAME="REF105" HREF="#FOOT105">105</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The same ideal of integrating art and politics in the search for an
Italian modernity inspired the modernist poetics of Massimo Bontempelli,
a former Futurist militant like Sironi and organizer of the movement
<I>Novecento</I>. In his view, the new art of fascism would harmonize
with modernity, an era he saw as "an age of activity and conquest," or
one "avid of conquest," by inventing "the myths and stories necessary
for new times."
<SUP><a NAME="REF106" HREF="#FOOT106">106</a></SUP>
 Bontempelli believed in the coming of a "Third Age" of humanity in
 which it would be the task of Italian artists, "the primordial people
 of a new era, to discover and create new myths, new stories that will
 nurture the youth of the Third Age."
<SUP><a NAME="REF107" HREF="#FOOT107">107</a></SUP>
 Through an aesthetic of "magical realism" they would give the future
 an intuition of modern life, "as an adventurous miracle: continuous
 risk and continuous effort to get through it safely," even at its
 "most normal and quotidian."
<SUP><a NAME="REF108" HREF="#FOOT108">108</a></SUP>
 Even Bontempelli's modernism was wedded to the religion founded on the
 myth of "Italianism." Italy's cultural preeminence was "irrefutable";
 she was unique among the nations because "alive with an eternal spirit"
 that from one age to another renewed "her office of instigator of
 civilization," a spirit that now, after the Great War, had returned
 and assumed the task of creating the myths of modern society.

Intellectuals and artists of this sort, who had been active in the
modernist avant-garde and Futurism, enthusiastically participated
in fascism and contributed to elaborating its cultural politics and
its aesthetic style. In it they saw a political weapon for realizing
the avant-gardist myth of <I>total revolution</I>, understood as an
intellectual and spiritual revolution that was supposed to modify the
essence and values of life, giving rise to a new art, a new style of
life, a new man. They participated in fascism, it must be emphasized,
rather than simply adhering to it. For the involvement of Futurism in
fascism was not simply an external act of joining a political movement,
but an active and self-aware collaboration in elaborating the movement's
culture and political style, that went as far as a substantial agreemnent
between avant-garde culture and totalitarian political culture regarding
certain fundamental themes. In fact the Futurists, in arguing for a
Futurist paternity for fascism, stressed those elements that could
easily be integrated into totalitarian culture: from the religion of
<I>Italianismo</I> (Italianness) to the search for an Italian modernity,
to the heroicization of life and the glorification of war.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After the failure of the experience with a Futurist political party in
1920, Futurist politics, as captained by Marinetti, swiftly renounced
the libertarian motifs of its ideology and the utopia of Futurist
democracy. With the advent of fascism to power, Marinetti and the
Futurists returned to fascism with a de facto acceptance of its
politics as the "minimal program" of the Futurist revolution. Perhaps
they also trusted that fascism, once it had consolidated and developed
its totalitarian politics, would gradually surpass or set aside some
of the more conservative and reactionary forms dictated by political
contingency, slowly approaching the "maximal program" of the

<B></B>

Fururist revolution. With their artificial optimism, the Futurists
struggled to accelerate this process within the regime, voluntarily
collaborating in the political culture of the totalitarian state and
the construction of fascist religion's sxymbolic universe. Moreover,
the return was also accompanied by a change in the Futurist vision of
modernity, a transformation that rendered it much closer to fascism's own,
with its distinction between a sane and a perverse modernity. Sharply
attenuating the modernist enthusiasm that had marked the early years
of the twentieth century, it largely abandoned the goals of radical and
total renovation of human existence in a libertarian and individualistic
sense, while increasingly it exalted the myths of bellicose, imperialist
nationalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF110" HREF="#FOOT110">110</a></SUP>
 In effect its tragic sense of existence as an unredeemable reality gained
 the upper hand over its enthusiasm for modernity, which now appeared
 to the Futurists in the perverse forms of "bureaucratic cancer" and
 the mucification of society through new forms of conformism. Even the
 fascist state was affected by these perverse forms of modernity, which
 rendered it all the more remote from the New State originally dreamt
 of by Futurism. From this point of view one can indeed maintain that
 the original matrix of Futurism largely faded away under the fascist
 regime. The Futurists, however, were not obliged to make a serious
 sacrifice of their theoretical coherency in order to participate
 with renewed enthusiasm in the cultural politics of the totalitarian
 state. They had, after all, always proclaimed that the religion of the
 nation was to prevail over the principle of freedom. The essence of
 Futurist freedom was not political freedom, but the creative freedom
 of genius, a sort that could easily adapt itself to living within a
 regime that never pretended to impose aesthetic conformism and that
 glorified politics as the art of shaping the masses, calling upon
 artists to collaborate in the task of forging the new Italian. To be
 sure, the fascist new man, regimented in the organizations of the
 regime and educated according to the rigid rules of discipline and
 military uniformity, was a "mass-Italian" that departed significantly
 from the Futurist ideal of the "unique--type Italian." But the Futurists
 ignored this discordance of ideals, accepting the fascist revolution as
 an initial phase toward the realization of the Futurist revolution. As
 Marinetti had announced in 1920

The Futurists were restless fascists and disagreed with some of the
regime's political and cultural decisions. None of them, however, ever
questioned the fundamental motifs of the totalitarian state: the primacy
of mythical thought, the vitalist realism, the mystical exaltation
of national community, the heroic and warlike pedagogy, the imperial
ambitions, or the myth of the Italian nation as the vanguard of a new
society. The Futurists were neither deceived nor misled by fascism; they
were fascinated by its appeal for the total mobilization of culture to
regenerate Italians in a religious cult of the nation and to construct
a new society that would leave its mark upon the future in the style of
'Italian modernity.' No Futurist believed that Fascism harbored the
intention of realizing a world of reason, freedom, equality, or peace.

l'uomo moderno vive senza la fede passata e senza una fede presente e
spesso senza neppure la fede in una fede futura. Destinato a preparare
una civilt&agrave; nuova, si sente sacrificato, senza neppure assurgere
alla coscienza di questo sacrificio, che potrebbe renderlo grande. Vive
spesso la sua tragedia, senza salire tant'alto con lo spirito da farsi
lui Fato e dominare il proprio intreccio. Di qui lo sgomento, la nerezza,
il nichilismo di tante anime.... L'individuo non &egrave; pi&ugrave;
retto da dighe sociali che separavano, ma sostenevano, che impedivano il
salire ma non permettevano il cadere, ed &egrave; ogni giorno davanti
all'alternativa di diventare padrone del mondo o l'ultimo straccio di
carne che una forza cieca afferri per ripulire le vie. Si sente che
qualche cosa di grande &egrave; in gestazione, ma l'immenso sforzo torce

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1917, four years after the appearance of Luigi Russolo's Futurist
manifesto "The Art of Noises," and eight years after F. T. Marinetti's
founding manifesto, the ultra-conservative German composer Hans Pfitzner
published a passionate, polemical essay entitled <I>Futuristengefahr</I>
(Danger of Futurists),
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 directed not at the Italian Futurists but at the recently published
 second edition of Ferruccio Busoni's <I>Sketch for a New Aesthetic
 of Music</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Pfitzner, deeply disturbed by the eminent composer's vision of a freer
 music to come that would finally realize the art's full--but as yet
 unattained--potential, took it as an unwarranted attack on the glorious
 achievements of music's past, with only vague and uncertain proposals
 for its future offered in return.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Shortly afterwards, in a brief reply, Busoni remarked that Pfitzner's
title alone led the reader astray, "heaping on my name...all the
weaknesses and faults with which you could possibly reproach a certain
group of people--a group from which I am far removed. The word 'Futurism'
is not used on any page of my little book. I have never attached myself
to a

<B></B>

sect--Futurism, a movement of the present time, could have no connection
with my arguments."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Strictly speaking, Busoni was right: the first edition of his essay had
appeared in 1906, three years before Marinetti's first manifesto. Though
it had originally had a small and limited circulation, attracting little
attention even within the musical community, the somewhat enlarged 1916
edition to which Pfitzner responded was widely circulated and heatedly
discussed; and by then the Futurist movement was firmly established,
already near the end of its first and most productive phase. Busoni
moreover had specific contacts with Futurism. He responded publicly
to an unsigned 1912 Futurist music manifesto published in a Parisian
newspaper, expressing approval of its positions and even claiming priority
in advocating microtonal scale divisions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 He also had ties with Marinetti and the Futurist painter Umberto
 Boccioni, whose wellknown painting <I>La citt&agrave; che sale</I>
 (The city rises) he purchased in 1912 and who subsequently became
 a close personal friend. Shortly before his death in 1916, Boccioni
 vacationed with Busoni and his wife at their summer villa near Lake
 Maggiore while on leave from the Italian army. It was here that he
 painted his fine full-length portrait of the composer, one of his last
 and most impressive works.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 After Boccioni's death the grief-stricken composer wrote a moving
 tribute to the young painter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even if Pfitzner was unaware of these connections, the content of the <I>New Aesthetic</I> alone would have been sufficient to trigger associations
with Futurism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Despite a calm and reasoned manner, the essay is decidedly inflammatory
 in devaluing the art's past and extolling its future, vigorously
 asserting music's need to break away from inherited shackles--its
 restricted tonal system, exhausted forms, and outmoded instruments. Even
 such towering res of the past as Bach and Beethoven are considered
 only beginnings rather than "unsurpassable finalities."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pfitzner responded sharply, even contemptuously: "Busoni places all his
hopes for Western music in the future and understands the present and
past as a faltering beginning, as the preparation. But what if it were
otherwise? What if we find ourselves presently at a high point, or even
that we have already passed beyond it?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 For Pfitzner, the idea that one should discard the past for an entirely
 new, unproven world of artistic expression and technical experimentation
 was both incomprehensible and inimical to all he stood for. His title,
 invoking guilt by association, simply castigates Busoni by linking him
 with the most recent, extreme, and ideologically colored manifestation
 of his own position: the Italian Futurist movement.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Busoni-Pfitzner controversy reminds us that the moment of Italian
Futurism, its first and most productive phase (roughly 1909 to 1916),
was part of a more encompassing "Futurist moment," in Renato Poggioli's
phrase: "a significant symptom of a broader and deeper state of mind."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 In one of the most brilliant of his publicity-conscious maneuvers,
 Marinetti drew upon the widespread future-orientation of the time
 to give the movement its name. Yet that "deeper state of mind," the
 larger Futurist context, is critical for understanding the movement;
 and nowhere is this more so than in Futurist music.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many, if not all, of the principal ideas associated with Futurism, as
well as the larger Futurist moment, developed and intensified over a
long period, going back at least to the early years of the nineteenth
century. That century's belief in progress, focussing attention toward
the future, was first and foremost tied to achievements in science,
industry, and technology; but it was no less critical for the arts,
including music. Robert Schumann, writing in 1835 in the journal <I>Neue
Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Musik</I>, which he had founded in the previous
year, treats the current period (his "recent past") as a tawdry moment
separating a lustrous former age from a beckoning future:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Our attitude runs as follows: to recall the past and its music with all
the energy at our disposal, drawing attention to the ways in which new
artistic beauties can find sustenance at a source so pure, then to take
up arms against the recent past as an age inimical to are...and finally
to prepare for and help expedite the advent of a new poetic age.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Schumann's view was sharpened by his successor Franz Brendel, who
invoked the forces of historical evolution in order to support the
progressive tendencies of the Wagnerian New German School against the
more traditionally aligned Brahms-oriented composers that were associated
with the critic Eduard Hanslick. But the most vehemently future-directed
nineteenth-century musical re was Wagner himself, who in 1849 titled
one of his major theoretical studies <I>Das Kunstwerk der Zukunft</I> (The
artwork of the future), and who wasted no occasion to rail against all
music of the past that in his view failed to point forward toward his own.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This Futurist orientation was fueled by a widespread belief among
progressive composers that the language of Western music, its tonal
system and formal conventions, was reaching a state of exhaustion and
thus required constant expansion and renewal. This fostered a growing
sense of crisis, reaching a climax shortly after the turn of the century
as composers pushed musical language to the outer edges of traditional
tonality. Busoni's <I>New Aesthetic</I>, appearing at this moment of
crisis, stands poised between two worlds: its radically conceived pleas
for innovation are rooted in aesthetic assumptions inherited from the
past. Innovation is required because music must be renewed to retain its
"spiritual," otherworldly essence, an essence defined by the literary
and philosophical representatives of musical romanticism (notably
Wackenroder, Tieck, Hoffmann, and Schopenhauer) and then echoes by such
nineteenth-century composer-writers as Schumann, Liszt, and Wagner. Far
from rejecting the romantic conception of music as a world apart, Busoni,
caught in the crisis of musical language, simply refashioned it as a
yet-to-be-attained goal, achievable only by escaping the limitations of
music's past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Near the very beginning of his essay, Busoni notes that music can achieve
its full potential only in acknowledging "its untrammeled immateriality":

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Young as it is, this child [music]...possesses one radiant attribute
which signalizes it beyond all its elder sisters [the other arts]. And
the lawgivers will not see this marvelous

<B></B>

attribute, lest their laws should be thrown to the winds. This
child--<I>it floats on air!</I> It touches not the earth with its feet. It
knows no law of gravitation. It is wellnigh incorporeal. Its material
is transparent. It is sonorous air. It is almost Nature herself. It
is-- free.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This mirrors the dominant line of nineteenth-century aesthetics, which
privileged music first among the arts due to its lack of association
with the material world. "No other art," wrote Wackenroder, "has a
basic material <I>[Grundstoff]</I> in itself already so impregnated with
heavenly spirit."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Shielded from material existence, music offered a language transcending
 ordinary meaning. Wackenroder, likening it to "the language of angels,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 believed it could speak the unspeakable, communicate fundamental
 metaphysical truths beyond the grasp of mere words and reason. Busoni's
 views are strikingly similar. What is new is the belief that music's
 current technical and spiritual impasse (and for Busoni the two are
 inseparable) requires the composer to reach beyond its traditional
 materials and syntax. Only then can music win its freedom and realize
 its true nature.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A sizable proportion of Busoni's essay is thus devoted to presenting new
technical possibilities, music's only hope if it is not to be grounded
in a morass of outworn formulas and clich&eacute;s. Discussing harmony,
he urges composers to move forward: "for all signs presage a revolution,
and a next step toward that 'eternal harmony.' Let us once again call to
mind that in this latter the gradation of the octave is <I>infinite</I>,
and let us strive to draw a little nearer to infinitude." The recommended
step is thus additional (microtonal) divisions of the octave, since the
current "system of tone, key, and tonality, taken in its entirety, is
only a part of a fraction of one diffracted ray from that Sun, 'Music,'
in the empyrean of the 'eternal harmony.'"

Perhaps most novel is Busoni's suggestion that if music is to
acquire richer sonic and expressive power, it must abandon traditional
instruments. He reports enthusiastically on an invention by the American
Thaddeus Cahill, the "Dynamophone," which, through transformations of
electrical current, allows for infinitely small and mathematically exact
pitch variations. Contemplating these possibilities, Busoni approaches
a state of rapture:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And what a vista of fair hopes and dreamlike fancies is thus opened...Who
has not dreamt that he could float on air? and firmly believed his
dream to be reality?--Let us take thought, how music may be restored
to its primitive natural essence; let us free it from architectonic,
acoustic and aesthetic dogmas; let it be pure invention and sentiment,
in harmonies, in forms, in tone-colors...let it follow the line of the
rainbow and vie with the clouds in breaking sunbeams....

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet for all its utopian tone and pleas for renewal through technical
experimentation and innovation, the <I>New Aesthetic</I> had little effect
on Busoni's own compositions. Purely theoretical and speculative, it is
an early instance of that separation of musical thought and practice so
characteristic of the twentieth century.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A sense of crisis was of course no less evident in the other arts. The
appearance around the turn of the century of so many different movements
espousing new artistic aims, usually with revolutionary intent, reflected
a general feeling of malaise. Those centered on the visual arts, such
as Die Br&uuml;cke, Der blaue Reiter, fauvism, and cubism, responded
to the breakdown of the traditional syntax of objective representation,
a development that corresponded to, and temporally coincided with, the
dissolution of traditional tonality and its concomitant formal conventions
in music. What set Futurism off from these others was in part its unique
ability to master and manipulate the resources of mass communication,
especially newspapers, to promote its artistic principles and (largely
totalitarian) political program. But more significantly, it differed
in not associating itself so exclusively with a particular aesthetic
or technical orientation (a tendency reflected in the names of such
movements as symbolism, cubism, and Vorticism). It allied itself first
and foremost with the "future" itself, and thus opposed itself to the
past. The Futurist manifestos, stressing creation ex nihilo, proposed a
total rejection of tradition--a desire "to mock everything consecrated
by time," as Marinetti put it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 The movement thus seemed to epitomize more fully than any other the
 revolutionary spirit of the age.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To be sure, the Futurists advocated specific artistic approaches
for achieving their ends, setting them forth in the various technical
manifestos issued as sequels to the more general, ideologically focussed
initial ones. But while the tone and visual layout of their proposals were
new and arresting, the content was not so distant from what had already
been advocated by the movement's various predecessors. The appeals of
the two main statements on painting, for example, the 1910 "Futurist
Painting: Technical Manifesto" and the catalogue introduction for the
1912 Futurist exhibition in Paris ("The Exhibitors to the Public"), were
by no means unprecedented:
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 that painting deal with modern subjects in modern dress; that it present
 "the simultaneousness of states of mind"; that the spectator be located
 in the center of the picture; that the painter "carry within himself
 the landscapes" intended for depiction on canvas; that imitation be
 rejected; that objects interpenetrate one another; that the tendency
 toward the "infinite" be revealed through "force-lines."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though expressed with remarkable energy and revolutionary fervor, these
ideas are to a marked degree derived from the artistic and theoretical
contributions of symbolism, impressionism, post-impression, cubism,
fauvism, and German expressionism. New, however, is the emphasis on
symbols of "victorious science" and technology: airplanes, high-speed
automobiles, motorcycles, trams, railroad trains, etc.-- references that
lend the manifestos a palpably hard edge, sharpened by suggestions
of violence, destruction, and danger (most egregiously so in the
glorification of war).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These technical suggestions are all ultimately directed toward a more
encompassing project: the sanctification of modern life as an embodiment
of "universal dynamism." Here again one finds precedents, as much art
of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century concerned itself with
ideas of motion and transience--for example the impressionists' interest
in spontaneity, in capturing moments of passing,

<B></B>

in abruptly juxtaposing vibrating colors that had to be actively
recombined by the viewer at a distance. The critic F&eacute;lix
F&eacute;n&eacute;on, writing in 1886, described these developments in
terms strongly anticipating those employed of the Futurists: "From the
beginning, the impressionist painters, from a concern for truth that
made them limit themselves to the interpretation of directly observed
modern life and to landscape painted directly from nature, had seen
objects as interdependent, without chromatic autonomy, sharing luminous
characteristics with their neighbors."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Indeed, by the end of the nineteenth century the idea that flux and change
were characteristic attributes of modern life had become commonplace. When
Baudelaire, writing in 1863 on the relationships between modern painting
and modern life, described modernity as "the transitory, the fugitive,
the contingent," he already grasped the age not simply as something new
but as a state of instability, propelled by change and dynamic energy
(although he continues: this is "the half of art whose other half is
the eternal and the immutable").
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Marx similarly stressed transience in his famous maxim: "all that is
 solid melts into air."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 But the roots go back to post-Kantian German idealist philosophy,
 to Fichte and Schelling, and from there to Schopenhauer and Hegel,
 eventually surfacing with renewed vigor at the turn of the century
 in Bergson. However different in other respects, these thinkers all
 comprehended reality as a process of transformation and evolution.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such notions of the mutability and impermanence of reality led
nineteenth-century thinkers to embrace music as an ideal medium for
conveying fundamental truths. Music's lack of materiality--its "floating
on air," in Busoni's phrase, free from attachments with the external
world--made it the "transcendent" art par excellence. It was accorded the
highest position among the arts--a remarkably swift ascent considering
its lowly status during the eighteenth century (all the more so since
at the time its subservience stemmed from exactly those qualities that
later brought it preeminence). Pater's oft-cited phrase that all art
"aspires to the condition of music" is but one of countless such paeans
voiced by artists and writers throughout the century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Music was thrust forward as a model for all the arts. Unburdened by
 words or literal representations, it communicated a purely symbolic
 meaning (and only in that evasive, nonliteral sense characteristic of
 the nineteenth century) through an autonomous language of pure form
 based on its own internal relationships; and it offered an ideal escape
 from the increasing materialism of modern life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If music supplied a key to otherwise hidden truths, however, it
did so in large measure because it was able to project a sense of
pure motion: it was itself in a state of constant transformation,
always becoming something other than it was, directed toward the
future. And this meant, paradoxically, that it was equally suited to
evoke those qualities of transience and dynamism associated with the
modern. Baudelaire, in discussing correspondences among the arts in
his essay on <I>Tannh&auml;user</I>, neatly linked the attributes of
immateriality and flux when he described his reactions to

<B></B>

Wagner's music: "I imagined the idea of a soul moving in a luminous
environment, of an ecstasy of voluptuousness and knowledge, floating
above and beyond the natural world."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nineteenth-century composers, responding to such notions of unrestricted
movement, began to feel hampered by the more solid, articulated musical
forms inherited from the previous century. Such forms treated music
"spatially," carving it up into well-defined units joined together in
cohesive, architectonic groups. Composers accordingly began to rethink
musical structure in terms better suited to an image of reality as
flux. Forms became more ambiguous, more unstable, in a state of permanent
development--an idea quite foreign to eighteenth-century composers,
for whom stability and instability were joined in an unmistakable,
if delicate, balance. Wagner perfectly expressed the tendency toward
fluidity when he described his music as "an art of transition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 And the idea is still fully alive in Busoni's remark in the <I>New
 Aesthetic</I>: "all composers have drawn nearest the true nature of music
 in preparatory and intermediary passages (preludes and transitions)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I have discussed elsewhere how the Romantic idea of music as a language of
pure form and motion encouraged nineteenth-century composers to undermine
the conventional tonal syntax inherited from the eighteenth century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 If music was to be truly free, it had to unburden itself of the
 constraints imposed by received conventions. The collapse of traditional
 tonality, so closely allied with modernism, evident in both the
 "neotonal" leanings of Debussy, Stravinsky, and Bart&oacute;k and the
 atonal ones of Schoenberg, was the seemingly inevitable consequence
 of the Romantic idea of music's autonomy, of an art sheltered from
 all worldly involvement, including ultimately even a shared--and thus
 socially constituted--musical language.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The aesthetic orientation fostering music's preeminence had important
consequences for the other arts. In literature it encouraged efforts
to purge words of their ordinary meanings, often to the extent of
conferring upon them a purely sonic value devoid of literal references,
an idea that found typically drastic expression in Marinetti's <I>parole
in libert&agrave;</I>, his "words set free" from syntax, punctuation,
linear placement on the page, "stupid formulas," and "the logical canal
of syntax." This "unchained lyricism" would--and here one hears distinct
echoes from the aesthetics of musical romanticism--"bring us to the
essence of material."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The influence of the aesthetics of autonomous music is perhaps most
clearly recognizable in the visual arts, especially in painting's break
with objective representation as it approached pure abstraction around
1912. The "language" of nineteenth-century painting was--like that
of music (but unlike literature)--an artificial one; and it too was
tied to "syntactical" conventions, in this case those of perspectival
representation. Hence the prevalent idea that painting should become
more like music, an autonomous pictorial language of pure colors and
form, and that it should do so by renouncing all ties to external reality
and objective representation. As early as 1908 the German art historian
Wilhelm Worringer argued "the presupposition that the work of art, as
an autonomous organism, stands beside nature on equal terms and, in its
deepest and innermost essence, devoid of any connection with it, insofar

<B></B>

as by nature is understood the visible surface of things."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The English critic and painter Roger Fry, writing two years later about
 C&eacute;zanne, mentioned "a new courage to attempt in painting that
 direct expression of imagined states of consciousness which has for
 long been relegated to music and poetry," and a year afterwards added
 that C&eacute;zanne had "recovered for modern art a whole lost language
 of form and color."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 These views reflected the more general belief, fundamental to the whole
 modernist enterprise, that each art should develop its own immanent
 language, fashioned from its own intrinsic properties and value--a belief
 that, paradoxically, as often as not was felt to make these arts more
 like music.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many painters were consciously aware of their debt to music. Indeed,
most of those associated with abstractionism's earliest phase, whether
in the Germanic, expressionistic line, like Wassily Kandinsky (then
resident in Munich), or in the French cubist line, like Robert Delaunay
and the Paris-based Franti&#157;sek Kupka, described their work in
musical terms. Kandinsky, who often gave his paintings musical titles,
such as <I>Composition</I> or <I>Improvisation</I>, remarks in a letter
written to Schoenberg in 1911: "I am certain that our own modern harmony
[i.e., that of painters] is not to be found in the 'geometric' way,
but rather in the anti-geometric, anti-logical way. This way is that
of 'dissonances' in art...in painting, therefore, just as much as in
music." A few months later he adds: "How immensely fortunate (though
only relatively!) musicians are in their highly advanced art, truly
an art which has already had the good fortune to forego completely all
purely practical aims. How long will painting have to wait for this?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Delaunay, writing to Kandinsky in 1912, notes that his new "laws" were
 "based on studies in the transparency of color, whose similarity to
 musical notes drove me to discover the 'movement of color.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kupka seems to be an exception, for in his <I>Cr&eacute;ation dans
les arts plastiques</I>, completed in 1913 (not published until 1923),
he remarks:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It would be better to treat with greater circumspection than hitherto
the analogies ...between colors and sounds....The fact is that a piece
of music suggests different images to each of its listeners....In other
words, chromaticism in music and the musicality of colors are of value
only as metaphors. Such a shame...yet another illusion goes up in smoke.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Kupka is referring here to specific analogies between sound and color
(about which he is no doubt correct), not to a more general analogy
between the formal languages of music and abstract art. Moreover,
he himself gave a musical title to the first purely abstract work he
exhibited, <I>Amorpha, Fugue in Two Color</I> ; and shortly before
its appearance, he was, as he acknowledged, intensely preoccupied with
the  music of J. S. Bach.

I have taken this excursion to be in a better position to understand
the particular conception of music that developed within the Futurist
camp. Consistent with the modernist

<B></B>

tradition just sketched, Futurist painters also were prone to emphasize
the "musicality" of their work. In the 1912 catalogue essay for the
Paris exhibition, the Futurist idea of "painting of states of mind" is
explained through a comparison "drawn from the evolution of music":

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And there are references to prolongations of the rhythms, and to "spots,
lines, zones of color...which, in accordance with a law of our interior
mathematics, musically prepare and enhance the emotion of the spectator."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 By the time this essay appeared, however, music had already assumed
 an explicit role within the Futurist project. This is of considerable
 interest, since, despite the symbolic importance music enjoyed in
 the development of both literary and visual modernism, almost none
 of the major avant-garde movements before Futurism had incorporated a
 specifically musical component.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Yet the Futurists, with their genius for defining ideas in terms equally
 applicable to all the arts, quickly accepted it as a central part of
 the movement's aesthetic platforms and artistic activities.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first indication was Balilla Pratella's 1910 "Manifesto of Futurist
Musicians."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Pratella was a talented and relatively successful composer of thirty,
 but by no means a progressive one measured within international
 musical circles; and by Futurist standards his initial manifesto is
 disappointing. It decries the "shame and filth" of Italy's musical past,
 and "the intellectual mediocrity, commercial baseness and misoneism"
 that make current Italian music inferior to that of other countries. But
 it provides only generalities in response: the need "to proclaim the
 unique concept of Futurist music, as absolutely different from music
 to date, and so to shape in Italy a Futurist musical taste, destroying
 doctrinaire, academic and soporific values."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pratella's "Technical Manifesto of Futurist Music," issued the following
year, offers a more concrete idea of how a Futurist music might be
developed: melody and harmony should be conceived as a single element;
traditional scales and modes should be rejected for the chromatic scale;
tempered scales, including the chromatic, should eventually give way
to microtonal scales; traditional meter should be expanded to encompass
combinations of all meters and rhythms; and the orchestra should become
"a sonorous universe in a state of constant mobility."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 While none of this goes beyond Busoni, a final passage, apparently
 written by Marinetti and added at his insistence, more faithfully
 reflects the tone of the movement as a whole:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
All forces of nature, tamed by man through his continued scientific
discoveries, must find their reflection in composition--the musical soul
of the crowds, of great industrial plants, of trains, of transatlantic
liners, of armored warships, of automobiles, or airplanes. This will
unite the great central motives of a musical poem with the power of the
machine and the victorious reign of electricity.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pratella's compositions of this period, including his <I>Musica
futuristica</I> of 1912, offer little indication that he followed his
own advice (again reminding us of Busoni). Though competently written,
they are remarkably tame. Here the frequent objection of Futurism's
critics--that the movement's true interest lies in its manifestos, and
is thus more theoretical than artistic in nature (unless one sees the
whole movement, as have some, as "performance art")--seems justified.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pratella's manifestos nevertheless had a critical role. They were read by
the Futurist painter Luigi Russolo, who, taking them seriously, succeeded
in imagining a truly Futurist music. Russolo was an artist of some
significance--he was one of the five signatories of the two Futurist
painting manifestos and the Paris exhibition essay --and his career
effectively illustrates the importance that musical thinking, in both
its literal and metaphorical sense, played within the movement. Indeed,
the re
of Russolo as theorist-musician is fully comprehensible only in relation
to his work
as a painter.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
<!--_a-head-->

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of the five painters who signed the Futurist painting manifestos,
Russolo had the most short-lived reputation. He nevertheless held a
privileged place in the early stages of the movement, exhibiting actively
with Boccioni and the others. His earliest extant paintings, such as
<I>Profumo</I> (Perfume), which dates from 1910 (earlier works were
apparently destroyed by the artist), are relatively conservative, with
a decided art nouveau flavor; yet they show a fascination with creating
impressions of motion on two-dimensional surfaces. <I>Profumo</I> depicts
a woman's head in profile, enveloped in swirling linear movements that
extend the swirls of her hair. Interest
in dynamism becomes more explicit in <I>Riassunto dei movimenti di una
donna</I> (Synopsis of a woman's movements) of 1912, whose title re
appears to execute a turn suggested through blurred and overlapping
multiple images (a technique much favored by Boccioni at the time),
arranged in a circular pattern.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Particularly revealing, given the artist's later turn to music, is
the slightly earlier <I>La Musica</I> (Music; 1911-12), a canvas over
seven feet in height depicting a multihanded pianist, positioned near
the bottom and playing on an oversized keyboard, out of which a massive,
snake-like arabesque rises upwards in a turning motion. Interacting with
this shape, numerous mask-like faces seem to move toward the surface
of the canvas as the endpoints of columnar projections thrusting toward
the center from various locations. Russolo's own discussion is telling:
"In this picture the painter has attempted to translate into painting
the melodic, rhythmic, harmonic, polyphonic, and chromatic impressions
that comprise the totality of a musical experience."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Here there is no doubt of a conscious effort to translate musical
 effects into painterly ones.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given this interest, and the ties binding music to nonrepresentational
painting, it is not surprising that Russolo was attracted to pure
abstraction. His <I>Automobile in corsa</I> (Speeding automobile) of
1913, though still containing a distorted, if identifiable,

<B></B>

car-like shape, is largely dominated by continuous, brightly colored
abstract wedges forming a dynamic leftward thrust. Finally, <I>Le case
continuano in cielo</I> (The houses continue into the sky), dating from
the same year, is entirely abstract, projecting motion through geometrical
shapes that extend both upward and outward in space, encircling one
another. A painting of considerable character and originality, it has
been termed Russolo's "masterpiece."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet it was nevertheless his last painting. Thereafter, as if fearing
that his search for an autonomous pictorial language had reached a point
of termination, Russolo gave up painting and turned to music. The first
evidence was the pamphlet <I>l'Arte dei rumori</I> (The art of noises),
published by the Direzione del Movimento Futurista in Milan in March
1913. This remarkable document offers a fundamentally new conception of
the kinds of sounds appropriate to music and, no less significant, of
music's relationship to its physical and human environment. It proposed,
in short, no less than a reformulation of what music should be.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though Russolo begins by describing his ideas as "a logical consequence"
of Pratella's, what follows reveals fundamental differences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Pratella, echoing Busoni, understood the expansion of musical resources
 as an extension, rather than rejection, of the essential sonic and
 organizational structures of Western music. Pure pitched sound is
 retained, but extended microtonally beyond the twelve-tone chromatic
 scale; and metrical rhythm is retained, but redefined as a complex
 network encompassing all possible meters.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russolo's proposals are far more drastic. After sketching the evolution
of Western music from the Greeks to the present, he notes that, despite
all change and diversity, this music has always remained tied to pitched
sounds associated specifically with music. He continues:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
This limited circle of pure sounds must be broken, and the infinite
variety of "noise-sound" conquered. Besides, everyone will acknowledge
that all [musical] sound carries within it a development of sensations
that are already familiar and exhausted, and which predispose the
listener to boredom in spite of the efforts of all the innovatory
musicians. We Futurists have deeply loved and enjoyed the harmonies
of the great masters. For many years Beethoven and Wagner shook our
nerves and hearts. Now we are satiated and we find far more enjoyment
in the combination of the noises of trams, backfiring motors, carriages
and bawling crowds than in rehearing, for example, the "Eroica" or the
"Pastoral."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No mere extension, this proposes that we open up music to embrace all
possible sounds.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To experience something of the sonorous richness this would provide,
Russolo recommends that we traverse a modern city with "our ears more
alert than our eyes," adhering to the complex sounds of motors, throbbing
valves, pounding pistons, screeching gears, the flapping of awnings and
flags, the noise of metal shutters and store windows, doors slamming,
the roar of railroad stations, forges, mills, printing presses, power
stations, and subways. The goal is not to achieve a realistic imitation
of the noises of real life, but to "attune and regulate" such sounds
for specifically

<B></B>

musical purposes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 The noises are not transformed into ordinary musical tones, however,
 but are analyzed so that they can be manipulated in a controlled way:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
To fix the pitch of noises does not mean to take away from them all the
irregularity of tempo and intensity that characterizes their vibrations,
but rather to give definite gradation or pitch to the stronger and
more predominant of these vibrations. Indeed, noise is differentiated
from musical sound merely in that the vibrations that produce it are
confused and irregular, both in tempo and in intensity. Every noise has
a note--sometimes even a chord--that predominates in the ensemble of its
irregular vibrations. Because of this predominant note it becomes possible
to fix the pitch of a given note, that is, to give it not a single pitch
but a variety of pitches, without losing its characteristic quality--its
distinguishing timbre. Thus certain noises produced by rotary motion
may offer a complete ascending or descending chromatic scale by merely
increasing or decreasing the speed of the motion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To realize his project Russolo devised a threefold plan:  to select,
coordinate, and control noises, for which purpose he distinguishes six
noise "families" (the number was later increased) ranging from "rumbles"
and "whispers" to "screeches" and "shouts";  to employ new instruments
to be designed and constructed by Russolo, subsequently to be named
<I>intonarumori</I>, which can produce these noise-sounds mechanically
and modify them through a continuum of microtonal increments; and 
to create a Futurist orchestra composed entirely of such instruments.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 With the help of his assistant Ugo Piatti, Russolo managed to complete
 an initial set of noise instruments within the year; and the first
 public concert featuring his own compositions for <I>intonarumori</I>
 ensemble was held in April 1914, in Milan. A month later a second concert
 took place in Genoa, and a month thereafter, a series of twelve in the
 London Coliseum.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not surprisingly, these concerts attracted considerable public attention,
though perhaps less as musical events than as quasi-theatrical occasions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 A subsequently arranged international tour, extending to Moscow, was
 organized but then cancelled due to the outbreak of World War I.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Despite attempts to revive Futurist music after the war, Russolo's
 "new musical reality" never reached full fruition. One factor
 was the misguided effort to enhance the commercial appeal of the
 <I>intonarumori</I> by combining them with traditional orchestral
 instruments, condemning them to a merely decorative function. But in
 any event, by the 1930s Russolo was essentially a forgotten man.

 nature, its material traces--both scores and instruments--have virtually
 all disappeared, having been either lost or destroyed in World War II. A

 disappointingly little. The sound is poor, and the compositions

More suggestive, indeed tantalizingly so, is the only other surviving
compositional  artifact: two pages of score from Russolo's composition
<I>Risveglio di una citt&agrave;</I> (The awakening of a city), reproduced
to accompany an article by the composer published in 1913. This
piece, with a title echoing one of Futurism's major paintings, <I>La
citt&agrave; che sale</I> (The city rises) by Russolo's friend Boccioni
(coincidentally, the painting owned by Busoni),
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 was performed at the first <I>intonarumori</I> concert. It offers at
 least some indication of just how unprecedented this music was. Notated
 on standard music paper, the score designates pitches with continuous
 lines rather than traditional noteheads; and movement from one pitch
 to another occurs as often as not by continuous glissando-like motion
 rather than discrete step, giving rise to unbroken pitch transformations
 quite foreign to previous Western music. One cannot reconstruct the exact
 effect, of course, since the sounds of the instruments are unknown. But
 this music was evidently composed according to fundamentally different
 organizational principles, with the primary focus placed on timbre
 and timbral groupings, and on changes in registration and in dynamic
 and density levels, rather than on conventional tonal and rhythmic
 relationships. The rhythmic aspect nevertheless seems surprisingly
 tame: the score is notated in 3/4 time, with clearly indicated beats
 and barlines, marked off on the page according to a strict grid of
 spatial-durational correspondences. Important musical changes are
 carefully aligned, occurring on rather than off the beats. The score
 nevertheless has a decidedly graphic appearance, quite different from the
 look of traditional music, somewhat resembling Krzysztof Penderecki's
 scores from the 1960s. Whatever this music may have sounded like, it
 looked like "the music of the future."

Eighty years later it is easy to recognize--as many have--the historical
significance of Russolo's Futurist experiment. As forerunner of
such phenomena as the "mechanistically" inspired compositions of the
1920s--e.g., Artur Honegger's <I>Pacific 231</I> and Alexandr Mosolov's
<I>The Iron Foundry</I>, Edgard Var&egrave;se's "sound-liberated"
compositions, especially the all percussion <I>Ionisation</I> ,
John Cage's 1940s noise-dominated works for prepared piano, and
textually organized music of the 1960s by Penderecki and Gy&ouml;rgy
Ligeti--Russolo's work initiated an important and enduring line in
twentieth-century music, regardless of specific, much less acknowledged
influence. (Except for Cage, none of the composers mentioned admitted
influence; and Var&eacute;se flatly denied it.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As for the impact of Russolo's Futurist music on the larger "Futurist
moment" in which it appeared, it was admittedly minor measured by the
response of other composers of the period. Viewed within the larger
musical and cultural context, however, Russolo's manifesto and music
marked a moment of considerable significance. To a far greater extent
than any of his contemporaries, Russolo gave expression--by implication
if not direct statement--to a remarkable idea: that with the abandonment
of traditional tonality everything became musically possible--not just
nontriadic harmonies

<B></B>

or nonmetric rhythm, but any kind of sonic structure whatever. No longer
in possession of a common language founded on purely formal conventions,
music relinquished the sole basis for limiting itself to a "specifically
musical" kind of material. Music could be whatever one wanted it to be.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet if Russolo's manifesto seems to imply that any sonic event
can be called "music," his actual musical realizations were
from all appearances--the fragment of score, reports of concerts,
etc.--considerably less radical than their theoretical foundations. To
judge from the two pages of <I>Risveglio di una citt&agrave;</I>,
for example, Russolo confined his work to a carefully prescribed and
regulated body of sounds that, though consisting entirely of "noise," was
nevertheless created especially for musical purposes. The concerts were
also traditional in layout, featuring a sequence of previously announced
compositions, presented as "works of art." They even had the appearance
of traditional affairs: photographs reveal an all-male orchestra in
formal attire, seated in ordered arrangement.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are nevertheless intriguing suggestions in Russolo's manifesto
for the far reaching implications of linking music with noise, almost
reaching the point of an equation of music with life that is reminiscent
of Cage. Toward the end of the tract, the following appears:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Every manifestation of life is accompanied by noise. Noise, therefore, is
familiar to our ear and has the power to conjure up life itself. Musical
sound, alien to our life, always musical and a thing unto itself, an
occasional but unnecessary element, has become to our ears what an
overfamiliar face is to our eyes. Noise, however, reaching us in a
confused and irregular way from the irregular confusion of our life,
never entirely reveals itself to us, and keeps innumerable surprises
in reserve. We are therefore certain that by selecting, coordinating,
and dominating all noises we can enrich men with a new and unsuspected
sensual pleasure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The last sentence, with its reference to human domination and control,
pulls back somewhat, but the implication of the preceding is clear:
that music, rendered "alien" by an "overfamiliar" grammar, must now
become as "confused and irregular" as life itself. This represents the
last stage in music's century-old search to develop a language of ever
greater expressive immediacy. In an extraordinary moment of dialectical
reversal, the romantic idea of "music as a world apart," having been
pushed to its logical consequences, concedes to the idea of "music as
part of the world."

Russolo's undertaking, with its negation of specifically "musical" sound,
can again be illuminated by considering a corresponding development
in contemporary painting: the rejection of all exterior content. The
widespread appearance of purely abstract art in 1912 encouraged several
painters to strip down the content of their work to what Kasimir Malevich
a few years later called "the zero of form," apparently denying everything
previously held necessary to the definition of "painting," including

<B></B>

even its craft. The evolution of both Piet Mondrian and Malevich during
this period can be viewed in this light, though their reasons for such
a radical reduction of painterly conventions were quite different.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The most telling example is this connection, however, is Marcel Duchamp,
an artist much concerned with movement and transformation, and himself
influenced by Futurist painting. Thierry de Duve, in a study of Duchamp's
"passage" to the readymade, has interpreted the artist's retreat from
painting as a final response to a series of historical abandonments
undergone by painting in its search for a purely pictorial language free
of external representation: the abandonment of chiaroscuro in Manet,
linear perspective in C&eacute;zanne, empirically experienced space
in Picasso, and, in a culminating convergence around 1912, objective
representation in several artists, including Kandinsky, Mondrian,
Delaunay, Kupka, and Malevich. These abandonments both mirrored and
promoted the rejection of a particular, traditionally established
conception of painting, ultimately leading to pure abstractionism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While acknowledging that Duchamp's work was never fully abstract, de
Duve maintains that "the question of abstraction" was essential to
it. Instead of redefining painting as abstraction, however, Duchamp
extended the series of abandonments a final step, abandoning painting
altogether and along with it the name of "painting" (de Duve stresses
a Duchamp 1912 diary entry: "Marcel, no more painting; go get a job.").
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 This decision was publicly announced in his first exhibition of a
 readymade, the <I>Bicycle Wheel</I> of 1913. For de Duve this final
 abandonment was

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the paradoxically historical condition for the survival of painting,
the reprieve that comes from its name being unpronounceable for a
while it was the "invention" of the readymade that would confirm this
revelation. Duchamp abandoned painting for the first time, or, to be more
precise, he abandoned painting as a making and seeing, as an artisanal
pleasure, an "olfactory masturbation." But he did not abandon the
paradoxical  contract that tied him to the history of painting; rather,
he reduced the act of painting to nothing more than the enunciation of
the contract itself: to name the death of painting and its survival all
at once, to name the broken pact and the new pact that, since Manet at
least, were part of the rhythm of the destiny of an avant-garde painter,
and, by a supplementary turn of the crew, to name the name.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although one cannot claim that Russolo created the first "musical
readymade" (that honor, I suppose, would belong to Cage), I believe
that his "Art of Noises," which appeared in the same year as Duchamp's
<I>Bicycle Wheel</I>, can be read as providing the theoretical basis. It
seems to advocate something Russolo the composer was never able, or
wished, to realize: a vision of music that, inseparable from nonmusic,
comes to us "like life itself." Like Duchamp's readymade, Russolo's
manifesto responds to a series of abandonments: monotonality in Wagner,
the triad in Scriabin, tonal centricity in Schoenberg, metrical rhythm
in Stravinsky. Having reached the zero degree of form, the art of music
gives way to the art of noise.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are several intriguing ties linking Duchamp to Russolo. In 1913,
the same year as Russolo, Duchamp abandoned painting and turned to
"nonart," his "readymade" matching the former's "noise"; and shortly
before this abandonment he produced

<B></B>

a painting of a musical performance, <I>The Sonata</I> of 1911,
as Russolo did with his <I>La Musica</I> of the same year. But most
remarkable, Duchamp also turned to musical composition in breaking away
from painting, though less intensely and exclusively than Russolo. Among
various excursions into aural-musical territory throughout Duchamp's
career, three dating from the time of the abandonment of painting are
particularly relevant, especially since they appear to deny the boundaries
separating painting from music. One is a drawing executed on music paper
of a bicyclist, who defines--as if in analogy to a melodic line--a path
of motion extending across the staves. Another, never realized, consists
simply of the self-injunction to "make a painting of frequency."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most suggestive however is the third, an actual musical composition
entitled <I>Eratum Musical</I>, produced in 1913, the year of the
first readymade, and conceived in conjunction with the early stages of
the <I>Large Glass, The Bride Stripped Bare by her Bachelors, Even</I>
(yet another form of nonpainting). Purely conceptual in intent (Duchamp
himself remarked that a performance would be "useless"), the work exists
in two versions, one for three voices and one "for a designated music
instrument (player piano, mechanical organs or other new instruments
for which the virtuoso intermediary is suppressed)." (Cahill's
"Dynamophone," so enthusiastically described by Busoni, would have
been--conceptually--ideal.) Both versions exploit a chance procedure:
a limited number of pitches is selected (25 in one, 89 in the other)
and placed in sequence by a random procedure that establishes their
order for a given realization (in the vocal piece the pitches are
indicated on separate pieces of paper, placed in a hat, shaken, and
removed one-by-one).
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Apparently after the abandonment of objective pictorial representation,
 visual art too can become anything you want it to be.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In view of the simultaneous turn by both Russolo and Duchamp to a
"foreign" artistic enterprise, the former's closing words in "The Art
of Noises" take on particular interest:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I am not a musician, I have therefore no acoustic predilections, nor any
works to defend. I am a Futurist painter using a much loved art to project
my determination to renew everything. And so, bolder than a professional
musician could be, unconcerned by my apparent incompetence and convinced
that all rights and all possibilities open up to daring, I have been
able to initiate the great renewal of music through the Art of Noises.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here Russolo touches upon an important factor related to both his success
and failure as a composer. While his status as a nonmusician often
led him to be dismissed as little more than a joke, that same lack of
professional training enabled him to extend his vision beyond the most
distant regions of what had previously been musically imaginable. Like
Duchamp, Russolo embodies that almost mythical modernist prototype, the
artist as outsider--the painter who has no professional training, or who
does not paint at all; the writer who produces in a foreign tongue; the
composer who is not a musician.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though Russolo remains a largely forgotten re in music history, his
sudden appearance on the musical scene in 1913 can be viewed as marking
a critical historical juncture, supplying the final link in a chain
initiated in the early Romantic aesthetics of autonomous music. That he
represented not merely a point of termination, but one of origin, has been
made clear by subsequent Western music. Russolo's vision of a new kind of
music, offering materiality as a replacement for its lost spirituality,
has proved remarkably fertile, and has shown little sign of exhaustion.

Russolo's interest in controlling noise through scalar increments
analogous to those in pitch scales led him to introduce a system of
notation incorporating microtonal divisions. It must be understood,
however, that what is transformed through Russolo's scalar adjustments is
not a fixed pitch, but a noise made up of irregular frequencies. Russolo's
proposal thus goes well beyond what Busoni and Pratella had suggested
regarding microtonal scale divisions. For a recent discussion of
Russolo's notational innovations, see Mark A. Radice, "<I>Futurismo:</I> Its Origins, Context, Repertory, and Influence" <I>Musical Quarterly</I> 73, no. 1 : 7-13.

The <I>London Times</I> reported of the opening concert: "It is impossible
to say that the first of the 'noise-spirals' [a term Russolo applied
to his compositions] performed, 'The Awaking of a Great City,' was as
exhilarating as Futurist art usually is; on the contrary, it rather
resembled the sounds heard in the rigging of a Channel-steamer during a
bad crossing, and it was, perhaps, unwise of the players--or should we
call them 'noisicians?'--to proceed with their second piece, 'A Meeting of
Motor-cars and Aeroplanes,' after the pathetic cries of 'No more!' which
greeted them from all excited quarters of the auditorium." <I>London
Times</I>, 16 June 1914, 5. A description of a rehearsal preceding
the first concert in the <I>Pall Mall Gazette</I> of 12 June, 1914
(page 1, column 4) is only somewhat less dismissive: "Thunder rolling,
bulls roaring, hurricanes blowing, factories buzzing, dogs barking,
pigs grunting, and occasionally some gentle and necessary murmurs like
the approach of a calm dawn, were amongst the noises that were heard
at a rehearsal of the Futurist band on the stage of the Coliseum this
morning." <I>Pall Mall Gazette</I>, 12 June 1914, 1. According to the
account given by R. W. Nevinson in his <I>Paint and Prejudice</I> (New
York: Harcourt Brace, 1938), the first concert caused such a furor that
Marinetti was thereafter obliged to add a gramophone recording of music
by Elgar to the performances in order "to bring a little melody into
the act" . See also Felix Barker, <I>The House that Stoll Built: The
Story of the Coliseum Theatre</I> (London: Frederick Muller Ltd., 1957),

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Throughout the course of his life," we learn from the "Reminiscences"
of his daughter, Luce, F. T. Marinetti persisted in "jotting down his
thoughts in the tiny notebooks that followed him" almost everywhere,
"from trains to battlefields."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Begun perhaps as early as 1900, the notebooks originally spanned the
 entire period from the formation of Futurism in 1909 to several days
 before Marinetti's death in 1944, and in their complete form they must
 have offered one of the most remarkable perspectives on the cultural
 and political history of the twentieth century's first half. When
 his daughters returned to the family house in Tuscany after the war,
 however, they discovered that most of the diaries had been lost or
 destroyed by looters.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 What remained were some fifty notebooks covering the period 1915 to
 1921, together with a few others from 1926.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 In 1979 the diaries, which had been put in their present order by Luce
 Marinetti, were acquired by the Beinecke Library of Yale University,
 together with the bulk of Marinetti's papers, but placed under
 restriction until January of 1992. In the interim an edition of them
 was published by Alberto Bertoni (with guidance from Ezio Raimondi)
 in 1987, based on microfilms made prior to the diaries' having been
 consigned to Yale.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Bertoni's edition printed about 80 percent of the originals. It excluded
"sketches, plans for novels, and notes for literary or fictional projects
that decisively depart from the registration of actual events," all of
which were to be "the object of a later



publication" ("NSC," lix-lx). In addition, when questions of "discretion
and the preservation of privacy" were deemed at stake ("NSC," lx),
real names were systematically replaced with ciphers, while "occasional
passages" were omitted altogether on the same grounds.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Other decisions were equally debatable. Bertoni was plainly trying to
 address a number of conflicting imperatives, and it would be unfair and
 inappropriate to criticize his decisions now. Yet one may question the
 wisdom of adhering to the basic distinction that Bertoni wished to draw
 between "actual events" and "literary or fictional projects." For what
 characterizes the diaries, perhaps above all else, is how easily, how
 seamlessly they shift back and forth between the two, between experience
 and culture, life and art.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The notebooks as we have them are still a compelling document. They cover
perhaps the most crucial and certainly one of the most dramatic moments
of the twentieth century, a period that comprises the experience of the
Great War in Italy, from the cataclysmic defeat of Caporetto in October
1917 to the euphoric victory of Vittorio Veneto a year later, and the
birth of fascism four months later, formally marked by the organization
of the Fasci italiani di combattimento or Italian Battle Fasces in March
1919 (an event in which Marinetti participated). as well as the official
formation of the National Fascist Party or PNF in November 1921. The
final passage in the selection that we present here shows Marinetti, in
Rome on the day after the Party's convention, watching Benito Mussolini
as he leads a procession of forty thousand fascists to the Monument to
Vittorio Emmanuele, the so-called Altar of the Patria, to salute the
tomb of the unknown soldier, a show of force that preceded his arrival
in power at the head of the government by less than a year.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The period covered by the diaries was no less eventful for Marinetti
himself. By June of 1918 he had met Benedetta Cappa, the writer
and painter who would eventually become his companion and later
his wife. His literary career, in the same period, was marked by an
almost feverish production. War, conflict, and struggle were central to
Marinetti's outlook on life, and the effort to convey the impact of war
had already sparked much of his pre-war experimental writing, including
the "words-in-freedom" works.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 The experimental variety of his production in the years 1915-21, however,
 reflects a more sustained and more complex exploration of the aesthetic
 and philosophical implications of war. The year 1915 might be said to
 mark a watershed in his development. On the one hand he writes <I>War:
 The Only Hygiene of the World</I> , a short book that looks forward
 to the political program outlined in <I>Futurist Democracy: Political
 Dynamism</I>  and most coherently elaborated in the brief work,
 <I>Beyond Communism</I> .
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 On the other hand he issues the manifesto of "Futurist Synthetic
 Theater," with its call for a "dynamic leap in the void, beyond the range
 of territory previously explored," a call swiftly answered by a series
 of brief experimental plays that were meant to embody its theories.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Yet a third direction is announced with the essay, "The New
 Religion-Morality of Speed" (11 May 1916), in which Marinetti moves
 into the realm of an anthropology and ethics of modernity, seeking to
 "defend man from the decay caused by slowness, by memory, by analysis,
 by repose and habit," and lead him to a "spiral ascent of the I towards
 the Void-God."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<B></B>

Yet a fourth direction is elaborated in dialogue with the feminist
controversy, in <I>How to Seduce Women</I> , which is amended
and expanded to <I>How to Seduce Women and Betray Men</I> , and
is rapidly followed by <I>A Woman's Belly: A Surgical Novel</I> 
written in collaboration with Enif Robert, which recounts the dialogue
between the Futurist Marinetti and a first-person narrator who gives a
shockingly graphic account of her operation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Likewise, the brief "theatrical syntheses" are elaborated into longer
 satirical works such as <I>The Island of Kisses: A Social-Erotic
 Novel</I> , as well as the more ambitious <I>Futurist Loves:
 Programs for Life with Variant Endings at your Choice</I> , where
 he returns to the main ideas of "The New Religion-Morality of Speed" in
 his exploration of the rejuvenating and spiritually beneficial effects
 of speed, novelty, and violence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Most important are the three major novels that derive from Martinetti's
 own experiences in the war: <I>Eight Souls Within a Bomb: An Explosive
 Novel</I> , which elaborates many of his experiences from 1917 in
 a prose still strongly inflected by the "words-in-freedom" experiments;
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 <I>The Steel Alcove</I> , which draws on later events that he
 witnessed as commander of an armored car, this time in prose that
 alternates between deliberate coarseness and almost mystical lyricism;
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 and <I>The Untamable</I> , perhaps his finest work of extended
 fiction, written in a style that returns to yet advances beyond the
 symbolist tendencies of his earlier writing, elaborating a sensual,
 descriptive prose that lingers over the surface of each object in
 accordance with Marinetti's theory of "tactilism," with its emphasis
 on the immediacy of touch over the distantiation of sight and its
 anticipation of the same motif in Surrealism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What follows below is a selection of twenty-three passages from the
unpublished portions of Marinetti's diaries. (Luce Marinetti requested
that three passages from the original selection of twenty-six not
be published.) Like the published works from this same period, they
range across a variety of genres and discursive types: from wistful
self-reflection to spare narrative, from lyrical evocations of landscape
to experiments in a theater of oneiro-erotics, from notes for a manifesto
to pungent, even acerbic observations on people such as D'Annunzio and
Mussolini. For Anglo-American readers especially, for whom Marinetti
is known almost wholly from the declamatory style of the manifestos,
the passages will offer a surprising range of tones: coarse anecdotes
jostling against moments of genuine lyricism, philosophical reflections
against unabashed eroticism, and everywhere an authorial voice that is
alternately wry, witty, crude, tender and severe, bitter and shrewd, and
consistently endowed with an immediate responsiveness to the variety of
the world. It is this re, far richer and more complex than one might
gather from just the manifestos, who is increasingly being viewed as a
writer of major importance not just within the history of modern Italian
literature, but within the broader evolution of cultural modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The translations have not attempted to replicate particularities
of spelling or punctuation of the originals, except in cases when it
appeared that Marinetti was drawing upon the techniques derived from the
"words-in-freedom" experiments. On the whole they have aimed at suggesting
the range of tones and linguistic registers in

the original. Marinetti sometimes revelled in vulgarity, and the English
faithfully reflects that. Readers can also make their own assessments, as
a transcription of the original Italian is given immediately after the
translation. It adopts the same conventions fro rendering the original
as were used in the published edition of Bertoni.

Passages 1-4. Marinetti spent most of 1916 on leave from active
duty, though inevitable he continued to feel the effects of the war: on 17
August 1916 the painter Umberto Boccioni died  during military exercises,
and two months later on 10 October the architect Antionio Sant'Elia was
killed in battle. In late December Marinetti was recalled to duty and
in February 1917 he was stationed at a small town about ten kilometers
southwest of Gorizia (at the extreme northeast of modern Italy). He soon
came down with bronchitis, and after enduring a month of illness he was
sent on 3 April to a hospital at Cormons to recuperate (some one hundred
kilometers west of the front), where he stayed until 18 April. The four
passages given here were written during this period. Passage 2 consists
of a sketch for a brief play that derives from the "synthetic theater"
which Marinetti had been developing in 1915 and 1916, first announced
in the manifesto "The Futurist Synthetic Theater" (January-February 1915).

 It survives in two versions: the longer one is given here, but the
 shorter one bears the title "The Game of the Lampshade" (Il gioco

 of the Italian Futurist Party," first published in the newspaper
 <I>L'Italia Futurista</I> in February 1918.

Passage 5. After leaving the hospital in Cormons in April 1917,
Marinetti was stationed with forces situated in the village of Plava
(one hundred kilometers north of Gorizia) He participated in the series
of heavy bombardments that began on 12 May in anticipation of an assault
on Austrian positions on Mount Kuk (or <I>Monte Cucco</I>; on this event
see also passage 22), and on 14 May he was severely wounded by a grenade
explosion (see passage 14). He spent the summer in convalescence in Udine,
where he was twice visited by D'Annunzio. Then, in early September, he
was stationed near the village of Doberd&ograve;, thirty-five kilometers
northwest of Monfalcone, a city on the Adriatic coast. His diary for 27
September records his taking an evening walk with several colleagues by
the shores of Lake Doberd&ograve;: "A large lake. With islands that are
almost round. A

The moon is a pervasive image in Marinetti's work, beginning as
early as 1904 when he evokes "the corrosive light of the moon," "the air
heavy...with lunar milk," the "strange sap" of this "terrible Magician"
who "imitates and liquefies the hardness of marble;"
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 it reemerges in the manifesto "Let's kill the moonlight!" , where
 the moon symbolizes sentimentality and decadence attacked by a band of
 madmen led by the Futurists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 In <I>The Steel Alcove</I> , Marinetti dedicates a whole chapter
 to the temptations of the moon, entitled "The moon's troops disembark at
 Rapallo," where the moon boasts that she has been able to "stop the war"
 by "fill[ing] the trenches with the beneficial milk of [her] light, and
 the lookouts' heads drooped, filled with sleep and tender pessimism...."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Finally in The Untamable , the moon's melting sweetness is
 associated with the freedom and agapic love of the night, and opposed
 to the sadistic violence of the midday sun.

I imagine rifle fire from the trenches being exchanged from one side of
the lake to the other, shooting among the shoreline plants (which emerge
and then sometimes are submerged again when the lake has risen a great
deal), beneath the discourse of the moon.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Discourse of the Moon to the Soldiers</I> (for the novel).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I'm lying down among you, hard trenches, and over you I'm spreading my
sweet snail-like spittle and the oil of my silver saliva. Let yourselves
become tender, you hard stiff rough surly trenches. Why are you ting
one another? Why are you struggling for this pool of useless absurd
water that you can't even use to ease your thirst? The water has been
poisoned by the moon. I alone reign here. This lake is neither Austrian
nor Italian. It's mine. It belongs to the Moon! Give it up. Lay down
your rifle and sleep for a while.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Be quiet," shouted an Italian sentinel. "You're an Austrian moon. Be
quiet or I'll take aim at you with my rifle!"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"No, no," another sentinel murmured to him. "The moon is Italian. Can't
you hear? She's singing just the way they sing in my home town! This
moon is Italian."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"That's why I'm going to smash it down with a rifle shot. Let me take
care of it. I'm a first-class Futurist marksman."

And thus it was that the Moon sank over the lake of Doberd&ograve; at
the crack of rifle fire.

Passage 6. Stationed near the front lines as he was, Marinetti
experienced first hand the disaster that occurred with the Austro-German
breakthrough at Caporetto and the massive rout that ensued in late October
1917. Subsequently stationed at several different places, Marinetti was
ordered to serve at the new front near the river Piave in February 1918,
a site where Austrian and Italian sentries would fire at one another
across the river. He noted in his diary for 21

Passages 7-8. On 22 March 1918 Marinetti was assigned just north
of Thiene (a small city about one hundred and sixty kilometers north
of Vicenza). Passage 7 shows him, a day after his arrival, testing and
refining sentences around one of his favorite themes, the sun as a symbol
of the power of destruction and renewal of the Futurist hero, as seen in
the third chapter of Mafarka le futuriste, "The dogs of the sun," where
the sun both decomposes the cadavers of the dead and ploughs the fields
to nourish the warriors.

Passage 8 comprises two parts. The first consists of two sentences
written toward the work that would eventually become <I>8 Souls Within
a Bomb</I> , a sequence of eight stories that "explodes" at the
end. More interesting is the abrupt shift to the second part, Marinetti's
recollection of an event that had taken place almost exactly three years
earlier, on 11 April 1915, when Marinetti and Mussolini were both arrested
in Rome. The occasion was a demonstration on behalf of interventionism,
one of a series staged in the principal cities of central and northern
Italy on the same day. They were organized by the "Fasces of Revolutionary
Action," a leftist group that strongly favored intervention and many of
whose documents and theoretical writings were printed by Mussolini in
Il Popolo d'Italia.Mussolini was speaking as a representative of this
group when he was arrested in the early afternoon and was released in
the evening on the condition that he leave Rome immediately.

Passages 9-12. In early July 1918 Marinetti was assigned to the
Corps of Armored Cars. After receiving his initial training in Genoa
he was ordered to join the Eighth Armored Squadron stationed between
Venice and Padua, where he remained for three months (25 July to 24
October). We give four passages from this extraordinarily productive
period just prior to the end of the war.

Passages 9 and 10 are a sketch for an episode in the work that
came to be called <I>Futurist Loves</I> , though ultimately it
was not included in the finished volume. Marinetti first mentions the
larger project in a diary entry for 18 March 1918: "I am thinking about
the Futurist Loves. Programs for life, with ramifications. Which is to
say, with variant endings. Two or three or four possible endings, each
different from one another, which a reader can then choose."

Passage 11 presents an extensive narration of the battle of
Caporetto, which had taken place a year earlier, as experienced by one
Captain Raby, who served with Marinetti in the Corps of Armored Cars and
who res prominently as a fictional character in Marinetti's work
<I>The Steel Alcove</I> , a novel closely based on Marinetti's
experiences in the war's final year. To what extent Marinetti altered
Raby's account cannot be determined, but it differs greatly from his own
experiences as recorded in the diaries. More important, Raby's account
sounds many of the notes that were heard in public debate about the
disaster, the scope of which had left Italy profoundly shocked. After
the breakthrough on 24
<BR>
October 1917, the Italians were forced to retreat more than two hundred
kilometers in eighteen days, battered by incessant rains and constant
shelling. When
<BR>
it was over they had suffered 40,000 casualties (dead and wounded) and
lost 280,000 prisoners and 350,000 more who were separated from their
units or had deserted. Less than half of the army was left at full
strength. Explaining "the disaster" became a national obsession and
the account of Captain Raby is partly a contribution to that debate, as
well as a distillation of Marinetti's own wartime experiences. Only a
portion of the narration is presented here, enough to indicate Marinetti's
understanding of the disaster's "real cause" and his flair for condensed
narrative.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
They look beneath the bed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"There's no basket of fish down here!"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Well then, it's quite simple! It's a case of shrivelled uterus with
pockets of menstrual puss! You know what the operation consists of."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Then, Bossi having departed, you will speak to your beloved of the
necessity of becoming a singer of light music, meanwhile pressing the
wound in the uterus with a light massage. You will repair the ege of
the uterus. You will wash it and take away all the pus.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Then you will go out into the garden and lie down on the grass about
100 meters from the window of the operating room. After 10 minutes an
extraordinarily white ray will leap out from the pierced jalousie and
fill the nocturnal garden which, bathed in bright light, will reveal red
armchairs that teem with naked shoulders and pearls, that bristle with
astoundingly luminous osprey feathers and dark glances, black diamonds,
a frenzied river of jewels.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rising, you will turn around and see, within the radiant circle
formed by the electric floodlights, a stage that is shining, with the
actor Petrolini in the middle, agile, jumping about in a black tuxedo
worn with a starched shirt-front as white as snow beneath the enemy
floodlights....With his mouth, with his eyes, Petrolini is imitating
grimaces, guffaws, hunger, thirst, ironies, thanks, and the prayers of
the female vulva.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The actor Fregoli (standing near Petrolini), meanwhile, will imitate all
the faces of the mothers, the fathers, the young couples who are there,
faces marked by horror, desire, reproach, and exaltation at the sight
of the immaculate daughter displaying herself in that way in public. At
last, what she had kept hidden beneath her dress is revealed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The stage has great buzzing wheels, 20 motors each of 200 horsepower. It
runs, leaps over plains, climbs mountains, jumps into a river (it looks
like a <I>dalabieh</I> or

<B></B>

riverboat on the Nile being pulled by unnumerable <I>vieux marcheurs
viveurs</I> in tuxedos who are bent beneath the tow-line...on both shores
they are pulling the stage as it sputututters and bebebelches its speedy
motors over the water like propellers) with ropes like electric rays.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Away! The stage contains your beloved who does a mean cakewalk and then
begins a marvellous belly-dance just where the uterus is becoming a
spiral a vortex of light warmth perfumes. The stage, like an assault
car, launches an attack upon a convent full of elderly respectable
English ladies, located on a mountain in Scotland. They are reading the
Bible. You take the Bible, mount the stage, and explain how Noah, at
the age of eighty, screwed his virgin daughters.

<I>The Retreat of Lieutenant Raby's Five Armored Cars</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I was at Maiano with five armored cars. The others were at Turin, in
the security service, at Turin with the Captain.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>The Night of 25-26 October 1917</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
They are taking away the telephone from the office (three soldiers from
the Engineering Corps placed at my orders) that linked me to the 16th
Division. I can hear shelling in the direction of Gorizia. At two o'clock
I go to the 16th Division Command at Purgessimo. I pass by Premariacco,
transport cars blocking the road. In the place where the cars are parked
I learn the tragic news of our collapse and retreat at Caporetto. Two
grenades explode nearby. Smoke is billowing over Cividale, fires. They
tell me that the first Austrian patrols are already in Cividale. I search
for the 16th Division at Remanzacco. They don't know anything there. I
eat and go on to Udine. The clearing out of our troops has begun in a
tumult of bad news.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I go on to Trigesimo.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Where is the 16th Division?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"What army are you with?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"The Third."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"This is the Second. We don't know a damned thing."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<!--_d-head-->
<I>27 October 1917</I>
<!--_/d-head-->
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At Trigesimo I finally find the 16th Division. The second in command
says to me: "What are you doing here?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"I'm looking for a place to hide the general's car!! I don't have time
to waste with you!"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At last I find General Ponzio, who says to me: "Bravo! If only all the
officers were like you! Very well. I've lost all my machine guns. I'm
going to need you."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ponzio describes the conration of our troops in retreat. Gorizia
(the Army's "Zone of Gorizia"). Lucinico, Rubrio, Trigesimo, Artegna,
Gemona--all of Carnia has already been lost. "We're meeting tomorrow at
Casacco. But remember to pass below Udine, because the road from Trigesimo
to Udine is being shelled." The defense was to be on the river Torre.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The night of the 28th I pass by Udine. It is pouring rain. Disorder,
panic. The wounded and the ill cleared out in haste. Stretchers
everywhere, wounded. Screams of terror. Cars, ambulances, the drone of
airplanes as they surge upwards in the dark. Fields with oxen. Cattle,
cows, carts. Cannons overturned. Fires, fires. The vast blushes of red
in the night against the maniacal tenacious filaments of rain turning
into tears over the countryside stricken with terror. Casacco. Artegna.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I am fired on by rifles that are shooting from Monte Stella. Then I run
into twelve Alpines. "We're all that's left of a battalion! The Austrians
are up on Monte Stella!" And then I run into a major coming with two
guns from the mountains. "I'm retreating. Ammunition is finished. I've
been shooting until now."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I go on, passing by the fiery blast, the enormous hot burning breath of
the old spinning mill at Artegna, in flames.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At Buia. Avella. Maiano. Deveacco. Farla.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<!--_d-head-->
<I>The Morning of the 29th</I>
<!--_/d-head-->
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The 16th Division has been merged with the 34th Division to form a unit
named the "Di Giorgio Special Corps," which has been assigned the task
of holding the bridgehead at Pinzano, with regrouping on the river Ledra.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I originally had five armored cars, but from Udine to Buia I've
lost three. With two cars and some outposts of the Cavalry (Umberto
Regiment) I am to cross back and forth from Buia to Avella and Avella
to Buia. Exchanges of fire with Austrian patrols. Pouring rain.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<I>The Night of the 29th</I>
<!--_/d-head-->
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
San Tommaso, Command of the 16th Division. They receive a communication
from the Command of the Syracuse Brigade reporting that Maiano has already
been occupied. Maiano is two kilometers away from San Tommaso. Panic in
the Command. A retreat is discussed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"If you want," Raby says to the general, "I'll go and see."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rain. Darkness. Carts abandoned on the roads. I go around via the country
roads. Empty houses. I think that I'm in a village near Maiano. I run
into a peasant.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"What village is this?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Maiano."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I examine some houses. I go to the intersection of the roads going to
Peri and Tonzolano. Nobody. Rifle fire in the distance. I return to San
Tommaso to make my report.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<!--_d-head-->
<I>Dawn of 30 October</I>
<!--_/d-head-->
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The 16th Division is folding back to the river Ledra. I am to stay behind
with two armored cars and a battalion of Alpines.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At Buia we see six Austrian cavalrymen outlined against the sky in
the hills. I fire with my machine gun. They disappear. They were three
hundred meters away.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The bridges over the river Ledra are being mined.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At midday I return to our lines. I am in the divisional reserves.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At twilight, an attack by the Austrians, who are coming from Udine. There
is a persistent rumor (started by the Austrians): the Third Army has
already reached Trieste and has taken 60,000 prisoners!!! Soldiers keep
on passing by and shouting: "This is the road to Trieste!" Then they
throw down their weapons!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<!--_d-head-->
<I>11:00 on 30 October</I>
<!--_/d-head-->
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I take an armored car and go to Maiano. I'm accompanied by a battalion of
the 246th Infantry. Their captain is energetic, powerful, bold. Maiano
has been occupied by the Austrians. They have six machine guns. Three
are standing pointed in a row in the middle of the road, left visible,
stupidly. I'm told that during the night one of our battalions had
occupied Maiano, but that it was chased out in the morning by the
Austrians. Now they are holding the city with six machine guns transported
with bicycles.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With my machine gun, at a distance of 50 meters, I take aim at the three
machine guns in the open road. I am standing at a corner. One blast and
the Austrian machine gun in the middle is overturned. I see the gunner,
who had been lying behind it, with his stomach to the ground, rising and
attempting to get up. His chest and stomach have an enormous hole torn
out, 30 centimeters in diameter, from which blood is flowing in streams
in rivers to left to right inundating the street which is already filled
with water and turning it all red. The three machine guns have been
smashed and overturned. The other gunners are fleeing into the nearby
houses, among the bicycles that they had placed under the porticos. The
dead gunner, who had gotten bloodily entangled in the tripod of his gun,
is crushed by the armored car as I pass over his body. I take away the
other two guns in the armored car; they're about a yard high. My tires
are shredded. There is the smell of gunfire. Pursuit into the houses. My
sergeant, the driver, chases one Austrian gunner and stabs him against
the shut door of a house.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The other three machine guns that were targeting us, hidden in a stack
of corn on the right, have grown silent. The captain of the infantry
battalion has been struck in the chest and falls dead. The battalion
is falling apart as it retreats. I fall back. My two Maxims have
been disabled. The radiator of the armored car is leaking, riddled by
bullets. I return to San Tommaso.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The 16th Division has already left. They are firing at me from the church,
situated in a high part of the town. I send the other armored car to
sector 193 just outside the town in order to fire from the same height
as the church. Grenades, the 75ers, are falling around us rrrrrrrr but
land without exploding. I reach the other car commanded by Lieutenant
Failli. My two cars fall back from Farla to San Daniele. Patrols. Rifle
fire.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I know that San Tommaso has been occupied by the Austrians. I run into a
captain from the 1st battalion of the Eighth Fortress, who has lost all
his weapons and is leading his men disarmed. At Villa Farlate there are
some blasts from machine guns which disabled the last two of Failli's
guns that were still firing.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At San Daniele del Friuli, a town that sits upon a hillside, I
find myself at the bottom of the city in a road that twists upward
with <I>s</I>-curves. At the top of the town are our two machine gun
companies. I clear the street of overturned carts, then go up on foot. I
receive orders from the Rovigo Brigade to disable the motors of my armored
cars and to take the remaining machine guns that work and resist as long
as possible. At whatever cost. The command of the brigade sends me two
boxes of cartridges.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the passageway of a country house I find a cart, on which I screw down
the machine that loads the cartridge belts. Helped by an old refugee
woman, I load the belts with my men. Meanwhile, my drivers are weeping
as they break up their motors. I prepare some cartridges with gunpowder
for mines in order to blow up the gasoline tanks.

Passage 13. Marinetti's meeting with Benedetta Cappa, an aspiring
writer and gifted painter, was undoubtedly the most important event of
his personal life during the period 1917-21. His earliest dated letter to
her is from 15 June [1918], but it was plainly preceded by several others.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Nine years later they married and eventually they had three
 daughters. The passages given below are found among loose leaves that
 follow a diary entry dated 3 November 1918, but their date is hardly
 secure. "Marinetto" is a pet name that was used by "Beny," as Benedetta
 came to be called.

Passage 14. The <I>Dolina of the Carso</I> or <I>The Nightingale of
the Plava</I> was a work that Marinetti planned, but never completed. It
was to thematize the lessons of the war in the re of a nightingale
whose song was transformed to harmonize with the sound of factories
and cannons. Toward this work, then, Marinetti plans to draw on his own
experience when he was wounded on 14 May 1917 at Plava (see the note to
passage 5). The Caf&eacute; Savini, in Milan, was frequented by writers
in Milan in the years before the war.

The haunting image of Marinetti "accartocciato nel camminamento"
(crumpled like paper in the communication trench) recalls the poet
Giuseppe Ungaretti's description of himself in "Dolina notturna"
(nocturnal doline), a poem dated "Naples, 26 December 1916," which first
appeared in 1918:
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 "Questo nomade / adunco / si lascia / come una foglia / accartocciata //
 L'interminabile / tempo / mi adopera / come un fruscio" (this nomad is

The "dolina" was, in Marinetti's own words, "a depression
in the terrain of the Carso. It looks like the crater of a dead
volcano. Sometimes a real circus dug out by the waters. A little
dried-out lake."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 It was typically used as a shelter by the soldiers--including Marinetti

Passages 15-17. The year 1919 signalled the moment of Marinetti's
most intense political engagement. On 11 January he joined Mussolini in
leading a group that disrupted a speech at La Scala by Leonida Bissolati,
the head of the reformist Socialists and an advocate of moderation on
the question of how much territory Italy was to receive after the war. On
23 March Marinetti joined Mussolini in forming the <I>Fasci italiani di
combattimento</I> (Italian Battle Fasces), the organization that became
the Fascist National Party. By the end of the year he was under arrest
and imprisoned for twenty-one days on charges of keeping weapons and
engaging in subversive activities. The three passages given here range
widely in nature and tone. Passage 15 is a sketch for brief play of the
"synthetic theater" sort. Passage 16 probably dates from late September
or early October 1919, and apparently recalls a moment during Marinetti's
visit to Fiume (15 September to 2 October), where he had gone only three
days after D'Annunzio's take over of the city. It is both harsher and
more honestly admiring of D'Annunzio than any of his published remarks,
which are instead marvels of satirical ambiguity, beginning with his short
"biography" <I>The Gods Depart</I>, D'Annunzio remains .

Passages 17, in contrast, suggests Marinetti's deepening interest
in questions of practical morality, questions that he explores by
assimilating Nietzschean thematics of the strong or forceful individual
to a vein of scientific mysticism turning around the concept of "forces"
at work in the universe. In his notes for the novel based on his later
war experiences, <I>The Steel Alcove</I> , he repeatedly pondered
giving it the subtitle: <I>The Book of Forces</I>; and in chapter three
of the novel, "The chemical battle and the azure halos," he describes the
"halos of lived life," in which are gathered "all the affective forces
of couples, friends, parents, children, mothers, lovers and little
children that, united with the forces of past pain and pleasure, shield
the soldiers."

<I>The Knowledge of Forces</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
1.) Mix great boldness with detailed prudence. Alternate a grandiose
blind thrust with a religious concern for being prudent about particulars.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
2.) The use of amulets should sometimes be a form of homage or a
genuflection to Forces that have been angered or gone mad.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
3.) There are shifty or halfway sorts of beings who are of no interest
to the Forces. They live in the shadow of what surrounds them; they
are never caught in the cyclonic movement of the Forces. Others,
instead, are always at the center of the breach or in the middle of
the road. These must always choose the type of movement in which it is
possible for them to turn the current that is taking them along in order
to redirect it then with the impetus added by the enthusiasm of the Forces
themselves. Otherwise they must give themselves over to the current,
changing themselves from opaque rafts to giant floating luminous things,
so that the Forces themselves go more quickly toward a new harmony.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
4.) Magicians say: You want to have something? Say in a loud voice: I
possess it. <I>A loud voice, naturally</I>. This is true for halfway
people who neither have nor can have much influence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
5.) A magician said that I was <I>a crowd</I>. I tell Beny that she's
a <I>crowd of beauties</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
6.) To say some things out loud is very dangerous. For the Forces can
overhear a voice and sometimes reject it absolutely. To repeat out loud
certain ideas reinforces them, makes them real.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
7.) Humans are open like porticos or rooftops or blocks of flats without
windows and doors. They can be invaded by another soul or by many other
souls. Others are closed and can't be invaded. Still others are extremely
open, but their inner personality is so compact active and powerful that
souls that penetrate it cannot resist that internal dynamism and end up
leaving immediately.

Passages 21-23. The first two passages are difficult to date
because they are fictional, and on loose sheets of paper inserted into the
diaries pertaining to 1921. Passage 22 outlines a method for overcoming
the oscillations of fortune through an "artificial optimism opposed to
all chronic pessimism, a continuous dynamism, a continuous becoming and
an indefatigable will."

3. Never speak of <I>Impossibility.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Declare that everything that is desired and everything that is wanted
is possible. Never say, "I <I>am unlucky. I'll never be able to do it</I>"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
4. Keep silence in matters that are relatively easy and prepare them
carefully. You should want them fiercely, but not say to others that
you'll succeed. Never say <I>it's a sure thing</I>, even when a favorable
outcome seems certain. To say it's certain is the same as considering
oneself the master of auspicious forces. But the forces like to consider
themselves <I>free not to favor someone</I> even when they have already
made their decision. They are kind, but surly and easily irritated
with people who are strong. It is necessary to say <I>we hope</I> or
<I>perhaps!</I> For if they hear you say, <I>it's a sure thing</I> or
<I>I'm certain</I>, they can abandon you brutally without reason.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
5. <I>Creative force of the word.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A terrible passion a terrible and pernicious love can be created in us
just by the force of saying, <I>"I'm in love"</I> or <I>"I'm smitten
with that woman. I can't live witout</I> 

<B></B>

<I>her."</I> Example: Carmissati. His lover, already fucked by others
as well as himself might have remained his model and his lover. But he
felt himself to be Tristan and saw in her his Isotta, and by means of
the music of Wagner at La Scala he artificially created his drama of
love. The piercing separation. Her brother understood the situation
and took her away from him, encouraging the musical tragedy with its
crescendi of violins--anxiety--blood sperm that rises falls rises rises
toward the spasm of the full orchestral conclusion. There's no one but
her. To marry her! Mine! Mine!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But she was already his! Marriage was necessary only to render more
Wagnerianly romantic a love that was already naturally romantic because
free. Literary superimposition. To perfect a love with weak artifice by
means of the instinctive physiological element of music.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
You can create a political state of mind in favor of war or revolution
with a simple cry: <I>Down with Austria</I> or <I>Death to Giolitti. We
have to take Mount Cucco</I>. "I've got Mount Cucco in my pocket," as
Cappello said at the dawn of the action of May 1917. The more difficult
a collective revolution is to achieve, the more one must repeat,
insistently and with iron crystalline adamantine faith, <I>the will</I> to <I>realize it</I>. It is necessary not to say, <I>the war with
Austria is a sure thing</I>. One must say <I>down with Austria!</I>
with faith and adamantine optimism. One must say <I>I want I have to
have that woman</I>. Don't say: <I>I'll have her for sure</I>. The cry
<I>down with Austria</I>, shouted with force and with faith precisely
when out intervention was and seemed to be the least likely event, was an
adamantine drill in the glass bell of the Germanophile clerical moderate
conservative quietist neutralism. It was a force of a quality absolutely
opposed to the other one, and therefore it pierced it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
6. <I>The electric light</I> has killed the sunset (indecision nostalgia
shadings of pessimism); agony of the solar force that man tends to
imitate; the pain of the sun that must yield to the shadows. We no
longer see the fields that grow pale and die under the rattlings of
churchbells. Electric light extends the full natural day with a full
artificial day.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
7. <I>Speed</I> has killed eliminated the visual analysis of the
countryside and the psychological analysis of the antimuscular internal
life. Speed has created the synthesis of a life deliberately thrown up in
great blocks and withdrawn from minute pessimism. Pessimism is minutiae,
detail, analysis. Optimism is synthesis. For that reason speed is optimism
because velocity gathers together and synthesizes life. Velocity kills
memory, folding back upon oneself, remorse. Velocity attacks, it does not
suffer; it is almost always the master of life and its forces. Slowness
is subject to others and is always a slave of life and its forces.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
8. <I>Destroy the frills of one's own life</I>. Simplify each thing in
order to be able to dominate a greater number of affairs. One must have
a hundred things simplified and coarsened in one's own life. One must
never have anything tied up or made ornate with a thousand useless frills.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Destroy all tricks masks cosmetics ribbons of important things. Reduce
every important matter to its state of raw nudity. That way you can
dominate many important

<B></B>

matters and make a complex synthesis of them directed toward its
perfection and splendor. Frills prevent us from seeing the direction of
their strength. Important things, once stripped liberated from their
frills, can reveal their power and their direction to us. Thus one
can identify the one two or three directions of the twenty or thirty
things-forces that are really important, and so life converges towards
its true ends.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
9. <I>Establish a bridge with artificial optimism</I> (constructed of
whatever elements are at hand, even fragile and worn out ones) <I>between
one good occurrence and another</I>, striding over the valley of the
bad event. This is based on the already universally acknowledged law
of the oscillation of fortune and misfortune. After the good the bad,
after the favorable the unfavorable. Rollercoaster of events. Create a
bridge from the <I>good</I> to the <I>good</I> and over the <I>bad</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
10. <I>Artificially keep up the situation at all costs</I> when there
is support on the right and the left and when the circumstances dictate
that the perilous situation, viewed within the context of all the other
situations, may turn out favorable. The Countess D'Orsay leaves tips of
500 liras "in order to preserve her station," as the Countess Robilant of
Florence says. She's right. The act of the Countess partakes of artificial
optimism and is quite right and useful for the entire environment that
wants the Countess D'Orsay to rise and not sink. The tips prevent her
from having to fall to the point of accepting some miserable little
job, which would not be honorable because it would mark a fall and would
depress a person ill-suited to such work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
11. <I>We must cultivate, educate in ourselves, our vanity</I>, rendering
it, however, charming and not aggressive. Thus one should give oneself
numerous tasks and numerous peaks to conquer. For the zig-zags of fortune
and misfortune will so turn out that a piece of good luck in politics
will be matched by bad luck in love or vice versa. And therefore one
is never overcome by any single misfortune. We should never renounce
our possibilities. We should remove all the frills from our objectives,
<I>but have many of them</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
12. Once you have decided on a given offensive in life, employ
<I>your own forces to the utmost</I> and use a <I>violent attack</I> without indecision, not worrying about possible losses or the labor
involved. After you have taken all the necessary precautions, attack
resolutely and desperately.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
13. When life seems to offer truces; when one is at the crossroads, in a
swamp, in the bogs, at a stopping point where the dimness of indecision
slowly falls like night; when the situation becomes serious, ambiguous,
full of checks and prohibitions masks and half-way measures; when
everything around us seems to say, <I>if only this or that were not
in my way</I>, or if only I weren't afraid of revealing everything to
the husband by some action taken against my flirtatious or unfaithful
lover, I would slap her, I would punch her other lover; when every
kind of logic seems to dictate immobility--<I>then, instead, one
must smash every obstacle</I> with <I>sudden violence and</I> decisive
<I>attack</I>. (Rimini, Gabriella, etc. The public gardens of Milan.) For
the forces of the universe are like men: they fall asleep when they
think they are secure. Thus the unfavorable forces fall asleep when it
seems absurd that you should attack them.

<B></B>

Precisely for this reason you must choose the moment of maximum confusion
tumult indecisive swamp in order to attack them and sink them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At Plava every logic counseled us not to take the Cucco head
on. Indecision, mistrust, too much time passed beneath the Austrians,
pressing upon their heels. Not only the Austrians but the superphysical
forces of the Cucco were shattered and in disorder when Cappello decided,
precisely then, to launch the great frontal assault against the mountain
that had always been deemed impregnable and especially so after sitting
there for some two years.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When you find yourself in this state with a woman whom you want to
seduce; when you find yourself in a long pause after fruitless attacks
of no importance; when you feel skepticism, or think that it's useless
to attack and certainly right now it's absurd to do so--this, instead,
is precisely the moment. But with violence and fierce decisiveness. Right
to the very end.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
14. <I>Always be close to strong men</I>. They give you voluntarily,
or they always let you take, a part of their useful forces. They enrich
all who approach them. If those who are strong should take some of your
strength (which rarely happens), it's not bad, for they won't lose that
force, but use it, and your force, having been utilized by them, will
create others that will be at your service. There is, therefore, always
profit for you in living close to strong people.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The weak, those who are depressing, besides depressing disheartening
discouraging and rendering your forces anemic, suck off your forces
sometimes with the intention of utilizing them, but they aren't able to do
so and they waste them, leaving them in agony. This gives the contagion of
destruction to your other forces. Sometimes they suck off your forces with
the deceitful intention of not using them and just losing them. Betrayal
discourages and devalues your good forces. What they take away from you
is irremediably lost and harmful. Weak and depressing people (such as
Ada Negri) say: Don't make me laugh, because I don't want to have to
cry someday when remembering these happy hours!!!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
15. <I>Always use the antidote of happiness against all sufferings
and against all misfortunes</I>. When you lose someone dear to you
and are assailed with terrible suffering, use the surefire antidote of
revivifying obscenity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The mother of my friend Enif, a strong and energetic woman, tall,
powerful, sixty years old, of distinguished personality and will, loves
the lottery games to the point that she will almost ruin herself with a
big weekly game. Yet she never opens the envelopes that the office of the
lottery system sends her. Even though she's a subscriber! I think that
she does it to maintain, within herself, that hope-almost-certainty of
winning from one moment to the next. In effect she is a subscriber to the
pleasure of being able to get the winning combination of numbers. This
is artificial optimism. <I>She doesn't open the envelopes</I> because
what matters to her most is this continual probability of winning, which
gives her a continuous optimism, and because when she actually opens the
envelopes she experiences a series of sorrows in finding out that she
hasn't won. This woman of superior instinct lives quite intelligently in
her isolated villa at Spazzavento, content and calm, without melancholy,
with her nerves



in good health. She is also given over to social pleasures, which is to
say to the better life that she leads by means of her telephone, which
gives her the certainty of communicating with everybody. So she lives
in almost absolute solitude, but with a sense of society and a wider
life  concentrated in the telephone that communicates with Florence,
Milan, etc. The enormous importance that the telephone has in her
dining room in the solitary villa. She once told me that in her worst
moments of sorrow she was fond of composing obscene popular songs. This
is strange, given that she never speaks obscenities herself and is not
given over to salacious tales. It is the antidote of sorrow. The best
antidote, because obscenity is happy and funny, energetically chasing
and burning away sorrow and disgrace, which are always full of chastity
and the austerity of physical renunciation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
16. <I>Always take the initiative in everything</I>. In America there
are schools of initiative. Every day and several times a day a prize is
given with little sums of money to the student who knows his lesson. There
are no punishments, but one is rewarded with money. The hours outside of
class and the vacations are used by the students in earning as much money
as they can, in all honest ways and with every possible effort. Thus,
in the twelve-year-old student, for example, are awakened the desire
and the skill for living on one's own according to one's own instinct,
intuition, judgment. An admirable way to develop the spirit of business
and commercial initiative in a young boy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
17. <I>Take into account the forces of Fortune and the forces of
Misfortune</I>, which is to say all the favorable and all the unfavorable
forces that are not yet well known, <I>but exist</I>. Napoleon believed
that his generals would prove <I>able in times of war</I> to the degree
that they proved <I>intelligent in times of peace</I>, and more <I>or
less unfortunate or fortunate</I>. Their good luck or bad luck was the
more important point of view for judging them.

sollevarsi il mitragliere che era coricato dietro pancia a terra e tentare
di alzarsi. Ha nel petto e nel ventre un buco enorme squarciato di 30
centimetri di diametro che schizza sangue a fiotti a rivoli a destra a
sinistra inondando la strada piena d'acqua che si arrossa tutta. Le tre
mitragliatrici sono spaccate rovesciate gli altri mitraglieri fuggono
nelle case vicino fra le biciclette che avevano messe sotto i portici. Il
mitragliere morto impigliato sanguinosamente nel suo trepiede &egrave;
schiacciato dalla mia blindata che passa sopra. Porto via nella mia
blindata 2 trepiedi. Sono alti un palmo fissi. Il mitragliere tira pancia
a terra. Ho le gomme sfasciate. Fragore di fucileria. Inseguimento nelle

lo pugnala contro la porta chiusa d'una casa.

Le altre 3 mitragliere che ci bersagliavano nascoste nel granoturco sulla

<a NAME="FOOT3" HREF="#REF3">3</A>.
A brief description of the diaries is given by Alberto Bertoni, "Nota
sui criteri di edizione," in Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, <I>Taccuini</I>,
ed. Alberto Bertoni (Bologna: Il Mulino, 1987), lix. References to
Bertoni's editorial discussion are made with the abbreviation "NSC," while
references to the diaries themselves are given as <I>T</I>. Bertoni's
discussion, it should be noted, is based on the study of microfilms
alone, rather than the documents themselves; some of the diaries are in
fact composite documents that have been formed from the residual parts
of what were originally two and sometimes more notebooks, which is to
say, separate and autonomous documents stemming from quite different
periods. We hope to present elsewhere a fuller discussion of the diaries,
their composition, and their present constitution.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT4" HREF="#REF4">4</A>.
In reality Bertoni was remarkably inconsistent in following his own
editorial criteria. For example, he publishes a second version of
Marinetti's "Manifesto Politico" (430-31), but does not include the
first one (passage 3 here); also, he publishes half of Marinetti's dream
description that will be the basis for the novel <I>Gli Indomabili</I>
(The untamed; 1922) (503-4), but omits the second half of the
same dream.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT5" HREF="#REF5">5</A>.
Passage 23, it should be emphasized, was included by Bertoni in his
edition of the notebooks, (<I>T</I>, 510-11). This is the only
passage given here that has been previously published, and its inclusion
is based on its intrinsic interest.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Debate about the nature and significance of the historical avant-garde
has reached an almost feverish pitch in the last decade, its intensity
clearly a sign that more is at stake than academic questions of historical
accuracy or comprehensiveness. Like an antique mirror from which the
mercury has seeped and faded, the avant-garde has become the ambiguous
glass in which we seem to scrutinize a perplexing image of ourselves,
an image that is haunting precisely because it is simultaneously so
alike and unlike, because it bears so many of the features by which
we recognize ourselves and the contemporary cultural milieu, even as
it also evokes a world that is already feathered at the edges, has
already receded irretrievably into the past, is already remote. While
it would be impossible to catalogue all the salient features that have
been held to define the avant-garde or its significance for today, two
questions have gradually acquired especial importance in the course
of recent critical discussion: one, the extent to which, to use Peter
B&uuml;rger's formulation, the avant-garde "can be defined as an attack
on the status of art in bourgeois society," or as B&uuml;rger further
clarifies, an assault on "art as an institution that is unassociated
with the life praxis of men";
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 and the other, the ways in which that attack overlaps with the
 avant-garde's use of motifs, materials, and artifacts from mass or
 popular culture, a usage that has been dismissed by Marxist critics as
 "a colonization of other, formerly independent" cultural practices,
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 or defended by others for its "subvert[ing]...the hierarchical
 distinctions between high art and mass culture," or for its proposing a
 "critique, not only of

<B></B>

prevailing market conditions, but also of the futility of the Symbolist
[or high-art] response to these conditions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These views may sound either glib or unduly dogmatic in their bold
assertiveness: and while partly that results from disembedding quotations
from their context, partly it reflects the growing polarization, the
increasingly schematic formulations that have characterized recent
discussion about the historical avant-garde. Yet such well-defined
dichotomies prove strangely inadequate when tested against the complex
social realities informing the interaction among avant-garde, elite
bourgeois, and popular cultures in the formative moments of modernism
and the avant-garde, an interaction that might be traced in many cultural
exchanges of the period, but perhaps nowhere better than in the dialogue
of actions that took place between Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Ezra
Pound during the period 1912 to 1914. Marinetti, after all, is typically
viewed as one of the founding fathers of the historical avant-garde, his
creation of Futurism in 1909 considered one of its paradigmatic moments.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Pound too is widely treated as a representative of the avant-garde,
 sometimes in contrast to Eliot with his more symbolist or modernist
 style, sometimes by virtue of his role in the formation of first
 Imagism, then Vorticism, the two movements in the Anglo-American literary
 tradition which that nearly resemble the Continental avant-gardes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For the most part, however, critics have paired Marinetti with Pound
only in order to dismiss the importance of the connection, and in doing
so they have largely been following a script that originated with Pound
himself. Writing anonymously in 1917, T. S. Eliot had already set a
precedent followed by subsequent critics when he characterized Pound's
relationship to Futurism as one of implacable but informed opposition:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Pound has perhaps done more than anyone to keep Futurism out of
England. His antagonism to this movement was the first which was due not
merely to unintelligent dislike for anything that was new, and was due
to his perception that Futurism was incompatible with any principles of
form. In his own words, Futurism is "accelerated impressionism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot, in these remarks, was not rehearsing a history that he had
witnessed first-hand, given that he had arrived in England more than two
months after Marinetti's final visit in June of 1914, and it is more than
likely that these comments were dictated or suggested to him by Pound.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Yet Eliot's assessment--or more accurately, Pound's own--has been
 repeated at face value again and again. "Pound was never a Futurist,"
 writes Noel Stock, the appointed biographer of Pound, and he remained
 "indifferent or opposed to most of their principles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Pound, states James Wilhelm, "was strongly opposed...to the
 gimmick-ridden futurists with their odes to automobiles and desire to
 sweep away all existing art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Both scholars, it is true, concede that Futurism may have stimulated
 Pound's thinking, but only insofar as it coincided with a general climate
 of "artistic rebellion" (Wilhelm) that was "[already] 'in the air,'"

<B></B>

(Stock), or only insofar as Futurism may have led Pound to think:
"...something saner might succeed" (Wilhelm). Such remarks bespeak a
puzzling wish to dismiss the possibility that Marinetti may have played
a role in Pound's development, a wish so fervent that it has transformed
itself into fact.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Consider the standard edition of Pound's <I>Selected Letters</I>,
 first published in 1950, a volume that includes two letters in which
 Pound explicitly refers to Marinetti by name, both from 1915; in
 their published versions, however, the first is presented without the
 sentence that mentions Marinetti, while the second is given with the name
 "Marinetti" disred into "Mennetti."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If it is true, as the logic of post-structuralism asserts, that every
erasure will leave its trace in such a way that the very thing one is
trying to exclude is disclosed as the hidden center of a contaminated
order, then it will come as no surprise to suggest that Marinetti, far
from merely prompting Pound to issue or encourage hostile remarks about
Futurism, may have stood behind two of the most significant turning points
in Pound's career. In the course of its activities in London during the
period 1912 to 1914, Futurism gradually mounted a sustained interrogation
of the concept of aesthetic autonomy, blurring the boundaries of a
category formerly deemed to be self-evident, precipitating a species of
legitimation crisis in the concept of art itself. Yet this crisis was
not purely or solely conceptual in nature, but derived its special power
from the ways in which Marinetti's activities elided and confused the
distinctions separating different spheres of cultural production--most
important, those associated with art and those with the production of
entertainment as a commodity. The effect of Futurism on Pound and the
London avant-garde was to make the social space of cultural production
into an urgent question, to problematize the settings in which the
work--the business, if you will--of modernism and the avant-garde might
get done. It was no longer the polite salon or the genteel review, it
seemed for a moment, but the concert hall, the mass-circulation newspaper,
or perhaps the music-hall that might serve as the new agora of literary
and cultural debate. But only for a moment. For the efforts to address
the new challenges raised by Marinetti also proved to be failures:
paradoxically, in other words, the twin turning points in the career of
Pound and the London avant-garde were significant not because they led
to the resolution of an intractable problem, but because they revealed
themselves as dead ends--and dead ends not just for Pound's poetic or
intellectual development, but for the avant-garde as a viable cultural
institution. It was when this was finally understood that the avant-garde
turned elsewhere: turned, that is to say, to a third alternative in which
the opposition between elite and popular culture, or between art and
commodity, could be resolved in a brief but uneasy synthesis--resolved,
one might almost say, by the creation of the avant-garde itself; or
resolved in such a way that we, who live on the other side of that
dramatic moment, have inherited a conceptual and institutional impasse
that will probably remain unresolved for quite some time to come.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though Marinetti's activities in London prior to World War I have been
poorly chronicled, they can be reconstructed in considerable detail.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 What emerges is a portrait of some complexity, one that shows an
 ongoing dialogue between Marinetti's evolution and a rapidly changing
 intellectual and social milieu. Marinetti visited and lectured in London
 at four distinct moments. The first was in 1910, when he delivered
 several lectures to the Lyceum Club for Women, then located at 128
 Piccadilly. Pound, however, was away from London when these took place,
 and the little attention that they received makes it unlikely that he
 heard about them upon his return.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 The second and more important of Marinetti's visits to England occurred
 in the spring of 1912, when he appeared in conjunction with the first
 exhibition of Futurist paintings at the Sackville Gallery, located at
 28 Sackville Street and owned by Max Rothschild.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Even before the show opened on 1 March, it was attracting media attention
 prompted by reports about the controversy it had provoked during its run
 in Paris. Most of the coverage came from mass circulation newspapers,
 dailies and weeklies--<I>The Daily Mirror</I> (7 February), <I>The
 Sketch</I> (14 February), and <I>The Illustrated London News</I>
 (17 February).
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 On the day before the opening of the exhibition, Sir Philip Burne-Jones
 offered his view of Futurism in an interview that appeared in the
 <I>Pall Mall Gazette</I>, and his comments anticipated the terms of
 subsequent debate. Burne-Jones termed the exhibition "something hideous
 and incompetent" and dubbed the Futurists "a band of maniacs."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 But when challenged to defend his assertions a few days later by Max
 Rothschild, Burne-Jones retracted his specific comments about individual
 works and formal practices, only to reassert a more fundamental
 critique. He should not have commented on the exhibition at all, he said
 now: it wasn't "really worthwhile discussing the matter seriously"
 because "we are not dealing with Art in any form." The Futurist
 paintings, he summarized, were "outside the pale of Art altogether."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 This was the question that Futurism would press to its ultimate
 consequence: where was the pale, the boundaryline, of Art?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The stage for a confrontation had been set, and when the show opened
the next day it set off an avalanche of newspaper reviews, commentary,
and publicity. In part the exhibition attracted so much and such intense
discussion because it coincided with a deepening political crisis. On the
day that it opened, more than one million miners led by self-declared
syndicalists declared a strike that seemed to threaten vital natural
resources in an unprecedented way. Newspapers called the day "Black
Friday," suggesting a religious cataclysm, and printed cartoons such
as one that portrays a massive Satanic re with hairy arms, cloven
hooves, and the word STRIKE written across his emaciated chest, who
strides across a coalyard and infuses the spirit of chaos among a crowd
of tiny humans fleeing in fright. The title above reads "BLACK FRIDAY,
1912," while below is a second title, "THE MASQUE OF ANARCHY," a reference
to the unions' anarchist-syndicalist leaders.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Simultaneously, militant suffragists suddenly intensified their
 window-breaking campaign, an activity that left contemporaries profoundly
 shocked.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 By a kind of metonymy facilitated by the modern newspaper's juxtaposition
 of disparate events, Futurism was becoming

<B></B>

the cipher of a contemporary crisis, and it was in this tense environment
that Marinetti himself arrived, ready to give his lecture of 19 March
at Bechstein Hall.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Ironically, it would mark a turning point in the career not of Marinetti,
 but of Ezra Pound.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By a curious coincidence, Ezra Pound was also giving a lecture on 19
March 1912, the second in a series of three. The talk that he planned
for that day was one that encapsulated the central motifs of his
career to that point. From the moment when he had arrived in London
in late 1908, Pound had welded his claims to literary authority with
the poetry and culture of Provence. The first poem he had published in
England had been a sestina, a verse form from Provence, that depicted the
Proven&ccedil;al poet Bertrans de Born, while his first books of poetry
(<I>Personae, Exultations</I>, and <I>Canzoni</I>) had offered readers
a steady diet of sestinas, albas, planhs, ballatas, madrigales, and
tenzoni. His first work of critical prose had treated the same subject,
the poetry of Provence. Pound had established his earliest literary
identity by offering readers a species of erudite exoticism, recondite
material updated with pungent <I>obiter dicta</I>, a learned mode of
writing that could appeal only to an upper-middle-class audience with
significant cultural capital (to use Bourdieu's term) and ambitious
cultural aspirations. As one approving reviewer of <I>Canzoni</I> put
it, Pound had become "The Modern Troubadour."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 It was a telling oxymoron: Pound had become a living archaism. For
 just as the sestina and the canzone were literary genres linked with a
 distinctly courtly lifestyle, so the troubadour presupposed an aulic mode
 of cultural production--something poles apart from the late industrial
 society in which Pound actually lived.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet if Pound could be accurately described as a form of living archaism,
perhaps it was because he was living archaically. Though Pound had
generally received warm reviews of his early verse, he had also soon
learned that his writings could scarcely earn a sufficient income. Indeed,
he would not have been able to survive had it not been for the stroke
of good fortune that befell him in March 1910, when he was introduced
to Margaret Cravens, a thirty-year-old American expatriate bohemian--a
member of the aristocracy of sensibility, in other words--studying music
in Paris and a friend of the pianist Walter Morse Rummel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Two days after they met, Cravens offered to become his patron. The
 evidence suggests that he received about $1,000, or &#163;200 per
 annum, a sum that was neither mean nor quite princely. On the eve of
 World War I in England, the average wage for the adult male industrial
 worker was about &#163;75 per annum, whereas the average annual income
 of the salaried class was &#163;340. The gap between these res
 represented the divide between the working class and the whole of the
 rest of society, a great and accepted gulf that one historian has termed
 "the major social fact of the day."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Patronage meant that Pound's tent was pitched just on the other side
 of that gulf, yet never far from the abyss that yawned behind him. On
 12 March 1912--one week before Marinetti's lecture, and his own--Pound
 reported to his prospective father-in-law that his income from his
 writings had risen to &#163;38 for four months, a re that would
 yield &#163;114 per annum;

<B></B>

in addition, he had recently secured a contract with a publishing firm
that guaranteed him another &#163;100 per annum. Together with his
&#163;200 from Cravens, he noted proudly, his income amounted to "about
&#163;400 per year, with reasonable chance of increase." To be sure,
"this would not go very far in England," but at least he was approaching
the promised land of the salaried class.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is in this context that we can best understand Pound's plans to
lecture in March 1912, for these were plainly conceived in order to
supplement his income. The strategy was clear enough: by presenting a
series of lectures with limited admission and relatively high prices per
ticket, one could maximize the returns from the small audience for poetry,
capitalizing on its appeal as a marker of social distinction. The series
would comprise three lectures, each at 10s. 6d., or the whole series
at &#163;1 1s. With the hall or salon furnished by a well-to-do friend,
there were no expenses to cover, and if the house was full, even with the
audience limited to fifty people, Pound would earn between &#163;50 and
&#163;60. The site for the series was the "private gallery" of Lord and
Lady Glenconner, located at 34 Queen Anne's Gate, a sedate residential
street in one of the choicest locations in London, parallel to the
southwestern edge of Saint James' Park. Then, as now, the street was a
museum of eighteenth-century architecture: its houses, all built around
1704, were handsome three-story buildings with brick fronts and interiors
that retained many of their original furnishings--oak staircases, carved
wood panelling with pediments over doorways, marble fireplaces, and so
on. The nearby residents were no less choice, with Lady Assheton-Smith
the owner and occupant of no. 30, and Dowager Lady Allendale residing
next door at no. 32.

Admission to Pound's lectures was almost as difficult to obtain as a
house on Queen Anne's Gate, and care was taken to distinguish it from
other offerings of the contemporary economy. The program announcing
the lectures, for example, was privately distributed. Tickets were not
commodities that could be purchased, but favors that might be courteously
requested. "TICKETS may be obtained on application to Lady Low," stated
the program. Lady Ann Penelope Low, the daughter of General Robert Percy
Douglas, 4th baronet, had been widowed in 1905 and now resided at 23
De Vere Gardens amid a row of houses nestled just off the southern
corner of Kensington Gardens, where she kept an informal salon and
sponsored "evenings at home." A close friend of Olivia Shakespear,
the mother of Pound's fianc&eacute;e, Lady Low frequented a circle of
upper-middle-class intellectuals such as G. W. Prothero, editor of <I>The
Quarterly Review</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Here was the realm of elite bourgeois culture in which Pound's career
 had been fashioned prior to 1912: a world withdrawn from public life
 and insulated from the grim imperatives of a commodity economy, a
 sphere in which literary culture had been largely privatized, serving
 as a medium of exchange for an exiguous aristocracy of sensibility,
 a court of intellect. Access to this world was strictly controlled:
 the audience, as the program noted, was "limited to FIFTY" (<A
 HREF="1.3rainey02_1.html"> 1</A>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pound's three lectures were scheduled for the 14, 19, and 21 of March,
and immediately after the first one he wrote his father to report his
success: "Have just got my

<B></B>

first lecture off my chest and am ready to rest. Have cleaned up $90
so far."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Yet there were some obvious disadvantages to these proceedings, which
 required that Pound maintain good relations with a network of people
 with influence and power, people who could oblige others to attend his
 lectures, and it left him little room to provoke an audience on whose
 good will he was patently dependent. Further, his access to these
 circles was mediated largely by Olivia Shakespear, creating private
 tensions and constraints that must have been all but unbearable. That
 there were other avenues to an audience would become apparent in the
 unexpected events that attended Pound's second lecture, the one scheduled
 for Tuesday, 19 March 1912.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The topic of Pound's first lecture of 14 March had been Guido
Cavalcanti. His second was to treat "Provence, A.D. 1190: Arnaut
Daniel." Pound was on familiar ground here, discussing the master of
"trobar clus" or "closed verse," the most hermetic vein of troubadour
poetry. Characterizing such poems two months later in an essay based on
this very lecture, Pound would write: "They are good art as the high
mass is good art," works that must be "approached as ritual" because
they sought "to make their revelations to those who are already expert."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Pound, very plainly, was describing not just the work of Arnaut Daniel,
 but his own poetry as well. His lecture on Daniel, his poems and his
 audience, was a wholly self-referential discourse that bespoke its
 own situation. Appropriately--and yet how ironic, when compared with
 Marinetti's lecture that same day--the program for Pound's lecture
 stated that he would discuss Daniel's "possible relation to the Art of
 to-day." (Like Philip Burne-Jones, Pound still conceived of art with
 a capital A.) The time was set for 3:30 p.m.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the morning of the lecture he received a letter from his
fianc&eacute;e, who told him that she would be attending a lecture
that evening--not his, however. She was going "to hear Marinetti
lecture...about les Futuristes" at Bechstein Hall.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 This was Pound's first experience of ephemeral seduction, seeing
 first-hand the powerful allure of art conceived as public practice,
 as a spectacle capable of attracting an audience much larger than
 fifty, as performance capable of arousing widespread curiosity, debate,
 desire. The next day must have been unforgettable for an avid reader of
 newspapers such as Pound. Not a one took note of "Provence, A.D. 1190:
 Arnaut Daniel." But Marinetti's performance was fully reported in
 the morning edition of <I>The Daily Chronicle</I>, with a headline
 reading "'Futurist' Leader in London," accompanied by the subtitle,
 "Makes an Attack on the English Nation." The next day a second article
 on Marinetti appeared in <I>The Morning Leader</I>, while yet a third
 was published on the second page of <I>The Times</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Odder still, Marinetti had not flattered his audience, but berated it,
 castigating the English as "a nation of sycophants and snobs, enslaved
 by old worm-eaten traditions, social conventions, and romanticism." And
 though <I>The Times</I> reported that "some of his audience begged for
 mercy," <I>The Daily Chronicle</I> noted that "the long-haired gentlemen
 in the stalls and the ladies with Rossetti eyes and lips rewarded him
 with their laughter and applause." Still another observer, writing a
 year later, recalled an audience that "wildly applauded his outspoken
 derision of all their cherished national characteristics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti's lecture achieved instant notoriety. After only six weeks in
England, he reported in mid-April, the Futurists had elicited 350 articles
in newspapers and reviews and had earned more than 11,000 francs in sales
($2,200 or &#163;440).
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 More important, Marinetti had achieved his success not by addressing
 only an educated elite, but by speaking in a public forum to a wider
 audience. Whereas tickets to each of Pound's lectures had uniformly cost
 10s. 6d., only the most expensive tickets to Marinetti's lecture had cost
 that much, and the lowest-priced tickets had sold for 1s.; and whereas
 Pound's audience had been deliberately "limited to FIFTY," Marinetti's
 may have reached five hundred. (Seating capacity at Bechstein Hall was
 five hundred and fifty.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Still more important, Marinetti's real audience had become not just
 the people who attended his performance in Bechstein Hall, but the
 millions who read about it in <I>The Daily Chronicle</I>, <I>The Morning
 Leader</I> and <I>The Times</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nothing could have made plainer the value of a concerted polemical
onslaught, the formation of a collective identity buttressed by
theatricality and publicity. Sometime in March 1912--it may have been
before Marinetti's lecture, though it was certainly <I>after</I> the
outbreak of publicity surrounding the Futurist exhibition--Pound sent off
the manuscript for his next book of poetry, <I>Ripostes</I>. At the end
of the volume he included a brief statement, since famous as the first
public reference to Imagism: "As for the future, <I>Les Imagistes</I>, the
descendants of the forgotten school of 1909, have that in their keeping."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 The use of French, <I>Les Imagistes</I>, to designate the new "school"
 is an obvious echo of the linguistic practice that had led Dorothy
 Shakespear to describe her plans "to hear Marinetti lecture in French,
 about les Futuristes," just as Dorothy's practice had been almost a
 consequence of Marinetti's

<B></B>

own. As Marinetti did not speak English, he delivered all his lectures
in French while in England; and as he also wrote the original versions
for the early Futurist manifestos in French, at least in part because
French was still the lingua franca of European intellectual exchange, it
was natural to speak about him in French as well. It was also the French
version of new manifestos that Marinetti routinely mailed to British
critics and journalists, and while mass circulation dailies translated
quotations into English, the intellectual and cultural weeklies usually
cited the French directly. When Pound, therefore, first announces the
creation of Imagism ("As for the future, <I>Les Imagistes</I>...have
that in their keeping"), he uses a conjunction of terms ("future" and
the name of a movement in French) that plainly signals their provenance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pound's subsequent steps toward art as public practice came in the wake
of three events, all of them precipitating a collapse of the "courtly"
structure of cultural production that had characterized Pound's milieu
until now. In June 1912 Margaret Cravens committed suicide, leaving
Pound without the financial support that had sustained him for the
last two years and reinforced his aulic self-conception. In late
October, the publishing firm that had guaranteed him &#163;100 per
year collapsed. Pound was back to where he had started, and it was not
a matter he could easily forget: &#163;500 per annum, his prospective
mother-in-law advised him in September, was the minimum it would take
for him to marry her daughter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 In late September, too, Pound learned that Edward Marsh was assembling
 an anthology designed to present the recent work of younger poets as
 a collective project, the Georgians.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 By December it had already become clear that the volume was going to be
 a remarkable success. Impelled by these events, Pound began to launch
 Imagism in a more systematic and serious way.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On 18 August and sometime in October he sent off poems by himself and
H. D. to <I>Poetry</I> magazine, characterizing them as "Imagiste."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 In December he wrote an essay that surveyed contemporary poetry in
 London--the essay was published in January 1913--and contained his
 second public reference to Imagism, a description that ran for two
 brief paragraphs. Imagism was "the youngest school here that has the
 nerve to call itself a school."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The aggressive tone was at odds with the tentative definitions
 that followed, a contradiction already apparent in the diction. For
 "school" was a term that Marinetti had used in his earliest writings
 on Futurism in 1909, but subsequently rejected for its associations
 with the taxonomies of academic art history, instead adopting the
 term "movement." Indeed, Pound's presentation of "Imagism" implicitly
 underscored its differences from Futurism. Imagism rejected Futurism's
 ethos of collective identity: a school was something more informal,
 more casual, more individualistic, the fortuitous outcome of "two
 or three young men agree[ing], more or less, to call certain things
 good." Imagism also shunned the kind of programmatic ambitions associated
 with Futurism: "a school does not mean in the least that one writes
 poetry to a theory." (Saying this, Pound was echoing contemporary
 reviewers who had complained that Futurist paintings were "rather a
 theoretic extension than a spontaneous development.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Instead Pound stressed the purely technical nature of Imagism: "Their
 watchword was Precision" and they

<B></B>

sought "to produce a good single line" or just "a good short" poem. They
opposed only "interminable effusions." Yet who, after all, would want
to defend interminable effusions? Imagism, in short, was a movement
to end movements: informal, antitheoretical, absorbed in matters of
writerly technique and averse to more global programs that linked poetry
to contemporary social transformations or posed questions about the
status and functions of art. Though Imagism is commonly treated as the
first avant-garde movement in Anglo-American literature, it was really
the first anti-avant-garde movement. And Pound's subsequent efforts to
define Imagism only accentuated these features. In an essay published
two months later in March 1913, written by Pound though printed under
the signature of F. S. Flint, Pound made the opposition of Imagism and
Futurism explicit:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The <I>imagistes</I> admitted that they were contemporaries of the
Post Impressionists and the Futurists; but they had nothing in common
with these schools. They had not published a manifesto. They were not
a revolutionary school; their only endeavor was to write in accordance
with the best tradition, as they found it in the best writers of all
time,--in Sappho, Catullus, Villon.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Accompanying this essay was another, this one signed by Pound, "A Few
Don'ts By an Imagiste," a title implicitly in opposition to the genre
of the manifesto.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 It was a timid response to the challenges raised by the Futurist presence
 in London, and in a moment of candor in 1927, Pound himself recalled the
 creation of Imagism in the most mundane terms: "The name was invented to
 launch H. D. and Aldington before either had enough stuff for a volume."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The launching and marketing of a new product--was this all that was at
 stake in the creation of Imagism?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Formulating the question this way fails to acknowledge the complications
and unexpected consequences that were entailed in this novel use of
publicity and advertising in connection with culture, creating new
pressures that became increasingly apparent in the course of Marinetti's
last two visits to England in late 1913 and early 1914. For Pound these
visits were important because Marinetti was increasingly shifting the
front of his activity from the visual arts to literature: in May 1912 he
published the "Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature," in August
the "Response to Objections"; in June and November 1913 he issued the
"Destruction of Syntax--Imagination without strings [or: Wireless
Imagination]--Words-in-Freedom;" in October, "The Variety Theater."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 English readers were kept abreast. In September 1913 the journal
 <I>Poetry and Drama</I>, edited by Harold Monro, devoted an entire
 issue to examining Futurism. (Its previous issue, notably, had devoted
 only a paragraph to Imagism.) The issue included a translation
 of "L'immaginazione senza fili ("Imagination without strings" or
 "wireless imagination")," as well as almost thirty pages of poems by
 Aldo Palazzeschi, Paolo Buzzi, and Marinetti himself. And in a long
 editorial, Monro praised Marinetti warmly, hailing him for auguring a
 dissolution of the distinction between poetry and popular culture, art
 and life. Rhapsodizing about the sheer size of futurism's audience--in
 Italy it had "gained the support of no

<B></B>

less than 22,000 adherents" ("V," 263)--Monro became positively
breathless at the thought that <I>I poeti futuristi</I>  had sold
35,000 copies ("V," 264). This fact in itself, Monro said, constituted
"Marinetti's most interesting attitude" ("V," 264). Here, in other
words, was poetry that was no longer written "for...close and studious
scrutiny by the eye" ("V," 264), or poetry "no longer... withheld from the
people" by "educationalists," "intellectuals," or the commercial press
("V," 265), but poetry intended "for the ear," "for immediate and wide
circulation" ("V," 264), poetry "regaining some of its popular appeal"
("V," 265). Single-handedly, Marinetti was restoring poetry to its status
in an earlier era, an age when "the minstrel and the ballad-monger then
represented our modern Northcliffe" ("V," 265). But Monro's reference to
Northcliffe inadvertently signalled some of the tensions latent in the
collapse of life and art that he wished to celebrate: for now it seemed
that there was no longer a meaningful distinction between poetry and the
most ephemeral of commodities, the daily newspaper. Those tensions would
be fully exposed in the course of Marinetti's last two visits to London.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Monro's remarks prefaced Marinetti's arrival in London by two months. Once
again, for six days in November 1913, Marinetti gave daily lectures and
readings that attracted substantial audiences and media attention. Now,
however, Marinetti began to press his attack against elite bourgeois
culture to new limits, assaulting the very principles that had once
grounded his own thinking--principles that still grounded Pound's
own. Already in the "Founding and Manifesto of Futurism" of 1909 Marinetti
had urged that contemporary art be responsive to continuous change and
innovation, emphasizing temporality in a way that tended to blur the
distinction between art and fashion; yet he had hesitated to draw the
logical conclusion that art itself was not an eternal absolute.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 To the contrary, as late as 1911 he could still charge that his critics
 feared him precisely because of his defense of art as an absolute:
 "Perhaps they saw, shining from our eyes, the glorious passion that we
 nurture for Art. [The capital <I>A</I> is Marinetti's own.] To art, in
 fact, which merits and which demands the sacrifice of the best, we give
 a love that is absolute...."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 But as early as the "Technical Manifesto" of mid-May 1912 he had begun
 to sound a new note: "Courageously let us set about making the 'ugly'
 in literature, and let us kill solemnity everywhere. Go away! don't
 listen to me with the air of great priests! Every day it is necessary
 to spit on the <I>Altar of Art!</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 And now, in the new lectures that he gave in late 1913, Marinetti pursued
 his conclusions to their ultimate consequences. He damned the sacred
 conception of art: "Art is not a religion," he was quoted as saying on
 17 November at the Poets' Club, "not something to be worshipped with
 joined hands." Instead it "should express all the intensity of life--its
 beauty...its sordidness," and "the very complex of our life to-day"
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 (Pound himself may have attended this lecture, as it is certain many
 of his friends did).
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Three days later, <I>The Daily Mail</I> would publish Marinetti's
 manifesto, "The Variety Theatre" or "Le Music-Hall," with its
 intransigent vindication of a despised and popular cultural form. "The
 music hall," wrote Marinetti, " is naturally anti-academic, primitive,
 and ingenuous, and therefore the more significant for the unexpectedness
 of its experiments

<B></B>

and the simplicity of its means.... It destroys the solemn the sacred,
the serious and the sublime of Art with a capital <I>A</I>."

When Marinetti returned to England six months later in May and June of
1914, he was given a chance to put his theories into effect. In June
Marinetti was booked to appear at the Coliseum for an entire week, from
Monday 15 June to Saturday 21 June, twice daily. By now Marinetti had
acquired an almost extraordinary stature in the life of the commercial
press. Mass circulation weeklies such as <I>The Sketch</I> and <I>The
Graphic</I> assiduously reported his doings and sayings. His mocking
self-portrait, an assemblage of discarded pieces of wood attached to a
wire-brush, the bristles of which represented his hair, was featured on
the front cover of the weekly <I>Sketch</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 His views on "Futurist" clothes made headlines, and his every lecture
 was greeted with warm good humor or respectful earnestness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Major newspapers were even competing for advance news stories about
 the "Futurist Music," and three days before the premier <I>The Pall
 Mall Gazette</I> featured a front-page story that was labelled a
 "'P.M.G.' Special" about the rehearsals.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 It was a major event indeed when Marinetti had agreed to introduce
 Luigi Russolo and his notorious noisetuners, or <I>intonarumori</I>
 (<A HREF="1.3rainey02_2.html"> 2</A>). Marinetti was crossing
 the boundary into a realm of cultural practice where "traditional art"
 had seldom been seen.

For the Coliseum was not just a music hall in the traditional
sense. Its construction and organization had epitomized a set of new
developments transforming the world of Edwardian entertainment. Its
site on St. Martin's Lane had been selected by Oswald Stoll, the most
successful of Edwardian theatrical entrepreneurs, precisely because
it stood directly across from the exit of Charing Cross station,
all but addressing the crowds of respectable, prosperous people
who poured into the metropolis on a day's shopping excursion (<A
HREF="1.3rainey02_3.html"> 3</A>). Such people might be glad of
an afternoon or evening's entertainment, Stoll had reasoned. They were
"middle-class people for whom a visit to a serious play might seem too
ambitious and a visit to a music-hall far too racy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 This was the audience whom Stoll sought to please, presenting them a
 sanitized version of the music hall, a "Palace of Variety" that offered,
 in the words of

<B></B>

its program, "the social advantages of the refined and elegant
surroundings of a Club."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Stoll's theater was part of a wider trend that was changing the music
 hall from a form of entertainment rooted in the culture of working and
 lower-middle classes and instead assimilating it to the tastes of a
 middle class increasingly defined by consumerism. His Coliseum, which
 opened in 1904, was the biggest and most lavish music hall in London. Its
 seating capacity was nearly 4,000, its stage and proscenium the largest
 ever built, and its architecture impossible to ignore: the centerpiece
 was a massive tower that soared into the air, topped by eight cupids who
 held a revolving globe with the name "COLISEUM" in electric lights. Here
 was something to "to catch the attention of those prosperous shoppers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Here was culture as consumption, art as entertainment, and here was the
 place where Marinetti would complete his last performance in England
 (<A HREF="1.3rainey02_4.html"> 4</A>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The show, paradoxically, was not successful. And contemporary observers
understood the reasons immediately. Reviewing the premiere performance,
<I>The Times</I> wrote:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Signor Marinetti rather mistook his audience yesterday afternoon, when
he tried to deliver an academic exposition of Futurist principles at the
Coliseum, and he had, in consequence, to put up with a rude reception
from a gallery which seemed fully qualified to give him a lesson in his
own "Art of Noises."

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti indeed "mistook his audience," ultimately in two different yet
related ways. One was historical. Marinetti had badly misunderstood the
nature of the music-hall itself. For Marinetti's sense of the music-hall
was derived largely from his experience in Italy, where it was still
a vital if troubled genre of urban popular culture, a hybrid form
addressing a public still in the course of transition from a largely
agrarian to a wholly urban lifestyle. It was a form that specifically
spoke to the hybridized experience of people who had recently migrated
to the metropolis, mingling motifs of the village carnival to treat the
dislocations of urban experience. But in the more advanced industrial
culture of England, where the wrenching process of urbanization had
been more fully assimilated, the music hall was already a corpse that
was experiencing a brief but spurious afterlife through its incorporation
into the "Palace of Variety," the new institution of an advancing consumer
economy. The music hall would soon be swept away by the outbreak of World
War I and the arrival of Hollywood cinema. In England, in other words,
the music hall was no longer a hybrid creation of popular culture, but
a prototype of mass commodity culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti's second mistake was theoretical. In the simplest terms,
he failed to see that quotation and bricolage are strictly one-way
streets. By this I mean that Marinetti's effort to appropriate,
legitimate, and transform a still illegitimate genre such as the music
hall had the effect not of delegitimating art, as he supposed, but of
reaffirming its legitimacy, insofar as it fostered belief not in the
value of this stake (e.g. the music hall) or that stake (e.g. classical
theater), but in the value of the game in which all the stakes are
assigned value at all.

 More concretely, from a position within the already legitimate domain
 of art or high culture it was possible for Marinetti to appropriate and
 legitimate practices of mass culture; but from within the illegitimate
 domain of mass culture, the Coliseum itself, there was no theoretical
 basis of critical distantiation by which to assimilate alien or
 heterogeneous cultural forms. What <I>The Times</I> reviewer termed an
 "academic exposition of Futurist principles" was precisely the kind of
 "serious" and self-reflective discourse that the Coliseum sought to
 exclude. And so it did. After fifteen minutes of Marinetti's first
 lecture the curtain was unceremoniously lowered--there was a danger,
 the stage manager later claimed, that "people would start throwing
 things" (<I>HSB</I>, 186). And for subsequent performances Stoll obliged
 Marinetti to include a gramophone playing records by Elgar, the most
 philistine of all composers, allegedly "to bring a little melody into
 the act."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Though Marinetti finished his run of one week, the Coliseum swiftly
 moved to compensate for the fiasco, bringing in George Robey as its next
 headliner, a performer almost as popular as Marie Lloyd. Marinetti's
 effort to assimilate the concept of art to that of the commodity
 had failed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If Imagism was an intellectual failure as an attempt to address the
pressures brought to bear by the forms of cultural practice that
Marinetti was introducing in England, then it must have been doubly
disappointing for Pound to find that his effort to assimilate those same
forms should meet with a different lack of success. For if we take it
that <I>Blast</I> did indeed incorporate the Futurist attack on high
art, that it presented itself as a kind of graphic counterpart of music
hall performance, then

<B></B>

its lack of critical and public acceptance is revealing. For contrary
to what later critics have suggested, contemporary critics were neither
angered nor provoked by <I>Blast</I>. They were simply bored, and bored
not because <I>Blast</I> was an incomprehensible novelty, but because
it was all too familiar. They said so, too, in contemporary reviews:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Almost all the pictures reproduced are (like the typesetting of the first
pages), Futurist in origin, and nothing else. And as for the productions
of the literary Vortices, these are not even so fresh as that.... All
it really is is a feeble attempt at being clever. <I>Blast</I> is a flat
affair. We haven't a movement here, not even a mistaken one.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And in perhaps the most cutting words of all, the same reviewer remarked:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Mr. Pound used to be quite interesting when he was a remote
pass&eacute;ist and wrote about the Proven&ccedil;al troubadours; but as
a revolutionary I would rather have Signor Marinetti, who is at any rate
a genuine hustler, whereas Mr. Pound assuming violence and ruthlessness
is as unimpressive in his movements as a man who is trying to use someone
else's coat as a pair of trousers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Blast</I> was indeed a dull affair, and the poems that Pound published
in it are among the dreariest he ever produced. His attempt to address and
provoke an audience through a programmatic polemical onslaught had proved
a conspicuous failure. And not just in aesthetic, but also in economic
terms. When Wyndham Lewis later recalled the brief moment when he was
the lion of London society as a result of <I>Blast</I> he remembered
how little it served him: "As a result of these sociable activities, I
did not sell a single picture, it is superfluous to say."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Initially, then, Marinetti's practical and theoretical activities in
London during the period 1912-14 had two related effects on Pound and what
has subsequently come to be termed the Anglo-American avant-garde. One
was to provoke a reconration of the relations among the institutions
in which the discourse of art and poetry had been produced until now,
forcing intellectuals and artists to come to terms with the role of new
institutions of mass culture and assess their bearings on the place of
art in a cultural marketplace being radically transformed. The other,
in so doing, was to precipitate a permanent collapse of the entire set
of distinctions between art and commodity, to effect a perceptible and
irreversible levelling of both within the single and amorphous category
of the commodity. Further, by late 1914 it was clear that the attempts to
address or resolve these dilemmas had proved to be failures, whether it
was the rearguard restoration effort of Imagism or the imitative gesture
of <I>Blast</I>. But if one could neither go back to reconstruct the
aristocracy of the salon nor go forward to embrace the egalitarianism of
the commodity, what solution was there? The answer, paradoxically, was
to do a little of both at once--to reconstruct an aristocracy, but to
reconstruct it within the world of the commodity. To accept, in other
words, the status of art as a commodity, even as it was simultaneously
transformed

<B></B>

into a special kind of commodity, a rarity capable of sustaining
investment value. Or to reformulate this, the answer to the levelling
effect precipitated by a consumer economy was to defer consumption
into the future, to transform it into investment; which is to say,
to encourage or even solicit the ephemeral seduction of the consumer
economy, acknowledging the status of art as commodity, but to postpone
and sublimate its consumption by turning it into an object of investment
whose value will be realized only in the future. Art, we might say,
becomes "news that stays news."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In concrete terms, this meant that what had once been an aristocracy of
patronsaloniers would now be replaced by an elite of patron-investors. For
the Anglo-American avant-garde, the future lay in the new patronage
provided by a small group of people such as John Quinn, Harriet Shaw
Weaver, Scofield Thayer, and James Sibley Watson, Jr. The actualization
of this new space within the commodity economy was achieved primarily
through the new and unprecedented use of two institutions that had
already existed for some time, but which now became central to an emerging
apparatus of cultural production: the little review and the limited or
deluxe edition, venues situated in a profoundly ambiguous social space,
simultaneously sequestered and semi-withdrawn from the larger institution
of publishing even while firmly embedded within the market economy. It
was in the little reviews--among them <I>The Little Review</I>, the
<I>Egoist</I> and the <I>Dial</I>--that the principal masterpieces of
the Anglo-American avant-garde would first be published. Likewise, their
second appearance was almost uniformly in limited editions of 200 copies
(such as <I>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</I>) or 254 copies (Eliot's <I>Ara Vos
Prec</I>), or 1,000 copies (<I>Ulysses</I>)--editions at the farthest
possible remove from the 35,000 copies of <I>I poeti futuristi</I>. And in
this new social space, the kind of publicization that had once been aimed
at a mass audience along the lines pursued by Marinetti and imitated by
<I>Blast</I> were no longer of use. Asked by Margaret Anderson in 1917 how
best to announce his collaboration on <I>The Little Review</I>, Pound now
replied: "IF it is any use for adv[ertising]. purposes, you may state that
a single copy of my first book has just fetched &#163;8 (forty dollars)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Similarly, seven years later when William Bird was drafting the
 prospectus for the first edition of <I>A Draft of XVI. Cantos</I>, Pound
 would urge the same argument: "Yr. best ad is the quiet statement that
 at auction recently a copy of Mr. P's [first book] 'A Lume Spento'
 published in 1908 at $1.00 (one dollar) was sold for $52.50."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 These remarks, far from advancing assertions of intrinsic aesthetic
 value based on the presupposition of Art, offer straightforward
 claims about the performance record of investments within a commodity
 economy: by 1917 <I>A Lume Spento</I> had been increasing in value
 at a rate of more than 50 percent a year, by 1924 at 28 percent a
 year. The same, it is implied, should now prove true of <I>The Little
 Review</I> or <I>A Draft of XVI. Cantos</I>. The reason to buy these
 is not necessarily to read them, but to be able to sell them--perhaps
 at a substantial profit. Readers, in short, are giving way to uneasy
 mixture of patron-investors, collectors, and speculators on the rare
 book market, all of these situated within a complex and highly unstable
 institutional space.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What the patron-investors provided with their generous subsidies and
endowments was an institutional sphere that was momentarily immune to the
pressures of a market economy, partially removed from the constraints
of an expansive and expanding mass culture. In this dense new space of
collectors and quasi-investors, large audiences were not a help, but a
hindrance. Consider only the case of the Modern Gallery, which was first
opened in 1916 at 500 Fifth Avenue by Marius de Zayas, a minor artist
and journalist previously associated with Alfred Stieglitz and the
"291" Gallery.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 The gallery's principal clients were Eugene and Agnes Meyer, Arthur
 B. Davies, Walter Arensberg, and John Quinn. Few but fit. In 1920
 alone Quinn purchased nearly $24,000 worth of works from de Zayas, and
 even after returning two paintings in early 1921, the sum of his 1920
 purchases totaled almost $13,000.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Translated into contemporary res, this might fall somewhere between
 $340,000 and $390,000. Success, even survival, could depend on just
 such a nucleus of patron-investors, as de Zayas was told in 1919 by his
 French colleague, the Parisian dealer Charles Vignier, who was shaken
 when he learned that de Zayas was staging exhibitions that were drawing
 large crowds, with his gallery filled almost daily:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I feel very uneasy to learn that your Gallery is full every day. You
are losing uselessly a precious strength by these vain chatterings. I
would rather hear that you have seen three clients in one week, of whom
one has bought something.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Vignier's remarks were perceptive. Ironically, de Zayas was ultimately
forced to close his gallery not because he had failed to attract a large
audience, but because he had succeeded in doing so. That was the dilemma
of the avant-garde.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In responding to it by creating a distinction within the world of
commodity culture, whereby there is one set of cultural commodities
whose value is exhausted in immediate consumption and another whose
worth is deferred or sublated into the future as investment, modernism
gained for itself--for an evanescent moment--a breathing space within the
present, a space from which it could formulate its powerful critique of
commodity capitalism, even as--and at the same time as--it mortgaged that
critique in the future, mirroring the very system that it critiqued. But
the consequences of this precarious and unstable compromise could not be
forever deferred. For it was an inevitable outcome of this situation that
the avant-garde's distaste for the dictates of the marketplace should
ultimately be revealed as disingenuous precisely because, and insofar
as, the works of the avant-garde began to command ever more significant
prices within the larger open market. After that it was only a matter
of time before we should see the emergence of forms of art that were
already "precommodified," art that ironically and even nostalgically
acknowledges its own exchange function, art that finds its richest
moments--in several senses--in the works of Andy Warhol. These are the
<I>tristes tropiques</I> of late capitalism, known in their more naive
form as "post-modernism."

There was one brief report about Futurism in 1910, an article entitled
"Futurist Venice" by Douglas Goldring, which appeared in <I>The Tramp</I>
in August 1910, 487-88. This contained excerpts from "Contro Venezia
Passatista" and "Fondazione e manifesto del futurismo" ("Bib.," B.1;
"Bib. Supp.," D.1). Goldring was the editorial assistant for <I>The
English Review</I>, a journal edited by Ford Madox Ford during the period
1908-1910, and the first important review to publish work by Ezra Pound,
in March 1909. He was also personally acquainted with Pound, and, though
they were not especially close, they saw one another often in 1909 and
early 1910. It is thus possible that Pound was aware of Goldring's report
in <I>The Tramp</I>, since the two men knew one another. Significantly,
Pound's earliest mention of Marinetti consists in a reference to his
manifesto "Contro Venezia Passatista," a reference that appears in
the last paragraph of "Patria Mia. III," <I>The New Age</I> 11 (19
September 1912): 491-92, reprinted in <I>Ezra Pound's Poetry and Prose:
Contributions to Periodicals</I> (New York: Garland Publishing, 1991),
1:79, hereafter abbreviated <I>EPPP 1</I>. The fact is significant because
that is also the manifesto cited by Goldring in his essay in <I>The
Tramp</I>. But by September 1912, when Pound wrote his essay, he could
easily have obtained information about this manifesto from other sources.

Lady Low" (<I>EP/DS</I>, 35); on [2] September she urges Ezra to visit
Lady Low in Dorset, saying "She's a blessed woman with a brain. I am
duly grateful for having met her" (<I>EP/DS</I>, 47). (Pound apparently

Tickets for Marinetti's lecture were advertised in <I>The Times</I>,

of Bechstein Hall or at the Sackville Gallery. Information on seating
capacity is from Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert, <I>The London
Encylopaedia</I> (Bethesda, MD: Adler and Adler Publishers, 1986),
s.v. "Wigmore Hall" (the name was changed after World War I). However,
one cannot assume that Marinetti attracted a full house. Recalling the
Bechstein Hall lecture in September 1913, Harold Monro described "the
little Marinetti" speaking in what he termed "a hugh empty hall," and at
another point he noted that Marinetti spoke "to a handful of English"
(V"). His account is at odds with the larger audience presupposed by
<I>The Times</I> and <I>The Daily Chronicle</I>, but I may be in error
in not giving sufficient weight to his testimony about the actual, as
opposed to the potential, audience.

Ezra Pound, "Prefatory Note" to "The Complete Poetical Works of
T. E. Hulme" (first published at the end of <I>Ripostes</I> in October
1912), in his <I>Personae</I> (rev. ed., New York: New Directions,
1990), 266.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The chronological limits for the preparation of <I>Ripostes</I> are
as follows. In an undated letter from March of 1912, Pound informs
his father: "The 'mss.' of 'Ripostes' had gone to publishers...." The
letter was evidently written sometime after 1 March 1912, since elsewhere
Pound refers to the coal strike that began on that date. Likewise, it was
written not long before 19 March, since Pound also notes that he must "get
my 'Arnaut' ready for delivery" (Ezra Pound to Homer Pound, unpublished
letter, March 1912; Beinecke, YCAL 43 [Pound Papers]). Most likely it
was around 14 March, therefore, that Pound sent off the manuscript of
<I>Ripostes</I>. However, it should not be assumed that the original
manuscript necessarily contained either the five poems by Hulme that Pound
labelled "The Complete Poetical Works of T. E. Hulme," or the "Prefatory
Note" that preceded them, with its mention of "Les Imagistes." Since the
poems and the note were printed at the very end of the volume, they may
have been added after he sent off the manuscripts in mid-March. But how
much later? Pound remained in London, apart from one-day excursions,
from mid-March to the end of April. Probably on 1 May he left London
for Paris, for Dorothy writes to him on 3 May, "I wish I were in Paris"
(<I>EP/DS</I>, 95). At first sight, this is the latest date when Pound
could still have added the text of Hulme's poems, if not the prefatory
note, for while in Paris he would have had difficulty securing a text
of Hulme's works. Even so, he had still not received proofs. After his
arrival in Paris around 1 or 2 May, Pound stayed with the pianist Walter
Morse Rummel until 26 or 27 May (see <I>EP/MC</I>, 110); he then left
for a walking tour in southern France, suddenly returning to Paris on 11
June after learning of Margaret Cravens' suicide (<I>EP/MC</I>, 122). The
proofs for <I>Ripostes</I>, meanwhile, reached Dorothy Shakespear in
England on 12 June (<I>EP/DS</I>, 111), and she immediately forwarded
them to Pound in Paris. On 16 June, while still in Paris and attending
to affairs occasioned by Cravens' death, he wrote her that he had
"just corrected" them (<I>EP/DS</I>, 113). This date, then, would seem
to have been the last when Pound might still have added the poems by
Hulme, or, if they already formed part of the volume, his "prefatory
note" to them. However, some evidence suggests that Pound received and
corrected a second set of proofs for <I>Ripostes</I> some two months
later, in mid-August 1912, after he had returned to London. In a letter
dated [18] August 1912 to Harriet Monroe (<I>SL</I>, 9), Pound writes:
"the proofs of <I>Ripostes</I> are on my desk." If this letter is dated
correctly by Paige, it can only refer to a second set of proofs, and in
that case Pound could easily have added his prefatory note concerning
"les Imagistes" as late as 18 August 1912. I suspect that this is indeed
what happened, a suspicion partly corroborated by the chronology of
Pound's other references to Imagism. For in all of Pound's extant
correspondence, there is not a single reference to Imagism prior
to this one in the letter of [18[ August to Monroe. (The passage in
question is quoted below.) It is also corroborated by an otherwise
curious reference in the "Prefatory Note," in which Pound contrasts
the "School of Images," which had supposedly led to the formation of
Imagism, with more recent movements, noting that "its principles were
not so interesting as those of the 'inherent dynamists'...yet they were
probably sounder than those of a certain French school which attempted
to dispense with verbs altogether...." These are plainly satirical
descriptions corresponding to no movement that actually existed, yet
taken together the references to "dynamism" and the suppression of verbs
seem to allude to the recent developments of Futurism, and in particular
to Marinetti's prescription urging the elimination of all verbs except
those in the infinitive, advocated in the "Technical Manifesto of
Futurist Literature" that was published in May 1912 (F. T. Marinetti,
"Manifesto tecnico della letteratura futurista," originally published in
1912 by the Direction of the Futurist Movement in Milan, as a leaflet
dated 11 May; reprinted in F. T. Marinetti: <I>Teoria e invenzione
futurista</I>, ed. Luciano De Maria [Milan: Mondadori, 1968], 46-54,
hereafter abbreviated as <I>TIF</I>). If so, it further corroborates a
later date for the "Prefatory Note," which would then have been added
after the publication of the "Technical Manifesto." That, in turn,
preceded the death of Cravens by only a few weeks. In short, everything
seems to suggest that Pound did not invent imagism until mid-June or
even mid-August of 1912, only <I>after</I> the controversy surrounding
the Futurists and <I>after</I> the death of Margaret Cravens, in essence
making his creation of Imagism a response to both these events.

For examples of discussions quoting Marinetti or other Futurists
in English in mass-circulation publications, see C. Lewis Hind,

Daily Chronicle</I>, 4 March 1912, 6; or Anonymous, "Art That Alarms:
Paintings that Nearly Caused Paris Riot Shown in London," <I>The Daily

from a group of manifestos that were included in the catalogue to
the exhibition of 1912, all translated into English. But consider the
case of the manifesto "Futurist Sculpture," written by Boccioni and
published in April 1912 ("Manifesto tecnico della scultura futurista"
[1912], published as a leaflet by the Direction of the Futurist Movement
in Milan, dated 11 April). In a French translation, copies of it were
sent to English newspapers and reviewers in early autumn 1912, and as
before, mass-circulation newspapers always quoted from it in English
translation; see Anonymous, "Paris Day by Day: Futurist Sculpture,"

This emphasis stems from Marinetti's assumption that art must respond to
its milieu and his belief that modernity is defined by rapid change. The
presupposition owes much to Baudelaire's observation, "Modernity is
the transient, the fleeting, the contingent; it is one half of art, the
other being the eternal and immutable," in "The Painter of Modern Life,"

On 6 November 1913 Pound left London to stay with William Butler Yeats at
Stone Cottage in Coleman's Hatch (see Dorothy Shakespear to Ezra Pound,

am coming up on Monday," or 17 November (see Pound to Dorothy Shakespear,
14 November 1913, <I>EP/DS</I>, 273). Marinetti's lecture would surely
have interested him: it was held at the Poets' Club and its subject was
"Futurism in Poetry." Harold Monro attended this event, recalling it in

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the period when Filippo Tommaso Marinetti brought to life his ambitious
project of artistic reawakening, mass society was still in an early
stage of development, far from having acquired the characteristics that
would subsequently become more and more clearly defined with the ever
more rapid development of new technologies. Yet it was precisely this
new world, just emerging at the dawn of the twentieth century, with its
profound economic and anthropological transformations, that became the
reference point for futurism, a movement that responded to the radical
nature of this epochal shift with a project almost equally global in
its ambitions, that committed itself to an aesthetic renovation also
entailing moral and intellectual claims, and that sought to involve not
just an intellectual elite, but all the classes and sectors of modern
society. Harking back in certain ways to the criteria of collective art
previously suggested by Wagner and Lautr&eacute;amont, Marinetti chose
to pursue a program of cultural democratization, setting himself the
goal of bringing art into the realm of daily life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The advent of mass society, as Benjamin noted long ago, entails the
"decay of the auratic,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 a process in which art loses its halo of associations with ritual and
 magic as the values of tradition disappear. His viewpoint might almost
 have been designed to illustrate a well-known prose-poem by Baudelaire,
 "Perte d'aur&eacute;ole" (lost halo), a witty sketch in which Baudelaire
 explores the new marginality assigned to the artist by the world of
 modernity. The protagonist, a poet, recounts his earlier attempt to
 cross a boulevard jammed with morning traffic. Trying to leap over the
 mud while also avoiding the horses and

<B></B>

carriages that fly in every direction, he had made a sudden movement that
caused his halo to fall into the mud. Stricken with panic and fearful of
being injured, he then decided to leave it on the ground. Yet he feels no
regret, he tells his interlocutor, for now he is free to stroll through
the city incognito, "like all common mortals." Now, the poet informs
his hearer, he is "an exact resemblance of yourself, as you can see!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Responding many years later to the same sense of the loss of the artist's
role in modernity, Marinetti attempted to relocate or rediscover the
sense of aura within the forms of modernity itself. Perhaps it is no
accident that he placed his own artistic rebirth in a muddy ditch as
well in the famous allegorical narrative that prefaces "The Founding
and First Manifesto of Futurism," in which an automobile accident is
represented as a second birth and myth of initiation to modern life:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Oh! Maternal ditch, almost full of muddy water! Fair factory drain! I
gulped down your nourishing sludge; and I remembered the blessed black
breast of my Sudanese nurse....When I came up torn, filthy, and stinking
from under the capsized car, I felt the white-hot iron of joy deliciously
pass through my heart!
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The passage plainly indicates the necessity of descending into the
inferno of modern life, of accepting the challenges posed by an existence
dominated by speed, standardization, noise, and mass communications;
but that project, in turn, implicitly requires that it be translated
concretely into a program of recuperating, for the domain of art, the
universe of new signs that is offered by the metropolis, signs that can
be used for constructing a new epic, an industrial epos shaped by the
mythic language of the machine.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That implicit program of recuperation is signalled not by the allegorical
narrative, but by the medium of its transmission and the relationship
of the narrative to the event that it heralds. Adopting a polemical
stance towards the communicative means of more traditional culture,
closed in upon itself and incapable of seeing beyond the institutional
limits imposed by academies, universities, readers' circles, and salons,
Marinetti understands the new world of mass communications and, decades
before Marshall McLuhan, intuitively perceives that "the medium is the
message." "The Founding and First Manifesto," published on the first
page <I>Le ro</I> (Paris) on 20 February 1909, embodies this very
understanding: it is launched from an international venue in a language
that addresses the widest possible audience. Moreover, it announces
a pseudo-event, the birth of Futurism; it is by means of the press
that this event is immediately realized. (In point of fact, Marinetti
possessed only a handful of followers at the time, all of them poets,
and it was not until much later that he would be joined by painters,
musicians, and architects, to form a genuinely global movement.) From
the beginning, in other words, Marinetti possessed an uncommon capacity
for using the media and forging public relations, gifts that he utilized
in a self-conscious effort to promote Futurism in much the way that one
would promote an industrial product that is to be introduced into the
market and publicized.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At least part of Marinetti's sensibility to advertising was a result of
his living in Milan, a city then in a stage of rapid economic growth. What
struck him in particular were two phenomena that were absolutely new
and that plainly accompanied the development of modern society: on
the one hand, industrialization, which, advancing in stages of sudden
expansion, dissolves the pyramidal structure of an older social order
in favor of massification, and on the other hand, the birth of popular
political parties and unionization. Both industry and politics possess
their own linguistic registers enabling them to enter dialogue with
a wide public, penetrating almost every level of society. Aiming at
creating an avant-garde that would address a mass society, Marinetti
introduced into the world of art precisely the kinds of communicative
systems that typified the political avant-garde (verbal violence,
techniques of agitation, meetings, etc.) and industrial advertising
(hypervaluation in the representation of its own products, a massive
use of posters, the launching of leaflets, etc.).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the most interesting aspects of this program consisted in
the strategy adopted for the sale and diffusion of works of art and
books. Marinetti created a complex of entrepreneurial functions and
activities aimed at moving goods created by artist-producers to public
consumers, and so became the unquestioned manager of a vast program
of cultural marketing, responsible for coordinating and directing the
entire enterprise. His initiatives extended from publishing to organizing
theatrical tourn&eacute;es, from arranging propaganda expeditions in
various countries abroad, typically accompanied by lectures and readings,
to preparing exhibitions both abroad and in Italy. An impresario of
poets and painters, Marinetti would deploy his own economic resources in
financing these operations. His house (first in Milan, then in Rome after
1925 or so) was always the official seat, the corporate headquarters of
the movement, a mixture of house and museum in which Oriental furniture
(inherited from his father, Enrico, formerly a lawyer and businessman
in Alexandria, Egypt) was placed alongside the paintings, books, and
sculptures of the Futurists. Over the entrance door was a plaque with
the simple inscription, "Futurism."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is a commonplace to say that "publicity is the soul of commerce,"
but before Marinetti nobody had thought that advertising might be also
the soul, or <I>motor</I>, of art. Fifty years after the foundation
of Futurism, the poet Aldo Palazzeschi could still recall the sense of
shock that this produced among contemporaries.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Marinetti had understood from the beginning the power of advertising, a
power that would eventually accomplish feats and address people from the
highest to the lowest, omitting no one within the social structure...for
more orthodox thinkers, to use it for matters of intellectual and cultural
life was considered an ignominy so base that no dictionary was thought
to possess a term that could sufficiently describe its wickedness.

Among contemporary cultural circles, Marinetti was reproved for operating
in a style <I>all'americana</I> (in an American style) that was deemed
inappropriate to the world of art. Giuseppe Prezzolini, who was interested
in rhetoric and the arts of persuasion,
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 remarked that Marinetti had the "advertising personality of a good
 travelling salesman":

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the early years of Futurism, prior to the outbreak of the Great War,
Marinetti would cover the walls and hoardings of all the major cities of
Italy with massive white posters that contained a single word in glaring
red: "Futurism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the most specific and widely debated instruments within Marinetti's
complex of entrepreneurial functions was the so-called <I>serata
futurista</I> ("Futurist evening" or "Futurist soir&eacute;e"). This
became a privileged form of communication during the "heroic" years of
Futurism prior to the Great War, an era when the theater was still an
important means of socialization that spanned the spectrum of Italian
culture, permitting people of different socio-economic strata to meet in
a single place without distinctions of class or income. From the ground
floor to the gallery and the boxes, the theater became a container
embracing everyone, a site in which the creativity of the Futurists
would spread like lava running from the mouth of a volcano: spectators
and artists became the chemical components of an incandescent fusion in
which the event was no longer the spectacle in itself, but the ensemble
of emotions, tensions, actions, and reactions being created.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti's management of the <I>serata</I> revealed the same intense
concern with entrepreneurial values. In general he rented the theater
himself, and typically admission was priced very low or made free in
order to encourage an audience as large as possible. Every performance
was preceded by an advertising barrage that included advertisements in
the daily newspapers, posters on walls, and the distribution of leaflets
or handbills. The audience was largely composed of intellectuals,
professionals, and aristocrats, with a smaller representation of young
people and workers. The performance itself consisted of participants
presenting their paintings, reciting poetry or other "words-in-freedom"
compositions, or declaiming manifestos. Marinetti and his companions
insistently provoked the audience, which in turn responded by launching
missiles of every imaginable kind: the <I>serata</I> was transformed
into a miniature war that required a visceral involvement on the part
of the spectator. To quiet the brawls the police were typically called
in, unintentionally lending themselves to a role that had already been
scripted for them in advance. From beginning to end the entire event
was carefully choreographed by Marinetti, including the predictable
aftermath: daily newspapers promptly reported the event with shocked
headlines, lengthy articles that detailed the brawls in all their fury,
and editorial commentary that deplored the Futurist provocations, all
of these inadvertently furnishing the Futurists with advance publicity
for the next <I>serata</I> to follow.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even the tone that Marinetti used in his speeches and addresses to the
gallery was tinged with the language of advertising. On the one hand he
carefully sought to shock by deliberately taunting and provoking the
audience, while on the other hand he glorified the successes of his
group with a lyrical rhetoric of excessive emphasis. Not

<B></B>

untypical is a speech from one of the Futurist evenings that took place
in Florence in 1913 at the Teatro Verdi, in which Marinetti assaulted
the audience thus:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We are a handful of tamers here in this cage of wild animals that are
roaring and yet also frightened. You will leave here tamed, bearing
within yourselves an involuntary admiration for us that you will be
unable to repress....Seven thousand mediocrities against eight artists
whose formidable genius you cannot deny.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti's activities as a publisher were strictly connected with his
propagandistic efforts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 In this regard his views owed much to wider changes that were taking
 place within the world of publishing in Italy, the outcome of a
 growing perception among contemporary intellectuals that cultural
 activity was something to be developed as part of a continuous
 process through a cycle of production and consumption, via specific
 channels and institutions. Reviews were now increasingly flanked by
 complementary cultural enterprises, such as publishing houses and retail
 outlets. Italian intellectuals who were most responsive to current
 events, in line with the industrial development that marked the era
 dominated by the governments of Giolitti, increasingly understood that
 culture was a product, and that as such, it was to be regulated by the
 laws of the market. Ideas, in order to become subjects of discussion,
 had to be widely diffused. Sharing this viewpoint, Marinetti had founded
 the journal <I>Poesia</I> in Milan in 1905, an eclectic monthly that
 hosted Symbolists, Parnassians, decadents, neo-romantics, modernists,
 the <I>crepuscolari</I>, and even authors writing in dialect. Yet its
 foundamental project was always that of self-promotion and publicity for
 Marinetti himself. The first number of the journal was announced with a
 "circular letter" prepared for the press, which adopted a synthetic and
 dramatic style of immediacy that indicated its origins in the language of
 advertising, a style that would become a constant in Futurism itself. By
 this time Marinetti was already standing accused of being an intellectual
 too attentive to the clamor of publicity, a weakness he was thought to
 share with Gabriele D'Annunzio, another great writer who understood the
 value of image and self-publicity in the modern society of the spectacle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Promotional systems created in support of the journal were numerous:
the habit of concocting "puffs" for the press, with reviews that were
prepared in advance; sending numerous copies of certain issues as
complimentary gifts to influential reviewers and authors; an insistent
program of editorial self-publicization; a constant search for
support for the journal from other intellectuals, including requests
for collaboration, which were also handsomely paid. More important,
authors were rewarded with res that ranged from one hundred liras
(received by the poet Giovanni Pascoli) to three hundred liras (offered
to d'Annunzio). Marinetti himself, it might be noted, much preferred
Pascoli as an author; his payments reflected not his value judgments,
but the fluctuations of the market.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Another feature designed to contribute to the journal's propaganda and
 self-publicity aims was the series of "inquests" that it sponsored: on
 "the beauty of Italian women," on "free verse," and

<B></B>

on and on. Still another were the contests for poetry and prose that
were open to the young and unknown. <I>Poesia</I>, moreover, was also
supported by a book series that published works by the authors who had
won its contests, or works that reported the results of inquests that
had proven especially controversial, such as the one on free verse
(<I>Enqu&ecirc;te internationale sur le vers libre</I> [International
inquest on free verse; 1909]).
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 And finally, in an Italian culture that was still largely provincial in
 nature, the international character of <I>Poesia</I> gave it a special
 glitter, even as it simultaneously served a crucial function as a bridge
 between Italy and the rest of Europe. One need only glance at a number
 of issues to see how many authors of genuinely international caliber
 were offered to the Italian public: William Butler Yeats, Alfred Jarry,
 Jean Cocteau, Paul Claudel, Miguel de Unamuno, the Russian symbolist poet
 Valery Bryusov, or the Greek national poet Costas Palam&agrave;s. To be
 sure, cosmopolitanism was also a characteristic innate in Marinetti's
 personality. An Italian who was born in Egypt, he had been educated
 in French and felt far more comfortable writing in it than in Italian
 until perhaps as late as 1915, and his earliest literary efforts were
 directed at taking of the role of a "Franco-Italian" poet. All these
 circumstances meant that Marinetti tended to regard culture as an
 essentially comparative and international activity, with the result
 that versions in multiple languages also became a recurrent feature of
 Marinetti's publishing activities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The journal <I>Poesia</I> continued to appear until 1909, serving as a
springboard for the launching of Futurism. Yet while it reprinted "The
Founding and First Manifesto," its publication was suspended shortly
thereafter. It had proven an invaluable testing ground for the techniques
of cultural communication that the movement would subsequently adopt,
but it remained inextricably tied to the hinterland of Symbolism by its
origins, its collaborators, and its history, and after the break announced
by Futurism, Marinetti strove to keep his distance from Symbolism in
all its forms. Notwithstanding the suppression of the journal, its book
publishing imprint ("Editions of <I>Poesia</I>") continued to be kept in
existence, and in 1910 it was renamed only slightly as "Futurist Editions
of <I>Poesia</I>," retaining a reminder of the earlier review that had
hovered so precariously between the past and the future. From now on
it would be the book that became the principal means for diffusing the
movement's poetics and propaganda, one of the most vital functions of the
complex Futurist organism. The "Futurist Editions of <I>Poesia</I>" were
soon flanked by other series and imprints that were typically connected
to particular groups of Futurists in specific cities and their reviews:
Marinetti's movement became extraordinarily extensive and multifarious,
not limited to a single cenacle. Increasingly it was structured like a
political party, guided by a charismatic leader and possessing an official
policy that was shaped by Marinetti's closest collaborators, generally
the best and most prominent painters and poets. Yet it could also count
upon an extensive network of Futurist groups that were scattered in
every region of Italy, as well as on a number of sympathizers abroad.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The existence of such groups inevitably generated autonomous initiatives
that could then be supported or absorbed by Marinetti, such as
<I>Lacerba</I>, the review

<B></B>

founded by Giovanni Papini and Ardengo Soffici in Florence in
1913. They soon allied themselves with Marinetti, who undertook
much of the journal's distribution on his own account for as long as
the collaboration lasted. How many readers followed the journal is
difficult to establish, as is also the case with the earlier review,
<I>Poesia</I>. Yet it is safe to say that press runs were quite high
in comparison with those of contemporaneous literary journals. Exact
res do not exist for <I>Poesia</I>, though the number of retail
outlets that carried it (which the journal listed in every issue) and
the letters from readers (which were published in a regular rubric)
suggest a rather ample diffusion. Marinetti himself remarked upon the
press runs of <I>Poesia's</I> last two numbers, which were issued in
quantities much larger because dedicated to Futurism: thirty thousand
copies of the penultimate number, forty thousand for the final one. Yet
these are res that need to be compared with actual inventories or
press orders, sinch Marinetti was not averse to inflating his reports
for advertising purposes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For <I>Lacerba</I>, on the other hand, there are more reliable res
available for comparison. The review had a considerable impact and its
engaging polemical battles left an indelible impression in the memory of
intellectuals of the time. Even Gramsci was intrigued by it, as he was
by Marinetti and the Futurists in general, and in 1922 he wrote a letter
to Trotsky in which he stated that <I>Lacerba</I> had a press run of
"twenty thousand copies" and "four out of five copies had circulated
among workers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 The re differs little from one recalled by Marinetti in a letter
 written to Mario Carli in 1919, when Carli was director of the newspaper
 <I>Roma Futurista</I>: "I am convinced that when censorship disappears,
 it would be possible to surpass the largest press runs of <I>Lacerba</I>,
 which were 18,000 copies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 But both these accounts differ significantly from res offered by
 more contemporary documents. Aldo Palazzeschi, in a letter written
 on 16 May 1913 to Attilio Vallecchi, the printer of <I>Lacerba</I>,
 speaks of only "ten thousand copies," while Giovanni Papini, writing
 a bit earlier to Palazzeschi, described the journal's success in the
 following terms: "<I>Lacerba</I> is selling like hot cakes. A great
 deal of discussion--and conversions everywhere. The number has been
 well received and very few of the 8,000 copies are left."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 And only a few days earlier Papini had written Marinetti to say that
 he was sending him copies of <I>Lacerba</I> to distribute at his own
 expense:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Today the printing of <I>L[acerba]</I> was finished and you should
immediately receive 3000 copies. At the beginning you will find an
article of mine which I have chosen to title Against Futurism. Don't be
alarmed. I have done so deliberately in order to attract attention and
arouse people's curiosity. It is a defense of the Fut[urists]...Don't be
upset if I repeat in several places that I am <I>not</I> a Futurist. For
tactical reasons that is a necessity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This letter reveals a considerable awareness of the mechanisms of
propaganda, as Papini describes an essay whose title appears to be
an assault against Marinetti's movement, but which actually announces
<I>Lacerba's</I> shift toward a position in its

<B></B>

favor. Papini cunningly exploits widespread hostility against Futurism
in order to thwart his readers' expectations and so prove all the more
shocking.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti, it should be noted, could sustain his role as an impresario
of poets and painters not only because of his formidable managerial
capacities, but also because of his substantial wealth. In 1907,
upon the death of his father, he had inherited a conspicuous sum of
money. Exactly how much is not known, though Marinetti himself, in his
memoirs dictated many years later, recorded that a French newspaper with
a large circulation reported at the time that his inheritance amounted
to eighty million liras.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Marinetti, in any event, employed his patrimony to finance Futurism
 with uncommon generosity and with a perceptive sense of how to create a
 more enduring kind of goods: today the works that his movement produced
 and the books that his publishing house issued constitute an object
 of great value both in the world of culture and in the domain of the
 market. Marinetti himself defined the motivations that prompted him to
 become an impresario of unknown talents in the following terms.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I had the good fortune to inherit a substantial sum from my father, but
I chose not to use it in a manner either base or banal. I have, instead,
availed myself of the opportunities offered by independence to realize a
vast and audacious plan for intellectual and artistic renewal in Italy:
to protect, encourage, and materially to help the young, innovative,
and rebellious minds that are daily suffocated by the indifference, the
avarice, or the myopia of publishers.

Marinetti spoke these words in his defense during the trial on charges
of pornography that were lodged against him in 1910 for the presence of
several erotic scenes in the novel <I>Mafarka il futurista</I> (Mafarka
the Futurist; 1910).
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 As was typical for Marinetti, his case was pleaded by a trio of
 illustrious lawyers (Innocenzo Cappa, Cesare Sarfatti, Salvatore
 Barzilai) and supported by an expert witness who was then of considerable
 renown, the author Luigi Capuana, all of which enabled him to turn the
 trial into yet another publicity success that was partly achieved through
 his careful organization of a press campaign involving intellectuals
 from Italy and abroad, a success that also helped to speed the book's
 translation into Russian and Spanish. And yet it remains a fact that
 Marinetti's cultural entrepreneurship was based upon a disinterested
 love of art which was combined with his wish to address the need
 for an alternative space that could sustain the talents he wished
 to launch into the marketplace of art and literature: the painters
 Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carr&agrave;, Luigi Russolo, Gino Severini,
 Ardengo Soffici, Fortunato Depero, Enrico Prampolini, as well as the
 writers Aldo Palazzeschi, Corrado Govoni, Paolo Buzzi, Luciano Folgore,
 Francesco Cangiullo, and many others. Paolo Buzzi, the first poet whose
 work was published by Marinetti in book form, later recalled:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Because of my poverty and the necessity that I faced of having to find
a job, which required studies that were not intellectual in nature, my
literary tendencies would have been dead heaven only knows how long ago
if I had not met with that electric lighthouse

 that you know of. And later, having come into contact with publishers,
 some of them quite large ones, I immediately perceived the evil
 mediocrity and the fierce mentality of the petty shopkeeper that animate
 them: with the result that returning to the old and crazy publishing
 house [of Marinetti] always gave me a shiver of enthusiasm and, more
 important, a bit of courage, of faith in the future.

The "Futurist Editions of <I>Poesia</I>" were perhaps the most important
embodiment of Marinetti's desire to create an alternative cultural space,
becoming an experimental laboratory in the true sense of the term, where
the canons of a new writing,  the "words-in-freedom," were successively
elaborated and consecrated for the first time with Marinetti's celebrated
<I>Zang Tumb Tuuum</I> .
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Marinetti himself was perfectly clear about his aims and the role of the
 publishing house within a larger artistic reawakening: "We reserve the
 'Futurist Editions of <I>Poesia</I>' for those works that are absolutely
 Futurist in their violence and intellectual extremism and that cannot
 be published by others because of their typographical difficulties."

Marinetti, then, was a publisher whose activities were largely unaffected
by the need to make money. Instead they resembled those of so-called
engaged or committed editors such as Giuseppe Prezzolini and Piero
Gobetti, though with some crucial differences: the impulse of extreme
avant-gardism, on the one hand, and the communicative systems that were
adopted to embody that impulse, on the other. Whereas Prezzolini and
Gobetti were deeply concerned with questions of pedagogy and the formation
of a civic elite, Marinetti placed more emphasis on the circulation of
ideas per se and, therefore, on propaganda. More concretely, Marinetti
tended to give away a remarkably high percentage of the copies from any
given press run of a book, almost wholly neglecting their distribution in
retail outlets such as bookstores. Journalists, politicians, artists,
intellectuals, industrialists, potential sympathizers and active
rivals--all found themselves flooded with gratis copies of books,
newspapers, journals, magazines, and leaflets streaming forth from the
Marinetti factories. The poet Aldo Palazzeschi later recalled with wry
humor his own naivet&eacute; and surprise when first confronted with
Marinetti's plans to compose hundreds of dedicatory inscriptions--not
for Marinetti's book, but for Palazzeschi's own--to people with whom
Palazzeschi had no relations at all:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
No sooner had the book been printed in a thousand copies than the question
arose of what to do about the number of copies customarily sent gratis to
members of the press and perhaps a few friends. At this point Marinetti
handed me a fat notebook. I began leafing through it with a growing
sense of fear and dismay. It contained some seven hundred names, together
with their addresses and a model of the sort of dedication that each was
to receive. The few remaining copies of my book, I was informed, could
be sent to a few booksellers in the larger cities, though without any
hurry and as if it were a fact of no importance in comparison with the
announcement that the book was already sold out, which had also been
prepared in advance. The list comprehended a most wild and unsuspected
variety of persons: men from the worlds of politics and culture, prominent
industrialists and professionals, men and women of society, among whom
were people who were truly famous and in some cases notorious for their

<B></B>

 implacable opposition to Futurism, persons who would surely throw the
 book away with a curse, or would even burn it. But it was exactly those
 who didn't want it, according to Marinetti's theory, who had to receive
 it....I was resolutely opposed to a project of this kind and after
 much discussion we at last agreed that I would make a wide selection
 in my own way from the six or seven hundred addresses, reducing it to
 almost half. I also announced firmly that I was not prepared to write
 hundreds of dedications to persons whom I didn't know.... "Don't worry,"
 replied Marinetti, "I'll dictate the inscriptions myself, and you can
 copy them down."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In lavishing gratis copies upon an unsuspecting world Marinetti was
violating one of the cardinal principles of the publishing trade, that of
profit. But his real goal was to see the book distributed as rapidly as
possible, attempting to augment its value with a maximum of commitment to
advertising and promotion. Such techniques horrified Giuseppe Prezzolini,
who, though hardly a commercial publisher, liked to think of himself as
a cultural impresario with experience in the techniques of organizing
intellectual activities, and on these grounds offered a defense for the
laws of the marketplace:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A Futurist book is no longer worth a penny...who would ever be such an
imbecile as to buy a Futurist volume when everyone knows that all one
has to do is send a greeting card to F. T. Marinetti, Corso Venezia, 61,
Milan, to have the mail disgorging a large packet full of books upon one's
doorstep--and to know that one will regularly receive all the others
that the factory of Futurism will publish in the future?...Something
that is given away has less value than something bought....

Prezzolini's judgment is quite plainly and quite wholly
negative. Marinetti is not a cultural organizer, but a "disorganizer." Yet
his analysis fails to take into account the situation in which Marinetti
was operating: that of the avant-garde, which by its very nature tends
to violate every received law, placing itself in a polemical relation to
reigning rules and protocols. Marinetti, in fact, privileged the immediate
diffusion of the creative product, imposing it upon the public with rules
and rhythms of his own making: the gratis copy, on closed analysis, is
an expedient for rapidly and indeed almost immediately making contact
with the right people, for eliminating the mediation of distributors
and bookstores. Though a portion of a press run might be reserved for
the normal channels of sales and distribution, it was always a minor one.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Oddly, this publishing system did not prevent some books from selling
quite well, such as the collectively authored volume <I>I poeti
futuristi</I> (The Futurist poets; 1912), which, with a "<I>real</I>
press run of 20,000 copies,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 soon proved a remunerative enterprise. Exulting in his triumph, Marinetti
 announces his promotion of it to Palazzeschi: "It will be distributed
 in Europe and America, with more than American vigor. I will place two
 to three hundred copies at the disposition of each contributing poet."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 His project proved successful and the anthology sold well; Marinetti,
 evidently satisfied, informed Palazzeschi that booksellers were
 repeatedly placing orders for more copies:

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

This one is selling in a truly exceptional way.... To think of it! Some
booksellers, such as Baldini and Castoldi, for example, have requested
additional copies seven times, which means that we have already sold
roughly two hundred copies through each principal bookseller....Even if
the newspapers are exclusively filled with stories about the war, the
volume of <I>Poeti futuristi</I> is competing with the war for space.

One more example might be the pamphlet "Sintesi futurista della guerra"
(Futurist synthesis of the war; 1914), printed in the climate of the
interventionist campaign, which had a press run of "more than 20,000
copies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 It depicts the World War through the graphic image of a wedge, with
 the word "Futurism" written in the center, the top of which touches a
 curve representing "Pass&eacute;ism," a composition anticipating that
 of the famous <I>Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge</I> (1919-20) by
 El Lissitzky.

Already these res suggest that Marinetti, far from being solely the
"disorganizer" indicted by Prezzolini, was in reality an "organizer"
of an entirely new type,  the inventor of the artistic avant-garde
as a cultural enterprise and shaper of public opinion. This was a
dialectical phenomenon composed of two opposing factors: destruction and
construction. In Futurist theory and practice the nihilistic aspects
are united with the constructive ones in a mixture of spontaneity and
rationality, a mixture characteristic of Marinetti's own personality,
in which the absolute love of poetry "was accompanied by exceptional
organizational and propagandistic gifts, in which, in a Nietzschean
manner, a sultry heart coexisted with a cool mind."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti, moreover, was an artisan of great stature. If his objectives
were grandiose, his enterprise for realizing them was remarkably small. In
the "heroic" period of the "words-in-freedom," one of his followers
(Cesare Cavanna) collaborated closely with a trusted typographer
(working for Angelo Taveggia) under directions furnished by Marinetti
during every stage of printing, from the rough sketch to the completed
volume. Busying himself with every detail, from the selection of paper
to the design of the cover, all the way up to the launching of publicity
and press relations, Marinetti displayed an uncommon degree of skill
and mastery of detail. And yet the editorial committee of Futurism was
extremely modest, composed of Marinetti and his secretary Decio Cinti,
his two servants Marietta and Nina Angelini, and one or more Futurist
volunteers (Boccioni, Buzzi, Russolo), with its headquarters always
located in his house in Milan, until 1912 at Via Senato, 2, and then
until 1924 in Corso Venezia, 61.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet if the institutional structure in which Marinetti's publishing
activities unfolded was essentially artisanal in nature, his editions
pursued goals that might well be termed industrial, goals expressed both
in the publicity systems that he used and in the substantial press runs
that he printed, typically ranging from one to two thousand copies, with
an occasional run of twenty thousand. The first edition of Palazzeschi's
<I>L'Incendiario</I> (Arsonist; 1910) was roughly a thousand copies, the
second  surpassed two thousand. Nearly always, however, Marinetti
announced press runs that were far above the real res: on the cover
of Luciano Folgore's <I>Il</I> 

<B></B>

<I>canto dei motori</I> (The song of motors; 1912), for example, he
reports that the edition comprises "eight thousand copies." But in
private he wrote to Folgore, "I have had 2,000 copies of your volume
printed, so there should be some left over. For the others, naturally,
the press run is at least seven or eight thousand copies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet whatever the res, they are considerably higher than the one
hundred copies of the first books of Guillaume Apollinaire and Max Jacob,
published by the art dealer and publisher Kahnweiler, or the three to six
hundred copies of the works of Mayakovsky, also published in the Futurist
series though outside of the official publishing house. Yet such large
press runs, notable for a publishing firm as small as Marinetti's really
was, responded to a self-conscious decision: Marinetti was opposed to
the rare and precious volume, printed in a limited quantity of numbered
copies and destined for a wealthy public, for bibliophiles or art
collectors, and instead he viewed the book as a militant product aimed
at wide usage. In this respect his editions differed both from those
of the Cubists, Dadaists, and Surrealists--almost always in limited
editions ornamented with engravings and designs--and from those of
the Russian Futurists, self-published with duplicating machines and
artisanal decorations. Marinetti, in other words, genuinely believed in
the possibility of an avant-garde publishing venture that would extend
far beyond purely literary and artistic circles to reach the man in
the street.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the most interesting editorial goals that he pursued was
represented by the so-called "typographic revolution" theorized in
the manifestos on literature. Through a subversion of the rules of
composition, Marinetti proposed to regenerate the book by means of a new
compositional and graphic language. The page, no longer viewed as passive
screen conditioned by rules of symmetry and harmony, becomes a dynamic
field that is open to the games of free and expressive orthography,
to the visual values of letters themselves, to the sounds and noises
represented typographically, and to graphic components and designed
analogies. Typography, no longer considered the humble maidservant of
writing, is called upon to play an essential role in the process of
the work's creation: for the first time within the Gutenbeg Galaxy one
witnesses a hot fusion of technology and poetry. The book is transformed
into a living organism that implies the involvment of the reader, to
whom is assigned the task of interpreting and decoding the message, now
constructed of linguistic, verbal, phonetic, and visual materials. If
the Futurist painters sought to place the spectator at the center of
the canvas, Marinetti, with his creation of "words-in-freedom," pursued
a similar goal: to place the reader at the center of the book and the
page. Such a program destroys the traditional role of illustration as
something posterior that has been  tied on to the text; all the visual
aspects of the work are now resolved within the ambience of free-word
writing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The precedent for this utilization of typography for its expressive
functions, as is well known, was set by Mallarm&eacute; in his poem
"Un coup de d&eacute;s jamais n'abolira le hasard," which for the first
time had introduced into poetry the use of typographical characters in
a manner that had hitherto been reserved for newspapers and posters.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 But Marinetti's "words-in-freedom" codified this new expressiveness
 and made it

<B></B>

correspond to the perceptual simultaneity that typified the new
man shaped by technology. Marinetti's theories unleashed a flood of
"words-in-freedom" writing in Futurist journals, newspapers, and books,
and those that were issued by his own publishing firm included a number
of modern classics: Luciano Folgore's <I>Ponti sull'Oceano</I> (Bridges
on the ocean; 1914), which had a cover designed by Sant'Elia; Corrado
Govoni's extraordinary pictographs and typographical experiments
in <I>Rarefazioni e Parole in Libert&agrave;</I> (Rarefactions and
words-in-freedom; 1915); Paolo Buzzi's <I>L'Elisse e la Spirale</I>
(The helix and the spiral; 1915); Francesco Cangiullo's <I>Piedigrotta</I> ; and Marinetti's own masterpieces, <I>Zang Tumb Tuum</I>
 and <I>Les mots en libert&eacute; futuristes</I> (Futurist
words-in-freedom; 1919). In addition to these there were the three
major theoretical works that would prove of great importance for the
future of the avant-garde: Boccioni's <I>Pittura Scultura Futuriste</I>
(Futurist painting scupture; 1914); Carr&agrave;'s <I>Guerrapittura</I>
(Warpainting; 1915), and Russolo's <I>L'arte dei rumori</I> (The art of
noises; 1916).
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The period dominated by the "free-word" works represented the most
significant moment in the trajectory of Marinetti's editorial activities,
a trajectory that encompassed two distinct phases: one centered in Milan,
the other in Rome. The first includes the period generally referred to
as the moment of "heroic" futurism, from 1909 to 1914, as well as the
years of the Great War and the early 1920s. The second begins in 1925,
the year when Marinetti moved to Rome to an apartment on Piazza Adriana,
30, and continues until 1943, the year of Mussolini's fall. The later
stage was marked by a drop in the level of production and a change in
the criteria that guided Marinetti's operations as a publisher. After
1925 or thereabouts, Marinetti no longer availed himself of the kinds
of publicity and advertising systems that he had used so effectively
before: the pamphelts and "puffs" that had been prepared for the press
disappeared, and even the name "Futurist Editions of <I>Poesia</I>" was
reduced to a trademark that was frequently ceded to authors who paid
their own costs of publication. Nor was there a favored typographer
who executed complex works under Marinetti's close supervision; now
each author would usually follow his own publication through whatever
press was located most conveniently for him. Marinetti, it should be
added, also found himself in a period when his financial resources
were severely reduced. The changed circumstances meant that books of
exceptional quality now became a rarity, though there were still the two
extraordinary books of "litho-tin," which is to say, books made entirely
of tin with full-color serigraphs. They constitute the farthest point
that Marinetti reached in his experiments with the book as object: one
was titled <I>L'anguria lirica</I> (The lyrical watermelon; 1934) by
Tullio d'Albisola, with designs by Bruno Munari; the other, <I>Parole
in libert&agrave; futuriste tattili termiche olfattive</I> (Futurist
words-in-freedom, tactile thermic olfactory; 1932), by Marinetti with
graphics by Tullio d'Albisola.

Writing in 1916, Terenzio Grandi argued that there was a deep consonance
between the aesthetic principles of the Futurists and what he called
"the art of typography." a common ground that had a double aspect.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 On the one hand, Marinetti's "words-in-freedom" used certain expressive
 modules plainly derived from the lettering

<B></B>

of contemporary advertisements, while on the other it was becoming
increasingly evident that more advanced and modern advertisements
were drawing upon styles and designs that had been pioneered by
Futurism. Marinetti was aware of these later developments and did much
to encourage them, and by the later 1930s, when advertising graphics
were being rapidly developed in Italy under the influence of Futurism,
"elementary typography," and Bauhaus, Marinetti could justly claim that
much of the most recent advertising was drawing upon ideas that stemmed
from the grammar and aesthetics of his movement:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Commercial firms were increasingly demanding a maximum of clarity without
any possible equivocation concerning their product or their location and
in wall posters this produced a sudden revolution of words-in-freedom with
its plastic typography in multiple perspectives reliefs planes depths
with its free orthography its alogical shifts in time of words outside
of syntax and literary habits. Words in freedom were found running
luminously across the fronts of buildings and the terraces of houses
climbing everywhere stripped of syntax and ready to say everything because
they had become plastic in their isolation and their percussive throbbing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Through the vehicle of advertising the avant-garde had invaded the great
cities and so realized one of the Futurist ambitions: to leave the museum
and extend art into the streets and public spaces, as Mayakovsky had
so famously announced. When an austerity program prompted the fascist
regime to threaten abolishing electric signs in the center of Milan,
Marinetti swiftly wrote an open letter to Mussolini in their defense,
arguing that they created a "childish" and "illusory nocturnal jewelry"
that constituted the modern decoration of the metropolis, a viewpoint
that had already been implicitly formulated by Sant'Elia in his designs
for the "new city" in 1914.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Especially during the 1920s and 1930s many Futurists, and chiefly
 Fortunato Depero, worked actively in the world of advertising,
 designing billboards, graphics, booths and pavilions for commercial
 fairs, shopwindows, and theoretical texts. The great example of the
 collective contribution of the group was supposed to be the <I>Almanacco
 dell' Italia veloce</I> (Almanac of quickening Italy), a volume that
 was announced on several occasions but never actually issued; a single
 specimen of it has survived, rich in original graphic formulations by
 Balla, Prampolini, and others, and preceded by a theoretical essay by
 Marinetti that urges the necessity of advertising that is multimedia
 and many faceted in its expressiveness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 The urge to combine art and advertising found curious expression in two
 of Marinetti's late books: one, <I>Il poema del vestito di latte</I>
 (The poem of the clothing made of milk; 1937), which is a hymn to the
 wool-like synthetic "lanital," extracted from the chemical caseine,
 and <I>Il poema di torre viscosa</I> (The poem of the viscose tower;
 1938), which treats the production of cellulose. Both were published
 by the National Italian Company for Viscose, and neither is valued very
 highly today.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What these productions Marinetti had essentially come full circle, from
the publicity of art to the art of publicity, always in search of a new
lexicon with which to attract the public, always seeking news ways to
transmit and popularize the products

<B></B>

of Futurism. Whereas earlier he had sought to employ the tools
of publicity within the environment of art, now he sought to employ
art and artists in the world of advertising. And yet throughout the
long course of his career he displayed the same exceptional gift for
inventing strategies and tactics in order to market the objects that he
considered to be of value. Rarely have the poet and the entrepreneur been
so combined in a single re. Yet as one critic has observed, the scales
were never evenly weighted; Marinetti always remained "more responsive
to the exciting odor of talents waiting to be picked just at the moment
of birth than faithful to the dogmas that he himself had proposed."

Causa la mia povert&agrave; e la necessit&agrave; che ebbi di conquistarmi
un posto con studi antideali, le mie tendenze letterarie sarebbero morte
chiss&agrave; da quanto, se non avessi incontrato il faro elettrico di

subito della cattiva mediocrit&agrave; e del bottegaismo feroce che li
anima: cosicch&eacute; il tornare, con una opera di poesia disinteressata,
all'antica fucina folle, mi diede sempre un fremito d'entusiasmo e, quel

Non appena in mille copie fu stampato il libro, trattandosi di
consegnare i consueti omaggi alla stampa e a qualche amico, Marinetti
a tale proposito mi consegn&ograve; un grosso scartafaccio che presi
a sfogliare con progessivo sgomento. Si trattava di settecento e
pi&ugrave; nominativi con relativo indirizzo e ai quali con tanto di
dedica si doveva mandarlo. Le poche e sparute copie rimaste sarebbero
state dispensate ad alcuni librai delle principali citt&agrave; senza un
minimo di fretta come fatto di nessuna importanza dopo quel tutto esaurito
che lo aveva preceduto. La nota comprendeva le pi&ugrave; svariate persone
e i pi&ugrave; insospettati personaggi: uomini politici e di cultura,
professori, industriali e professionisti, gentildonne e gentiluomini,
fra cui risultavano quali astri di prima grandezza proprio quelli che si
sapeva essere i pi&ugrave; feroci e irriducibili nemici di tale impresa, e
che lo avrebbero gettato con infamia e magari bruciato, ma erano proprio
quelli che non lo volevano, secondo la teoria di Marinetti, che dovevano
averlo....Mi opposi risolutamente a un simile progetto e venimmo a patti
che in quei settecento e pi&ugrave; indirizzi avrei fatto un'ampia scelta
a modo mio e che si ridusse presso a poco alla met&agrave;, non solo, ma
mi dichiarai impreparato nel modo pi&ugrave; preciso a scrivere centinaia
di dediche a persone che non conosceve...."Le dediche te le detto io,"
rispose Marinetti.

It pleases me to scrutinize and ascertain that which I truly possess in
the propeller myth, and thus also the nature of the propeller's impulsion
or propulsion. One thing seems clear: that the propeller cannot be just
"any old myth."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Driven by the propeller myth of Carlo Emilio Gadda, this essay derives its
title from the opening paragraph of Marinetti's 1912 "Technical Manifesto
of Futurist Literature": to be precise, from its famous description of how
the poet, seated on the fuel tank of a soaring biplane, first felt the
need to free language from the prison house of traditional syntactical
form. You will recall that this exordium is pronounced by a re well
known to readers of <I>La Conqu&ecirc;te des &eacute;toiles</I> ,
<I>Mafarka le futuriste</I> , and the early Futurist manifestos:
Marinetti's boastful and boisterous first-person narrator/orator
persona. The phrase "io sentii l'inanit&agrave; ridicola della vecchia
sintassi ereditata da Omero" (I felt the ridiculous inanity of the old
syntax inherited from Homer) thus has a familiar ring to it, linked
as it is with Marinetti's usual claims of clairvoyance and prophetic
urgency. By the paragraph's end, however, this "I" has been recast in
a less customary role, that of taking dictation...from a propeller.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Ecco che cosa mi disse l'elica turbinante, mentre filavo a duecento metri
sopra i possenti fumaiuoli di Milano. E l'elica soggiunse...." (This is
what the swirling propeller told me as I sped along at two hundred meters
above the powerful smokestacks of Milan. And the propeller added....)
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Dictation taken

<B></B>

from an object. A cutting-edge object, to be sure, but a mere object, all
the same, and one that is infringing on the place usually reserved for
Marinetti's blunt-edged egocentric muse. Yet the manifesto is unambiguous:
a propeller, not a poet, will do the talking; a propeller will dictate
from on high the laws that are to govern modern poetic discourse and
define the desublimated forms of individuality and subjectivity attached
thereto.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It might be objected that, despite this opening gambit, the poet-scribe's
silence does not last for very long. By article 7 of the manifesto his
voice is cutting back into the propeller's chatter, merging with its
modernist whir as if to enact the manifesto's closing dream of a fusion
of motor and man, metal and flesh.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The takeover is complete once the properly "technical" portion of
 the argument has concluded, whereupon dictation ceases and the poet
 reasserts total control: "looking at objects from a new point of view,"
 he proclaims, "I have been able to demolish the old logical fetters
 and the leaden wires of ancient understanding."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 So, the "Technical Manifesto" animates the voice of a propeller only in
 order to absorb it within the poet's own voice, and to remake that voice
 in the image of the new mechanical kingdom that Futurist poetry is called
 upon at once to presage and reproduce. The object world represented by
 the propeller is only a pretext, the true goal being the modernization
 and expansion of the poet's subjectivity. But if such is an adequate
 account of the overall trajectory of the manifesto, I would like to
 return to and interrogate Marinetti's opening fiction a bit further. For
 example, why is it desirable that this particular mechanical muse
 should propel the discourse of the "Technical Manifesto"? Why should
 a propeller stand in for the animated objects, courageous metals,
 and capricious motors that make up the manifesto's redeemed material
 world? In what ways does Marinetti's propeller prosopopeia regulate
 the manifesto's argument and form? In the following remarks I will
 be addressing questions such as these through close scrutiny of the
 manifesto itself and by means of a lateral sectioning of the airspace
 in and around the manifesto's propeller screw.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What I am especially interested in is the multiplicity of simultaneous
semiotic chains, institutions, technologies, and historical circumstances
whose determinations interconnect in the 1912 "Technical Manifesto". Of
particular concern to me, for example, will be emerging links among
various apparently unrelated technologies developed during the second
industrial revolution, the cognitive possibilities opened up by the
experience of flight, and the way in which certain modes of organization
and coordination that first arose during the early years of aviation
(and, especially, <I>military</I> aviation) rendered "thinkable" forms of
literary expression like those prophesied and practiced by Marinetti. I
am therefore unconcerned with establishing an argument founded primarily
on notions of causal explanation or genealogical development, although I
remain committed to the philological reconstruction of certain aspects
of Marinetti's text, and take for granted the inaugural role that the
"Technical Manifesto" played with respect to Futurism's later aerial
formulations of fascist modernism. My deeper concern, rather, lies with
sampling the vintage 1912

<B></B>

air breathed by Marinetti's mechanical muse. And, in so doing, I will be
operating in a speculative middle zone somewhere in between the sharply
polarized assessments of Marinetti offered by, among others. Edoardo
Sanguineti and Luciano De Maria: that is, between the former's version
of Marinetti as the hack recycler of contemporary commonplaces, and the
latter's depiction of Marinetti the revolutionary and founding father
of cultural modernity.

I begin with a grammatical detail that is easily overlooked--the
<I>passati remoti</I> (past absolute)
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 mentioned above, featured in the preface to the manifesto: "sentii
 l'inanit&agrave; ridicola" and "ecco che cosa mi disse l'elica." Although
 a standard rhetorical feature of the manifesto form, the temporal
 disjunction signaled here corresponds to an actual chronological gap
 of nearly two years. The "Technical Manifesto" was composed between
 January and May 1912, in the period after Marinetti's return from the
 Battle of Tripoli where he participated "in all the most violent, most
 virile, and most heroic actions" of that colonial war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 The months in question were times of relative glory for Futurist
 art, but of crisis for Futurist poetry. In the words of the poet Aldo
 Palazzeschi, author of <I>L'incendiario</I> : "Do you [Marinetti]
 know that no one talks about Futurist poetry any longer? About painting
 yes, but poetry seems to

<B></B>

have drowned in everyone's eyes. Hardly surprising given that the poets
are dead silent! Foremost among them the chief!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 In response to pleadings of this sort, Marinetti had promised "to
 dedicate himself exclusively to [the triumph of] Futurist literature"
 and the "Technical Manifesto" was the device by means of which he hoped
 to relaunch the movement's literary wing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The Futurist leader had first climbed aboard an aircraft some two
 and one-half years before sitting down to pen the 1912 manifesto: in
 September 1909, to be precise, during the first international air meet
 at Brescia (<A HREF="1.3schnapp_1.html"> 1</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The Brescia event was of momentous importance; not only did it launch
 the aviation craze in Italy, but it also introduced the muses into an
 Italian aerodrome for the first time. During ten days of accident-prone
 races, which included a competition for <I>slancio</I>--a key Futurist
 term (best translated as <I>&eacute;lan</I>)--Marinetti had been only
 one among a number of poets to hitch rides, however brief, around the
 field before an audience that included the young Franz Kafka.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Foremost among the aspiring poet-aviators was Gabriele D'Annunzio,
 who alone was honored with a full eight-minute flight by the
 aerial luminary of the moment, the American pilot Glenn Curtiss (<A
 HREF="1.3schnapp_2.html"> 2</A>). D'Annunzio's ascent was, like
 every act of aviation first accomplished during this era, copiously
 chronicled in the contemporary press by means of a combination of image
 and industrial

<B></B>

print technologies (multiple typefaces, parallel columns, boldfacing,
etc.), as well by means of wireless telegraphy. A photograph of and
full-length interview with Luigi Barzini were, for instance, featured
on page 3 of the <I>Corriere della Sera</I> on the following day, in
the course of which D'Annunzio had proclaimed the birth of no less than
"a new sensation...a new necessity, a new passion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 The <I>terza pagina</I> ("third page"--the standard cultural/intellectual
 page in Italian newspapers) was (and remains) the standard forum for
 cultural debate within the new public sphere constituted by daily
 mass circulation newspapers; this specifically "cultural" collocation
 of aviation was the rule from 1909 through the early 1930s. Aviation
 poems; the stories of feats accomplished by individual flyers, their
 accidents and falls, their biographies and photographs; accounts of
 rival nations' attempts to gain aerial supremacy; international flight
 meets; flight trophies; and even technical developments in flight
 technology were featured on <I>terza pagine</I> under the rubric of
 "The Conquest of the Air" alongside more conventional cultural fare
 and in addition to front-page headlines trumpeting such media events as
 Louis Bl&eacute;riot's English Channel crossing and the not infrequent
 breaking of altitude and distance records.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nor was the relation between daily newspapers and aviation one of mere
reflection, for the medium itself had assumed an active role right from
the start. Aviation was one of the era's defining forms of spectacle
so, like its British and French counterparts, the <I>Corriere</I> had
provided the prize monies for the Brescia air meet in return for special
coverage rights, as well as offering third-page coverage of the event's
cultural ramifications. Among the latter would be D'Annuncio's <I>Forse
che s&igrave;, forse che no</I> (Perhaps yes, perhaps no), the first true
aviation novel, as well as an influential oration, also dating from the
following year, entitled "Per il dominio dei cieli" (For the dominance
of the skies).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Less well known, however, is the flood of other literary artifacts with
 para-Futurist resonances produced in the immediate wake of the Brescia
 meet by minor poets such as Alberto Alberti and Giovanni Bertacchi.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 In the former's <I>All'et&agrave; ventura</I> (For the coming era),
 for instance, within the arc of a poetic cycle that leads its reader
 through a sequence of chapters entitled "La macchina" (The machine), "Il
 passato" (The past), "L'avvenire" (The future), "Gli uomini nuovi" (The
 new men), and "Il pensiero e l'infinito" (Thought and the infinite),
 Alberti sings of a winged contraption that with its "leading edge

 Bertacchi's "Canto d'aerea vita" (The song of aerial life) similarly
 celebrates the ability of the new ethos of flight to descend from the
 supreme hero of modern times--the pilot/athlete--down into the hearts
 of the masses "where the new conquest will live again translated into
 life's everyday rhythms."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 And this new aerial, quotidian reality is then identified with the
 familiar Marinettian theme of the passage via technology out of legend
 into a transred daily life: "I see history peopled with heroes and
 new exploits in continents of air; I see the city of Icaria with its
 free children, moving from myth into reality."

Many other examples could be cited in order to show just how widespread
was Bertacchi's conviction that in the age of industry and the masses--an
era, in the words of Edmond Rostand, "without inebriation and where the
soul lay idle"--aviation

<B></B>

alone could resuscitate art, the individual, and an ethos of
heroism. (Rostand's own 1911 <I>Le Cantique de l'aile</I>, for instance,
sings of how, thanks to the discovery of flight, "Daring is reborn as
well as Exploit!" and how "the Hero, long retired beneath his tent like
the Greek hero, has now ripped down the pulsing cloth and flown away
with it!")
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 But beyond wishing to point to aviation's key place in the early
 twentieth-century imagination, my concern here is to underscore one of
 the 1912 manifesto's essential frame conditions: namely, the existence
 of a network binding aviation to contemporary literary forms, to the
 news media, to industrial typography and image technologies, and to new
 technologically inflected redefinitions of both heroism and everyday
 life--a network that was already solidly in place when Marinetti embarked
 on his first true flight nearly one year after the events of Brescia. In
 other words, Futurism was less ahead of the trend line than alongside it
 when, in September 1910 at the Milan International Air Week, Marinetti
 stepped up onto the wing of Giovanni Bielovucic's biplane to set off
 on the overflight of industrial Milan described <I>a full year and a
 half later</I> in the opening paragraph of the "Technical Manifesto".
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The flight in question, "two hundred meters above Milan's powerful
 smokestacks," was one of the earliest such passenger flights in
 northern Italy, since only one week earlier Germano Ruggerone had been
 the first Italian to overfly the Madonnina of the Milanese Duomo (<A
 HREF="1.3schnapp_3.html"> 3</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 It occurred, moreover, under the

<B></B>

shadow cast by the era's most recent aerial exploit, Juan Chavez's
crossing of the Alps, which ended in a fatal crash landing on 23
September--an event coordinated by wireless telegraphy, greeted by daily
banner headlines, mourned by millions, and commemorated in <I>terza
pagina</I> poems by Giovanni Pascoli ("Ode a Chavez" [Ode to Chavez]),
Cesco Tomaselli ("Il prodigio fatale" [The fatal feat]), and E. A. Butti
("L'elegia del volo mortale" [Elegy on a mortal flight]).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 If such background considerations may help to explain the "Technical
 Manifesto's" definition of art as "a [heroic] need for self-destruction
 and dispersal" through innovation, and its promise to "free [mechanical]
 man from the idea of death," it is only by turning to certain technical
 features of Marinetti's flight that the opening paragraph locks into
 focus.

The Voisin biplane on which the poet-scribe took his dictation--apparently
the same as that imagined back in April 1909 in the manifesto in which he
had first imagined himself as an aviator-bombadier, "Uccidiamo il chiaro
di luna" (Let's kill the moonshine)--was already of outmoded design
(<A HREF="1.3schnapp_4.html"> 4</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Its pilot, a young Peruvian like Chavez, was seated on the lower
 wing with his feet extending forward into a short cockpit equipped
 with lateral ailerons. To his sides extended a double set of wings
 (around six feet apart, six feet deep, and forty feet in total wingspan)
 joined together by vertical struts and by four vertical panels, which
 combined to form symmetrical cells on each end of the wing with a broad
 rectangular "window" at

<B></B>

their center. The tail took the form of a box kite. Above and behind the
pilot, atop the fuel tank, there was space enough for a single passenger,
whose lower body, as indicated in the manifesto,
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 would have been partially shielded from the airflow by the aviator's
 head. Directly behind the passenger was a noisy fifty-horsepower
 E.N.V. engine with the propeller screw facing backwards, pushing rather
 than pulling the airship. (Bielovucic's airplane was, in other words,
 what contemporaries called a "pusher.")

This design bears a number of perceptual-symbolic consequences that may
help account for the "Technical Manifesto's" constant oscillation between
a poetics of agitated matter associated with aviation's links to the more
"intuitive" senses of touch, smell, and hearing, and a poetics of image
streams associated instead with aviation's impact on the faculty of
sight. I begin with the first. The Voisin's design is such that, as was
typical of early aircraft, the poet-passenger's body, rather than that of
the pilot, forms a single physical unit with the engine, fuel system, and
propeller chassis (<A HREF="1.3schnapp_5.html"> 5</A>). Unable to
communicate with the pilot because of the deafening din, he participates
instead in the mechanical rhythms and physical vibrations

<B></B>

emanating from the engine/propeller complex--the noises, weights, and
odors exalted at the manifesto's midpoint.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 But most of all what he hears is the roar that constitutes the propeller
 screw's "dictation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Reaching him from behind, "roared" into his ear and relayed directly
 to his body by the pulsating motor and chassis, the propeller's talk
 is identified with the principal mystery of flight as then conceived:
 the fact that masses of metal, wood, and cloth loaded down with human
 bodies could become airborne, which is to say "dematerialized" and
 "spiritualized," simply by means of the acceleration produced by an
 internal combustion engine. Advances in engine design such as the
 advent of rotary cylinder layouts had more than doubled the speed and
 duration of flights by 1911. But with increased power came increased
 danger and unreliability.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All three attributes--power, danger, and unreliability--are advantageous
from Marinetti's viewpoint, since they permit the development of
a body/machine complex founded on notions of struggle, sacrifice,
feverish effort, and expenditure: an aesthetic (i.e. non-productivist)
body/machine complex that runs counter to the complexes being devised
within the domains of scientific management (Taylor)and the "science of
work," which were founded instead on notions of body/machine harmony,
energy conservation, and freedom from fatigue.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Let me clarify. If motors were to become fully reliable and peril-free,
 as was the dream of turn-of-the-century mechanical and social
 engineers, they would embody earthbound and library-bound rationalism
 and promote the attenuation of instinct in the name of predictability,
 standardization, and the leveling of human differences. For Marinetti,
 to the contrary, it was imperative that motors remain quite literal
 <I>motori a scatto</I> (internal combustion motors), mechanisms
 that, no matter how technically perfect, are always capable of
 lunging, sputtering, or exploding due to their capricious, excessive,
 individualistic nature. This because motors were meant to function as
 adversaries, as enemy doubles of a human subject who, in the process
 of taming the always menacing machine, was called upon to metallize
 himself and to transform his own distinctive vital <I>scatti</I>, his
 own "breathing, sensibility, and instincts," into those of "metals,
 minerals, and wood."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Hence, the new visionary will be a man like Arturo Mercanti, the
 organizer of the 1910 Transalpine crossing and of other celebrated aerial
 exploits; a man who, according to one reporter from the <I>Corriere della
 Sera</I>, generates not a stable output, but an always-about-to-double
 horsepower:

 "Without poetry's uninterrupted succession of new images," the "Technical
 Manifesto" proclaims, "there is nothing but anemia and chlorosis,"
 and, in keeping with this polarity, the Futurist body/machine complex
 is designed to produce an infinite proliferation of novelties and to
 forestall the onset of repetition (identified with a return to the
 "dark diffidence," effeminacy, and decay of the fin de si&egrave;cle).
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

The motor jutting out behind the poet-passenger's back on Bielovucic's
Voisin would of course be grounded were it not for the presence of a
propeller screw. And whereas the former was made of metal, the latter
had to be made of laminated lacquered wood. At the time of Marinetti's
1910 flight, experiments were underway with other surface treatments
(copper, lacquer-impregnated linen) and technologies (cast metal) in
order to reduce propeller torsion and skin friction. But the problem
with metal was excessive weight, so in order to balance the need for
lightness and strength, wood became the material of choice. The wood
propeller's intermediate position between the weightlessness associated
with the airplane's sail-like wings
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 and the weight associated instead with the engine (in other words,
 between the aerial and metallic aspects of an aircraft's identity),
 corresponded to its location at a symbolic crossroads: right at the
 center of the cross formed by the airplane's wings and its perpendicular
 fuselage.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Symbolic considerations such as these, bolstered by  the propeller's
 crucial role as the translator of an engine's power into actual physical
 thrust, led the contemporary imagination to transform it into the very
 emblem of that material dematerialization of matter in which the miracle
 of flight was thought to consist. I employ the word "miracle" because it
 suggests just how thoroughly the already secularized romantic language
 of transcendence and sublimity was grafted onto the technology of flight
 during these early years, even within the domains of aeronautic science
 and engineering.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 The airplane, or "aeroplane" as it was oftentimes denoted, was thus
 imagined as a crucifix, and the pilot as a self-sacrificing god; its
 propeller or wings became the "wing&egrave;d oarage" employed by Virgil
 in the <I>remigium alarum</I> topos to describe Daedalus's flight,
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 by Church Fathers such as Ambrose and Augustine to represent the human
 soul's flight from the body's fallen materiality, and by Dante to deepen
 the tragedy of Ulysses's <I>folle volo</I> (mad flight) in the pursuit
 of secular knowledge.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 In the specific case of the propeller screw I offer as a first example
 of Futurism's contribution an unpublished Marinettian text entitled
 "L'elica e il paesaggio" (probably dating from the 1920s), in which
 the female protagonist, a "propeller, halo of the new divinity, the
 machine," vanquishes the universe by streaming triumphantly up into
 the sky in five-hundred-meter leaps and bounds.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Similarly, throughout the "Technical Manifesto's" immediate predecessor,

<B></B>

<I>Le Monoplan du Pape</I> , the propeller is at once delicate
and fierce. A fearsome borer of the heavens driven by the poet's pulsing
motor/heart, it slaps the aviator in the face with indefatigable gusts
of wind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Nonetheless, <I>Le Monoplan's</I> propeller is less a shrew than a
 floral screw: a "purring" or "swirling rose"; a "vast African rose,
 drunk with flirtatious insects" that can be offered up as a gift to
 the rising sun by the poet's motor/heart.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such conceits are ubiquitous not just in Marinetti's writings, but also
within the period as a whole. To cite but one example, a technical
aeronautics text from the immediate post-World War I ear does not
hesitate to describe the motor as the airplane's heart and the propeller
as its soul:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Isn't [the propeller] soul-like in its infinite smallness with respect
to the whole airplane, in its imponderability when twirling at high

breath; so often a mere caress will prompt it to expire.

Here, as in the prior propeller-halo equation and in <I>Le Monoplan's</I> propeller-rose, the screw is unambiguously female. So too, I would
submit, in the propeller prologue to the "Technical Manifesto" and
in numerous other Futurist aviatory works extending from Marinetti's
<I>Danza dell'aviatrice</I> (Dance of the aviatrix; 1916)
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 through aeropoems like Giovanni Rotiroti's <I>Eliche sul cuore</I>
 (Propellers on the heart; 1939) and aeropaintings like Sante Monachesi's
 <I>Desiderio di eliche</I> (Propeller desire) and Tullio d'Albissola's
 ceramic designs (both from the late 1930s) (. <A HREF="1.3schnapp_6.html">6</A> and <A HREF="1.3schnapp_7.html">7</A>). (I note
 in passing the names of Giacomo Balla's two daughters: Elica and Ala
 ("Propeller" and "Wing"). Whether she assumes the guise of an aureole
 forming over the motor or of a fragile soul attached to a masculine
 body/motor, or merely functions as a mechanical muse, the propeller
 behind the motor is always the little woman behind the big man: a thrust
 device just like the woman celebrated decades later by Benedetta as
 "apex and propeller of the spiritual-aesthetic expansion of the great
 fascist Italy" led by <I>il Duce</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 In the specific case of the "Technical Manifesto," the woman in
 question--be she mistress or muse--is implicitly identified with the
 materiality of wood.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Not unlike the linguistic material available to the words-in-freedom poet
 nor unlike the cloth that makes up the airplane's wings, this wood can
 be freed from the chains that keep it bound to Mother Earth--the chains
 that bind matter to death and to the "fatally corrosive effects of time"
 (<I>la fatale corrosione del tempo</I> [<I>TIF</I>, 42]), the chains that
 shackle words within the laws of logic, syntax, punctuation, spelling,
 verb tense, and decorum. All of these life-sapping, leaden fetters
 constitute a tragic reality that can be momentarily overcome through
 the activation of a higher potentiality that lies dormant within matter
 (but is nonetheless an integral component): that inner agitation and
 drive toward "greater ardor, greater movement, a greater subdivision
 of itself sung in the 1912 manifesto.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 What is needed to effect this transformation, to get matter airborne,
 to recover its secret life, and release it into the plenitude of the
 eternal present, is a masculine force: a motor and

<B></B>

a pilot, a poet-flyer endowed with a wireless imagination, an aerodynamic
phallus.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There would be much to be said here about the virile subject over whose
head looms the propeller-aureole and out of whose body the aircraft's
wings obtrude. Identified at the close of the manifesto with Futurism's
ideal "mechanical man composed of interchangeable parts," this cyborg-like
creature takes to the air in the pursuit of freedom from "death itself,
[the] supreme definition of logical intelligence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 And, as was earlier implied with regard to the Futurist body/machine
 complex, his flight from the logic of death often entails a flight from
 those aspects of female anatomy and sexuality that seem too closely
 allied with earthbound forms of reproduction. Hence, for instance, in
 <I>Le Monoplan du Pape</I>, the poet-aviator's claim that "flying at
 full speed beyond history and anatomy, / on vacation, on vacation, /
 far from the vulva, gloomy mandatory school!" he becomes "the artist," a
 "great and abundant being" because endowed with limitless self-generative
 powers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Likewise, in the conclusion of "Against Love and Parliamentarianism,"
 the dream of creating "a mechanical son, engendered by willpower alone"
 is invoked as the inebriating spectacle of a Bl&eacute;riot's takeoff
 causes "strong Futurists" to "feel detached from woman, who has suddenly
 become...the symbol of the earth that must be left behind."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Given the importance of the propeller-myth analyzed above, the larger
 meaning

<B></B>

of these fantasies of self-creation and of escape from the routines
imposed by history, woman, work, and school cannot be <I>detachment</I>
from the world. Rather it is reattachment, but <I>reattachment</I> under
conditions wherein the aviator is free to dictate his law of infinite
novelty (against monogamy, monotony, and other principles of repetition
and decay). For Marinetti, in other words, flight is less an evasion
of sexuality or labor, than a form of hypersexuality that removes
prohibitions and multiplies desires. When the Futurist flyer touches
down, and touch down he must, he is a changed man. Revirilized, still
propped up by his propeller and wings (which have now become an integral
part of his body), he springs from his craft "with an ultralight elastic
leap" because he has conquered Mother Earth and overturned the iron-clad
law that once "obliged man to crawl."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is under the aegis of this mechanized human type, a subject whose
anticontemplative mode of apperception Futurist words-in-freedom poetry
would aim to transcribe, that I now wish to turn away from the 1912
manifesto's musings on the transration of matter towards what was
earlier defined as their visual counterpart, a poetics of image-streams
associated

<B></B>

with aviation's impact on the faculty of sight. Once again, I take as my
point of departure the physical conration of Bielovucic's Voisin. The
poet-passenger on such a biplane, elevated as he is above the pilot
and his cockpit, has before him an entirely unencumbered, "transparent"
visual field, a visual field unavailable in propellerforward monoplane
designs even after 1911 (when monoplane wings were set back and the
observer's seat raised for purposes of military reconnaissance). The
resulting sense of unrestricted vision and direct bodily exposure to the
airstream surely must have strengthened in Marinetti the conviction that
aerial vision constituted an unmediated, accelerated, and synthetic mode
of apprehending the real that would infinitely expand the poet's powers
of vision and permit "literature to enter directly into the universe
and to form but a single body with it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 The single universal body thereby constituted is conceived within the
 "Technical Manifesto" as an aesthetic totality emanating from and under
 the control of a poet who is also a conqueror, bombardier, orchestra
 conductor, and campaign coordinator, much like the re of Arturo
 Mercanti. But whereas the latter's "totality" consisted of the staging
 of unprecedented aerial feats over ever new landscapes, of what, one
 might ask, might the Futurist poet's emanations consist; and just how
 might the Futurist poet achieve his territorial conquests and acts of
 coordination? Typically, Marinetti's answer mixes technical-scientific
 notions with metaphors of late symbolist derivation. The poet's body,
 by virtue of its being airborne, is hollowed out:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
When I flew for the first time with the aviator Bielovucic, I felt
my chest open up like a great hole through which, smooth, fresh, and
torrential, all the blue of the sky plunged exquisitely. Instead of the
slow watered-down sensuality of walks under the sun and amidst flowers,
one ought to prefer the ferocious and blood-tingling massage of the
raging wind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "great hole" stands for a momentary effemination whose overall effect
is virilizing. It marks the site where earthbound forms of sentimentality
and sensuality have been evacuated or vomited forth so as to make room
for aerial passions and sensations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Opened up, reinvigorated by the wind's fierce massage, the poet's body
 is unchained. It can flow out and take possession of the universe by
 means of networks of perceptual and/or intuitive strings that, woven
 together, form invisible aerial nets, "invisible" either because they
 are mental constructs or are envisaged according to a double analogy
 with flight paths and wireless telegrams, "aerial" because no longer
 weighed down by the "leaden" ballast of logic or syntax. So light and
 rapid that the poet's "expansionist gesture can cast them afar...out
 over a vast ocean," "the mysterious sea of phenomena," these nets
 yield an ever more bountiful and renewable catch of images that would
 be unavailable, or so Marinetti implies, were it not for the advent
 of an imagination that, freed from wires or syntactical strings, is
 endowed with wings: "words in freedom, the imagination with outspread
 wings, analogical synthesis of the earth embraced by a single gaze and
 wholly gathered together in essential words."

Several points need to be made with regard to the rhizome that informs
the imagist poetics dependent upon airborne sight and according to
which the airplane functions as a mechanical intensifier of poetry's
"work of analogy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 First of all, the link established in the 1912 manifesto between the
 visual perspectives made available by flight, the aerial communication of
 synthetic or mechanized messages, and the conquest of abundant "oceans"
 by a sovereign subject was not of Marinetti's devising. On the contrary,
 it might be said that between 1910 and 1915 it was very much "in the
 air." Two examples from quite different contexts, both involving the
 use of aerial bombardment, come to mind. In November 1911, the Cinzano
 company began its first experiments with aerial publicity campaigns,
 launching disk-shaped tricolor flyers bearing an image of the earth
 surrounded and embraced by a ring representing its world-famous brand
 of vermouth.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 In March 1912, this form of intrusion into the everyday lives of
 city dwellers was extended into the domain of political propaganda by
 the newly founded Lega Aerea Nazionale, an ultranationalist aviator
 association that counted D'Annunzio among its staunchest supporters. In
 order to spread its nationalist gospel of the air, the Lega scattered
 tricolor manifestos over numerous Italian cities, calling upon the masses
 to found "the legion of eagles of the skies dedicated to defending
 borders, wherever there is danger, wherever Italy's flag and name are
 at stake."

Such uses of the airways for purposes of mass persuasion and national
mobilization corresponded in turn to two key areas of experimentation
within the domain of military aviation with which Marinetti was well
familiar: first, the ongoing race among industrialized nations to forge
wireless links between aircraft and the ground (Guglielmo Marconi was
pursuing such research) and second, the contemporaneous effort to develop
aircraft for scouting, gunning, and bombardment purposes. As early as
1910, wireless telegraphy and aviation had become indissociable not just
due to the prominence granted to flight by mass circulation newspapers,
but also in the minds of contemporary scientists and their sponsors in
various European ministries of defense (<A HREF="1.3schnapp_8.html"> 8</A>). Ground-to-air links,
it was rightly believed, would greatly enhance the reconnaissance value
of aircraft. They would facilitate the rapid deployment of troops and
artillery and disperse the "fog of war," giving rise to a battlefield
upon which face-to-face combat would be replaced by increasingly "clean"
forms of mechanized firepower arriving via the air and coordinated by
a central command located far from the theater of battle.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 It may be worth noting that on a battlefield of this kind there exists an
 absolute split between the earthbound perspective afforded the ordinary
 foot soldier and the aerial or overhead perspective available to the
 commander, a split that may, in turn, help to explain how, in the
 "Technical Manifesto," the proposed "destruction of the literary I"
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 might engender an even more sovereign literary subject. For the foot
 soldier, war's violence is experienced as agentless, random, and
 catastrophic; for the commander (and his Futurist poet counterpart)
 it is simply the expression of a greatly expanded sense of individual
 agency: "greatly expanded" because, through the eyes and bodies of his
 aviators, he can now see the

<B></B>

enemy from the air, penetrate his airspace, and be simultaneously present
at every point along the front.

Now it just so happens that the first testing ground for these concepts
was the 1911 Battle of Tripoli, the conflict between the Italian and
Turkish armies that Marinetti later described as "the most beautiful
aesthetic spectacle of my existence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 The spectacle in question involved aerial surveillance, aerial
 photography, aerial gunning, and even crude experiments with
 bombardment. (Air-to-ground communications were not yet in use.) And its
 aesthetic potential would have seemed all the greater due to the presence
 on the battle front of the documentary filmmaker Luca Comerio. Comerio
 was perhaps the earliest Italian film journalist; he can be credited
 with inaugurating the transformation, recently examined by Paul Virilio,
 of the camera eye into modern warfare's most conspicuous weapon:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
On board an airplane, the camera's peep-hole served as an indirect
sighting device complementing those attached to the weapons of mass
destruction. It thus prered a symptomatic shift in target-location
and a growing derealization of military engagement. For in industrialized
warfare, where the representation of events outstripped the presentation
of facts, the image was starting to gain sway over the object, time
over space.

Comerio experimented with footage shot from the air, from moving vehicles,
and after dark, in coverage that he hoped

<B></B>

would both permit civilians to participate in the war's most glorious
actions and "remap the world and uncover new visual and representational
rhythms and meters."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 His efforts made the Battle of Tripoli a doubly appropriate incubator for
 Futurism's new poetics. It permitted words in freedom to be hatched as
 a literary analog both of the newly mechanized, transparent battlefield
 and of a montage-based aesthetic or reportage emerging from within the
 primitive documentary cinema.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti was the war correspondent in Libya for the French daily
<I>L'Intransigeant</I>. The war dispatches that he contributed from
the front were soon reshaped into <I>La battaglia di Tripoli</I>,
the reportage that provided, in turn, the raw material for his
first words-in-freedom poem and the first implementation of the 1912
manifesto's laws: "Battaglia Peso + Odore" (Battle weight + smell)
(printed as a supplement to the August 1912 "Risposta alle obiezioni"
[Response to objections]).
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 From his earliest accounts, it was the battlefield's aerial dimension
 that most attracted Marinetti's interest (though in this regard he was
 no different from the rest of the international press corps).
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 Accordingly, the climactic chapters of <I>La battaglia</I> propel
 the poet's palpitating but earthbound heart up into the air alongside
 that of the aerial scout Carlo Piazza, who from this point on becomes
 the sole narrator. As is the case with all of Marinetti's airplanes,
 Piazza's Bl&eacute;riot monoplane functions as a kind of celestial
 writing table from which the aviator can skywrite and leave his mark
 on the territory to be surveyed and subdued.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Carving "at will circles of death through the dangerous waters of
 the enemy army," Piazza emits a rapid-fire sequence of discontinuous
 paragraphs variously addressed to comrades, the enemy, the landscape,
 the reader, all within the framework of what amounts to a crude allegory
 of arousal, followed by violent penetration and renewal.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 Saharan Africa's barren womb, plowed by artillery shells, bombs, and
 airpower--Marinetti's principal alter egos--is delivered from savagery
 and rendered fruitful through the civilizing violence of Italy's new
 war technologies. The closing paragraph speaks for itself:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

I have lingered over <I>La battaglia di Tripoli</I> not because it
somehow reveals the darker, "truer" nature of the "Technical Manifesto,"
but rather because it conjoins two themes that crisscross within the 1912
airspace and with them this essay reaches its close: that of the conquest
of the air and the conquest of colonial ground. By the beginning of the
second decade of our century, just as a certain secularized rhetoric of
transcendence had been grafted onto the technology of flight, so too
the related discourses of exploration and colonization had been fully
projected onto what was referred to as the "aerial continent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 For reasons of brevity, I cite only two illustrations: one from Walter
 Wellman's <I>The Aerial Age</I>  and another from an

<B></B>

early debate on aerial law. First Wellman: "For a century or more man
has had two great aspirations in the field of progress--one to conquer
the unknown parts of the earth, and other to conquer the air. He had
already possessed himself of most of the surface of the globe, and now
he wished to take possession of the remainder."
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 Irrespective of whether the conqueror was an individual, a collectivity,
 or a nation, the remainder of the globe here described was to be
 vanquished through a combination of technological intelligence and
 reckless adventurism. (Hence Wellman's self-designation as a scientific
 adventurer.) Instinct and science, violence and civilization, technical
 progress and the return to primordial forces and values, nationalism and
 internationalism...all of these binary oppositions could be harmonized
 within an airspace that remained, for the moment, at once law-bound and
 above the law. I quote from the jurist Edouard Rollin: "The air is still
 something unknown to us, and the drawing up of a body of rules in regard
 to it is of yet premature....[It is like] the center of the African
 continent some fifty years ago, when the maps indicated it by a great
 white space vaguely described by geographers as <I>terra incognita</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 Pronounced in 1906 during the Institut de Droit International's drafting
 of the legal corpus that would govern flight and wireless telegraphy,
 these remarks testify to the sometimes willful hesitancy with which
 international organizations undertook the task of fully regulating the
 air. Even four years later, years during which the law of the air had
 been far more exhaustively codified, the inaugural 1910 issue of the
 <I>Revue Juridique Internationale de la Locomotion A&eacute;rienne</I> would still show traces of this reluctance, defining aerial law
 as "an act of faith in the glorious destiny of aviation" and defining
 its purpose as that of "favoring the soaring impetus of the individual
 emancipated from the earth" in "a century of scientific and industrial
 miracles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 If the lyrical tone here seems out of keeping with the prosaic occasion,
 it points, as do the cases of Rollin and Wellman, to a deeper paradox
 which resonates within the 1912 manifesto. Whether viewed by those who
 would regulate and rationalize it, or by those who would survey and
 conquer it by technological means, the continent of the air was seen by
 all as humankind's final frontier: a last remaining source of mystery,
 miracles, novelty, and the unknown; a last refuge for the individual from
 the humdrum world of work; a last place of transcendence in a resolutely
 secular age. Something to be preserved, therefore, in its "savage"
 natural state even as it is conquered and absorbed within earthbound
 laws and institutions. This is precisely the same paradoxical airspace
 traversed in the "Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature." An
 airspace where literature's future can be legislated through a body
 of laws above and against all prior literary laws. An airspace where
 new sovereign forms of individuality can be forged and outdated ones
 discarded in the face of physical groundlessness and peril. An airspace
 where nations can compete in the name of international progress. But
 most of all, an airspace in which metal and flesh, technology and
 instinct, mind and matter can be pressed together in the pursuit of that
 vertiginous feeling of outer fullness and inner emptiness that, Marinetti
 tells us, results when an inspired authorial hand takes to the skies:

early aviation). Monoplanes like the Bl&eacute;riot XI, however, were
already outdistancing and outflying most biplane designs by late 1910,

As noted later, one of the principal odors and tactile sensations that

oil was the best engine lubricant available and its use in racing cars and
airplanes, conjoined with its traditional medicinal use as a purgative,

The notion that the airplane forms a crucifix can be traced back to the
beginnings of aviation. It already appears to have become a commonplace
notion by the time of the 1911 Paris Aviation Salon, where the sculptor
Roger Bloche proposed that a monument to fallen aviators be constructed
in the form of a pilot-Christ re attached to an airplane-cross. It
would reach its highest expression in D'Annunzio's famous World War I
oration "L'ombra delle ali e l'ombra della croce" (The shadow of wings
and the shadow of the cross).

complex. Patristic tradition had already identified Christ on the
cross with Ulysses bound to the mast of his ship in book 12 of the
<I>Odyssey</I> so as to endure the Sirens' song. Topoi involving
"airborne" oarage or sails are not infrequent in ancient Greek and
Roman texts and can be found in such authors as Virgil, Ovid, and
Propertius. They conflate rapid sailing with the flight of birds, both of
which were invested with allegorical meanings by Christian Neoplatonists
familiar to later authors such as Dante and D'Annunzio. On this subject

It is not that Marinetti's discourse on technology brings him down to
earth, but rather that the airplane allows him to remain a distant poet,
while "seizing" the earth all the better from his total perspective. We
might say here that, with the help of the airplane, Marinetti has forged
a total aesthetic practice from Bergson's dynamic intuitions and their
politicization in Sorel. He is recapturing the spirit of engineering for
the world of art. In the sense that the air view gives him a powerful
new perspective, he feels paradoxically quite earth-intimate.

A tale of rape, carnage, and Futurist declamation set in Africa,
Marinetti's 1909 <I>Mafarka le Futuriste</I> takes as its theme the
generation of a mechanical son born of male parthenogenesis. In the
opening scene its protagonist Mafarka-el-Bar, an Arabian king with
imperial ambitions to conquer all of Africa, has recently defeated an army
of black Africans and dethroned his uncle, King Boubassa. Those ambitions,
both imperial and Futurist, will finally be satisfied, however, not by
Mafarka but by the son he constructs without the aid of what the text
refers to as the "vulva." The novel thus combines a number of elements
that might be called fascist: a rhetoric of virility, imperial fantasies
tied to the colonization of Africa, misogyny, a reproductive project,
and an obsession with self-sufficiency. Grounding itself on the notion
that the ideological specificity of a discourse or text is to be found
not in the single ideas that circulate within it, but rather in the
relations and articulations among elements, my project in this essay is
to map out the ideo-logic that binds together the elements above, and
to suggest a parallel articulation of elements in fascist discourse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If <I>Mafarka</I> is a Futurist text that looks ahead to fascism, it
also looks back to nineteenth-century orientalism. Like Flaubert's
<I>Salammb&ocirc;</I>, to which it is often disparagingly compared,
<I>Mafarka</I> is a novel immersed in an orientalist world into which
no self-identified Western narrator intrudes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 The only "Western" voice to be heard is that of Marinetti in the
 preface, where he identifies himself with his "barbarian" theme: "Am
 I not a barbarian, at least for those false devotees of progress?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<B></B>

Within the novel itself, the perspective camouflages itself as
non-Western, even producing a reverse orientalism in which the
West, and Western women, are the source of exoticism. But unlike
<I>Salammb&ocirc;</I>, a novel resolutely without a future, <I>Mafarka</I>
ends both with the obliteration of the earth and with the birth of a
superhuman creature who will rule over a new world. The orientalist
notion that the West will be reborn, revitalized, by returning to the
East, a notion that appears in the narrative setting of the "founding
manifesto" and "Let's Kill the Moonlight" as well, thus informs the
narrative structure of the novel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 As Liz Constable has noted, at least one of the functions of the African
 setting is to invert the ration of the Eastern/African other as
 belonging to a time period different from that occupied by the West.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 The notion that African peoples are "primitive," that they presently
 occupy a place in the West's past, is simply overturned so that they
 now occupy the place of the West's future, with all the orientalist
 notions about atrociously "primitive" qualities still intact.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Into this setting is introduced a reproductive fantasy: the novel's
project, in its own terms, is to bypass the vulva and impregnate the
ovary that is the male spirit: "the spirit of man," proclaims Marinetti
in the preface, "is an unused ovary...It is we who will fertilize it
for the first time <I>[la premi&egrave;re fois]!</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 The narrative impetus for this fantasy is provided by the death of
 Mafarka's beloved brother Magamal, who contracts rabies and dies after
 ripping his bride to shreds and reducing her to what the text pleasantly
 refers to as "scarlet mud" (<I>M</I>, 134). Gazourmah, the mechanical
 son, is to be the immortal substitute for the dead brother. A sort
 of Futurist Geppetto (Mafarka in fact sculpts his son from a piece of
 oak), Mafarka's reasons for creating his own kin are less than kind--to
 women. The transplant of the ovary to the male spirit is necessitated by
 the unabashedly misogynist desire for procreation without procreative
 sex: in his "<I>discours futuriste</I>" (<I>M</I>, 163), Mafarka
 jubilantly announces that "it is possible to procreate an immortal
 giant from one's own flesh, without concourse and stinking complicity
 with woman's womb."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course this is not really "<I>la premi&egrave;re fois</I>" that such
a fantasy has been conceived; my use of the term autarchy is meant, in
fact, not only to anticipate its later fascist use but also to evoke
its much earlier classical sources--the Greek <I>autarkeia</I> was used
to refer to Jason's desire for self-sufficiency in a world without
women. Marinetti's claim to originality may seem at least partially
justified by the form that the son assumes, for Gazourmah takes shape
as an airplane, and, as part human flesh and part mechanical structure,
qualifies as an early cyborg: "With my very own hands I sculpted my son
in the wood of a young oak...I found a mixture/formula that transforms
vegetable fibres into living flesh and firm muscles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 But unlike the cyborgs theorized by Donna Haraway--the transgressive,
 oppositional creatures who conjure up visions of a postmodern, postgender
 world--Marinetti's Gazourmah is born of a dream of male parthenogenesis
 that rests on philosophical foundations that are not quite so shiny
 and new.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Jean-Joseph Goux nicely encapsulates those foundations when he writes
 of philosophical idealism that is "is first of all a conception of
 conception."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 That conception is one in which woman supplies matter, and man supplies
 form; its progeny is the philosophical opposition between matter and
 spirit; and

<B></B>

its dream is that of immaculate conception or, as Goux also puts it,
"scissiparous reproduction, sexless procreation" in which value reproduces
itself, concepts spawn concepts, and fathers create sons, all without
"mother" or "labor," "out of desire and form alone" (<I>SE</I>, 199).
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Goux's formulation points to the way in which the sexual and the economic
are necessarily intertwined in the fantasy of male autarchy. But in
acting out the fantasy of male autarchy that underlies this project, an
additional factor emerges, for the novel finds itself in the bonds--the
double bonds--of the "homesexual panic" theorized by Eve Sedgwick.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Sedgwick has analyzed this double bind, and resultant panic, as a
 product of the prescription of homosocial behavior (male bonding) and
 equally strong proscription of homosexual behavior that characterizes
 all patriarchal, heterosexual culture. Within such cultures, the
 boundaries between the homosocial and the homosexual are unstable,
 and that instability works to regulate, in more or less terroristic
 fashion, all bonds between men. In <I>Mafarka</I>, as in the manifestos,
 the elimination of woman brings into view this boundary dispute and
 its attendant panic. In <I>Mafarka</I>, woman is to be eliminated not
 only as <I>matrice, mater</I>, empty receptacle, but also as "vulva,"
 as object of sexual desire. Indeed, the part of woman to be bypassed is
 more often referred to as "<I>vulve</I>" than as <I>matrice</I>" or womb,
 thereby underscoring the sexual relation and producing the repeated,
 odd formulation "I gave birth to my son without the aid of the vulva!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 As we shall see, the form that the "homosexual panic" assumes in this
 novel is somewhat different from the form it takes in the manifestos,
 where the question of the correct proximity of man to man is red
 as a question of the correct proximity of man to woman.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 In <I>Mafarka</I>, instead, it is the question of the correct proximity
 between male mother and son that causes panic, and requires the
 reintroduction of the woman as mother. What does remain constant,
 however, is the question of proximity itself, now overcoded so that
 it is not only a question of the correct proximity of man to woman,
 but also of the proximity of Futurist Europe to its once and future
 colonies. In both cases, what is at stake is the transfer of properties:
 from women to men (a transfer red in the "male ovary"), and from
 Africa to a (linguistically) Franco-Italian West. Not surprisingly,
 this latter transfer is red on the model of the dominant pair:
 Africa is introduced metonymically in the first chapter, "Le viol
 des N&eacute;gresses" (The violation of negresses) as the racialized,
 sexualized body to be raped.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here in his African novel the "lyrical obsession with matter"
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 of Marinetti's later "Technical Manifesto" appears instead as a lyrical
 obsession with <I>mater</I>--both with deanimating whatever is animate
 and gendered female, turning mother into matter, and with becoming a
 male mother. Both transformations are already internal to the project
 of idealism, as Goux describes it in his chapter on "Sexual Difference
 and History": the role of the mother is that of lifeless, formless
 matter, and the father's role, insofar as it is the purely ideological
 (as opposed to physiological) one of "cultural gestation," is that of
 "social mother" (<I>SE</I>, 224). It is as though <I>Mafarka</I> were
 the literalization of its philosophical underpinnings: Mafarka's own
 beloved mother,

<B></B>

Langourama, is a mummy--lifeless flesh preserved as object of
veneration--while Mafarka himself becomes the "social mother" and
cultural gestator of Futurism when he pronounces his "<I>discours
futuriste</I>." As I have suggested, in <I>Mafarka</I> these
transformations are bound up with "homosexual panic": we might say, in
fact, that becoming a male mother is the (however baffling) solution to
the problem at the heart of the novel: How can one remain a heterosexual
male once sexual relations with women have been eliminated? As it
turns out, of course, all mothers, including Mafarka himself, end up
deanimated, and all mothers, including Mafarka himself, end up having
sexual relations with men. But the logic of this exchange of question
(how to remain heterosexual) and answer (become a male mother) is the
structuring (and unconscious) ideo-logic of the novel.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The deanimation of female matter does not, however, imply its elimination
from the text. One of the conditions of being able to procreate without
the complicity of the "vulva" appears to be that the "vulva" must
paradoxically be everywhere present; as Kaplan has noted, "femininity"
is attributed to almost everything in the novel: landscape, objects,
Mafarka's brother Magamal, even Mafarka himself by the end, after he
has embraced his mummified mother and become a mother himself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Mafarka finds himself immersed in what Edward Said has called the
 "deep rich fund of female sexuality" characteristic of a certain
 orientalism which here functions to make his repeated refusals of
 women's propositions seem all the more heroic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 More importantly, though Mafarka rails against the debilitating effect
 of sexual relations with women, he is everywhere surrounded by scenes of
 rape. The "vulva" must not only be everywhere present but also always
 open to violence: the relation to matter is almost always red as
 heterosexual rape, as sexual violence against feminized matter or against
 female characters. Indeed, rape remains the relation to matter even for
 Gazourmah, Mafarka's mechanical son, who begins to spout the rhetoric
 of rape at birth and soon after finds himself some yielding breezes to
 violate. My analysis of the rhetoric of virility in the manifestos has
 suggested why this should be: in the homophobic logic of the text, female
 matter must always be open to violence in order to maintain the border
 between virility and what Marinetti slurringly refers to as "pederasty."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But what happens when a male becomes a mother, becomes matter in relation
to a mechanical son? The novel gives us two examples of possible relations
between mother and son: Mafarka's own relation to his mummy, and the
relation of (the hallucinated?) Coloubbi, Mafarka's abruptly introduced
ex-girlfriend, to Gazourmah. In the first case, reverence of the dead is
combined with a strange surrogacy, for by constructing Gazourmah, Mafarka
aims to give his mother a replacement for her dead son Magamal: he becomes
his mother's surrogate mother. Langourama is the only female character
in the novel not to be presented as a body to be raped, but it should
be noted that she is <I>already</I> inert matter. This might suggest
not that the mother is exempt from the sexual relation, but that it has
already taken place (at least phantasmatically), and had the consequence
consistent with the logic of the text. This suggestion is shored up by
Langourama's literary precedents (in Gautier's <I>Pied de Momie</I>,
for example, it is the object of desire who is mummified) and borne out by

<B></B>

Mafarka's reaction to Coloubbi's attempt at seduction, which Mafarka
rebuffs because it reminds him of mom: "With a very slow movement of
her soft and terrible arm, Coloubbi again drew Mafarka's mouth to her
breast...Suddenly he started, horrified, and cried: Oh! Don't make the
gesture of my mother!...Your breasts are cursed and exhausted!...Go away!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Coloubbi's own claim to be Gazourmah's mother provides further
 confirmation of the sexual nature of the relation between mother and
 son. Thus, while in relation to the "Futurist discourse" of the novel,
 Coloubbi clearly stands for the passatist nostalgia for <I>amour</I> and
 <I>clair de lune</I> that the Futurist Mafarka must overcome in order
 to give birth to his son, in relation to the economy outlined here,
 her importance lies in her sudden appearance as competing mother. She
 claims to be Gazourmah's true mother precisely because she is his lover:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
He is my son, you know, for his first glance was for me!...I melted with
pleasure beneath the rough caress of his eyes!...And he is also my lover,
and I abandoned myself to his caprices in that first glance!...You see:
I enjoy atrociously, by myself, beneath his male strength that already
dreams of killing me, emptying his veins into mine!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mother love, it would seem, is inseparable from annihilating incest.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kaplan has noted that both Mafarka and the narrative break down at this
point: Coloubbi's claim causes Mafarka to dissolve into tears, and sends
the narrative off onto a detour.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Kaplan argues that the breakdown signals an involuntary return to the
 maternal, occasioned by the threat of total feminization; I would argue
 that the narrative stalls as it attempts to re out a way to re
 the male mother's incestuous relation with the son as heterosexual. After
 all, according to the heterosexual imperative of the text, Gazourmah
 should rape his mother, should rape Mafarka; the homophobic ideologic
 of the text cannot permit this, however, because Gazourmah's "mother"
 is his "father": father-son incest cannot be staged. This conundrum
 occasions the return to the maternal, which takes place in the form
 of Mafarka's search for his "<I>momie maternelle</I>" (maternal mummy
 [<I>M</I>, 218]), Langourama, who then issues an order: "Mafarka! Kiss
 your son for me too, on the mouth!...Don't forget!" The order is clearly
 a relief to Mafarka: "Then a cry of joy relieved Mafarka's breast. He
 leapt toward his son, like the gush of a fountain." Made the bearer
 of an incestuous, but heterosexually incestuous, kiss, Mafarka can
 return to his son as a man turns from a wife to a lover; the rhetoric of
 justification is that of the supposedly unwilling adulterer, pushed into
 the arms of the "other woman": "Oh caressing breath of my mother!...You
 push me into the arms of my son!...You command me to annihilate my own
 body, giving him life!" It is at this moment in the novel that Mafarka
 is most clearly, and culturally, a mother, at the same time as he most
 clearly exhibits the forbearance marked as virile: "Oh my son! Oh my
 lord!...I have given everything, for you! By dint of fasts and bloody
 sacrifices and prayers, I saved my will from dependence on drink or on
 a fascinating color or on the perfume of a woman."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Kaplan quite correctly glosses the first three exclamations of this
 passage as marking a failure of will: Mafarka is the martyred mother, a
 "total woman."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 But the second half ("By dint of fasts...") introduces a rather different
 element, for this

<B></B>

is a rhetoric of virility that quite specifically marks this mother as a
male who can withstand the distraction women's perfume can cause to the
"olfactory imagination of the male."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 In other words, Mafarka is both the sacrificing, devoted mother who
 gives all to her child and the male who succeeds in maintaining
 both will and virility, for as we know from the later manifesto
 "Contro il lusso femminile" (Against feminine excess) a mere whiff
 of a woman's perfume, a touch of a fine fabric, may sometimes lead to
 "pederasty." And by bearing the mother's kiss, Mafarka is able to give
 life to his son not through the lips of the vulva, but through those
 of his own mouth. Gazourmah comes to life under the kiss of his male
 mother: "Here is my soul!...Give me your lips and open your mouth to
 my kiss!...And he threw himself about the neck of his son, and pressed
 his own mouth onto the sculpted mouth. Immediately the formidable body
 of Gazourmah started violently, and his powerful wings sprung open."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 A page later, of course, Mafarka meets the fate of all that is feminine
 in the text, as he, too, is reduced to inert matter. But here the
 homoerotic kiss is stolen under cover of familial relations, through
 the mother's interposed kiss, and as a same-sex version of Pygmalion,
 who, like Mafarka, was driven to sculpt out of scorn for women. As
 in <I>Come si seducono le donne</I> (How to seduce women), where the
 Futurist male can <I>inculare</I> neutralists' wives while ting
 for the nation's borders, here the homoerotic fantasy is smuggled in
 <I>as</I> heterosexual.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The narrative introduction of a competing incestuous mother (Coloubbi)
and its detour to Mafarka's own mother (who gives permission to commit
incest) were thus motivated by a requirement of what Luce Irigary has
called the male hom(m)o-sexual economy. By male hom(m)o-sexual economy,
Irigaray means the patriarchal, exogamic economy in which women are
exchanged among, and serve as the mediation and alibi for relations
(economic as well as sexual) between, men. It is important to distinguish
this double-<I>m</I>-ed hom(m)o-sexuality from homosexuality, which
refers instead to male same-sex relations that are at once required by
and yet subversive of that economy. This is a familiar formulation,
for it recalls Eve Sedgwick's notion of the double bind whereby male
homosociality is prescribed but male homosexuality proscribed. For
Irigaray, male same-sex relations are subversive insofar as they forgo the
prescribed mediation through women and put into circulation the phallus
that serves as (excluded) universal equivalent, and thus deprive the
economy of its "money." In other words, male same-sex relations would
bankrupt the hom(m)o-sexual economy. Within that economy, then, neither
male homosexuality nor father-son incest may be openly avowed, for,
as Irigaray writes, "they openly interpret the law according to which
society operates."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 In <I>Mafarka</I>, the evocation of mother-son incest is thus the
 displacement of the alibi for father-son incest, of the pederastic
 relation (and at this point I take "pederasty" out of the quotation
 marks that contained it as Marinetti's slur on all male same-sex
 relations). Within the economy of the text, the openness of this
 particular scene is paid for in the final pages of the novel, where
 the mediation through women is less than delicately restored in the
 dialogue between Gazourmah and the (linguistically feminine) "Mocking
 Breezes." I quote at length to show how "costly" the scene has been:

Surely there are other ways to imagine the relation between an airplane
and the clouds through which it flies, but even as airplane, the
transcendent male spirit needs to negate matter <I>as</I> female. The
by now tedious insistence upon rape as the basis of even the superhuman
Gazourmah's relation to feminized matter serves both to reaffirm the
heterosexual imperative, and to throw into high relief the anomaly of
the tender kiss exchanged between Mafarka and son. The "cost" of this
reaffirmation is the success of Mafarka's project, for this is the
relation to the "vulva" that Mafarka has railed against throughout the
novel, and that Gazourmah's vulva-less birth was meant to bypass. The
narrative, however, plays itself out in triumphant Futurist mode as
though oblivious to the loop in which its own project is caught. This
is no send up of idealism, but rather a rehearsal of its foundations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That rehearsal is repeated in the "apocalyptic" scenes in the novel. In
both cases those scenes are apocalypses of heterosexuality. The first
is the "<I>d&eacute;bauche v&eacute;g&eacute;tale</I>" (vegetable orgy
[<I>M</I>, 200]) that immediately follows Mafarka's close call with
Coloubbi; he almost gives in to the temptation of nostalgia, and in the
place of surrender makes a burnt offering to the Hurricane that arises
inexplicably to threaten Gazourmah. The offering is the vegetable orgy;
male tree trunks and virile bowsprits are consumed by naked female
flames; ships tossed by the sea become "<I>tartanes en chaleur</I>"
(tartans in heat [<I>M</I>, 200]); Mafarka as pimp races about preparing
his own personal holocaust: "And Mafarka did not tire of running here
and there like a lugubrious pimp, preparing beds of lust for the loves
of these red goddesses! He arranged both young and centuagenarian trunks
on mattresses of leaves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 No noun enters this description without being both personified and
 gendered, and there is no relation that is not a (hetero)sexual one. Even
 the night during which the orgy takes place is personified as a woman
 in labor, giving birth to an unknown world: "the Night swelled her
 laboring belly. To what world would she give birth?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The question thematizes the function of the apocalypse itself; it seems
 to want to mark the death of the sexual relation to woman, and in its
 place put the parturition of the male mother: "Oh! The joy of having
 given birth to you thus, handsome and pure of all the defects that
 come from the maleficent vulva and predispose one to decrepitude and
 death!...Yes, you are immortal, my son!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 The implicit reference to Pandora, whose

<B></B>

birth inaugurated not only sickness and death but also introduced the
"damnable race of women" to mankind,
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 makes it clear that the world about to be born reinaugurates a
 pre-Pandoran state, yet that pre-Pandoran state cannot be imagined except
 through mediation by women or the feminine. Similarly, the pages that
 follow the dramatic dialogue quoted above describe the earth convulsed
 by quakes and engulfed in volcanic eruption as Gazourmah flies off to
 dethrone the sun.

The kiss between male mother and son is not entirely unprecedented
in the novel, however, for Mafarka's relation to his brother Magamal
similarly appears to smuggle in homoerotic relations under the cover
of the proximate relations of the family, and within the sheltering
boundaries of the so-called Sotadic zone. Given the orientalist context,
it seems appropriate to adopt this term coined by Richard Burton, the
orientalist and translator of the <I>Arabian Nights</I>, in order to
refer to a topography of "pederasty." Burton considers "pederasty" to
be "geographical and climatic, not racial"; within the Sotadic zone,
Burton writes,

<BLOCKQUOTE>

the Vice is popular and endemic, held at the worst to be a mere
peccadillo, whilst the races to the North and South of the limits here

In Marinetti's imaginary geography, then, where Egypt, Morocco, and
central Africa seem to coexist, we are safely within the zone. But not
so safe as not to require that "Sotadic love" be red as brotherly
love. Magamal is blatantly feminized: he has "feminine graces" and, with
his "<I>corps de caoutchouc</I>" (body of rubber [<I>M</I>, 29]),

<B></B>

makes his appearance for the first time in the novel as if in response
to Mafarka's desire for an "ardent, elastic virgin."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 But the more interesting case is recounted in the tale that Mafarka tells
 the African king, Brafane-el-Kibir, as part of his strategy to conquer
 him and take his lands. Ironically, the story turns out to recount
 Mafarka's previous and recent success in precisely such an endeavour;
 introduced as the story of the horse trader, the stuffed fish, and the
 devil, it is also the story of Mafarka's usurpation of his uncle King
 Boubassa's power. Indeed, the tale can be read as a mise-en-abyme of
 the entire novel for, like Mafarka, Gazourmah has imperial ambitions;
 he aims to dethrone not an uncle but the Sun itself, and become king not
 of Africa but of the firmament. Briefly, the story recounts how Mafarka
 the horse trader sells a marvelous horse to the devil, disguised as a
 rich merchant (in obvious counterpoint to Mafarka, who is disguised as
 a poor beggar as he tells the tale). The wondrous stallion, whose red
 mane and tail ignite in the wind, and whose purple, sapphire-encrusted
 <I>zeb</I> is the dream of all the girls of the city (<I>zeb</I> is in
 fact Arabic slang for "dick"), turns out not to be a reliable means
 of transportation for he cannot resist an opportunity to copulate:
 "Completely drunk from the smell of the moist vulva, he tossed his
 whiplike mane against the flanks of the female, who started at the
 burning sensation, delivering terrible kicks. Thus the Devil, even
 though an excellent horseman, was thrown from the saddle three times."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Engaged, the Devil decides to get his revenge by castrating the horse
 and serving up its <I>zeb</I> to Mafarka as a stuffed fish, delicately
 prepared with curdled milk, violets, and cinnamon. Unaware, Mafarka
 eats the stuffed penis and immediately exhibits the same behavior as
 the horse, copulating with everything female in sight. As his violence
 grows, so does his own penis until it eventually reaches its maximum
 length of eleven meters, is mistaken for a rope curled next to him as
 he sleeps and then, as it is tied to a sail, becomes the mast of the
 ship that is his body. In this way Mafarka sails to Tell-el-Kibir, where
 King Boubassa hears the story and insists upon personally experiencing
 the virtues of such a miraculous <I>zeb</I>. The <I>zeb</I> in question
 is of course Mafarka's own at this point, and he hastens to comply with
 the King's request:

This single exception to the femaleness of the object of sexual violence
goes unremarked in the text, as Brafane-el-Kibir breaks in to ask about
the fate of the castrated stallion, still wandering about looking for its
lost <I>zeb</I>. The final scene (to which I shall return) is important,
however, not only as the culmination of the story of how Mafarka comes
to power, but also as the last exchange in what I will argue is a fable
of phallic economics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The fabular and fabulous character of the story recalls tales of both
Scheherazade and Boccaccio. Mafarka's strategy, like Scheherazade's,
aims to gain power through storytelling; as in Boccaccio's tales of the
eating of hearts, the object that serves as

<B></B>

the catalyst of the story's plot is consumed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 When hearts are eaten in the <I>Decameron</I>, they are eaten as signs
 of nobility (the gentle heart) and as the consummation of a love for
 which the heart is the metaphor.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 The consumption of the heart is not an act of cannibalism but rather
 the culinary consummation of a prohibited sexual relation. In the
 context of the (homophobic) homerotics of Marinetti's text, it seems
 all too easy to read the consumption of the <I>zeb</I> as yet another
 thinly disguised (homo)sexual act. But what is different about eating
 a stuffed penis is that, within a phallic economy, you are eating the
 general equivalent; you are, in other words, eating the gold standard
 of your libidinal economy, gobbling up your own capital.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It may help to translate the tale into more explicitly economic terms,
in the wake of Marx, Goux, and Irigaray. Goux in fact points to what
would seem to be an analogous example of eating in Marx (without,
however, footnoting the exact location in Marx's work): as their empire
declined, the ancient Romans were given to eating pearl salads during
their orgies. The intertwining of the sexual and the economic in the
ingestion of pearls is what particularly interests Goux: what does it
mean to eat pearls, and why do so within the context of an orgy? Why is
it so economically and sexually perverse? The economic perversion, Marx
tells us, lies in treating wealth as though it had a direct use-value. Yet
pearls, of course, have no known nutritional value and it is therefore
blatantly not their use-value that is consumed; rather, they are
consumed <I>as</I> exchange value. As a quasi-money, pearls are consumed
insofar as they stand as general equivalent and hence as "the abstract
potential of all <I>jouissances</I>" (<I>SE</I>,  207). The pearl-eating
Romans, Goux concludes, found <I>jouissance</I> in the general power of
<I>jouissance</I>, imaginary satisfaction in the fetishism of exchange
value. The price of this imaginary satisfaction is great (and not only
for one's digestive tract), for in order to find <I>jouissance</I> in
the use of the general equivalent, one must renounce all exchange;
the economy falls apart. Now, Goux has no difficulty (perhaps too
little difficulty?) translating this into the libidinal economy: for
the penis to be the phallus, that is, to be the general equivalent, it
must be prohibited from immediate use value, which Goux identifies as
masturbation, and from immediate relative exchange value, which Goux
identifies as incest. As an analogy, or isomorph, to those pearl salads,
Goux offers an example from Sade of masturbation before piles of gold;
our own example from Marinetti works perhaps even better, for not only
does it represent a similar entwining of the sexual and the economic,
but it reveals, via Irigaray, a blindness in Goux's argument. Iragaray's
analysis of the hom(m)o-sexual economy also addresses the consequences of
treating the general equivalent that is the phallus as use-value: when,
as she writes, the "penis itself becomes merely a means to pleasure, of
pleasure among men, <I>the phallus loses its power</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Short-circuiting the commerce that is the exchange of women,
 male homosexuality, as we have said, eats the capital of
 hom(m)o-sexuality. Goux is thus both right and wrong when he points
 to incest as the equivalent of eating pearls: right insofar as what is
 at stake is the violation of exogamy, but wrong insofar as he seems to
 assume that it is only mother-son incest that is at issue. In Mafarka's
 story, the use of the penis as relative

<B></B>

exchange value is red as uncle-son incest, and the loss of phallic
power that it entails is fantasized instead as its explicit reversal. That
is to say, Mafarka <I>gains</I> the power of the king, the general
equivalent in the political realm, in precisely the moment that he,
in theory, loses phallic power by using the general equivalent in the
libidinal realm for pleasure between men. The lubrication for this
reversal is supplied by a recoding that takes place within the scene
itself; the consensual sexual relation between men (the king asks and
Mafarka complies) is, necessarily for the hom(m)o-sexual, homophobic
economy, recoded as a political rape: "<I>lui ravit le sceptre</I>"
(he stole/ravished his scepter [<I>M</I>, 64]).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mafarka's story of the <I>zeb</I> is not, however, only or even
principally a sexual fantasy; as in the Romans' orgiastic consumption
of pearls, the sexual fantasy is bound up with an economic fantasy. The
story also tells the tale of an increasingly "primitive" economy; it
begins with an exchange that takes place within a money economy, as
Mafarka sells the horse to the Devil, and then moves quickly to what
we might call a barter economy as the Devil takes his revenge. Revenge,
after all, seems to be based upon the principle of barter: the exchange
of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, is in principle no different
from the exchange of a horse for a pig. From revenge, the tale seems to
move to hoarding, and from hoarding to theft. In this economic fantasy,
the fantasy of the eating of the <I>zeb</I> and the consequent growth
of Mafarka's own penis appears to be based upon the notion that grounds
the fantasy of hoarding: to accumulate it is to increase it. This notion
is, of course, faulty with respect to money, since money must circulate;
as Marx explains, the independence of wealth is "a mere semblance; its
independence of circulation exists only in view of circulation, exists
as dependence on it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Wealth is dependent upon exchange, so that what appears to be, in
 hoarding, an increase in wealth is in fact its decrease. The notion of
 hoarding is foundational to the fantasy of male autarchy in the novel,
 for it proposes to hoard the penis, multiply the stores of virility by
 withdrawing it from the economy of the exchange of women. The economics
 of the fantasy of male autarchy are equally faulty, however, and the
 declaration of the male organ's independence exposes its dependence
 upon women in the (hom[m]o-)sexual economy. Wealth--in this case,
 virility--is, in that economy, dependent upon the exchange of women, upon
 their circulation both as commodities and as the "paper" representatives
 of the phallus. Once women are no longer exchanged, another economy
 must be envisioned. But as we have seen, the narrative can imagine that
 other economy only as the decrease of phallic power; indeed, Mafarka
 describes his years of powerlessness as those years in which he was
 trapped within the uncle's bowels. The narrative starts and stalls at
 each attempt to imagine that economy as ideological closure (here in
 the form of homophobia) moves in to choke it in order to secure the
 value of the phallus. Hoarding thus seems to stand as another (still
 baffling) solution to the dilemma of how to remain heterosexual without
 having sexual relations with women: it is an economy without exchange,
 Midas preferred to Medusa.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This petrified economy of no exchange is also an economy of pillage--there
is take, but no give. It makes (ideological) sense, then, that the
consequence of the

<B></B>

eleven-meter (hoarded) penis should be red as the "rape" of the
king/uncle by his usurping nephew, for the final stage in this series
is an economy of theft and rape. And the same sense might allow us to
suggest that the economy of theft and rape is here not coincidentally
set in Africa, for this is also a colonialist economic fantasy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Outside of the tale within the tale, that economic fantasy appears
in the series of what Kaplan has suggested are "uneven exchanges": as
technological qualities are attributed to humans (largely, males), human
qualities are distributed onto the landscape.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 As we have seen, those human qualities are largely "feminine" ones. But
 what happens to the (female) bodies from which those qualities have
 been borrowed? The novel seems to offer two possibilities, which often
 make up a sequence rather than an alternative: the body becomes the
 bearer of new properties, and/or it is reduced to paste. In the first
 case, the body in question is the black African woman's body, and as
 Liz Constable has noted, the properties in question are those desired
 not so much by an individual male as by a nation:
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 with "sugared thighs, the color of vanilla" and "breasts the color of
 roasted coffee," African women appear "suspended, like bananas, on the
 savory stem of his voice."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Even Magamal, with his "<I>corps de caoutchouc</I>," fits into this
 series. Rubber, sugar, vanilla, coffee, bananas: fantasized colonial
 products become properties of the body to be raped, so that possession
 of the woman becomes possession of the products as well: "One saw the
 smooth and shining bellies of the young women, and their small breasts
 the color of roasted coffee squirm with pain beneath the heavy blows of
 the men, whose bronze loins rose and fell indefatigably, in the dancing
 slapping of green putrefaction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 This rape, which takes place in the green paste produced from the
 grinding of African bodies by a "<I>fantastique pressoir</I>" (fantastic
 press [<I>M</I>, 38]), is, within the terms of the novel, color coded
 racially: the bronze rapists are, like Mafarka, Arabs, while the women
 raped are black Africans.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 And the relation between Arabs and black Africans is, through that
 putrefaction, red as an economic one: "Will not all these piles
 of black corpses, shiny, smoking, and almost liquefied on the dusty
 green of the praires, soon be transformed into pools of liquid manure,
 of rich ebony reflections, to cheer the proprietary eyes of the owner,
 the Sun...and yours, my prime minister!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 What is striking about this passage is not so much its interest in
 putrefaction--Flaubert's fascination, in <I>Salammb&ocirc;</I>, with the
 differing rates of putrefaction of bodies according to their national and
 ethnic identities provides a powerful and perhaps more shocking literary
 precedent--but rather the nature of that interest. Flaubert's investment
 seems detached, almost hyperintellectual, in relation to Mafarka's very
 proprietary interest, which is underlined by the possessive adjectives in
 the passage: the Sun owns the land to be enriched by the rot, the prime
 minister owns the eyes that like those of the Sun are proprietary, and
 Mafarka owns the prime minister. There is indeed a Western perspective
 in the novel, and this perspective is a colonial one. Mafarka the Arab
 is to the black Africans what the white man is to all Africans; the
 position of the subject in the fantasy is found not in this or that
 character, but in the relation between characters (or, as Laplanche
 and Pontalis put it, in the "syntax" of the fantasy).
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>

<B></B>

Putrefaction transforms and transfers properties. Mafarka's interest is
in the future usefuless of such transformations:

The fantasy at work here posits a self-sufficient sun, able to reap crops
without interference of the "natives," indeed, by pur&eacute;eing them
into part of the inanimate raw material necessary in order to produce
those future salads.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 (The culinary, colonial logic of this process brings to mind Helen
 Bannerman's story "Little Black Sambo," in which tigers race after each
 other so fast that they are finally turned into butter, pur&eacute;ed
 into a useful product). A most convenient transformation, for it
 sidesteps all the various problems posed by the very existence
 of "natives," and clears the field for the possibility of the
 self-sufficiency of the Emperor that is the Sun.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 It is here that we may return to the questions with which the
essay began, and posit a point of articulation between the fantasy
of male autarchy as it is played out in <I>Mafarka</I>, and another
fantasy of autarchy that will be played out on the stage of fascist
Italy decades later: that of the cultural autarchy of the nation, and
later of the economic autarchy of the "Impero." I would like to suggest
that these fantasies are interstructuring, intercontaminating. As we
have seen, the fantasy of male autarchy is built upon misogyny, comes
to be threatened with bankruptcy by same-sex relations, and therefore
requires the reintroduction of the other in the form of the woman (to
be raped). Might we also say that the fantasy of national autarchy,
which is built upon nationalist xenophobia, comes to be threatened
with bankruptcy by the erasure of difference within, and therefore also
requires the reintroduction of the other in the form of the colony (to
be raped)? Does the structure of Marinetti's homo(phobic) economics also
inform the structure of fascism's fantasized "home economics"?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 This is the moment of articulation most subject to
narrativizations--source and deltas, roots and branches, biography
and work, and so forth--so I want to be very clear about how I see
the relation between literary text and fascist discourse. I am not
suggesting that proponents of national autarchy, having happened upon
<I>Mafarka</I> one rainy afternoon, found in it a blueprint for their
policies. Nor am I suggesting that Marinetti was possessed of prophetic
powers by means of which he foresaw future policy. I am suggesting,
rather, that both Marinetti's novel and fascist discourse construct
economic and cultural fantasies that share not only individual elements
but an overall structure, a syntax that I have been calling an ideo-logic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In other words, Marinetti did not "act alone." The notion of cultural
fantasy that I invoke here allows us to address ideological structures
as they manifest themselves in and across the most diverse of texts. Just
as the fantasy of male autarchy does not

<B></B>

originate with Marinetti, so the cultural materials that his novel binds
together can be found already joined, at least partially and in varying
conrations, in texts roughly contemporaneous with Marinetti. A case
in point would be an 1898 political tract entitled <I>La virilit&agrave;
nazionale e le colonie italiane</I> (National virility and Italian
colonies) by Pasquale Turiello. National virility and Italian colonies
are, Turiello argues, "completely interdependent, having a mutual relation
of cause and effect."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Turiello spells out that interdependence: Italy has suffered from
 "<I>muliebrit&agrave; politica</I>" (political womanliness) since
 the Risorgimento, a womanliness that consists in a languid weakness
 that has caused the nation to give in too easily to other nations, in
 particular to France, and to have passed up the opportunity to acquire
 colonies. After 1870, Turiello claims, Italy thought of Africa only
 "<I>supinamente</I>" (on her back). Now is the time to begin to
 take "virile action," he announces, and here virility is linked to
 antiparliamentarism, an expanded program of physical education in
 schools, discipline, and demographic colonialism:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
To all this [political womanliness] there are only two definitive
remedies: more industrious activity (that in peacetime can only derive
from a more masculine education) and new fields and favor for dignified
emigration, by providing new locations for it. Since we cannot desire
that emigration stop, but rather urge that Italy grow, we are faced
by a dilemma: either this emigration will be entrusted to the changing
conditions of foreign states, so that it goes as a guest with head hung
low, and only as long as others are willing to receive it, or it will
go with head held high to our own lands, open and conquered.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Several pages later, Turiello writes, "The solution to the African
problem is still today a problem more of Italian virility than of
Italian finance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 These arguments are similar to those that Mussolini will make. Here I
 cite Turiello in order to point to the way in which the fantasies of
 virility and colonialism that Marinetti's novel elaborates are already
 part of the cultural matrix.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It should not be so surprising, then, to find that two fantasies of
autarchy share an ideological structure. Most vigorous in the 1930s, the
fascist project of cultural autarchy consisted in the effort to expel all
that was foreign--linguistically, literarily, cinematically--in order
that Italian culture might produce itself as authentically Italian and
fascist. The campaign against the <I>Lei</I> (the formal second-person
singular form of address, deemed unItalian because not Latinate),
decrees against the use of words from foreign languages and dialects,
protectionist measures in the cinema as well as the practice of dubbing
all films into Italian, and literary movements like <I>Strapaese</I>
were all "autarchic" measures and proposals. As Giuseppe Carlo Marino
notes, the project remained elusive and dependent upon "a negative norm";
"<I>italianit&agrave;</I>" could define itself only as that which was
not foreign.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 But if the foreign is expelled culturally, it makes a necessary re-entry
 economically. In force during the 1940s, the project of economic
 autarchy aimed to make the nation, and then the Empire, economically
 self-sufficient (this "policy" became something closer to a necessity
 after sanctions were imposed upon Italy as a result of the Ethiopian
 campaign

<B></B>

in 1936). A paradox is produced in the encounter between cultural
imperative and economic reality, for as it turns out, the nation can
only be self-sufficient--can only survive economically--if it depends
upon others, if it annexes new markets and assures itself of sources
of raw materials not available in the metropolis. The paradox is solved
by expanding the "nation" into "empire," for as empire, the nation can
declare itself autarchic by taking into itself the foreign upon which
it depends culturally for definition and economically for survival.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Like the homophobic fantasy of male autarchy, which can do without women
 only through the mediation of women, the xenophobic fantasy of cultural
 and economic autarchy can do without the foreign only by annexing it.

Such an approach is crucial in dealing with fascist discourse which,

together seemingly incompatible elements and polarities; its ideological

the binding mechanism itself. See Ernesto Laclau, "Fascism and Ideology,"

As Kaplan writes, "The earth is played by woman--so is war, the machine,
the sea, and, in fact, nearly every possible thing except woman herself,
who, having given over her essence to everything around her, is completely

Luce Irigaray, "Commodities Among Themselves," in <I>This Sex Which is
Not One</I>, trans. Catherine Porter (Ithaca, N. Y.: Cornell University
Press, 1985), 193. Originally published as "Des marchandises entre elles,"
<I>La quinzaine litteraire</I> 215 (August 1975). Irigaray's formulation
has been much misunderstood and accused of the very homophobia that
her theory explains. Sedgwick writes that Irigaray's writing about the
hom(m)o-sexual "is the locus classicus" of a trajectory "according to
which authoritarian regimes of homophobic masculinist culture may be
damned on the grounds of being <I>even more homosexual</I> than gay male
culture." Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, <I>The Epistemology of the Closet</I>
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990), 154. For other
examples of this reading of Irigaray, see Jonathan Dollimore, <I>Sexual
Dissidence: Augustine to Wilde, Freud to Foucault</I> (New York: Oxford
University Press, 1991) and Joseph Bristow, "Homophobia/Misogyny: Sexual
Fears, Sexual Definitions," in <I>Coming on Strong: Gay Politics and
Culture</I>, ed. Simon Shepherd and Mick Wallis (London: Unwin Hyman,
1989), 64. Dollimore cites Bristow approvingly:

Such an argument gives the impression that gay men are the culprits of
the sexual inequalities--between homosexual and heterosexual, man and
woman--we have to struggle against. The glaring contradiction--that
homosexual desire creates the oppression of homosexuality--appears
over and again in sociology, literary theory and varieties of feminist
criticism. (249-50)

Some of the paradoxes and uneven exchanges that result from this logic
are apparent in a 1940 economic treatise, Raffaele Basile-Giannini's
<I>Autarchia dell'Africa italiana</I> (Rome: Edizioni della "Rassegna
economica dell'Africa italiana," 1940). Published in "Anno XIX" according
to the calendar of the regime, it lays out plans for the autarchy
of Italian Africa as well as for the autarchy of the "Madrepatria,"
or Motherfatherland (another male mother?). The African landscape
it describes is an unpeopled one where colonial products--coffee
from Ethiopia, bananas from Somalia, grain from Libya, livestock
(what the text refers to as the "African zootechnical patrimony"
[109])--stand ready for importation to the Madrepatria. Or rather,
they stand ready to be "contributed" to the autarchy of the empire:
after initially describing the exchanges between colony and nation as
imports and exports, the text switches to "apporto" and "contributo,"
and speaks of "la possibilit&agrave; di eliminazione delle importazioni
metropolitane attraverso l'apporto dell'Africa Italiana" (the possibility
of the elimination of metropolitan imports through the contribution of
Italian Africa). Like the "male ovary," the Italian colony is part of a
one-way deal; part of the empire as it contributes, it is however to be
independent of the nation. Imperial and nationalist rhetorics crisscross,
absorbing and re-expelling the colony as necessary.
