<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the evidence of the number of entries in the Biblioth&egrave;que
nationale catalogue, Georges Belmont must rank among the most prolific
writers of the post-war period: 156 to date (September 1998) in Opale,
the online catalogue, to which one must add 13 in the 1960-1969
<I>Catalogue des imprim&eacute;s</I> and ten more in the old pre-1960
card catalogue. This impressive output includes five novels, a collection
of poems, and above all a large number of translations from English.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Belmont's work as translator over more than four decades ranges from
 Henry James (<I>The Ambassadors</I>), Malcolm Lowry (<I>Hear us, O
 Lord, from Heaven, Thy Dwelling-Place</I>), Evelyn Waugh (<I>Brideshead
 Revisited</I>), and James Hardley Chase, to autobiographies of political
 and artistic res such as Golda Meier and Arthur Rubinstein. Four
 authors with whom Belmont's name is more closely associated are Graham
 Greene (four titles: <I>A Sort of Life, Travels with My Aunt, The
 Honorary Consul, The Human Factor</I>), Peter Townsend (five titles),
 Erica Jong (<I>Fear of Flying</I> and eight other titles), and Anthony
 Burgess (13 titles, including <I>A Clockwork Orange</I>). But there is
 one author who is inseparable from Belmont in his role as translator:
 Henry Miller. In addition to the 13 titles Belmont translated
 (including <I>Tropic of Capricorn</I>, <I>Sexus</I>, <I>Max and the
 White Phagocytes</I>, <I>The Smile at the Foot of</I> 

<B></B>

<I>the Ladder</I>), he has published prefaces to Miller translations
by others and a volume of interviews he conducted with Miller in 1970
for the French national radio and television, known as the "Entretiens
de Paris," and has contributed an introduction and thirty-eight dense
pages of personal notes to the French translation of Mary Dearborn's
1991 biography of Miller.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 These notes document a friendship which went back to the late 1930s
 and they represent, together with the <I>Entretiens</I>, a valuable
 biographical source for Miller scholarship. If, however, one had to
 select one single book linked with Belmont's name, it would have
 to be not a translation but <I>Monsieur Proust</I>, the memoir of
 C&eacute;leste Albaret, Proust's housekeeper for the last nine years
 of his life, recorded and prefaced by Belmont. This famous literary
 "scoop" (seventy hours of conversations over five months according
 to the introduction) caused a sensation at its publication in 1973
 and its prodigious success can be measured by the simple fact that,
 twenty-five years later, it remains in print.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The critical reception of the book was mostly enthusiastic but the
 praise was not altogether unqualified. In spite of the ghostwriter's
 protestations of absolute objectivity in his introduction, doubts were
 raised about certain aspects of C&eacute;leste's monologue, which veers
 from a self-effacing to a vehemently assertive tone, denouncing what she
 views as the "lies" (<I>mensonges</I> is used frequently) that have been
 spread about her master, suggesting for instance that if Proust had been
 homosexual she would have been aware of it, and, while she repeatedly
 denies having any literary competence, often sounds as if she were
 paraphasing or parodying well-known passages from the <I>Recherche</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Is Belmont's C&eacute;leste quite the same person as the one interviewed
 for French television by Roger St&eacute;phane?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All the above should make us legitimately curious to know who was, or is,
the prolific Belmont. The Biblioth&egrave;que nationale catalogue does
not show anything published in book form under his name before 1950. The
first occurrence of his work I have been able to locate is the French
translation of John Hersey's <I>Hiroshima</I> which came out in 1947;
there is evidence, however, that it was first published with no mention
of a translator.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 There is a biographical note in Belmont's first novel, <I>La vache
 et la tour Eiffel</I>, published in 1953, but one would be tempted
 to say that it withdraws as much information as it yields: apart from
 the author's age, forty-three, he is introduced as an alumnus of "one"
 Grande &Eacute;cole, has not travelled much, "except in France," has
 "subjected himself to a variety of jobs and (reluctantly) put up with
 [<I>support&eacute;</I>] several positions--neither the ones nor the
 others highly interesting, ultimately, in his view." Then, we are told,
 he became a translator and lived in the suburbs before moving back
 to Paris with his wife and daughter. The note (presumably penned by
 Belmont himself) continues with a statement both bland and cryptic,
 and defies interpretation: "He believes that life is what it is, that
 is to say what you make of it. But if you make nothing of it, it will
 make itself and it will be even less fun."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 The short biographical note on the back cover of Belmont's last novel,
 <I>Ex</I>, published in 1969, tells us a little more. It specifies that
 "he was a journalist before and after the war" and later "abandoned the
 press to become an editor." Indeed, in the 1950s and early 1960s, Belmont
 worked as editor of popular glossy magazines such as <I>Paris-Match</I>,
 <I>Jours de France</I>, and <I>Marie-Claire</I> (for which he interviewed
 Marilyn Monroe in April 1960), and as an occasional

<B></B>

contributor to periodicals like <I>Arts</I> and <I>Candide</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 In the late 1960s and 1970s, his name appears as director of collections
 for Robert Laffont, the publisher of two of his novels. If one turns
 to the bibliographies of two other novels, <I>Chris</I> and <I>Un homme
 au cr&eacute;puscule</I>, published by Julliard in 1965 and 1966, they
 list work in preparation which does not appear to have been published
 as well as a previously published poem, play, and essay--works which
 a curious reader would be at a loss to locate in any library catalogue
 under the name Belmont.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the post-war era, Maria Jolas reportedly said that Georges Belmont did
not exist. She mentioned him infrequently and with evident distaste. It
was a painful subject, recalling a betrayal she no doubt viewed in both
personal and civic terms. Nonetheless in February 1982 she did so with
her usual firmness. When she saw under Belmont's signature an article
in <I>Le Monde</I> in connection with the James Joyce centenary, she
wrote to its editor Jacques Fauvet (she was then 89):

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I must inform you that Joyce, who died in January 1941, knew no Georges
Belmont. This surname was adopted at the Liberation, perhaps to cast
oblivion on collaborationist activities, by Georges Pelorson; the French
had the recent opportunity to see this character on their television
screen, shouting slogans in favor of the "R&eacute;volution nationale"
. . . This ceremony . . . was part of the film <I>The Sorrow and the
Pity</I>. . . . I am offering these clarifications, Monsieur, because it
seems to me important, with a view to any future use of your archives,
to fill the lacunae and point out the dishonesty of the article signed
Georges Belmont."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I will now try in my turn to fill the lacunae by retelling the story of
the man I will henceforth call by his real name.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Georges Pelorson was born on July 19, 1909 in Belley, capital of the small
province of Bugey on the southeastern edge of Burgundy. After taking his
Baccalaur&eacute;at, he was enrolled in 1926 or 1927 at the Kh&acirc;gne
of the Lyc&eacute;e Louis-le-Grand which res so prominently
in Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Sirinelli's <I>G&eacute;n&eacute;ration
intellectuelle</I>. Indeed, even if he does not receive much attention
from Sirinelli, Pelorson is a perfect representative of that "generation
of 1905" which, too young to have fought in the First World War, found
itself so diversely involved during the second, especially under the
Nazi Occupation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 His contemporaries at Louis-le-Grand included Robert Brasillach, Maurice
 Bard&egrave;che, and Roger Vailland and his teachers the pro-Action
 fran&ccedil;aise French literature professor Andr&eacute; Bellessort,
 who was Louis-le-Grand's answer to the radical-socialiste Alain in the
 other leading Kh&acirc;gne at the lyc&eacute;e Henri IV.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 In 1928, Pelorson entered the &Eacute;cole normale
 sup&eacute;rieure. Among the 29 members of his class (besides the
 aforementioned Bard&egrave;che and Brasillach) were Jean Beaufret, the
 future philosophy teacher and Heidegger disciple who was also from the
 Kh&acirc;gne at Louis-le-Grand, as was Jacques Talagrand, a.k.a. Thierry
 Maulnier, future contributor to <I>L'Action fran&ccedil;aise</I> and
 <I>Je suis partout</I>. Last but not least, the 1928 class included a
 woman, Simone Weil. At rue d'Ulm, Pelorson's room was next to the one
 shared by Bard&egrave;che and Brasillach but he does not seem to have
 been particularly close to either.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Politically, he would appear to have leaned towards the left, if one
 can thus interpret his

<B></B>

presence among the 83 signers of the petition against the special
military preparation Normaliens were subjected to: it was published
in <I>Le populaire</I> of 26 November 1928 and provoked the ire of the
nationalist press.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If not much is known about Pelorson's political views during his
Kh&acirc;gne and &Eacute;cole normale years, much, on the other hand,
is known about his relations with the new English lecteur at the ENS,
fresh from Trinity College Dublin. His name was Samuel Beckett and he
was to become one of Pelorson's closest friends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 As the only English major in his class, the instruction Pelorson
 received from Beckett seems to have consisted mostly in two-voice
 readings of <I>The Tempest</I> and long conversations in the bars
 of Montparnasse. "The real lectures were in Montparnasse," reminisced
 Pelorson sixty years later, "the lectures of life. There were two things
 that changed my life, Montparnasse and then Ireland afterwards."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson went to Ireland in the fall of 1929 as the French lecteur
at Trinity College, Dublin, a position he held until the summer of
1931. Beckett himself returned to Ireland in 1930 and it was then
that he and Pelorson became particularly close. A well-known episode,
which took place in February 1931, was their staging of <I>Le Kid</I>,
a parody of Corneille's <I>Le Cid</I>, as the annual presentation of
the French group of the Modern Languages Society. Beckett played Don
Di&egrave;gue and Pelorson the Count. The event provoked the expected
scandal and has gone down in history as the first direct involvement of
Beckett with the theater and his first and only stage appearance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Pelorson is also linked with Beckett's debut as a novelist, since,
 according to James Knowlson, the episodic character named Liebert in
 <I>Dream of Fair to Middling Women</I>, his first novel (which remained
 unpublished until 1993), is at least in part based on Pelorson.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Pelorson also claims to have introduced Beckett to that remarkably
 pre-Beckettian text that is the diary of Jules Renard.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 During his second year in Ireland, Pelorson met a young woman named
 Marcelle Graham, whom he married shortly afterwards. On his return
 to France, he decided to abandon the traditional academic career
 usually expected of a Normalien to become a writer instead. He left the
 &Eacute;cole normale with only a licence (B.A.) in English instead of
 the <I>agr&eacute;gation</I> which would have made him a member of the
 French national school system. He and his wife together produced a French
 translation of Emily Bront&euml;'s poems, which was published in 1933.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Beckett's work had begun to appear in <I>transition</I> in June 1929, when
his first published story, "Assumption," as well as his essay on Joyce's
"Work in Progress," had appeared in <I>transition</I> 16/17. Thanks to
his connection with Beckett, Pelorson soon got to know Eugene and Maria
Jolas and it was in <I>transition</I> that he too made his literary
debut: his work, mostly in its original French, appeared in every issue
but one of the "new <I>transition</I>" from 1932 to 1938. Two poems,
"Isoc&egrave;le" and "Plans," re in the "Poetry is Vertical" section
of <I>transition</I> 21 (March 1932). Pelorson's name appears several
times in <I>transition</I> 22 (February 1933), with a letter-poem
"A Eugene Jolas" (dated October 1932), followed by three poems, a
multilingual short story, "Hysteriette of La Cosmosa," signed jointly by
Jolas and Pelorson. A Vertigralist fantasy, "Le moment de Parsifal" is
to be found in the "Paramyths" section of <I>transition</I> 23 (July 1935)

<B></B>

and the same issues contains two poems in the "Hypnologues" section,
a reply to the "Mutation in Language" questionnaire, and three short
poems in the section "Experiences in Language Mutation." There are
a lengthy poetic fragment ("Le nombre") in the "Vertigral" section
and a prose text ("Le Roi dans la Vall&eacute;e") in the "Paramyths"
section of <I>transition</I> 24 (June 1936). Finally, the prose poem
"Le vrai visage" appeared in two parts in the journal, part I in the
"Workshop" section of <I>transition</I> 26 (Winter 1937), part II in
<I>transition</I> 27 (April-May 1938), which also contains his
prose poem "Perp&eacute;tuel Mobile."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson's contributions to <I>transition</I> fall into two
distinct groups. One group is the work of a dutiful--if not highly
original--disciple of Eugene Jolas and the Revolution of the Word and
"Verticalist" or "Vertigralist" tenets. It is therefore not a surprise to
find Pelorson's name among the eight signers of the "Poetry is Vertical"
manifesto in <I>transition</I> 21.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Particularly characteristic of his production is "A Eugene Jolas,"
 a prose poem in celebration of American Spirituals: ostensibly in
 reaction to "Black Rhythms" in <I>transition</I> 21, it can be seen as
 an homage to Eugene Jolas the author of the anthology <I>Le n&egrave;gre
 qui chante</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 It combines neologisms (<I>all&eacute;goreuse</I>), spelling fantasies
 ("jeste" for geste), unorthodox punctuation, an emphatically stated
 preoccupation with the status of language and the possibilities of
 multilingualism, references to Joyce as well as to Benjamin P&eacute;ret,
 and a tone bordering on that of a manifesto: "Then instead of striving
 for the creation of new ideas with new words/We can create new words
 and ideas will follow if we truly cannot do without them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 The three poems that follow present the same characteristics; they are
 in fact not called poems but "ontogrammes," Pelorson's coinage, which
 res in <I>transition</I>'s "Revolution-of-the-Word Dictionary"
 in the same issue with the definition "neo-mythical composition with
 a-logical words."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Three short poems in <I>transition</I> 23 are called "rythm&egrave;ses"
 and can be described as nursery rhymes based purely on neologisms and
 nonsense words.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 "Perp&eacute;tuel Mobile," Pelorson's last contribution to
 <I>transition</I>, is very much along the same lines. All the
 aforementioned texts suggest--as seems to have been the case--a
 master-disciple relationship between Pelorson and Jolas. The short
 story they wrote in collaboration, "Hysteriette of La Cosmosa"
 (<I>transition</I> 22) is a Rabelaisian romp with passages in English
 and in French, often combined in the same sentence, peppered with
 Wakean coinages. It makes no greater impression than a curious and
 amusing experiment but its very effervescence is indicative of a happy
 congeniality between its two authors.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The other group of Pelorson's contributions to <I>transition</I>
belongs to a strikingly different vein. "Connaissance" and "Semence"
in <I>transition</I> 23 are called "ontogrammes" but it is difficult
to see what is "ontogrammatic" about them. Neologisms are absent. The
form, free verse in appearance, is in fact a series of hexasyllabic
lines which to the ear sound no different from conventional, if unrhymed
alexandrines ("L'homme alors s'avan&ccedil;a/dans la force de l'ombre/Et
l'on n'entendit plus/que le dur de la mer").
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 The poems deal with broad entities ("les Dieux," "la terre," "l'homme,"
 "la femme") in a mode of incantation and with a use of repetition
 strangely reminiscent of the poetry of Charles P&eacute;guy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 The first poem, "Connaissance," much revised, forms part of a much
 longer poem Pelorson published under that same title in 1937.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  "Le nombre--Prologue--

<B></B>

fragment" (<I>transition</I> 24) presents exactly the same
characteristics. "Le Roi dans la Vall&eacute;e" (<I>transition</I> 24),
a tale in the surrealist mode with a strong oneiric flavor, and "Le vrai
visage" (published in two parts in <I>transition</I> 26 and 27), also
in prose, retain some modernist traits: the latter, however, deals like
<I>Connaissance</I> with broad, abstract entities and displays the same
grandiloquence of tone and a similar reliance on effects of repetition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson's response to the "Inquiry on the Malady of Language"
in <I>transition</I> 23 appeared in English and was one of the two
longest. It unsurprisingly endorses Jolas's "vertical" and "vertigral"
aspirations. But it is also an intemperate anti-intellectual outburst
which has (with hindsight) a quasi-fascist ring to it: "Intelligence
be damned! . . . To the deuce with the fruits ripened in the brain! To
the deuce even with the brain! We shall create with the incantation of
our bodies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Transition</I> was the main, but not the only literary anchor of
Pelorson in the mid-1930s. His name crops up at least three times in
the <I>Nouvelle revue fran&ccedil;aise</I> between 1932 and 1935.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Another, longer fragment of the poem Connaissance, "Le soir," was
 published in Jean Paulhan's handsome review <I>Mesures</I> in 1935 and
 we know that in July 1936 Pelorson participated in a reading organized
 around <I>Mesures</I> at Adrienne Monnier's Maison des Amis des livres.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Was Pelorson the epic poet Paulhan eagerly wished for, as one of his
 editors has suggested?
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 In any event "Le soir" was Pelorson's only contribution to
 <I>Mesures</I>. According to Pelorson's own testimony recorded by
 Richard Ellmann, Paulhan asked him to undertake a translation of
 Joyce's <I>Pomes Penyeach</I> for <I>Mesures</I> and Pelorson worked
 on the project during the spring of 1937 in consultation with Joyce,
 who tried to convince him "to retain the identical rhythms in French
 as in English" (a common failing among poets who get involved in the
 translation of their own work). Ellmann does not indicate whether the
 undertaking was abandoned at Pelorson's or Joyce's initiative.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The question of Pelorson's relations with Joyce has been described in
diverse ways. Pelorson himself, both in his testimonies to Ellmann and
in the <I>Le Monde</I> article mentioned above, suggests that he and
Joyce enjoyed a sort of literary or at least intellectual friendship,
including discussions of Pelorson's own work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Maria Jolas, in her rebuttal of the <I>Le Monde</I> article, takes
 a firm exception to that view. "Around 1932, Joyce asked my husband,
 Eugene Jolas, to recommend to him a man who could help him in his work;
 Pelorson, who knew Ireland well, was approached because he was bilingual
 and competent in literary matters. He thus enjoyed the privilege of
 having professional relations with Joyce at that time. Joyce, to be
 sure, was affable and friendly towards the young man, but he kept
 his distance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 It must also be noted that Paul L&eacute;on, in a March 1933 letter to
 Harriet Shaw Weaver, lists Pelorson among the people who "constantly
 pester" Joyce, "asking for his help and aid which having not the strength
 to refuse he is trying to do in the best possible manner and which is
 not at all warranted either by his occupation or by his present state
 of health and nerves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 On the other hand, it was Pelorson who published in the <I>Revue de
 Paris</I> dated 1 September 1939 (the very day Hitler's troops invaded
 Poland) one of the first reviews--the first in French--of <I>Finnegans
 Wake</I>. According to his 1982 article in <I>Le Monde</I>, it was Joyce

<B></B>

who commissioned him to write the review and guided him through its
writing. Joyce was sufficiently pleased with it to recommend it to both
Valery Larbaud and Frank Bugden two weeks later.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson's activities in the 1930s were by no means limited to his
literary career. At least until the war he was a freelance reporter for
the daily <I>Paris-Midi</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 And in 1936, Maria Jolas recruited him as headmaster ("directeur des
 &eacute;tudes") of the &Eacute;cole bilingue de Neuilly which she
 had opened in 1932 and which grew from the original handful of pupils
 (which included her two daughters) to 150 in 1939. In addition to these
 administrative responsibilities, Pelorson taught literature courses
 at the school, where his wife Marcelle was a teacher as well. There is
 every indication from the surviving correspondence from that period that
 Maria Jolas had the greatest professional and personal confidence in
 both Pelorsons and the tone of the letters is, on both sides, that of
 mutual esteem and indeed affection--feelings that make her subsequent
 unforgiving resentment even more understandable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the end of 1937, as <I>transition</I> was about to stop
publication, Pelorson was ready to launch his own journal, the monthly
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I>. According to Maurice Girodias, whom he met at that
time and whose memoirs contain a perspicacious and generally sympathetic
portrait of Pelorson, <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> was financed by Pelorson's
journalistic work for <I>Paris-Midi</I>. Pelorson's own version is that
it was supported by a pool to which he and his co-founders had agreed
to contribute in equal parts, but that he found himself increasingly
responsible for its maintenance, all the others but two (Miller being
one of them) having stopped contributing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I> published 20 issues between December 1937 and
August 1939 and an additional one in the spring of 1940. Its official
editorial board, as it appears on the cover of the first issue,
comprised, besides Pelorson himself, Pierre Gu&eacute;guen, Eugene
Jolas, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Joliot, Henry Miller, Raymond Queneau, and
Camille Schuwer. Jolas's own presence is hardly a surprise: Jolas was,
as we have seen, Pelorson's literary godfather and it is only natural
that the disciple would have recruited his master. Gu&eacute;guen,
described by Girodias as a "little, round-bellied poet of gardens," was
one of the poets praised by Pelorson in his review of <I>L'ann&eacute;e
po&eacute;tique</I> for 1935; one poem by him had appeared in
<I>transition</I> 25.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The name of Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Joliot, known as Joliot-Curie
 following his marriage to Eve, daughter of Pierre and Marie
 Curie, is an unexpected re to encounter in the context of
 <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>. Pierre and Marie Curie had shared the 1935
 Nobel Prize for chemistry and their son-in-law may have simply lent his
 prestigious name out of friendship for Pelorson, since he does not appear
 to have made any substantive contribution to the review. A socialist and
 member of the Comit&eacute; de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes,
 he was then close to the Communist Party, which he officially joined only
 in 1942. As of No. 12 (December 1938), his name is no longer featured
 on the cover. Pelorson met Miller through Queneau in 1937 and they were
 to remain lifelong friends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Queneau himself had met Pelorson in 1935 through Paulhan and they became
 close friends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 In July 1939, he was recruited by Maria Jolas, presumably on Pelorson's
 recommendation, to teach at the &Eacute;cole bilingue de Neuilly: his
 mobilization in September 1939 prevented him from taking up the position.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

Schuwer taught philosophy and had been, like Pelorson, a regular
contributor to the "New <I>transition</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 A new name was added to the list as of the second issue, that of
 the modernist &eacute;migr&eacute; Hungarian sculptor Joseph Csaky
 (1888-1971), who became <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>'s chief art critic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson's later testimony on his intentions as founder of
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I> are not altogether consistent. On the one hand,
he claims that when he first approached Miller, what won the latter over
"was that there was no question of either a movement or group gathered on
a 'programme,' that there would be no common 'line' other than through the
natural conjunctions of opinions and ideas, each participant remaining
entirely free to express what he meant, no matter whether the review
offered in its pages the paradox of contradictions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
  On the other hand, he himself implies, in a rather self-serving
  statement that therefore needs to be somewhat qualified, that there was
  something of a political program behind the founding of the journal:
  "The journal <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> was born in my mind in order to
  awaken the energies to denounce and t the passivity of public
  opinion and the incompetence of rulers, on the side of democracies
  facing the hegemonic onslaught of a fanaticized Germany."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The contradictions and paradoxes announced above are indeed plentiful
in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>. To be sure, there is much in the journal
that can be described as non-political. This applies to Jolas's own
contributions: poems mostly, one Vertigralist essay ("Vertigral ou la
volont&eacute; cosmique") in No. 5, and one translation (a fragment of
"The Roan Stallion" by Robinson Jeffers, in No. 2). Jolas was, in fact,
one of the most frequent contributors to <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>, present
in every issue but one. Later, he evidently wished to distance himself
from it, since he mentions the journal only once in his autobiography
in connection with Miller, without referring to his own involvement.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 As for Miller, his work appeared 18 times in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>,
 usually in translations by Pelorson (except for an extract from <I>Tropic
 of Cancer</I> in the French version by Henri Fluch&egrave;re). Queneau
 res in 17 of the 20 issues of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> (as well as in
 the April 1940 number) and was its chief cultural critic, contributing
 articles on aesthetics, poetry, humor, Proust, and Joyce. Those include
 some of his wittiest and most esteemed early work as an essayist and he
 later collected nearly all of them in <I>Le Voyage en Gr&egrave;ce</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 He also published poems in No. 5 ("Paysan qui va-t-en ville") and No. 20
 (an extract from "Gueule de Pierre"). Besides Gu&eacute;guen and Schuwer,
 the poetry published in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> featured work by Jacques
 Audiberti, Armand Robin (poems later reprinted in <I>Ma vie sans
 moi</I>), and L&eacute;opold Sedar Senghor ("In Memoriam" in No. 17,
 "H&eacute;ritage" and "Aux tirailleurs s&eacute;n&eacute;galais morts
 pour la France" in No. 20).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson himself published little poetry in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>. One
poem, "Titan," in No. 15 (March 1939), was written very much in the mode
of <I>Connaissance</I>. <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 4 and 7 contained parts
III and IV of "Le vrai visage," the "prose po&eacute;tique" written
in the prophetic mode (the first two parts of which had appeared in
<I>transition</I>). His literary interests seem to have shifted towards
the theater, both as a playwright and as a critic. The first issue of
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I> contains a fragment ("Prologue") of a tragedy,
"Caligula"; two more fragments appeared in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 3
(from Act III) and 8 (Act IV, death of Caligula).
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Nos. 17 and 19 included two fragments from another Roman play, "Jules

<B></B>

C&eacute;sar."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 The fifth issue opens with an essay on "Le Th&eacute;&acirc;tre et les
 Moeurs," which denounces the decadence of the stage--from which only
 Giraudoux and Artaud (not the worst choices) are excepted. Four issues
 later, Pelorson published a "Lettre &agrave; M. Jean Dast&eacute; sur la
 trag&eacute;die," in which he gives his own conception: "The theatrical
 action seems to me to be the truest, most complete form of eloquence"
 (not a very avant-gardist statement).
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 As of No. 14 (February 1939), Pelorson kept a "chronique dramatique"
 of which three more installments appeared between March and August 1939.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Art criticism, we have seen, was mostly the province of Csaky, who
contributed a series of thought-provoking, at times frankly polemical
articles. The second, "Abstraction et Humanit&eacute; ou le Sens de la
Gr&egrave;ce Antique," published in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> No. 3, prompted
a response from L&eacute;once Rosenberg, the noted art dealer, who had
represented Csaky in the early 1920s. From No. 8 on, Rosenberg became
a second art critic for <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> and his contributions
included aphorisms on art, "Parlons Peinture," in Nos. 8, 9, 11, and 14
and a series on Italian art, "L'Italie sans Baedeker," in Nos. 15, 17,
and 19. Along with Queneau's articles, these contributions are some of the
more refreshing to read in this often relentlessly strident publication.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Why does a perusal of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> inevitably produce a
more than occasional feeling of malaise? It is due to part to some
individual contributions--and contributors--such as Lucien Combelle's
"Discours sur un Tombeau" in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 17 (May 1939),
a virulent attack on the Third Republic in which he advocates a "moral
revolution" in a particularly premonitory language: "When we face those
monsters, let us then be monstrous. . . . Threats if necessary. A black
list even. . . . <I>Physical</I> forces are at play. To resist them
victoriously, the fist must be ready to support the mind. Let us find
wits with firm fists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Combelle, who was only 27 in 1939, had been Andr&eacute; Gide's secretary
 and was then, among other things, managing editor of the magazine <I>Arts
 et Id&eacute;es</I> (published by Jos&eacute; Corti). During the war,
 Combelle became involved with, then responsible for the collaborationist
 weekly <I>R&eacute;volution Nationale</I>, to which Pelorson contributed
 as theater critic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 At the Liberation, he was sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor but
 was freed in 1951.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another cause for malaise is the recurrence throughout the issues of
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I> of a number of themes and vocabulary which,
admittedly, were found in many publications of various political
tendencies at the time, but are no less troubling for that. A good
example, taken from the opening number, is the first of Le Corbusier's two
contributions to the journal, in which he urges reforms in urban planning
policies in the context of "creating a solid, beautiful, healthy race."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Simply entitled "Volont&eacute;," and signed "Acte de volont&eacute;"
 like a proclamation at the end, the piece reads as if it had
 been ghostwritten by Pelorson: "Will to get out of it! Will of
 happiness. Definite happiness. Will of greatness. Greatness is to put
 one's heart before one and to respond to its simple, timeless demands."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 Along the same lines, an article by Pelorson entitled "Recherche d'un
 statut &eacute;conomique de la jeunesse" in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>
 3 advocates "policies of racial 'maintenance' (sports and leisure)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other passages, also much in the spirit of the times, sound themes soon to
be taken up in some of Marshal P&eacute;tain's best-known speeches. Under
the signature of Dr Henri

<B></B>

Arthus, in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 13: "The soil, our land, therein lies
the truth, therein lies what represents, among us, the center, the soul
of the nation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 In the next issue, Pelorson himself takes up the theme: "But the soil
 is stubborn. The soil has ideas of its own, which 'ideology' cannot
 comprehend. The soil has ideas on man, which man cannot control." This
 textbook example of the confusion denounced by Pascal when he warned
 against speaking of spiritual things in corporeal terms is followed
 by a not completely reassuring disclaimer: "And I see that I have to
 pause once again. For 'they' will misinterpret: 'they' will interpret
 this as racism, as 'they' put it these days."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Further on, Pelorson praises nationalism as the expression of the soil
 and finds reasons to exculpate Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin: "I also
 note that their mistake is in line with destinies, that they were able
 to correct their 'ideology' and that . . .they certainly <I>reawakened
 an idea</I>, gave rebirth to a soil, brought the minds back to their
 measure of soil. . ." Pelorson goes on to express qualified, but clear
 support for the Munich accords.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 The language is not much different in Pelorson's response to the enquiry
 on directors of conscience, the results of which occupy the entirety
 of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 18 (June 1939):

The person, in truth, matters so little, whereas the idea, sister of the

that seems to me the single universal on which the moral revolt can be

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Launched in its February 1939 issue, <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>'s
investigation on the nature and the role of "directors of conscience"
in the West was commissioned from the young sociologist Jules Monnerot
and it raises the question of the links between <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>
and the Coll&egrave;ge de Sociologie, since Monnerot was a participant in
its activities, as were a number of personalities who received Monnerot's
questionnaire and responded to it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 In its November 1938 issue, <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> had published the
 "D&eacute;claration du Coll&egrave;ge de Sociologie sur la crise
 internationale" which first appeared in the <I>Nouvelle revue
 fran&ccedil;aise</I> for November 1, with a note endorsing the
 declaration which may be interpreted as an indication that Pelorson
 had not yet come around to a pro-Munich attitude).
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 In their variety, the responses to Monnerot's questionnaire are the best
 illustration of the contradictions and ambiguities that characterize
 <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>--or indeed characterize that particular moment
 of French intellectual history. They range from Georges Duthuit's
 denunciation of "the sordid mysticism of race and the State" to
 Combelle's transparent apology for dictatorships and Pierre Libra's
 overt racism; from Eugene Jolas's hopes in "the new being," with "a
 new language, the inter-continental inter-language" to the astrological
 rantings of the charlatan Conrad Moricand, Henry Miller's friend.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 The most lucid is probably that of Jean Wahl, who begins by questioning
 the questionnaire ("What an odd questionnaire. How badly framed the
 question is")

<B></B>

and goes on to sum up in the clearest terms the crucial problem of
the hour: "Today the question is to know whether the collapse of the
national-socialist regimes will take place soon enough for democracies
not to be completely destroyed beforehand."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The presence of such statements in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>--and there are,
fortunately, more--corrects to some extent the impression of malaise
made by other statements like the ones quoted above.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 So does the publication, in the August 1939 issue, of Aim&eacute;
 C&eacute;saire's "Cahier d'un retour au pays natal"  and of poems by
 Pablo Neruda, Cesar Vallejo, and Octavio Paz.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 Above all, the review appears to mirror the ambiguities and ambitions of
 its creator, leader, and chief contributor. Though Pelorson is actually
 absent from No. 13, every issue of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> bears his
 mark. We have already noted in his poetry his penchant for blank verse
 combined with P&eacute;guy-like repetition. In <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>,
 these tendencies, especially the latter, are inflated to the point
 of caricature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 The word "volont&eacute;" is constantly hammered in like a mantra, either
 alone or in phrases like "volont&eacute; de grandeur" or "volont&eacute;
 de vivre" (a section heading in each issue), often printed in capitals
 for greater effect.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 "Actif France," the title of the two-part article quoted above, is
 particularly representative of Pelorson's growing tendency to think--or
 at least write--in slogans, a tendency that was to bear poisonous fruits
 in 1941-1943.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is indeed much in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> that could be interpreted
as evidence that Pelorson was harboring political ambitions. We have
quoted his article "Recherche d'un statut &eacute;conomique de la
jeunesse" in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 3. The very first issue contains
a "Plan Directeur d'une r&eacute;forme de l'enseignement en France,"
identified in a footnote as an "excerpt from a book, <I>&Eacute;ducation
et enseignement</I>, to be published by &Eacute;ditions Deno&euml;l
next January." The publication of the book continued to be announced in
subsequent issues but the book came out, as we will see, only in late
1940, under a different title, and under a different imprint.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I> did not survive the Declaration of War, which
led to the mobilization of most of its editors. An attempt was made to
resurrect it in the spring of 1940, with Pierre Pr&eacute;vost as its
chief editor and as its new publisher the very young Maurice J. Kahane,
soon to become Girodias, whose father, Jack Kahane, founder of the
Obelisk Press, had just died. <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 21 came out in
April 1940 and was distributed free. The cover page had a new design
and bore the address, though not the name, of the &Eacute;ditions
du Ch&ecirc;ne (16, place Vend&ocirc;me), which Girodias had just
created. It consists simply of four articles and a "letters from the
front" section. The contribution by Pelorson, "La guerre et la paix,"
and that by Pr&eacute;vost, "La guerre sans bataille," are relatively
sober assessments of the situation, whereas the piece by Combelle that
follows, by contrast, opens with a candid defense of eugenics as practiced
in Germany. The fourth article is a review by Queneau of M.B. Fondane's
<I>Faux trait&eacute; d'esth&eacute;tique</I>. <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>
22 was printed but the Nazi offensive on May 10 and the ensuing debacle
prevented its publication.
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson's editorship of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> brought him wide
recognition in pre-war intellectual circles. In the fall of 1939 and
the early months of 1940, he participated in the meetings that took
place in the apartment by Marcel Mor&eacute; to resume the activities
of the Coll&egrave;ge de Sociologie. Besides Mor&eacute; and Pelorson,
the meetings gathered, among

<B></B>

others, Georges Bataille, Julien Benda, Pierre Klossowski, Alexandre
Koyr&eacute;, Paul-Louis Landsberg, Ren&eacute; Leibovitz, Queneau, Wahl,
and, it seems, Gide. By May 1940, the group had disbanded, apparently
after bitter altercations ensued, and in which Pelorson was directly
involved.
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 According to both Paulhan's and Queneau's testimonies, Pelorson was
 also cultivating ties at the time ("a reprehensible flirt in my view,"
 in Paulhan's words) with Jean Coutrot, a Polytechnicien and the founder
 of AFNOR (Association fran&ccedil;aise de normalisation). Coutrot
 was the leader of Travail et Nation, a group which had ties with the
 fascist-leaning Parti populaire fran&ccedil;ais (P.P.F.) of Jacques
 Doriot. Members of this group included Henry de Jouvenel and Pierre
 Pucheu.
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 Pucheu's and Pelorson's paths were to cross again in Vichy three
 years later.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the meantime, Maria Jolas had moved her school to
Saint-G&eacute;rand-le-Puy, the tiny village near Vichy where she was
joined by the Joyce family. Pelorson remained officially the headmaster
and his wife a teacher: he was able to visit twice a month, at least in
the fall of 1939.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 In her 1950 article "Joyce en 1939-1940," published in the
 <I>Mercure de France</I>, she prompted Pelorson's last visit to
 Saint-G&eacute;rand in February 1940 and threw a dinner party with James
 and Nora Joyce, the Pelorsons and herself, but concluding tersely: "As we
 wished him 'godspeed,' far were we from suspecting the collaborationist
 career that awaited him following the armistice."
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marcelle Pelorson was Irish, and Maria Jolas's War Diary records her
virulent anti-English feelings as the hostilities erupted.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 As for Pelorson himself, he continued to be in touch with Maria
 Jolas. There is certainly nothing pro-Hitler in the feelings he conveyed
 to her from "somewhere in the Yonne [d&eacute;partement]" on May 29,
 1940: "Here we wept with rage before the radio yesterday. But we have
 never been so certain that Hitler will be swept away, or better: that
 Europe and the world will be swept clean of him."
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 At the armistice, Pelorson was briefly a prisoner of war but was, it
 seems, freed on parole, and was able to walk all the way back to Paris.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 Girodias mentions a meeting which then took place to discuss a
 possible resurrection of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>. These plans failed,
 however, owing to irreconcilable differences between the extreme right
 (Combelle) and the extreme left (Andr&eacute; Viollis, who was close
 to the Communist Party).
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 In the fall of 1940, as Maria Jolas and her daughters were leaving
 France for the United States, Pelorson and his wife reopened the school
 in Neuilly (reverting, according to a prospectus preserved in the
 Jolas Papers, to the school's original name, "&Eacute;cole nouvelle de
 Neuilly"). They had sixteen pupils and the teachers included Queneau
 and Paul Guth, the future popular writer, who had contributed to
 <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>
 However, by the end of the year, faced with high utility bills and unable
 to pay them (in that very cold winter of 1940), the school closed its
 doors for good.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By then, Pelorson's book <I>De l'enfant &agrave; la nation</I> had
appeared, one of the first if not the first book published by Girodias
under his new imprint, the &Eacute;ditions du Ch&ecirc;ne.
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>
 The first sentence of the introduction reminds the reader that the book
 was ready two years previously, which is another way of stating--and the
 author does state it--that its contents are unrelated to the context
 created by the defeat and subsequent Occupation. Indeed, it can be
 described as technical rather than a political work, going into such
 details as teachers' salaries and pupils' daily schedules. The two
 references to

<B></B>

educational practices in Third Reich Germany can be considered fairly
innocuous, even supposing that they were added as a topical afterthought:
there are others to England, the United States, and the Montessori
methods.
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 More significantly, in view of the functions the writer was soon to
 occupy, are the references to propaganda and even slogans as tools for
 a reform of education.
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
 Even more interesting and revealing are the introduction and the book's
 "packaging." The introduction refers to the child as the prime goal of a
 "r&eacute;volution nationale" (without capitals), and goes on to claim
 that the book "was rejected by a publisher not long ago on the grounds
 that it did not conform to the fantasies which the Abraham-Zay had made
 into law." The sentence targets the reforms introduced by the Popular
 Front under its minister of Education, Jean Zay, and generally known
 under his name (Abraham was his chief of staff). Pelorson's appellation
 ("la r&eacute;forme Abraham-Zay"), in the fall of 1940, was anything
 but innocent at a time when Zay had been imprisoned and had become the
 object of anti-Semitic attacks in the collaborationist press which did
 not cease until his assassination by the Milice in 1944.
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 There is a laudatory reference to Vichy's pro-family policies,
 immediately followed by a derogatory reference to the previous regime
 as serving the interests of "certain people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>
 As for the book's advertising matter, it is interesting in two
 respects. First, the biography on the flap of the front cover, which,
 after mentioning Pelorson's role as director of the "&Eacute;cole
 Nouvelle Bilingue de Neuilly," refers to his growing "interest in the
 political and moral problems caused by the disorder of our country"
 and goes on: "But Georges Pelorson, a born animator, could not be
 content with an activity limited to the intellectual 'elites'. He is
 aware that a racial and moral renaissance is called for. . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>
 The anonymous author of the biographical note, in all probability
 Pelorson himself, writes in conclusion that the book should be
 considered not as a technical study intended for pedagogues, but
 rather the work of a "moral and political reformer" and it quotes the
 "r&eacute;volution nationale" passage from the introduction. On the
 other flap, two more publications by Pelorson on related issues are
 announced, "Le testament de notre temps" and "La r&eacute;volution de la
 jeunesse," neither of which was published. Under the heading "Collection
 'Volont&eacute;s,'" forthcoming publications, presumably under the
 &Eacute;ditions du Ch&ecirc;ne imprint are announced: the authors listed
 include Jacques Copeau on the theater, Georges Bataille (<I>La mort et
 le sacrifice. Premier essai de sociologie sacr&eacute;e</I>), Pierre
 Pr&eacute;vost (<I>Le gouvernement des hommes</I>), Lucien Combelle
 (<I>Responsabilit&eacute; des &eacute;crivains</I>) and Jean Jardin
 (<I>Les transports</I>). Even though the "Collection 'Volont&eacute;s'"
 never materialized, this is an interesting assemblage which gathers
 briefly under the dual patronage of a half-Jewish publisher (Girodias)
 and soon-to-be Vichy official (Pelorson) two of the future founders of
 <I>Critique</I> (Bataille and Pr&eacute;vost), a P&eacute;tain-appointed
 theater administrator (Copeau), an ultra collaborationist (Combelle),
 and Pierre Laval's chief of staff (Jardin).

As we have seen, the paths of Bataille and Pelorson had crossed
previously in the context of attempts to revive the Coll&egrave;ge de

abortive project of a "Collection  'Volont&eacute;s.'" Their names,
however, are linked in a most intriguing way in the context of one of
the many movements that sprouted in the first year of the Vichy period,
called "Jeune France." First

occupied zone in January 1941, "Jeune France" was created with the purpose
of promoting the artistic and cultural education of young people and,
because of its educational aims, received the patronage of and financial
backing from Vichy's Secr&eacute;tariat g&eacute;n&eacute;ral &agrave;
la jeunesse. Its founder was a young Polytechnicien, Pierre Schaeffer,
later one of the heads of the national French radio and a pioneer of
<I>musique concr&egrave;te</I>. Other participants were former members
of the movement Ordre Nouveau, such as Paul Flamand, future head of the
&Eacute;ditions du Seuil, Xavier de Lignac, and Pierre Pr&eacute;vost,
and also a prestigious array of literary and artistic personalities:
the poet Patrice de la tour du Pin, the painter Alfred Manessier,
the philosopher Emmanuel Mounier, and men of the theater such as Jean
Vilar and Raymond Rouleau. Actors included Pierre Fresnay, and Pierre
Renoir, and contributing composers and musicians included Henri Baraud,
Daniel-Lesur, and Maurice Martenot. In spite of the fact that it received
official support from Vichy, "Jeune France" was a genuine educational
movement and historians of the period stress its high quality and
generally single it out as one of the most creative and high-minded of
the era.

 Pelorson was to be responsible for its literary section and preliminary
 discussions were held with Girodias about the publication of a journal.
<SUP><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></SUP>
 In February 1941, when Pelorson abandoned the project to take up his
 new position, he recommended to succeed him a young writer of his
 acquaintance whom he considered equal to the greatest. His name was
 Maurice Blanchot. Pelorson introduced him to Pr&eacute;vost who in
 turn introduced him to Bataille. Pelorson was thus responsible for the
 meeting, which soon developed into a close friendship, between two of
 the greatest res of the French literary avant-garde of the next
 three decades.
<SUP><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The new position Pelorson took up in February 1941 was that of "Chef de la
propagande des jeunes" for the occupied zone within the Secr&eacute;tariat
g&eacute;n&eacute;ral &agrave; la jeunesse (SGJ). The SGJ was one of
the creations of the Vichy r&eacute;gime that have survived, in various
incarnations, throughout the Fourth and Fifth Republics. It first
combined Family and Youth and was first entrusted to the right-wing
Basque sportsman Jean Ybarn&eacute;garay. As of September 25, 1940, the
new man in charge was Georges Lamirand, who was a director of the Renault
factories at the eve of the war. A catholic and an admirer of Marshal
Lyautey, who prefaced a book he published in 1925, <I>Le r&ocirc;le social
de l'ing&eacute;nieur</I> (a direct homage to Lyautey's own <I>R&ocirc;le
social de l'officier</I>), Lamirand had gained the personal confidence
of P&eacute;tain. He has been described by one historian as "a sort
of boyish itinerant national cheerleader for the National Revolution"
who seemingly loved nothing more than the sound of his own voice.
<SUP><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></SUP>
 He reported to the Minister of Education, except for a two-month period
 at the end of 1940 when the SGJ was controlled by Laval, who was then
 Vice-pr&eacute;sident du conseil. The role of the SGJ was to oversee
 training programs at all levels for young people after they had left
 school. The "Chantiers de jeunesse" and the 20 or so newly created
 leadership schools, of which the most famous was the &Eacute;cole des
 cadres d'Uriage founded by Captain Dunoyer de Segonzac, were under the
 SGJ's tutelage. It was also supposed to liaise with youth movements
 and develop a network of regional delegates. Finally, it was

<B></B>

able to subsidize youth movements once they had gone through a procedure
of official recognition or "agr&eacute;ment" (a system which, as Pierre
Giolitto points out, is more or less still in place today).
<SUP><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Youth Propaganda services which Pelorson headed for the occupied zone
had a program of publications, the collection "France nouvelle--&agrave;
nous, jeunes," which published edifying 32-page brochures on themes
such as <I>Forces de la France: le mar&eacute;chal, les jeunes</I>,
or <I>Qu'est-ce que la r&eacute;volution nationale</I>?
<SUP><a NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">93</a></SUP>
 Those brochures often reprint speeches given by Pelorson at meetings such
 as the Assises de la jeunesse de France organized at the Salle Wagram
 in Paris on June 15, 1941 for regional youth delegates from the occupied
 zone: in the presence of the notoriously pro-Nazi Abel Bonnard, Pelorson
 addressed the audience on "Destin de la jeunesse fran&ccedil;aise,"
 "L'Union et l'unit&eacute;,"  "Discipline," "Hi&eacute;rarchie," among
 others. Under "N&eacute;cessit&eacute; de choisir," Pelorson opposes
 "the France of the Mar&eacute;chal, which is France itself" and "that
 image of our country which has been appropriated by a mendacious foreign
 propaganda and which they are trying to promote from beyond our borders,"
 between "the hero of Verdun" (P&eacute;tain) and "l'homme de Dakar et
 de Syrie" (De Gaulle). He urges the delegates to have "absolute faith
 . . . in the Leader the Mar&eacute;chal gave us: Georges Lamirand."
<SUP><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></SUP>
 At another such meeting ("Journ&eacute;es de solidarit&eacute;
 nationale"), held at the V&eacute;l d'Hiv at the end of November 1941,
 the former editor of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> addressed the youth delegates
 in words and in a style that sound like a parody of his younger self; a
 less charitable interpretation would be to suggest that the "geographic"
 rhetoric of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> had finally found its real home:
 "We have a will,--it is to achieve, together with the Mar&eacute;chal,
 for the greatness of our country, the National Revolution. This will
 is made of our blood, and our blood is made of our soil. This will is
 that of France. We are here by the will of France. And no force in the
 world could possibly distract us from this will."
<SUP><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the evidence of their speeches, it would seem as if Lamirand and
Pelorson were speaking as one voice. They were, in fact, bitterly opposed
in their views, which represented two conflicting and contradictory sides
of Vichy France. Lamirand, for all his fondness for public appearances and
his addiction to applause, was a pragmatist rather than a doctrinaire. His
Catholicism and social conservatism were in contrast with Pelorson's
anti-clericalism and socialist views. Both Anglo-American and French
historians of the Vichy regime, for once in agreement, have taken a
severe view of Pelorson, whom one of them introduces as "one of the more
curious characters that the regime threw up."
<SUP><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></SUP>
 He was described as an ideologue bent on imposing a "jeunesse unique"
 on the model of the Hitlerj&uuml;gend, a "brilliant representative
 of the collaborationist extreme-right within the SGJ," a partisan of
 "a kind of moral and spiritualist fascism," a "crypto-fascist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></SUP>
 He was held in suspicion in Vichy because of his extremist views,
 both by P&eacute;tain's staff and by the prudent J&eacute;r&ocirc;me
 Carcopino, Minister of Education from February 1941 until the return
 of Laval to power in April 1942. In his post-war memoirs, Carcopino
 recalled with dismay the vast budget (10 millions francs) allocated
 by his predecessor to Youth Propaganda and harshly criticizes the SGJ
 as being infiltrated by a "handful of fanatics" and elsewhere mentions
 Pelorson among his most virulent opponents.
<SUP><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In early 1942, the relations between Lamirand and Pelorson had
deteriorated to such a point that the former, according to Pelorson's
own testimony, tried to force him to resign.
<SUP><a NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">99</a></SUP>
 Pelorson, however, had the opportunity of furthering his political
 ambitions in mid-March 1942 at a meeting of the Conseil national,
 the advisory body created by P&eacute;tain to advise him on
 constitutional matters, which was convened behind Carcopino's back
 to review questions relating to youth. In his testimony before the
 Commission, Pelorson attacked the "clerico-reactionary" philosophy of
 the SGJ and denounced its tepid paternalism. His views were supported
 by the ultra-collaborationist wing on the Council: Pucheu, Minister of
 the Interior, Paul Marion, Minister of Information, and Bonnard. The
 Commission's final report recommended him among possible replacements
 for Lamirand.
<SUP><a NAME="REF100" HREF="#FOOT100">100</a></SUP>
 In April 1942, Laval returned to power and named Bonnard Minister of
 Education. On June 6, Pelorson was appointed Deputy Secretary General
 for Youth with the specific mission of keeping Lamirand in line and
 with the determination to push for a more authoritarian control over
 youth movements. Pelorson's "reign" (since Lamirand was no more than a
 rehead at this point) began, to the alarm of P&eacute;tain's cabinet,
 with an administrative purge of the moderate elements in the SGJ staff.
<SUP><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></SUP>
 It was marked by the granting of official recognition (and therefore
 subsidies) to overtly pro-fascist movements previously kept at bay by
 Lamirand, such as the Jeunesse de France et d'outremer, the Jeunesses
 paysannes of Dorg&egrave;res, and the Jeunesses francistes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF102" HREF="#FOOT102">102</a></SUP>
 Another opportunity Pelorson had to display his New Order zeal was
 the support he gave to the Jeunes de l'Europe nouvelle of Marc Augier,
 which he lobbied in vain to represent France at meetings of the Union of
 European Youth organized in Vienna by Baldur von Schirach, the notorious
 Jugendf&uuml;hrer of the Third Reich.
<SUP><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></SUP>
 He was, in fact, soon known among youth leaders wary of SGJ hegemony as
 "Baldur von Pelorson."
<SUP><a NAME="REF104" HREF="#FOOT104">104</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson's grand idea (in the context of his dreams of a "Jeunesse
unique") was the "&Eacute;quipes nationales," which he created in early
August 1942 to "gather the young from 12 to 15 that do not belong to
any movement, to make them participate in civic and social activities
and give them a 'virile and strong' training."
<SUP><a NAME="REF105" HREF="#FOOT105">105</a></SUP>
 The context of the speech is worth recalling: since May 29, Jews in
 the occupied zone had been forced to wear the yellow star and the
 V&eacute;l d'Hiv roundup had just happened on July 16. It goes without
 saying that those &Eacute;quipes, in Pelorson's own words, echoed in
 the oath required of the "&Eacute;quipiers," were reserved to the "sole
 Frenchmen worthy by the soil, the blood and the race to be admitted
 into the French community."
<SUP><a NAME="REF106" HREF="#FOOT106">106</a></SUP>
 And if any doubts subsist on how Pelorson then stood on such issues,
 here is how he addressed the youth leaders on August 3, 1942: "We wish
 to launch in France the reign of a new, just, and strong State. . . . We
 want this force not to be used anymore for the benefit of velleities
 [<I>volont&eacute;s</I>], parties and more or less anonymous and
 French private ventures: for the benefit of the Jews, the Freemasons,
 corporations, the financial world and international capitalism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF107" HREF="#FOOT107">107</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As we have suggested above, Pelorson's policies did not endear him to
any but the most pro-Nazi activists among youth leaders. For example,
at the Congress of the Jeunesses nationales populaires in 1943, he was
singled out for praise by Marcel D&eacute;at's

<B></B>

right-hand man, Georges Albertini.
<SUP><a NAME="REF108" HREF="#FOOT108">108</a></SUP>
 He was particularly resented by the Catholic movements.
<SUP><a NAME="REF109" HREF="#FOOT109">109</a></SUP>
 Relations were no better with the leadership schools, which Pelorson
 viewed (not incorrectly) as devoted to Uriage. In late August 1942,
 at a "R&eacute;union des Chefs" held at the &Eacute;cole des cadres du
 Mayet-de-Montagne, Pelorson blamed the Uriage representative for the
 school's failure to apply Vichy's anti-Semitic policies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF110" HREF="#FOOT110">110</a></SUP>
 At a similar meeting with Pelorson at &Eacute;cully, near Lyon, in
 October 1942, an uproar occurred as a result of the racism of some of
 the statements.
<SUP><a NAME="REF111" HREF="#FOOT111">111</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In spite of Pelorson's collaborationist zeal which earned him praise
from the Nazi authorities, he did not succeed Lamirand, to the surprise
of many, when the latter was finally dismissed on March 24, 1943. As we
have seen, Pelorson was not popular with the entourage of P&eacute;tain
(with whom he had a meeting the day before, on March 23). The pragmatist
Laval (who also saw Pelorson in Vichy on March 18) may have grown wary of
his extremism. Bonnard himself, even though Pelorson was perceived as one
of his henchmen, may have come to the conclusion that his nomination would
have incensed the youth movements. Instead of him, he chose as Lamirand's
successor the conservative law professor F&eacute;lix Olivier-Martin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF112" HREF="#FOOT112">112</a></SUP>
 The position of deputy Secretary General was abolished and Pelorson's
 political career came to an end. He did, however, keep his office on
 the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor&eacute; and was retained by Bonnard
 to head an obscure collaborationist organization called "Les amis
 du Mar&eacute;chal," a position he retained until his arrest at the
 Liberation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF113" HREF="#FOOT113">113</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Vichy historians generally agree--not, of course, to deplore it--on the
overall lack of success of the regime's propaganda machine. Indeed,
Pelorson's tenure at the SGJ is symptomatic of the glaring contrast
between Vichy's inflated rhetoric and the realities faced by the country,
particularly the increasing weight put on its youth by the Service du
travail obligatoire, which by the summer of 1943 claimed an ever-growing
number of them. Pelorson himself almost seems to have sensed the ultimate
futility of his efforts even as he was addressing the topic dearest to
him, his "thing," the creation of the &Eacute;quipes nationales: "Never
mind even what those young people should build: roads leading nowhere,
roads that would not make any sense . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF114" HREF="#FOOT114">114</a></SUP>
 The irony is that despite this "Bridge on the River Kwai" insanity,
 the &Eacute;quipes nationales actually accomplished some useful work,
 especially after Pelorson's departure, as the bombing of French cities
 intensified. They were not dissolved at the Liberation and, even more
 paradoxically, were subsequently incorporated into the Communist-led
 Union de la jeunesse r&eacute;publicaine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF115" HREF="#FOOT115">115</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One Frenchman who hardly met Pelorson's official criteria of blood,
soil, and race had nonetheless kept in touch with him throughout the
war. Girodias was indeed able to continue his activities as a publisher
throughout the Occupation and regularly visited Pelorson at his office,
conveniently located within walking distance of the Place Vend&ocirc;me.
<SUP><a NAME="REF116" HREF="#FOOT116">116</a></SUP>
 Pelorson was by then separated from his first wife and eventually
 married his secretary at the SGJ, named Josephine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF117" HREF="#FOOT117">117</a></SUP>
 Girodias's &Eacute;ditions du Ch&ecirc;ne published two works by Pelorson
 during the war: the play <I>Jules C&eacute;sar</I> in 1943, and the
 poem <I>Carmen Seculare</I> the following year. <I>Carmen Seculare</I>
 is a love poem and definitely not a modernist one, even if we allow
 that it was written at a time when even former

<B></B>

Surrealists turned back to traditional forms ("je pourrai dans tes
yeux/et dans l'ombre lev&eacute;e,/voir enfin devant Dieu/la beaut&eacute;
communier/avec l'&eacute;ternit&eacute;").
<SUP><a NAME="REF118" HREF="#FOOT118">118</a></SUP>
 <I>Jules C&eacute;sar</I> is a more interesting work, not so much in
 its form which is the familiar split alexandrines of Pelorson's earlier
 poetry, but for the deliberately anachronistic treatment of the theme
 as a fascist tragedy--the dictator versus Roman senators who are made
 to sound like Third Republic senators.
<SUP><a NAME="REF119" HREF="#FOOT119">119</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is no surprise to find Pelorson's name on the black list published at
the Liberation by the Comit&eacute; national des &eacute;crivains, whose
members included Queneau. Pelorson appears both on the first list of 88
names, published in the <I>Lettres fran&ccedil;aises</I> for September
16, 1944, and on the much enlarged list of 158 names published in the
same journal on October 21.  The presence of one's name on those lists
was tantamount to a ban on publication, at least for the immediate future.
<SUP><a NAME="REF120" HREF="#FOOT120">120</a></SUP>
 Pelorson, who had been arrested in his office at the Liberation, was then
 in one of the makeshift prisons established in the Montparnasse area
 to cope with the overcrowding of the official ones. Girodias tried in
 vain to plead with Queneau the cause of his old friend "Pelo" and claims
 to have even plotted an escape attempt, but Pelorson was unexpectedly
 released after five months. Having risen only to the level of Deputy
 Secretary of State, he was spared a trial by the High Court of Justice
 and was sentenced to a relatively lenient deprivation of civil rights
 for ten years.
<SUP><a NAME="REF121" HREF="#FOOT121">121</a></SUP>
 He was also advised to spend a few years away from Paris. As he needed
 financial support, Girodias put him in charge of the translation of
 <I>Tropic of Capricorn</I> and other works by Miller: the career of
 Georges Belmont had begun.
<SUP><a NAME="REF122" HREF="#FOOT122">122</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Few of Pelorson's pre-war friends appear to have even attempted to resume
relations with him. He does not come up in name in Jolas's autobiography,
though one passage clearly alludes to him: "I met old friends who had
spent the war in resistance to the enemy. I also heard of others who
had been P&eacute;tainists or had even betrayed France and its Allies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF123" HREF="#FOOT123">123</a></SUP>
 Henry Miller himself, who was being translated by Pelorson while the
 latter was in hiding, writes to Jolas in October 1950 that he has "never
 had a line from Pelorson since [he] left Paris" (though relations were
 resumed shortly afterwards).
<SUP><a NAME="REF124" HREF="#FOOT124">124</a></SUP>
 The main exception was Samuel Beckett, which may be surprising in
 view of his involvement in the Resistance, but which can be explained
 both by the closeness of their early ties and by Beckett's profoundly
 forgiving nature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF125" HREF="#FOOT125">125</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are few links between the literary output of Belmont and that of
Pelorson. The 1953 novel, <I>La vache et la tour Eiffel</I>, is a mildly
amusing satire reminiscent of the popular works of Pierre Daninos. His
next work, <I>Le grand pressoir</I> was published four years later also
by Robert Laffont. And though it is also rather conventional in form,
it is, by contrast, a serious and even stark novel. Set in the future
(the 1970s), it is the story of a civil war in France and an obvious
allegory of the Occupation and its sequels. France has been caught in a
war between the two superpowers. The hero, Jacques Legrand, was on the
American side and served the government they backed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF126" HREF="#FOOT126">126</a></SUP>
 The other side having won, he is taken prisoner and eventually murdered
 by one of his jailers after having seen his best friend savagely
 tortured. Flashback chapters describe the fallen regime, at the head
 of which were an old general ("L'Image") and his head of

<B></B>

government, the "Vizir." These transparent portraits of P&eacute;tain
and Laval contain cruel barbs towards the first, whereas the interview
with the second in chapter 8 is a lively vignette, clearly based on
personal reminiscences. Legrand himself is a leader of Brigades civiques
de volontaires in which it is not too difficult to recognize Pelorson's
&Eacute;quipes nationales. <I>Le Grand Pressoir</I> is a striking novel,
but, as an attempt on Pelorson's part to come to terms with his past,
it is also a deeply dishonest one. By transposing the action into
the future, Belmont can be conveniently selective in his allegorical
treatment of Vichy. Racial persecutions are not even hinted at. Based
on this account, it would seem that the gravest crime Pelorson would
let himself be accountable for was political naivete.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The other three novels can be dealt with more briefly. <I>Chris</I>,
published in 1965, is also allegorical, and is also set against a
political background. Its theme is reminiscent of Sartre's <I>Les
mains sales</I>, opposing a cynical hero and "Chris," his "pure"
Doppelg&auml;nger. An epilogue suggests, a little heavy-handedly,
that Chris never existed and they were the same person. <I>Un homme au
cr&eacute;puscule</I>, published the following year, is set in Ireland
and on the Riviera and explores the sentimental interaction between the
French narrator, his Irish friend John (a painter), and John's girlfriend
Vicky. Vicky turns out to have had a previous affair with another woman,
who committed suicide. The treatment of the sexual theme seems excessively
melodramatic. We are certainly as far from <I>transition</I> as from
the R&eacute;volution nationale. <I>Ex</I>, published by Deno&euml;l
in 1969, has little in common with Belmont's preceding four novels. It
is a "nouveau roman" of sorts, with some typographical and syntactic
liberties such as interrupted sentences, unconventional punctuation,
or the words "aimer" and "amour" replaced by dashes. The work has a
certain confessional tone--a confession made at times to a doctor,
at other times to a judge--and there are references to a plague-ridden
city and an unspecified "thing" which haunts the narrator and follows
him everywhere: it could be seen as his past, but the very opacity of
the text defies interpretation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson published one more book of poetry in 1973, <I>L'honneur
de vivre</I>, with a vanity press known as &Eacute;ditions
Saint-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s. One poem is dedicated to Maurice Nadeau
and his wife, another to Beckett. The form is freer than Pelorson's
earlier poetry, the inspiration elegiac or melancholy. But the most
notable feature of the book is its colophon, where we catch the author
fiddling with his past: it mentions a limited edition of 26 and a few
Hors Commerce copies with a lithograph by Jean H&eacute;lion: "This
illustration was made in 1937 by the painter for the poem 'Connaissance'
by Georges Belmont."
<SUP><a NAME="REF127" HREF="#FOOT127">127</a></SUP>
 As Maria Jolas might have said, Georges Belmont the author of
 'Connaissance' does not exist.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There has been a growing tendency among historians of ideas in the past
two decades to cast suspicion on the intellectual and artistic avant-garde
as the pre-war or wartime political views of some of its representatives
became better known.
<SUP><a NAME="REF128" HREF="#FOOT128">128</a></SUP>
 The case of Georges Pelorson is of no such scope insofar as his
 literary significance is negligible and, his early contributions to
 <I>transition</I> notwithstanding, he was never more than a surface
 modernist. On the other hand, it is an extreme case in the sense that
 it would be hard to find anyone else in the pre-war avant-garde circles
 and connected

<B></B>

with so many of their members, who compromised himself to such an extent
as a government official--only just short of occupying a cabinet position
in the Vichy regime during the period when it sided most clearly with
the Nazis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF129" HREF="#FOOT129">129</a></SUP>
 The post-war disappearance of Pelorson and his reappearance as Belmont
 make it also an interesting case as one of the most successful (and
 therefore little-known) illustrations of what Daniel Lindenberg amusingly
 calls "l'effet Monte Cristo." What Maria Jolas and many others who knew
 him as Edmond Dant&egrave;s could not forgive him for was his attempts to
 have it both ways: he posed as Georges Belmont--the friend of Beckett,
 Miller, and Joyce--as if he and "Baldur von Pelorson" had not been one
 and the same person.

On the friendship between Pelorson and Beckett, see above all Pelorson's
own testimony, "Remembering Sam" [by] Georges Belmont and John Calder, in
<I>Beckett in Dublin</I>, edited and introduced by S.E. Wilmer (Dublin:
Lilliput Press, 1992), 111-128. Both Beckett biographers, Deirdre
Bair and James Knowlson, interviewed Pelorson and their accounts are
essentially derived from his testimony: see Bair, <I>Samuel Beckett:
a Biography</I> (New York et al.: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1978), and
Knowlson, <I>Damned to Fame: the Life of Samuel Beckett</I> (London:
Bloomsbury, 1996). Bair fails to explain the connection between the
Georges Pelorson mentioned in her narrative and the Georges Belmont
referred to in her notes; Pelorson himself later had harsh words to say
about her biography (see <I>Beckett in Dublin</I>, 120). Knowlson (722,
note 8) mentions the change of name after the war. Both he and Bair are
silent on Pelorson's wartime activities, as is the short biographical
note in <I>Beckett in</I> Dublin ("Notes on Contributors," 147). On

Jean Piel, a one-time contributor to <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>, may well have
had the journal (if not Pelorson himself) in mind when he wrote in his
diary for September 26, 1943: "This is the result of that frenzy of naked
will, devoid of the true convicton that would give it a purpose: thus
erred so many pre-war pseudo-intellectuals, reacting against surrealist
fatalism, and among whom fake Nietzschean stirrings were awakaned by noisy
echoes from beyond the Rhine. Will for will's sake without any reason
for willing. Pure dilettantism, lyrical gymnastics." ("Voil&agrave;
o&ugrave; m&egrave;ne cette fr&eacute;n&eacute;sie de volont&eacute;
nue, sans conviction vraie qui lui asigne un but: d&eacute;formation de
tant de pseudo-intellectuels d'avant-guerre, en r&eacute;action contre
le fatalisme surr&eacute;aliste, et chez lesquels de faux relents de
nietzsch&eacute;isme &eacute;taient r&eacute;veill&eacute;s par les

Maria Jolas mistakenly refers to a ten-year banishment ("interdiction de
s&eacute;jour") in a letter to Dougald McMillan, Jolas Papers, Box 32,
folder 954. According to Arnaud, "&Eacute;tranges Volont&eacute;s," 311,
Lamirand (who was not prosecuted by the High Court) tried to minimize
his own responsibilities by putting the blame on his deputy. Pelorson
himself seems to have remained defiant throughout, since from his
prison he attempted to sue a Resistance sheet for appropriating the
title <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>. I am grateful to Alice Yeager Kaplan for
bringing to my attention this revealing episode (on which Girodias is
unfortunately silent) and to Roger Grenier, who was named in the suit,
for confirming the details.

The resumption of the relations between Beckett and Pelorson is
mentioned neither by Bair nor by Knowlson. Pelorson, or rather Belmont,
was if anything a little boastful about it: see Gaston Bonheur,
"Les tentations de Saint-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s," <I>Les nouvelles
litt&eacute;raires,</I>" November 4, 1965, quoted by Dufay and Dufort,
118. His attendance of the premiere of <I>En attendant Godot</I>, to
which he took Miller, is mentioned in note 70 to Dearborn, 363.

The other Vichy official to have been in relations with Joyce, Jacques
Benoist-M&eacute;chin (sentenced to death by the High Court of Justice in
1947, a sentence later commuted), does not come close in the range of his
other contacts. None of the other possible contenders, such as Bernard
Fa&yuml; and Armand Petitjean (both contributors to <I>transition</I>),
or Drieu la Rochelle, occupied a government position.

I had completed the revision of this article when I became aware
of a short biography of "Georges Belmont" in English available
on the World Wide Web through the Gale Literary Databases. Under
"Politics," the "personal information" section states simply: "Never
belonged to any party." No wartime activities are listed except for
service in the infantry in 1939-1940 and "taken prisoner by
the Germans" (a very short imprisonment, as we have seen). Religion
is given as "Pantheism." The "career" section makes no reference to
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I> (or <I>transition</I>); on the other hand, Joyce,
Beckett, and Miller are mentioned in the "sidelights" section. Two novels
are listed as being in preparation. Most tantalizing is the indication:
"accumulating material for memoirs." The biography seems to have been
compiled in the late 1970s and we can only speculate as to why the
promised memoirs have failed to appear in the 20 years since.
