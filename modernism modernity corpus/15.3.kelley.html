      Mrs. Pugh, first name unknown, received an unexpected present upon moving into her new home at 114 Cambridge Street, Pimlico, London, in June 1895. The previous owner had left behind a two-sided oil painting.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> On one side of the canvas is a portrait of a woman from the waist up, what in cinematic terms is called a medium-shot. <span style="font-style:italic;">A masked woman</span> (c. 1894) is painted as if mediated through the soft focus of a camera lens. The blackness of her scoop-necked dress and her frizzy black hair highlight her white face and neck. The woman wears a black mask, which draws attention to her white skin and conceals her face so that the viewer cannot tell if she is beautiful or ugly. In front of the woman, a small dead white mouse lies on a brown table. On the opposite side of the canvas are two res, each painted softly on an olive-brown background. In the foreground of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Caprice</span> (c. 1894), a white woman in a long black dress stands stiffly, looking posed. Her arms jet from her shoulders at uncomfortable angles. Only her white skin, white muff, and the white and blue feathers of her headdress keep her from melting into the darkness of the canvas. The other smaller, eye-catching re stands at one half the height of the woman. He wears a bright red costume with a white neck ruffle which, along with his bright red hat, makes his black skin stand out prominently. The artist who left these oil paintings behind in 1895 at 114 Cambridge Street was Aubrey Beardsley, the boy genius illustrator of <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> Decadent Aestheticism. These two creations, the only surviving oil paintings Beardsley produced, would have been lost to art and history had it not been for the fastidious cleaning habits of Mrs. Pugh. The  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> paintings engage issues of gender, sex, and race that vexed not only Beardsley, but also the generation of modernist artists that would follow him. Beardsley’s two forgotten oil paintings, along with his many illustrations, allow us to trace a proto-cinematic moment to one that would be realized later in film.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>
      In many ways, the male modernist artists of the early-twentieth century performed the same kind of act of forgetfulness as did Beardsley. Clearing a path for their own work by rejecting the romantic Decadent artists of the 1890’s, they left behind, whether consciously or unconsciously, part of the identity that shaped and influenced them as artists. H. D. might be regarded as a modernist version of Mrs. Pugh, at the ready to rescue them from their own forgetfulness. She had, in fact, “found” the modernist artist in Beardsley, quite by accident, through her involvement in the 1930 film <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, in which she played the role of “white demented Astrid.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Beardsley’s “proto-cinematic” work intersects uncannily and metaphysically with H. D.’s role as actress, muse, promoter and editor for Kenneth Macpherson’s film in relation to gender, sex and race.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Beardsley and H. D. are, admittedly, more concerned with questions of gender and sexuality than race. Nevertheless, that he should position the black male body as sexual plaything in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Caprice</span> suggests his interest in the intersections of race, sexuality and gender. His preoccupation with the notion of the racial Other as plaything is demonstrated further in the illustration Beardsley created from this painting, No. I of “<span style="font-style:italic;">The Comedy of Marionettes”</span>  (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>). Had Beardsley not died at the age of twenty-five, I speculate that he would have produced more texts focused on racial issues. In the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline,</span> the film is clear in its intention to explore race as it intersects with gender and sexuality. Through her role as the racist Astrid, H. D. gives voice to the problem of racism, which was largely without a voice in the Decadent and Modernist eras.
    </p>
<p>
      Questions of gender and sexuality saturated the lives and works of both Beardsley and H. D. Beardsley’s androgynous looks and dandyish affectations caused speculation about his sexuality. Oscar Wilde joked about Beardsley’s “freakish asexuality,” advising, “don’t sit on the same chair as Aubrey . . . it’s not compromising.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Brigid Brophy writes, “Beardsley kept a foot in either camp—a foot wearing, moreover, a kinky boot,” an allusion to his purportedly bisexual inclinations.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Beardsley never admitted to having been either hetero- or homosexual, preferring to leave people guessing. He ambivalently assumed the role of the androgyne, sometimes delighting in it and, at other times, railing against it. Beardsley enjoyed, on the one hand, being the naughty school-boyish imp who continually shocked Victorian society. In late 1893, for example, he jokingly wrote to his friend Robert Ross about his “amusing” notices from his exhibition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl and a Bookshop</span>  (<a name="2-text" href="#2">2</a>) at the New England Art Club Exhibition: “[The art critic from the magazine] <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Opinion</span> sets me down as belonging to the Libidinous and Asexual school.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> He also referred playfully to himself as “the solitaire,” the nickname he gave a virginal character in his story of Venus and Tannhäuser (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span>, 217). On the other hand, when <span style="font-style:italic;">St. Paul’s</span> art critic Haldane MacFall called his work “sexless and unclean” in 1895, Beardsley composed an angry letter to the editor in response: “As to my uncleanliness, I do the best for it in my morning bath, and if he [MacFall] has  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> really any doubts as to my sex, he may come and see me take it.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Here, the impish androgyne evaporates, leaving only the boiling anger of the man who (passive) aggressively invites an art critic to watch him prove his sexual prowess.

      H. D. shares with Beardsley a distinctly androgynous quality, although she embraced her bisexuality and formed significant sexual attachments to men and women throughout her life. She was involved, moreover, in intersections of sexual desire that haunted and encompassed the formation of the POOL group in general and <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> in particular.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> As Anne Friedberg notes, “‘pool’ may have seemed a suitable metaphor for the fluid and yet quite complicated relationships that existed between H. D., Bryher and Macpherson.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> H. D. began a sexual affair with Macpherson in 1926, and Bryher, H. D.’s lesbian lover “agreed to screen [the affair] by marrying Macpherson in 1927.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Macpherson envisioned H. D. as “an adorable androgyne; he wrote her, in the dawn of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> their love affair: ‘I knew I had seen god or goddess in you then.’”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> “Adorable androgyne” seems an odd moniker to give one’s lover, yet the androgynous quality projected by H. D. not only made her right for the role of Astrid, but also probably contributed to her attractiveness to the bisexual Macpherson.
    </p>
<p>
      The intricate mixture of sexuality and gender that exist at the heart of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, both in the lives of those involved in making the film and within the film itself, is complicated by the question of race. In her excellent introduction to H. D.’s “<span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> and the POOL Films,” Friedberg succinctly captures the knotty-ness (and perhaps naughtiness!) of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>: “the racialized sexual politics of the film operate within the binary metaphor of borderline—white/black; hetero/queer—presenting a complex matrix of racial and sexual tensions.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Susan Stanford Friedman traces the “real life” sexual intricacies among those who participated in the making of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>: the bisexual Macpherson, along with his homosexual friend Robert Herring (the piano-player in the film), were involved in the Harlem Renaissance scene, which introduced Macpherson to many young black male artists with whom he had affairs, much to the chagrin of H. D., who was sexually involved with him during these subsequent homosexual affairs (“MSR,” 97–99). In relation to the star of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, Paul Robeson, Friedman observes: “Robeson himself may have been the object of Macpherson’s attraction for black men. Macpherson’s fascination with Robeson’s beauty as a body to film is evident in his stills, sketches, and montage” (“MSR,” 100). Although H. D. was attracted to Robeson, there is no evidence suggesting the two had an affair (ibid).
    </p>
<p>
      As for the “reel life” among the actors in the diegetic world of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, the “white/black” and “hetero/queer” borderlines are threaded and crossed. The film depicts a heterosexual affair between (white) Thorne (Gavin Arthur) and (black) Adah (Eslanda Robeson). The (white) barmaid (Charlotte Arthur) also flirts with (black) Pete (Paul Robeson). She links arms with him and coyly places a flower behind his ear (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>). As for the “hetero/queer” dynamics, the barmaid also links arms and flirts with the manageress (Bryher). The piano player (Robert Herring) harbors a crush on Pete and keeps photograph of him pinned on his piano. When Pete leaves town, he puts the photo in his wallet, and then places his wallet into his jacket, signifying his desire to carry the photo (and his memory of Pete) close to his body. The piano player then lets out a deep sigh and returns to his playing, which shows that although he pines for Pete, life must continue. The film seeks to provide a location where sexual orientation is not judged.
    </p>
<p>
      H. D., unlike her male modernist counterparts, strived to provide a place free of sexual judgments not only through her collaboration on <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, but also through her poetry. Cassandra Laity argues that female modernists like H. D. “responded differently to the powerful feminine subjectivities of their early reading that were presently driving their male contemporaries toward a foreboding masculinization of poetry.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> H. D. used the “Decadent topoi of the femme fatale and the male androgyne and their attendant tropes, forms, and linguistic practices in works by the Pre-Raphaelites, Swinburne, Pater and Wilde . . . to fashion a modernist poetic of female desire.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> While I agree with Laity that the Victorian <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> artists influenced and infused  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> H. D.’s art, I would add an additional artist to Laity’s list—Aubrey Beardsley. Although Beardsley was not a Pre-Raphaelite, Edward Burne-Jones discovered him, giving him a Wittgensteinian “family resemblance” to the pre-Raphaelites.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Beardsley’s work persistently negotiates the same metaphysical and artistic space as H.D.’s in <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>. The work of both res reveals a shared interest in four areas: first, in gender conflation, particularly involving a specific trope I call the “repellent femme fatale”; second, in gender/sex conflation, particularly in depictions of the masculinized woman and the feminized man; third, in sex, race and racism in relation to the Othered “male” femme fatale; and fourth, in sex, race and racism beyond the specific trope of the Othered “male” femme fatale. Before going on to explore these “uncanny intersections” in Beardsley and H. D.’s work, I’d like to consider more closely the historical and artistic connection, linking Beardsley and H. D.—a connection that ultimately demonstrates that modernist artists need to embrace their Decadent and Aesthetic roots.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Connecting Beardsley and H. D.: Linking Decadent Aestheticism and Modernism</h1>
<p>
	H. D.’s position as a woman modernist in a profoundly male-dominated artistic era made her more receptive to the gender fluidities of the Decadent and Aesthetic eras, which reached their pinnacle in the illustrations of Aubrey Beardsley. Male modernists dismissed the “feminine” as the soft, squishy, and blurry emotional side of art that often found representation in the tropes of the castrating femme fatale and the homoerotic aesthete, both res that blur the lines between masculinity and femininity and that frightened male modernists away from the overly decorative, dandyish works of <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> artists. As Laity notes, “theories of modern poetry authored by Eliot, Pound, Yeats, and others repeatedly raise the specters of the femme fatale and the Aesthete to warn against the ‘hedonism’ they believed had plunged Romanticism into decadence and decay” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HDV</span>, xi).
      </p>
<p>
	The modernist disavowal of decadent artists like Beardsley is unfortunate, given that his work is eerily prescient of the type of filmic devices that modernism would come to embrace, and that can be seen throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>. Susan McCabe writes that the “medium of film opened up a new vocabulary for modernist poets not only to challenge modes of mimetic representation but also to explore and reconstruct cultural tropes of fragmented, dissociated corporeality,” as can be seen in the work of the modernist artists, such as Marcel Duchamp, who participated in the 1913 Armory show.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> These artists “underscored modern art’s capacity to blur, to enlarge, to cut away outlines, particularly those which fix or delimit gender morphology.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Although Beardsley never references film, his illustrations herald the filmic medium’s ability to morph and fragmentize through the formal cinematic tools of the cut, the close up, and the use of light.
      </p>
<p>
	H. D. employed this “new vocabulary” of modernity, fragmenting Macpherson’s corporeality by merging his body with the work/art he produces: “Kenneth Macpherson,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> at work, is a hard-boiled mechanic, as if he himself were all camera, bone and sinew and steel-glint of rapacious grey eyes” (“B,” 226). Although predating the Armory show by twenty years, Beardsley’s illustration <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl and a Bookshop</span> (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>), also suggests a dissociated corporeality that challenges “modes of mimetic representation.” The <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl</span> is stiff and mechanical looking, like a wind up toy. She is comprised of disassociated body parts—her arm is too long for her body, and her foot, peeking out from the hem of her skirt, is perched at an unnatural angle in relation to her body and appears unable to support her body weight. Her body seems cut and fragmented in the same way that bodies are fragmented through the rapid editing of clatter montage used in <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>. Her body mimics the stiffness and unnaturalness of the trees around her. The three trees all are broken (fragmented), their trunks truncated by the picture’s borderlines. The artificiality of the tree in the upper left corner is highlighted by the supports around it, as if the tree were too weak or decayed to stand on its own. Beardsley’s positioning of the girl in the upper left side leaves the entire bottom half of the drawing blank, evoking a kind of “no-man’s land” of white space, anachronistically (for Beardsley) reminiscent of the wasted space of the no-man’s land of World War I, a war which haunted H. D.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Whereas Beardsley seems presciently proto-modern in terms of his representation of a fragmented corporeality, H. D.’s preoccupation with questions of aesthetic beauty gestures backward toward Decadence. In the “<span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> Pamphlet,” she asserts: “There is no such thing as any fixed art standard. This is beautiful, this was beautiful, this may be beautiful. There is one beauty, it is the beauty of belief, of faith of hope” (“B,” 226). H. D.’s concept of “no fixed standard for art” is rooted in the same Decadent Aestheticism that fueled Beardsley’s imagination and excitement over his periodical project, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Yellow Book</span>. In an interview, Beardsley and co-editor Henry Harland explained that their “sole criterion for acceptance would be artistic distinction; the treatment of the subject was crucial. ‘If you were to bring us a bad picture of the Crucifixion,’ the editors explained, ‘we should not take it; but it you brought us a good picture of a pumpkin; it’s highly probable we should” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span>, 190–91).
      </p>
<p>
	In May 1928, H. D. wrote an article for <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-up</span> on the film <span style="font-style:italic;">Expiation</span>. She describes the female lead as “angular, bird-like, claw-like, skeleton-like and hideous. . . . Beauty is too facile a word to discuss this, this woman is a sort of bleak young sorceress, vibrant, febrile, neurotic, as I say, almost cataleptic.” Her face, moreover, “can be termed beautiful in the same way that dawn can be termed beautiful rising across the stench and fever of battle.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> This actress, Alexandra Khokhlova, is said to have been H. D.’s inspiration for the character of Astrid.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> H. D. argues that Khokhlova’s exquisitely beautiful “hideousness” trumps the usual cinematic definition of “beauty,” which she describes as the post <span style="font-style:italic;">Joyless Street</span>-fashioned Garbo, who was no longer “this Nordic flower,” but now a “wild camellia . . . the most blatant of obvious, crepe tissue-paper orchids.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Such sensibilities are aligned closely with Beardsley’s: for while H. D. prefers an exquisitely well-executed image of an ordinary, ugly object (Khokhlova) over an artificially beautiful, revered object (the “camellia” Garbo), Beardsely prefers a “good picture of a pumpkin” to a “bad picture of the Crucifixion.” The striking visual  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> similarities between Astrid and Beardsley’s Women illustrations establish yet another connection between these artists. Although H. D. may have had Khokhlova in mind when she created Astrid, her real roots lie in Beardsley’s decadent New Woman illustrations.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Gender/Sex Conflation in Beardsley’s Art and <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>: The Repellent Femme Fatale</h1>
<p>
	Both Beardsley’s women and Astrid can be said to possess “a contrast of sweet beauty with repulsive ugliness.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Heyd uses these words specifically to describe Beardsley’s women, but they also apply to Astrid. And while H. D. describes <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>’s barmaid character as “sweet gone stagnant,” the description better fits her own character of Astrid (“B,” 233). The past potentiality of beauty exists in Astrid, but it is a “stagnant” beauty that has turned from peak ripeness to rot. Beardsley’s women, like H. D.’s Astrid (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>), still possess a residue of beauty in spite of appearing ugly, and even repellant, at times. Beardsley and H. D. capture these women on paper and on film in true decadent fashion after they turn from sweetness to stagnation or from ripeness to rot, forming a trope that I call the repellent femme fatale. This “turn” to the repellent  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> femme fatale occurs at the point at which the iconic femme fatale finds her feminine beauty and masculine power turning to masculine (read: unappealing) “beauty” and feminine (read: lost) power.

<p>
	This iconic femme fatale derives from the archetypal fatal woman, a mythic creation common to most cultures, for “[w]oman = sex = death is an equation inscribed into mass consciousness around the world, common to the postmodern West and the pre-modern East.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> The iconic femme fatale is unknowable and sexually dangerous; her unknowability shrouds her in a mystery that stems in part from her hidden, and therefore unknowable, genitals. This possession of a secret transforms her into a puzzle that the male must solve in order to prove his intelligence and superiority. The iconic femme fatale also carries with her the threat of castration: she is the “bearer of the bleeding wound; she can exist only in relation to castration and cannot transcend it.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Using her hypnotic sexual attractiveness, the femme fatale lures the male and then threatens to castrate him (metaphorically) by stealing his power of reason. He loses his head, so to speak, unable to think reasonably and logically in her presence. Although hyper-feminine in her attractiveness, the femme fatale codes as masculine in her ambition for power and her desire for control over men.
      </p>
<p>
	In contrast to the iconic femme fatale, the repellent femme fatale has lost her feminine beauty, which is her source of power over men. She also codes as excessively feminine in that she is womb personified, and her hysterical machinations make her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> dangerous. An out-of-control monster, the repellent femme fatale injures the white male from a position of instability rather than from a position of power. At one point in time, she held the position of the iconic femme fatale. Unlike her cinematic sister, however, the repellent femme fatale becomes “knowable” because she allows the male to see how much she needs <span style="font-style:italic;">him</span>. The power paradigm shifts; the mystery is revealed and the source of her power evaporates, and with it, her ability to castrate. At this point, the repellent femme fatale undergoes a kind of castration herself, having lost the phallus (the sense of her power). Modernist male authors had particular scorn for the iconic femme fatale; as Laity maintains, she is reinscribed “by the modernist prohibition against the brazenly sexual and ‘pathological’” woman (<span style="font-style:italic;">HDV</span>, 23). Although the repellent femme fatale would not be threatening to the modernist male as she no longer had the power to control him through her sexual allurement, she still could provoke scorn because of her “pathological” turn into hysteria. H. D.’s decision to portray a repellent femme fatale suggests that she looked to the recent past of Decadent Aestheticism, and particularly to Beardsley’s fascination with the re of the repulsively beautiful woman, to explore this trope—a trope ignored by male modernists who feared becoming infected with the feminine.

	In Beardsley’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A masked woman</span>, the viewer comprehends the easy metaphor of cat equals femme fatale; nevertheless, this painting represents not femme fatale-ness, but <span style="font-style:italic;">potential</span> femme fatale-ness. Whether the masked woman’s powers are at their ripest or  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> are starting to rot is up for debate. Does she wear the mask to appear mysterious and sexually alluring, or to cover a flaw in her looks that renders her repellent? Beardsley’s use of softening lines suggests that she wants to hide an imperfection from the spectator, like an aging film star might request a camera lens be covered with petroleum jelly or cheese cloth before agreeing to submit to its gaze. The painting captures the masked woman just as she has caught and killed her prey, leaving undetermined a host of other questions about the future. Had Beardsley chosen to capture his subject five minutes into the future, the image of her might have been gruesome: her black dress sullied with blood and fur, her mouth dripping with blood as she devoured her prey. Or perhaps we should have seen the mouse being stolen away from her, by a man she no longer enchants or by an iconic femme fatale at the apotheosis of her beauty. As <span style="font-style:italic;">A masked woman</span> remains frozen in the moment at which Beardsley painted her, the spectator can never know for sure what this mask masks.
      </p>
<p>
	Unlike Beardsley’s masked woman, <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>’s Astrid has no mask behind which to hide. The film exposes her fully, revealing her to be a repellent femme fatale. In her description of the heroic effort put forth by Macpherson to get the film completed, H. D. writes of his “turning” the camera with the precision of a metronome in order to get the perfect rhythm of each scene (“B,” 229–30). Likewise, Astrid’s “turning” from iconic femme fatale into repellent femme fatale occurs with precision. While Susan McCabe argues that Astrid is “a femme fatale stripped of charisma,” I would like to argue that one way of looking at the repellent femme fatale is to imagine applying a layer of hysteria to her psyche and body following this stripping of charisma.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> We sense that Astrid, prior to the advent of the film, could have been an iconic femme fatale: for with her high cheekbones and well-proportioned features, Astrid’s face implies a long-ago beauty, while “H. D.’s weathered face offers another image—the aging woman, the loss of beauty, the beating taken from life.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> As Judith Brown righly notes, H. D. herself describes Astrid as having “a weathered woman-face,” which “beats through the film like the very swift progress” of the wings of the dead, stuffed bird in Astrid’s hotel room on “doomed wings . . . already extinguished in ‘borderline’ existence” (“B,” 223). Macpherson aesthetically renders the “beating” of Astrid’s face by using light adeptly in filming <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>). “Macpherson sculpts literally with light,” H. D. writes. “He gouges, he reveals, he conceals” (“B,” 227). The word “gouging” invokes a feeling of pain, a feeling mirrored by Macpherson’s lighting of Astrid throughout the film, which appears to gouge and cut her. This aesthetic choice is characteristic of filmic depictions of the femme fatale, who “ultimately loses physical movement, influence over camera movement, and is often actually or symbolically imprisoned by composition” behind either visual bars or real bars. The light that once gave her control and strength now renders the femme fatale “symbolically . . . impotent.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Light becomes even more pernicious, in the case of the repellent femme fatale, not only capturing, but metaphorically gouging, her. Where the iconic femme fatale may lose her power, her beauty usually remains intact; in contrast, the repellent femme fatale is stripped of her beauty, which renders her powerless—not a puzzle to solve, but a hideous monster to avoid. The iconic femme fatale usually dies for her sins, but dies beautiful, delivered from the repellent femme fatale’s fate, which is to become monster-like and hideous  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> prior to death. Macpherson’s use of lighting, moreover, never implies that Astrid ever had control of the camera or the male hero’s gaze since harsh bars of light already imprison her at the start of the film.
      </p>
<p>
	Beardsley’s Salome, featured in his illustration <span style="font-style:italic;">The Peacock Skirt</span>  (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>), is also a repellent femme fatale. This illustration captures the moment in Oscar Wilde’s 1894 play, <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome,</span> in which Salome speaks seductively to Narraboth in order to persuade him to bring John the Baptist to her. In the illustration, Salome stares directly into Narraboth’s eyes with her mouth open, as if she has been captured mid-word. She stands in profile; Beardsley “lights” her right eye in a white circle, suggesting that her eyes are cold, hard, and fixed on that which she desires. Her right brow arches, making her look cruel and severe, while her protruding chin signals her strength and power. In the midst of such masculine severity, however, Salome’s face still shows a trace of beauty, for her features are feminine and attractive in a repulsive sort of way. Her nose, in particular, is both delicate and feminine. Narraboth meets Salome’s stare, gazing directly into her eyes. The blackness around his eyes suggests the danger of “looking” at Salome, as if his eyes rot due to the power of her stare.
      </p>
<p>
	Astrid resembles a “Beardsley Woman” with her hypnotic stare, angular body, and strange, unnatural hairstyle. Her long shawl brings to mind Salome’s shawl-like Peacock Skirt (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a> and <a name="7-text" href="#7">7</a>). The phallic peacock feathers of Salome’s attire connote masculine power just as the balls that hang from Astrid’s shawl (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>) and the phallic candle in the background (<a name="7-text" href="#7"> 7</a>) lend her an air of masculinity. Like Salome, Astrid embodies the role of repellent femme fatale through a simultaneous display of both excessive masculinity and femininity. The latter manifests itself through the guise of hysteria, “a spectacle—of shock, of illusion which has been compared to that of early cinema.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> It was believed that hysterical patients experienced “convulsions and contractures—as well as the moments of stillness and ecstasy”; at the Salpêtrière Hospital in the 1880s, Dr. Jean-Martin Charcot captured the movements of his hysterics on film.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Discussing Joan of Arc in <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-up</span>, H. D. wonders if Joan “fumbles in her dazed hypnotized manner towards some solution of her claustrophobia? I am shut in here, I want to get out.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Astrid, whose world consists of two small rooms—one of which is covered in claustrophobic, busy wallpaper reminiscent of the pattern that drove Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s heroine insane—probably feels the same about her physical environment. Astrid’s rooms serve to exaggerate her imprisonment: she either paces, moving her angular body in jerk-like motions, or nervously plays solitaire. This claustrophobic environment serves as a factor in her descent into hysteria. Macpherson intersperses scenes of Astrid in her room with scenes of Thorne walking through meadows and woods, emphasizing his freedom as opposed to her confinement. Like Charcot’s hospitalized patients, Astrid is trapped by her physical environment and by her symptoms of hysteria manifested in bodily convulsions and catatonia during her t with Thorne over Ada. Whereas Charcot filmed his hysterics to serve as documented evidence of their authentic hysterical “performances,” Macpherson films H. D. as a performing hysteric.

Thorne emerges from the closet with a suitcase; recognizing it as Adah’s suitcase and convinced that Thorne plans to reunite with Adah, Astrid runs toward him and pounds furiously on his chest. Thorne briefly embraces her. Macpherson’s camera shows Astrid in profile, hugging Thorne’s body. Astrid’s face is stark white, which is accentuated by Thorne’s white sweater. Macpherson’s lighting highlights the contours of her eye sockets, making her look skeletal and sinister. When Thorne pushes her away, she loses control and assumes a posture resembling one of Charcot’s hysterics: raising her hand to her forehead and throwing her head backward to expose her white throat, she emits a silent scream before collapsing to the floor and playing dead, mimicking the catatonia of the hysteric. Astrid wears only black; her wing-like shawl has fallen away, causing her to look like a bird of prey with clipped wings.

	its pallor now accentuated by her black dress. Her eyes remain wide open, unfocused, and lifeless, suggesting to the audience and to Thorne that she is dead. The camera cuts back and forth between close-ups of their faces. Then, one close-up captures an ever-so-brief fluttering of Astrid’s eyelid. Thorne recoils in horror as Astrid suddenly sits up. Then, Astrid’s body cuts diagonally across the screen, her white face dominating the shot from the upper right corner as her body in the black dress seems to fade into the carpet. She looks like a floating head—a Medusa post-Perseus.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Gender/Sex Conflation in Beardsley’s Art and <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>: The Masculinized Woman and the Feminized Man</h1>
<p>
	The iconic femme fatale derives from what Judith Butler calls the “two res of abjection,” which Cassandra Laity identifies as “the masculinist woman and the feminized man” (qtd in <span style="font-style:italic;">HDV</span>, 23; ibid.). Both res existed in the Decadent era. The “masculinist woman” was embodied in the re of the “New Woman,” the name given to Victorian women who sought increased social, political, and educational opportunities. In order to counter the feminist threat, establishment res invented “degrading stereotypes” that depicted the New Woman as “ugly,” “masculine-looking,” and “sexless.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> The “feminized man” was personified in the re of the dandyish artist who, working in the romantic tradition, was “labeled ‘effeminate’ by male modernists.”<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Beardsley’s art and H. D.’s Astrid demonstrate that these two “res of abjection” are not self-contained, but that gender and sexuality are fluid categories.
      </p>
<p>
	In one of the first sequences of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, Astrid calls Pete to tell him that Adah is with Thorne. The camera holds Astrid in a close-up, her right side exposed to the harsh light of the camera. In this shot, she resembles an androgyne, as she could be mistaken for a man with male pattern baldness. As Astrid hangs up, angry that Pete would not take her call, the camera rests on her claw-like hands that are curled around the telephone receiver. The camera cuts to a medium close-up of Astrid, focusing on the hairless chasm of her scalp. After a quick cut to Adah, the camera cuts to a close-up of Astrid’s right profile, focusing the light on the back on her neck and casting her skeletal appearance in a strange and surreal swirl of shadows and light. Occurring in rapid succession at the advent of the film, these stark, unflattering shots shock the viewer with the repellent nature of Astrid’s physical appearance. Astrid continues to be lit harshly throughout the film, as, for example, the scene in which she stares relentlessly into the camera upon realizing that Thorne is about to leave her. In this ten-second stare, the viewer sees the stark light embedding into Astrid’s skull on the left side. She wears little to no make-up, and her thin mouth suggests no hint of sexual enticement. Her eyes lock unto the camera. This hypnotic stare manifests utter desperation (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>). Astrid’s is the very antithesis of the beautiful face of the iconic femme fatale, whose heavily-hooded eyes, cast downward, invite the male gaze. This shot of Astrid has the opposite effect—it repels the viewer. The viewer wants to avert his/her eyes.
      </p>
<p>
	Beardsley’s illustration <span style="font-style:italic;">Bookplate of John Lumsden Propert</span>  (<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>), depicts women with similarly shocking and repellent features. Noting Beardsley’s tendency  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to endow his female res with masculine qualities, Brigid Brophy asks: “Are they female fops, these personages of Beardsley’s: female dandies: female effeminates, even? Or are they male hoydens, male tomboys, boy butches?”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> A menacingly large re with an unattractive face, a hooked nose, and bag-lined eyes stares from the page, her gender signaled only by her elaborate hairstyle and dress. She, too, bears markers of masculinity: dwarfing the illustration’s smaller Pierrot re, her height, body shape, and lack of appendages are suggestive of the phallus. She controls the gaze of the picture with her icy and threatening stare at the viewer. She is also masculine in that she replicates the traditionally dominant male position of power. However, she would not be considered a femme fatale in that her power does not originate, as does the femme fatale’s, in seductiveness.

	Beardsley depicts his repellent woman and her adorning Pierrot in what in filmic terms would be called a two-shot, a presentation that highlights the masculinity of the woman re. Macpherson similarly uses a two shot of Astrid and Adah in order to emphasize Astrid’s masculinity and unattractiveness (<a name="9-text" href="#9"> 9</a>). As Adah prepares to leave Astrid and Thorne’s hotel suite, Macpherson frames the actresses in medium close-up. Shooting their profiles as they face one another establishes a sharp contrast between Astrid’s white, skeletal looks and Adah’s softer, more pleasing features. A painting in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the background, in which a man’s head twists unnaturally in Astrid’s direction, as if he were shocked and repelled by her ugliness, separates Astrid and Adah. The shot’s framing cuts off Astrid’s back while leaving Adah’s back and shoulders intact, suggesting that Adah is more self-possessed than Astrid and that Adah’s presence in Thorne’s life cuts into Astrid. Astrid’s harsh profile and scalp distinguish her from Adah’s attractive hat-adorned head, while her tall, angular body contrasts with Adah’s smaller, rounder, more feminine body. Added images of penises and testicles further connote Astrid’s masculinity and contrast her with Adah’s attractive feminine qualities: two balls of fabric resembling testicles hang from Astrid’s dress and an erect phallic candle rests directly beneath her on the mantelpiece in the background.

	This shot of Astrid and Adah mirrors uncannily Beardsley’s positioning of res in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Peacock Skirt</span> (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>). The masculine-looking Salome is on the left and the feminine-looking Narraboth, the captain of the guard, is on the right. Narraboth’s dress-like tunic shows off his effeminate knock-knees. As Chris Snodgrass points out, the outline of an axe located within the contours of Narraboth’s tunic foreshadows his own death as well as John’s beheading, rendering them both castrated males.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Narraboth’s elegantly coiffed hair and smaller headdress compared with Salome’s elaborate one further code him as effeminate. The ragged edge of Narraboth’s tunic forms a series of small phallic-shaped rips. The center one, which hangs directly between his legs, resembles a small, flaccid penis while the small, double half circle of dots directly above and to the right of this  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> center rip signifies a small and incomplete scrotal sack: both render his image one less masculine than that of Salome. By making her the much larger re, Beardsley portrays the power Salome has over Narraboth. Standing erect, phallic-shaped, and armless on her sturdy, skirted pedestal, her re overpowers the illustration. Salome’s flowing skirt, which resembles a peacock’s fanned plumage, and her headdress, which mirrors the crown of the peacock’s head, align her image with that of the male peacock who exhibits his plumage to attract the female peahen. In his drab tunic, with its ragged, ripped bottom, Narraboth’s appearance suggests the dull plumage of the peahen. In this illustration, Salome is cock and Narraboth is hen.
      </p>
<p>
	Astrid, likewise, desires to make herself cock to Thorne’s hen. Her attempt to appropriate Thorne’s large knife—which is rendered impotent in her hands and then turned against her—signifies her simultaneous desire both to masculinize herself and to feminize Thorne. Using a high-angle shot, Macpherson makes Astrid appear small and powerless. He also focuses a harsh bright light on the right side of her head that highlights her skull—a lighting choice he repeats throughout the film. Astrid looks up at the camera with her head down, producing a ghoulish, frightening effect. The lighting emphasizes her eye sockets, which reinforces her skeletal signification. By relating her so obviously to a skeleton, Macpherson preres her as a corpse, and within a minute or two this shot, Astrid will be dead. Putting on her Beardsley-esque shawl that had fallen off during her earlier hysterical fit, Astrid races toward Thorne and snatches his knife. H. D. describes this scene in her “<span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> Pamphlet”: “The white woman is here, there, everywhere, the dagger is above, beneath, is all but in her heart or in the heart of her meritricious [sic] lover” (B. 230). Macpherson presents this sequence through an Eisensteinian clatter montage that makes the viewer feel disoriented and uneasy. These rapid cuts mirror the frenzy of the scene unfolding as Astrid’s frenetic and hysterical movements frighten and disorient Thorne. Astrid makes small cuts on Thorne’s face and hands. McCabe comments on this scene noting that by “making little cuts on his face” Astrid produces “the body as screen, a scriptable surface.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Just as Gilbert and Gubar have theorized that the pen is a “metaphorical penis,”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> the page then, becomes a metaphorical vagina. Astrid attempts to gain power over Thorne by feminizing him, appropriating ownership of the pen(is) and attempting to turn him into the page. Her efforts to dominate him, however, are unsuccessful: after losing the knife to Thorne, it is she who is penetrated by it in the ensuing scuffle.
      </p>
<p>
	Beardsley’s Salome, who echoes many of Astrid’s characteristics, also shares her fate. Beardsley captures the moment in which Salome is her most “hysterical” in his illustration <span style="font-style:italic;">J’ai Baisé Ta Bouche Iokanaan</span>  (<a name="0-text" href="#0"> 10</a>). This illustration depicts the moment in Wilde’s play in which Salome’s unrequited desire for John, like Astrid’s unrequited desire for Thorne, throws her into the final throws of hysteria. Like Astrid, she becomes homicidal, demanding that the man who rejected her pay with his blood—a blood lust that ultimately causes her own demise. As John the Baptist (Iokanaan) continuously repels her advances, Salome repeats, “I will kiss they mouth Iokanaan” (<span style="font-style:italic;">J’ai Baisé Ta Bouche Iokanaan</span>) over and over, like one of Charcot’s hysterical patients repeating the same movements or phrases. Salome finally demands that his severed  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	Beardsley’s direct reference to Salome’s obsessive repetition of the phrase reinforces the power of her obsession and confirms her turn to the hysterical (the overly feminine). Even her body is draped in a hospital-like gown like those worn by Dr. Charcot’s patients. Salome’s masculine face and jawline make her appear ugly and repellent, while John’s face is feminized. His eyes are closed and lips slightly puckered as if anticipating Salome’s kiss. His long, flowing hair connotes his “femme fatale” quality, while Salome’s “erect” hair conveys her masculinity. Her ability to float in mid-air suggests the strange bodily contortions of which Charcot’s patients were capable during their hysterical episodes. Salome’s head, which appears to be severed by a strand of black hair echoes the floating head of Astrid. The deaths of both women are presaged by these images of decapitation, which symbolize the castrating effects of their hysteria.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> The liquid [Blood? Semen?] dripping from John’s head morphs into a flame signifying the flame of sexual desire; it drips down snake-like into a puddle, winds itself around Beardsley’s emblematic signature, and lands at the base of a clematis flower. The turn of the flame of passion into a puddle connotes the turn of Salome’s flaming sexual allure into an extinguished puddle of her own gendered fluidity. Beardsley also implies the fluidity of gender through the use of gendered metaphors: flower and water connote the feminine, while flame and erect, snake-like hair connote the masculine. In Wilde’s play, Salome pays the ultimate price for her hysteria, her immediate execution ordered by a repulsed King Herod. Certainly this picture gives the slang phrase “giving head” a macabre twist. One that the “polymorphously perverse”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Beardsley would have relished and the male modernists would have feared.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Sex, Race and Racism in Beardsley’s Art and <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>: The Othered “Male” Femme Fatale</h1>
<p>
	In both Beardsley’s art and <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, the iconic femme fatale is not red as an alluring, dangerous woman but by a non-white man. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Peacock Skirt</span> (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>), Narraboth, as the “Syrian” captain, is an Othered racial re in relation to Salome, and he assumes the feminine position to Salome’s masculine one. In <span style="font-style:italic;">J’ai Baisé Ta Bouche Iokanaan</span> (<a name="0-text" href="#0"> 10</a>), John, as a Nazarene, is also an Othered male put in the feminine position. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline,</span> Pete, as racialized Other, embodies the “ripe” femme fatale. Although very masculine, he does not have the power to use his sex appeal to his advantage and instead becomes an object of (white) male desire, just as the iconic femme fatale operates in the matrix of heterosexual (white) male desire. Unthreatened by Pete’s sexuality, the barmaid thoroughly delights in Pete, as is evidenced by her playfully tucking a flower behind his ear (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>); in contrast, Pete’s sexuality is dangerous and threatening to the white male, Thorne, for whom Pete functions as a potential castrator, thereby placing Pete in the position of the iconic femme fatale. As E. Ann Kaplan and Susan McCabe point out, black men and white women are often similarly marginalized as “the Other” in relation to white male power. McCabe argues, “<span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> reanimates the re of the femme fatale by self-consciously racializing it, shifting the film’s erotic locus from H. D. to Paul Robeson. As such, the film invokes the femme fatale as an index for how sex and race impinge upon each other.” She continues, “Astrid is not the film’s femme fatale; instead, the film makes this trope more problematic, and through Robeson, manifests culture’s expulsion of a feminized racial other.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> While not referring specifically to <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, Kaplan considers how the “feminized racial other” fits into the white male power paradigm: “While the specificity of [the white man’s] fears of women, homosexuals and people of colour are different, all three groups share a similarity as marginalised by the white centre.” She goes on to hypothesize that mainstream films tend “to use a <span style="font-style:italic;">similar structure in relation to kinds of difference</span>. That is, Hollywood<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> puts different kinds of difference into the same position vis-à-vis the imaginary white center.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Thorne so thoroughly inhabits the “white [male] centre” that he wears his whiteness, in the form of a white turtleneck sweater, throughout the entire film.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>
	Ironically, the montage poster produced to advertise the film (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 11</a>) does not privilege this “white centre” but concentrates instead on Pete as the erotic locus. Faces, bodies, and parts of faces are cut out and pasted to form a metonymic, corporeal collage. Out of the thirteen images used in the collage, seven are of Pete. At the top left of the poster, is an image of Pete with closed eyes and puckered lips; the crouched re of Thorne, arms raised and fists clenched in a boxer’s pose, rests on Pete’s chin and mouth. The conflation of these images suggests both danger and erotic possibility: will Pete kiss or caress Thorne’s tiny body with his tongue, or devour it? The largeness of Pete’s head in comparison with Thorne’s body, codes Pete as the more sexually potent of the two men.
      </p>
<p>
	The name Pete, a nickname for penis, further evokes the trope of the sexually powerful black male. At the same time the film undermines this persistent trope by positioning Pete as a femme fatale. The scene in which Thorne places a knife by his crotch and begins to whittle a <span style="font-style:italic;">very small stick</span> suggests Thorne’s feelings of sexual inadequacy in regard to Pete, who dwarfs and threatens the sexuality of the white male while also enticing him with his beautiful body. Macpherson’s presentation of Pete  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> via lighting and close-ups unambiguously establishes him as the film’s fetish object extraordinaire. As a sexually powerful racial Other who poses a castration threat, Pete is subject to fetishization.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> His seven erotic heads in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> poster certainly imply his fetishization: Pete is cut up into pieces and displayed as body parts rather than as an entire human being. McCabe describes Macpherson’s eroticized treatment of Pete, noting how: “the camera caresses him almost to the point of soft porn, building on his cultural capital as sex symbol. The film thus idealizes, objectifies, and fragments Robeson, associating him with the femme fatale.”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Macpherson’s camera slices Pete into pieces and serves him up on a cinematic platter for sexual consumption. Numerous close-ups zoom in on Pete’s forehead and face, both in profile and in full frontal shots, as well as on his strong, veined hands and forearms, which are suggestive of an erect penis. As Judith Brown observes, “an early indication of the emphasis of Pete as (erotic) object in the film will be the framing of his hands.”<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Pete’s body in general, and his hands in particular, are so fetishized in one scene that Macpherson’s camera seems to have “had” Robeson sexually. This sequence of shots occurs almost immediately after the scene in which Thorne plays with his knife, first sticking it into his hand, then placing the knife against his face and running it slowly down his forehead and nose with his eyes closed in what could be described as sexual enthrallment. After a quick series of shots of the café, the following forty-eight second sequence of shots ensues:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot one: ECU (extreme close-up) of Pete’s face in (left) profile with only his eyes nose and mouth appearing in frame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot two: CU (Close-up) of Pete’s face in (left) profile filmed in soft focus and lit so that his nose, lower lip and forehead, are highlighted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot three: CU of Pete’s right hand gripping the right collar of his shirt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot four: ECU of Pete’s right hand in soft focus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot five: CU of Pete’s heavily veined left hand and forearm resting against his left thigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot six; ECU of Pete’s left hand in soft focus</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot seven: CU of Pete’s face in (left) profile in sharp focus. The camera then tilts slowly down the left side of Pete’s body. The camera’s focus becomes softer just as the camera hits his right hand, still clutching the collar and then in soft focus the camera continues down his body until it reaches the left hand still resting on his thigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot eight: First shot of Pete in motion, CU with blurry focus on his moving torso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot nine: Medium CU of Pete falling into his bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot ten: CU of Pete lying in bed, eyes closed. Pete then slowly turns to his right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot eleven: Medium Shot (MS) of Pete in bed, the camera showing his head, torso, and right thigh. Pete restlessly writhes in bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot twelve: ECU of Pete’s face, taking up almost the entire frame. Pete still lies on his back and is lit so that the shadows of a design blanket his face. This final shot lasts ten seconds.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	After cutting Pete up into various body parts, the camera lasciviously travels slowly down Pete’s body turning soft when it reaches his phallic hand as if so sexually frenzied that it loses focus. Pete’s constant writhing in bed, captured in rapid cuts, further  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> suggests sexual copulation between Pete and the camera. After the act is completed, Pete stares into space, and the strange shadows that settle on his face suggest a kind of erotic makeup that highlights his exotic Otherness. This sequence of shots reflects more than Macpherson’s aforementioned desire to bed his star, suggesting that Pete is a sexual object to be “had.” The fact that this sequence occurs almost immediately after Thorne’s knife play implies that he, as the dominant white male, in entitled to bed Pete, thereby feminizing and marginalizing the latter.
      </p>
<p>
	Beardsley’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Caprice</span><a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> also res the racialized male Other as sexual plaything, although in this case, it is a white woman who sexually objectifies a black male. The title of the painting intimates that this woman’s involvement with him is no more than a whim, a fancy, or something to occupy her time until she capriciously drops him and moves on to another sexual plaything. The clown-like outfit worn by the male re connotes him too, as an object of play. His featureless face serves also to objectify him—stripping him of ethnic and racial identity that facial features provide. In this painting, he appears to have been captured in motion, forever frozen in the middle of a dance—an obvious metaphor for sex—that is being performed for the woman’s amusement. Adding to the implication of his sexual potency is an erect feather on his hat. His positioning under an arched, vagina-like entranceway, the tip of his cap protruding into the archway, only furthers his phallic image. Despite the masculine persona suggested by his feather and his positioning in the archway, his size, dress, and role as plaything code him as feminine. The re of the woman shows a similar degree of gender fluidity. The woman directs her gaze at the male re, signifying her desire to look at him. Her elaborate dress denotes her wealth and power. Her “muff,” symbolic of the vagina, res prominently into the composition, with its whiteness highlighted by the darkness of her dress and the background. The prominence of this muff suggests she derives sexual pleasure from watching his dance. The muff also codes her as feminine, as does her dress with its pouffy sleeves and green ribbons. Her prominent hair decoration, with two large brightly colored feathers, signifies her masculine power. Nevertheless, the male re’s feathers are “erect,” while hers, although larger, appear flaccid, sending a mixed message: Is she really sexually aroused or merely amused?

<h1 class="sec-headA">Sex, Race and Racism in Beardsley’s Art and <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>: “Othered” Woman Tropes</h1>
<p>
	The racism implied through the sexual objectification of persons of color in <span style="font-style:italic;">Border-line</span> occurs not only through the re of Pete, but through that of Adah. When we first glimpse Adah, she has just been pushed to the floor by Thorne and stares up at him, looking frightened and small. A high angle shot emphasizes her powerlessness. Her chest heaves rapidly, displaying her corporeality as well as her fear of Thorne. As she collects herself, she flinches and backs against a window curtain as if pinned in place or frozen in fear. Her positioning against a window rather than a solid wall indicates the precariousness of her situation at both the literal and rative levels and accentuates her vulnerability. Although Thorne eventually channels his violent impulses into  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> smashing a porcelain re instead of hitting Adah, the film implies Thorne’s belief that it is his right to physically abuse Adah, which further emphasizes her marginalized position. Although Thorne eventually kills Astrid, he never threatens to strike her.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> The film leaves his actions in relation to Astrid open to interpretation. He might have been acting in self-defense, or the up-ended table might have caused the knife to slip into Astrid’s body.
      </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>’s fetishization of Pete and Adah as exotic playthings who can be abused raises questions about the way the film portrays race. Eslanda Robeson wrote in her diary that she and Paul “ruined their make-up with tears of laughter” over the racial naiveté of H. D. and Macpherson.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> This naiveté was undoubtedly compounded by the more covert forms of racism that typified the 1920s, for “H. D. and her white friends might fit the pattern of so many liberal whites whose disgust for discrimination and sympathy for blacks ran very deep but whose friendship and fascination were often tainted by covert forms of racism” (“MSR,” 101). The film strives to be anti-racist, using the bigoted Astrid as a conduit for its explicit anti-racist message. <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> situates Astrid so that her physical ugliness—her repellent, skeletal, and vulturesque qualities—reflects her spiritual ugliness. In the scene in which Astrid hysterically hisses, “Nigger lover,” for example, Macpherson uses a harsh light to illuminate her ugliness. Clawing at the air, she looks like a predatory animal. Still, one wonders if the desire to present an explicit anti-racist agenda somehow gets lost in the racism noted by Friedman. The way in which the film enacts its anti-racist message, by comparing Adah with monkeys, further makes the film itself appear to be covertly racist.
      </p>
<p>
	The scene in question is that in which Astrid and Thorne first quarrel over Adah. Macpherson’s positioning of Astrid directly above an ugly toy witch that sits on the mantel visually and metaphorically connects Astrid with the toy. Astrid’s gaze initially looks out beyond the frame, as if she looks at Thorne, sitting on the bed in their adjoining room. Astrid then turns her head slightly, gazing at a blurry object hanging on the wall in the center of the frame. She looks down at the bottom of the object and slowly looks up so that her gaze encompasses the entire length of the blurry hanging object. The camera quickly cuts to an extreme-close-up of Thorne gazing out beyond the frame, suggesting that he watches Astrid in the next room. Rapidly, the camera cuts back to Astrid, now in extreme-close-up, her face holding a smug, superior smirk. She remains in profile and in soft focus as she gazes intensely at the re on the wall, which is now in sharp focus. Astrid gazes smugly at three miniature toy monkeys, hanging vertically, hand over foot. The camera moves up the trio of monkeys as it follows Astrid’s eye up the chain. Macpherson then moves to a new location, indicated by a close-up on a closed curtain-adorned door, which Adah opens, entering into the close-up. This shot obliquely mirrors the opening of a theater curtain, “introducing” Adah into the previous scene, which suggests a more covert racism at work in the film.
      </p>
<p>
	The same kind of problematic associations with women and race occur in Beardsley’s work. Matthew Sturgis writes that in the 1890s “an alarmed public” considered many of Beardsley’s women “ugly and bizarre. . . . The thick-lipped ‘Beardsley mouth’ came in for particular censure as being ‘inexpressive and ugly’ and anatomically improbable; it  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> had . . . been borrowed from Africa and applied incongruously to the Anglo-Saxon face” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span>, 218–19). Indeed, many of Beardsley’s women had African or Asian features, as can be seen, for example, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Bookplate of John Lumsden Propert</span> (<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>), in the illustrations of <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> (<a name="5-text" href="#5">. 5</a> and <a name="0-text" href="#0">10</a>), and in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Design for the Prospectus of The Yellow Book</span>  (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 12</a>) and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Design for the Front Cover of The Yellow Book, Vol. II</span>  (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 13</a>). <span style="font-style:italic;">Design for the Prospectus</span> depicts an angular, unnatural-looking woman whose face has disproportionate non-Caucasian features that make her appear grotesque. The (white) Pierrot-like re minding the bookstore looks at her disapprovingly. The fact that the woman is out alone at night suggests that she may be a prostitute, or, at the very least, a woman with loose morals. <span style="font-style:italic;">Design for the Front Cover</span> depicts a woman with thick lips and slanted eyes that appear crossed as a way of indicating a lack of intelligence. The way her hair parts at her forehead to look like two white horns suggests devilish intensions, or perhaps a deviant sexuality. The presence of six large, open flowers, signifying the vagina, connote her hypersexuality. Beardsley’s women were often caricatured in <span style="font-style:italic;">Punch</span> magazine (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 14</a>) with particular “emphasis on the woman’s slanted eyes and thick lips” which “carried Asian or African racial connotations which would have reinforced the racist notion that non-European women were more primitive and sexually voracious.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Recognizing that being lampooned in <span style="font-style:italic;">Punch</span> was a sign of success, Beardsley must have realized that that his images of women were hitting upon a sensitive Victorian nerve.
      </p>
<p>
	It is unclear whether Beardsley’s depictions of these women highlight his racist tendencies, or whether they mock racist attitudes of his time. Beardsley played with the fluidity of gender and sex as a means of suggesting that male/female and masculine/feminine were not either/or binaries. Along the same lines, Beardsley’s presentation of women with varying and perhaps fluid racial features suggests that racial fluidity could also traverse preset binaries of white/Other and centralized/marginalized. Beardsley and H. D. seemed to have shared similar agendas in regard to blurring the conventional borderlines of sex, gender, and race; such efforts as they made to tackle these binaries were rare in both the Decadent and the Modernist periods.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Conclusion</h1>
<p>
	In his “Translator’s Postscript” to de Gourmont’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Natural Philosophy of Love</span>, Ezra Pound wrote that writing effective poetry was like “driving any new idea into the great passive vulva of London.”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Pound’s phrase emphasizes his distaste for the ways that the Aesthetic and Decadent movements had feminized London with their decaying romantic notions of decadence and art-for-art’s-sake. In Pound’s view, London needed to be inseminated with the hard, masculine ideas of modernism. While H. D. began her career as a hard modernist, her artistic sensibilities would soften as her career continued, for “H. D. would cast off the vanishing body of male ‘indifference’— Hermaphroditus—for exploded and explosive female bodies that matter” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HDV</span>, 119). Even while working on <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> pamphlet in and around 1930, H. D. expressed reservations about linking herself to the Decadent Aestheticism of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	the 1890s. Expressing admiration for Macpherson’s talent in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> pamphlet, she writes: “I have said that Kenneth Macpherson touches the various ‘stops’ and focus appliances of his beautiful camera like a violinist. And that presents another parallel. I have said that in the film alone can the pictorial arts be welded. They can in addition be <span style="font-style:italic;">wedded</span> and to a separate art form. And that form, music.” However, she then issues a caveat: “But here we are on difficult ground; speaking of one art in terms of another always seems the hall-mark of the ‘nineties’ or of facile dilettantism. Yet it is perhaps as necessary to-day for the modernist artist to endeavour to shock weary sensibilities as it was for the so-called ‘effete’ of that generation” (“B,” 228).

	On the one hand, she mistrusts the ease with which the Aesthetes “weld” and “wed” different forms of art; on the other hand, she acknowledges that this “welding” and “wedding” is necessary in order to “shock” people out of their perceived expectations of what art should be. H. D. comes to realize her connection with the 1890s Aesthetes  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and welcomes a welding and a wedding of her works to theirs. Eventually, she would come to see the Aesthetes’ combining of art forms, such as Whistler’s insistence that his paintings were musical, not as “facile dilettantism,” but as a means of infusing all art forms with new energy. Beardsley’s Aesthetic Decadent “energy” infiltrates H. D.’s work, and she, as Laity cogently argues, continually influenced the shape of modernity and (almost exclusively male) modernist ideas. H. D. is the Mrs. Pugh of modernism. By unconsciously “finding” Beardsley’s work, she prevents the ideas of the Decadent Aesthetics from being forever lost to the succeeding generation of modernists. Functioning as “Mrs. Pugh” to Beardsley’s “ghost,” particularly with regard to their views on gender, sex and race, H. D. becomes the artistic and historical link between Decadent Aestheticism and modernism.
      </p>
<p>
	After Beardsley’s death, Arthur Symons noted that the young artist “had the fatal speed of those who are to die young; that disquieting completeness and extent of knowledge, that absorption of a lifetime in an hour, which we find in those who hasten to have done their work before noon, knowing that they will not see the evening.”<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> Just as his <span style="font-style:italic;">masked woman</span> is caught in a moment before she reveals her true self to her audience, Beardsley too was caught in a moment of history come too soon, swallowed up by an untimely death before he had the chance to develop into one of the finest artists of the modernist era. By seeing the connections between H. D.’s work in <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> and Beardsley’s art, I feel that in some manifestation, Beardsley did become a great modernist artist despite his unfortunate historical timing. In her essay “The Cinema and the Classics III—The Mask and the Movietone,” H. D. dreams about that great new invention of modernism, the cinema. With cinema, she writes, “we are visionaries, we may become prophets.”<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> H. D. was herself that visionary, as she (unconsciously) recognized a proto-cinematic “prophet” of modernism—Aubrey Beardsley.

	    The POOL group, which consisted primarily of H. D., Bryher, and Macpherson, announced its formation in various literary magazines in the spring of 1927. Its “projects” were to include the publication of books, the production of films, and the formation of the monthly film art magazine, <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up</span>, which would “begin battle for film art.” See Anne Friedberg, “Introduction: Reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up, 1927–1933,</span>” <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up 1927–1933</span>, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Cinema and Modernism</span>, ed.

	  Beardsley’s biographer, Matthew Sturgis, reports that Beardsley met Edward Burne-Jones on Sunday, July 12, 1891 when he and his sister, Mabel, dropped by “The Grange,” thinking Burne-Jones had “open studio” sessions on Sundays. Although this proved not to be the case, Burne-Jones still welcomed the uninvited couple into his home, told Beardsley his drawings showed promise and encouraged him to continue his art (AB, 71–74).

	  Brigid Brophy uses this Freudian phrase to describe Beardsley’s child-like sexuality: “Mannerism is in itself a style that murmurs of perversity, its elongations a visual drawl that mimics sexual languor. Beardsley, who <span style="font-style:italic;">was</span> a precious child, remained one. . . . The genius of Beardsley’s eroticism is precisely the quality Freud ascribed to the sexuality of children: polymorphous perversity.” <span style="font-style:italic;">Black and White</span> (New York: Stein and Day, 1968), 28.

	  In “Visual Pleasure and the Narrative Cinema” Laura Mulvey discusses “two avenues of escape” from castration anxiety available to the male unconscious: the “complete disavowal of castration by the substitution of a fetish object or turning the represented re itself into a fetish so that it becomes reassuring rather than dangerous.” In <span style="font-style:italic;">Screen,</span> 16.3 (Autumn 1975), 13–4.

	  Beardsley’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Caprice</span> is owned by the Tate Museum of Art, London, England. Unfortunately, obtaining a reproduction of this painting was not possible. This oil painting is very similar to his later illustration No. I of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Comedy of the Marionettes</span> (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>); the main differences between the two being his use of color in the painting and his providing facial features of both res in the illustration.

	  I will contend that he does grab at her shirt in the café, but this maneuver seems defensive as she simultaneously grabs him. It appears that any aggression toward Astrid results from Thorne’s need for self-defense. Late in the film, he pushes her away, but this is more an act of repulsion than aggression.
