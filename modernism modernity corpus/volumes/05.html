I am delighted to be able to begin my response by thanking my fellow
panelists for writing papers that I could enjoy hearing again even after
spending considerable time with them. I want to thank them also for
being so impressive on Stein as to force me to confine my remarks to the
Wittgenstein aspect of their papers, where they help stage a conflict that
I think is very much worth pursuing. I will argue that it is misleading
to impose a pragmatist grid on what Wittgenstein says about language
games and about the role of philosophical grammar. Pragmatism depends on
the ability to determine shared purposes. Wittgenstein is at once more
ambitious and less demanding, for he is not interested in the empirical
question of how agreement is reached and purposes satisfied. Instead his
primary purpose is reflective: he wants to understand not the fact of
agreement but the possibility of agreement in terms of how individuals
find their way to a way, that is, to a sense of "fit" from within which
questions about meaning and purpose simply dissolve, at least relative
to the specific practice at hand.

<P>
These two papers provide an excellent laboratory experiment for testing
this assertion because they take opposing positions that I think are
both limited by abstract philosophical agendas distorting the full
reflective resources provided by Wittgenstein's notion of grammar. Meyer
faults Wittgenstein for not achieving a radical empiricism comparable
to Stein's, while for Lezra, Wittgenstein is too much the empiricist
to appreciate how the Hegelian concept of reserve reveals necessary
tensions between the pull of explanation and the pull of an immediacy,
a pure "there" displaying what proves an unnarratizable 
<B></B> 
subjectivity. By
engaging the alternatives that these critics represent I hope to show how
Wittgenstein in fact does allow for an immediacy that is deeply connected
to something like "a determined excess of reserve," since his imagined
dialogues create exemplary contexts by which the "there" of "perspicuous
representation" becomes resonant in its concreteness. To make this case
I will concentrate on what seems shared by Stein and Wittgenstein on the
notion of grammar and its relation to the staging of subjective agency.

<P>
I think it is fair to take Meyer's praise of "radical empiricism"  as
an idealizing of those writerly stances that can treat sentences entirely
in terms of the roles they play "swimming in the stream of thought"
. If language can swim in these waters, then a behaviorist theory
of emotions will not suffice because, contra James, one cannot simply
treat emotions as the expressions of physiological states. Rather one
must also develop a proprioceptive psychology in which self-reflection
and imagination are acknowledged as elemental building blocks of what
emerges as "feeling," i. e., as "the experience of a particular succession
of sensations" . In my view this critique is clearly on the right
track, but I am bothered by two possible conceptual problems in Meyer's
formulation of his case. First, a truly radical empiricism would have
serious trouble accounting for any "reserve" within this proprioceptive
process: all it allows us to do is track the flow of feeling without
having the ability to characterize the frameworks and structures that
give the feelings shape and meaning over time. In relation to texts
this empiricism might account for the movement within a paragraph but
it would be hard-pressed to track any larger semantic units. And even
within the paragraph there are relations among sentences that would be
very difficult to account for in any empirical model, if by "empirical"
we mean phenomena that in principle could be located by some tracking
machine like a semantic MRI. In fact Meyer is terrific in showing just
how much the idea of a paragraph differs from the idea of a sentence
because where sentences offer only types, infinitely combinable
but without direction, paragraphs bring to bear something like an
intentionality that can only be inferred. Hence in Stein's example of
the dog drinking, what makes a paragraph is the rhythmic process that
pervades and distinguishes the whole. What can it mean to locate this
process as the object of a radical empiricism? Clearly no idealism will
be able to capture its distinctive singularity. But why must empiricism
be the only alternative to idealism? Why can we not simply stop with the
fact that as we learn to read Stein we learn to allow such singularity
to function as perspicuous representatives of what remains singular and
untranslatable in our affective practices?

<P>
So my first problem with Meyer is that his empiricism is not concrete
enough. As Wittgenstein was fond of showing, empiricism about mental
states will always lead to conditions that cannot be measured or included
within empiricist practices. The second problem then involves how we
characterize the consequences of such misplaced concreteness. While I
laud Meyer's stress on the complexity and immediacy of Steinian writing,
I think he is not fair to what Wittgenstein offers for our attributing
value to such work. In particular I want to challenge Meyer's claim that
Wittgenstein is himself so committed to theory that his thinking lacks any
middle ground between 
<B></B> 
instance and language game, and hence cannot get at
the rich singularity of particular paragraphings. For while Wittgenstein
does attack James for lacking the appropriate experimental method, he
is not proposing that such a method is possible, but simply criticizing
James for claiming the status of science for his research. Analogously,
while Wittgenstein does say that there can be a physiognomy of error,
he is careful not to extend that claim to any positive assertions that
there can be a physiognomy about human meanings. What Wittgenstein does
say turns out to be much closer to Stein and to help define the specific
orientation that her writing takes further than Wittgenstein himself does.

<P>
One cannot capture this link if one insists that Stein is a radical
empiricist. Rather one has to insist on the deep suspicion in both
Stein and Wittgenstein of any such philosophical positioning. Consider
Stein's statement that "Grammar does not consist in rain raining that
has nothing to do with expectation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 And recall how for
both Stein and Wittgenstein the positive force of writing becomes
its capacity to build upon the negative realization that abstract
categories like "emotion" or "reserve" or "singularity" or "identity"
rarely do any actual work. These categories are good for eliciting
slogans we can argue for, like "radical empiricism," but they cannot
get us a clear grasp of what we are arguing about or what we might gain
from our arguments. For that grasp, or, better, for moments when such
grasp seems almost attainable, Wittgenstein insists that the most his
writing can do is provide perspicuous representations, and Stein seems
to follow similar principles. Such representations are not singular in
any significant way. They do not refer to what might occur only once
nor is their mode of expression unique. What matters is their particular
process of becoming representative--not by the arguments proposed or the
human powers dramatized but simply by the distinctive angle of vision
the representations maintain in areas where our minds have become cramped
by remaining too long in what prove awkward and misleading postures.

<P>
I claim then that Meyer buys into a typical philosophical error in
his insistence that Stein realizes a particular vision of the world,
a radical empiricism, that Wittgenstein failed to accomplish. He may
not be wrong about how one might provide a philosophical translation of
Stein's accomplishment, but he is wrong to think that any translation into
specific philosophical positions will capture what most matters humanly
and hence philosophically in Stein's writing. And I claim further that
what he misses in Wittgenstein is precisely what now provides us the
best means we have of getting at this force in Stein's texts. This trait
in Wittgenstein is his way of not worrying about ideas like immediacy
because for him what matters is not any truth the writing possesses but
simply its power to develop a potential representativeness by virtue of
how it handles concrete details. (To call this concreteness "immediacy"
is to have to oppose it to mediation, yet there is little point to any
reflective enterprise that is not involved in mediating some significant
concerns.)

<P>
As my example of how such perspicuous representation uses concreteness
as its means of mediation I turn to Wittgenstein's reminder that it
"sound[s] queer to say: 'For a second he felt deep grief.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

Wittgenstein does not deny that we could produce 
<B></B> 
a context in which this
statement makes sense, and he does not insist that he has somehow captured
something immediate. He does invite us to realize that providing such
contexts or making such claims does little more than demonstrate how
clever the analyst is. The important self-reflexive task is managing
to keep what seems queer foregrounded without displacing its critical
and its projective force. Then we may be able to sneak past the borders
established by our habits to allow this queerness in effect to put those
habits on trial, and to indicate what they have been preventing us from
appreciating. The positive task of the writing is relational. Its force is
less in the immediacy it establishes than in the uses that this immediacy
seems to project so that we can self-reflexively balance between seeing
why we have not been able to see and registering further connections
that follow from the framing provided by this odd position.

<P>
In this case the perspicuous representation foregrounds two surprising
features within the grammar of certain emotions, features that
clarify why writing about the emotions requires a very complex sense of
mediation. First, as Meyer shows, this example dramatizes a temporality
for grief very different from the temporality of sensations (hence it
suggests basic limitations in the empiricism of the James-Lange theory of
the emotions). We cannot measure grief in seconds. Grief has a duration;
it involves a relation to other emotions from the past that binds us to
the object of grief and it involves projections into the future. Second,
we can begin to understand why there is a temptation to treat emotions as
if they were sensations. If we take the verb "feel" as part of a two-place
predicate, then we are likely to have to postulate some kind of force that
acts upon the subject so that the subject can respond with feeling. But
we are also then postulating psychological factors that are not really
evident in our experience of grief. It turns out to be more economical
and more precise to treat "feeling grief" as if it were a one-place,
intransitive expression. For if we examine our statements of grief we will
find that we do not set an independent subject over against some object
that he or she begins to feel. Instead our feeling takes the form of an
atmosphere or framing condition in which subject and object are not easily
distinguished, at least within the state of grieving. For analogies,
think of how logic cannot be identified apart from its manifestations
or happiness apart from its particular realizations. Hence in Steinian
terms feeling grief involves paragraphs, not sentences. The feeling is an
index of a direction in which we are oriented and of a framework within
which sentences can cohere. When we recognize the feeling we do not so
much identify a distinct mappable psychological state as project a way
of engaging the sentences another speaks that may allow us to continue
appreciating what they say and do without feeling we have lost our way.

<P>
The stakes for critical languages here are quite high. If Wittgenstein
is right, we have to accept an irreducible metaphoricity in our efforts
to create discursive frameworks for our experiences. This metaphoricity
is not Nietzschean. It makes as little sense to say that metaphoricity
is in fact the nature of language as it does to insist on an unequivocal
analytic standard for description in these domains. We need to acknowledge
metaphoricity because we cannot stand outside language to describe its
<B></B> 
nature, just as we cannot characterize the temporality of grief unless we
project ourselves into realms where we speculate on why sensations do not
provide the appropriate model. Thinking is a complex dance of negation and
indirect affirmation, with each activity delicately balancing first-order
direct perceptual relations to the world and second-order interpretive
expectations and reinterpretations. Wittgenstein's representation of grief
shares with Stein's writing the power of perspicuous representations
to fold these first- and second-order aspects of our grammars in ways
that enable us to appreciate the differences implicit in them and the
paths that become possible as we notice possible relations among these
differences. We come to understand why a language of sensations cannot
suffice, and we get a glimpse of how far we still have to go to replace
the overall rationalist and empiricist orientations we have inherited
from the Enlightenment as conditions of enlightenment.

<P>
Lezra has no illusions about immediacy. In this he is Meyer's
opposite. Yet the two critics share much more than, I suspect, they
suspect. This is in part because both base their interpretations on
established conceptual models and in part because both seem committed to
treading a very delicate line where the critic's brilliance becomes the
measure of the writer's value (or failure, when the critic's brilliance
seems the brighter instrument). There is no avoiding some version of
this equation between who the reader becomes in reading and how the
reader values texts, but there are ways of becoming more aware of the
dangers in this temptation to brilliance than either critic is (and
perhaps than Stein is at her most glib). And there is no avoiding Lezra's
brilliance, so criticism of his work must try to problematize precisely
that source of his strength. However, I also focus on his most intricate
claims because our seeing how these become problematic should help by
contrast to display the strange indirect forms of asserting positive
representativeness that is fundamental to Stein's and Wittgenstein's
investigations. Let me then treat two of Lezra's formulations as if they
were voiced by the interlocutor that Wittgenstein is constantly resisting:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
1. Does grammar provide the means by which "I" becomes one or another
thing--a grammarian, for example? Does the subject of "I am" precede
its grammatical articulation? Which pre-poses the other? [123]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. Difficulties with Stein's argument immediately surface. In what
way does the nonidentity to itself of grammar "make" anything, without
falling into [what Nietzsche calls] the "snare of language" [123]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Why do these statements require that resistance? I think they represent
the temptation in much philosophically oriented literary criticism to rely
on strings of problematic assertions, each asked to prop up the other. If
grammar were some kind of entity or determinable content, then it might
make sense to employ predicates like "nonidentity to itself." And if
grammar means rules of syntax, there would be clear boundaries enabling
one to specify what is part of its identity and what lies beyond it. But
for Wittgenstein's philosophical grammar and probably for Stein's notion
of grammar, these assertions will not do. Nonidentity must be as much a
part of grammar as identity, since we have to rely on language games to
determine either one. Analogously 
<B></B> 
we cannot get far speaking of the "snare
of language" as some general ontological condition because we cannot know
what the general opposite of language might be. There are many specific
snares within language, as Lezra shows superbly. But it does not help to
treat the source of the problem as language itself; nor are we likely to
escape the snare if we try to avoid language (since avoiding language
depends on linguistic representation for its significance). Snares and
escapes are both aspects of our language use, not to be escaped but to
be recognized as particular phenomena that arise from certain kinds of
language employed and misemployed in certain contexts. We realize that
we have encountered a snare by recognizing that our specific sentences
leave us no way to proceed intelligibly. But we also can realize within
language that we have managed to escape snares and to achieve a sense
of new permissions, as when we encounter Merleau-Ponty teaching us to
engage C&eacute;zanne.

<P>
These are not mere debating points. It is crucial that we recognize the
degree to which abstractions about language blind us to how we actually
live within it, as well as to how we might explore new conrations
adapting both the prison house and the kaleidoscope as necessary res
for self-reflection. And, more important here, resisting Lezra's
formulations seems to me to open intriguing speculative paths for
Stein criticism, especially in regard to his discussion of whether the
subject precedes its grammatical articulation. The separation of these
categories is problematic in itself because the very idea of a subject is
a grammatical one: what lies outside grammar may have many attributes,
but it cannot be a subject. But I find exciting the particular traps
that this line of thinking creates for Lezra, primarily because thinking
against his thinking seems to me to provide an opportunity to see what
is representative in some of Stein's richest ways of proceeding. Lezra
hopes to bring Hegelian ironies to bear against what he sees as Stein's
unwarranted faith in identity by calling attention to various aspects of
subjective agency like depersonalized drives that precede the grammatical
articulation of identities and cannot be articulated as determinate
features of such identities. But I will use his claims to indicate how
Stein develops a version of agency that simply cannot be approached
in the terms that Lezra wants to impose, and so the better that Lezra
can be seen as representing traditional philosophical imperatives, the
better the measure we have of Stein's originality, and of her relation
to Wittgenstein's experiments in the same vein (which I develop in my
<I>Subjective Agency</I>). And because Stein escapes those categories,
grappling with how she does stage subjective agency will also require
our relying on aspects of philosophical grammar that clearly do not
fit a pragmatist emphasis on established practices but instead requires
attending to how that grammar enables constant shifting among modes of
awareness and expression. As Stein put it, "On the edge of grammar is
why they make things" (<I>HW,</I> 109).

<P>
Lezra wants grammar to be reducible to those practices because then
he can sustain the Lacanian notion of the symbolic order as a texture
of repressions. But a brief analysis of one representative passage
should indicate why the conventional models of language and of the self
compatible with this hypothesis simply do not apply to the innovative
work of either Stein or Wittgenstein. Here is Stein: "I like the feeling
the 
<B></B> 
everlasting feeling of sentences as they diagram themselves. In
that way one is completely possessing oneself and incidentally one's
self."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Now Lezra on this statement: "'Diagraming sentences'
turns out not to be a case of what 'I' do, but itself the subject and
object of a 'doing' of which 'I' am the incidental product." 
Yet there is nothing in Stein's statement that refers to the "I" as a
product. But once Lezra equates self-possession with treating the "I" as a
product, he also has to read "incidental" as an adjective modifying that
product rather than as an adverb modifying the possessing. He sees that
the adverbial dimension may matter, but he does not have a perspective
from which he can develop the significance of his observation.

<P>
We can occupy this alternative perspective if we focus on what is
involved in this contrast between adjectival and adverbial readings
of "incidental." Indeed this expression can bear adverbial functions
precisely because the sense of self here need not be read as a product
but can instead be regarded as a force or modality that we recognize
simply in the way that it is woven into the incident--perhaps as that
which allows us to make a paragraph of the work of diagraming. From this
perspective the self is incidental only because it is not thematized, is
not specifiable within the diagram but nonetheless creates the site to
which we can attribute the pleasures involved. And then it makes sense
to claim that loss of self-consciousness as one gets absorbed within the
work of diagraming is not opposed to a sense of presence or conative
fullness. For the activity itself calls attention to how the actor is
contained within it and able to will that containment without having to
thematize the willing.

<P>
Stein's sentence then offers a version of subjectivity that we can treat
as incidental in time and co-incidental in space because self here is
not a product of any process: not thematized as idea and not torn between
seeing and doing, the self emerges as the condition of acting in a certain
way. There is no object to fix as self; there is nonetheless an agency
and a sense of investment that one locates simply in how the diagraming
manages to show signs of the person's presence within it. Therefore being
"incidentally oneself" is in no way what Lezra calls an agrammatical
mode of appearing that falls "outside a regulated or economized field of
effects" . Were there no grammar here, there could be no incidental
mode manifesting the person's relations to a clearly defined process. And
the "I" cannot be outside the effects of that process. Rather the "I"
is not reducible to the process. The "I" makes itself felt by how the
effects of the process are engaged in specific cases.

<P>
But how then do we know we are dealing with anything positive at all? Why
are the effects of these processes not entirely contingent? The best
answer I can give, and the best access to Stein on subjectivity, is
simply to invoke the forces brought into play by all the negatives I have
been using in order to hold off the cultural models informing Lezra's
approach to philosophical grammar. The "I" that I here assert takes what
substance it can have from its capacity to compose a way of negotiating
sites where many paths seem to cross. For Oedipus that locus was the
scene of tragedy. The hope shared by Stein and by Wittgenstein was that
this sense of tragedy could be understood as inseparable from his effort
to maintain a logic sharply distinguishing identity from nonidentity.

<p>
Although poets such as Elizabeth Bishop or May Swenson share Marianne
Moore's well known aversion to self-indulgent poetry, it is Moore's
unmatched ability to proffer moral standards without recourse to a
fleshy, lyric "I" that has made her, for feminist critics, the most
difficult and diversely read poet of this century. Grounding feminist
principle in autonomous self-definition, and the autonomous self in
female sexuality, the most vocal feminist critics of the past thirty
years have largely contributed to what Taffy Martin terms the "myth" of
Marianne Moore:
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 the popular conception of a self-protective,
well mannered eccentric who flirted coyly with her peers, dutifully went
to church, and wrote reticent poems with what Louise Bogan called "her
delightful innocence of approach."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 In some ways, of course,
Moore was all of these things; however, in search of autobiography,
political purpose, and sexual frankness, the majority of feminist critics
through the mid-1980s glossed over the intricate and often paradoxical
ways in which Moore was also none of these things at all. As Elizabeth
Bishop once wryly reminisced, Moore "was rather contradictory, you know,
illogical sometimes. . . . You could never tell what she was going to
like or dislike."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>


<P>
In the last ten years, several critics have sought to
remedy, or complicate, this portrait of Moore, but it lingers
tenaciously.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Undoubtedly this is due in part to Moore's
own cape-bedecked complicity in fostering this persona within the
public spotlight of her later life. Cristanne Miller notes that this
<B></B> 
stereotype of Moore was so firmly entrenched by midcentury that even her
close friend Bishop encouraged it, at least in part; Bishop's memoir,
"Efforts of Affection," and especially her poem "Invitation to Miss
Marianne Moore" frequently construct an "image of the poet as quaintly
harmless."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 At the same time, recent feminist scholarship on
Bishop often endorses, and thus inadvertently strengthens, the image of
Moore as archaically prim and private in an effort to position Bishop
as a different--namely autobiographical--poet.

<P>
Within Moore criticism, this myth appears, at once innocently and
insidiously, in readings that emphasize her observational prowess at the
expense of her moral and political integrity, or in analyses that describe
her difficult technique as self-protective armor, a "shield that [Moore]
constantly hides behind."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Moore's poems <I>are</I> marked by
stunning concrete descriptions and a shifting, restless, even reticent
"I," but to dismiss or praise her work as masked or object-oriented is
to ignore the biting satire and subversive coils of language that make
her work so radical, as both modernist and feminist. The power of Moore's
observations cannot be grasped in isolation from her refusal of the stable
lyric "I," for, as Swenson once asked, who "of us is able to be such an
acute instrument for the objectification of sensual perceptions and states
of mind as she, without emphasizing <I>self</I> as subject?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>


<P>
Swenson's question implies that it is exactly the tension created by
Moore's remarkably precise observations and her simultaneous undermining
of the "I"/eye from which they emanate that marks Moore's most puzzling,
and rewarding, poetic. That poetic, with its vital relevance to the
currently shifting parameters of American feminist criticism, is the focus
of this essay. In the following pages, I will draw from Moore's poetry
and archive to suggest that she developed a style of authorship based
on the self as <I>strategy,</I> an adjustable lens through which to view
the world without demanding a look in return. In an effort to establish
the contemporary currency of Moore's feminist method, I employ the work
of Donna Haraway and Judith Butler to show why Moore came to believe that

or, as Moore phrased it in 1955, "The self does not realize itself most
fully when self-realization is its most conscious aim."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

Exploring the implications of Moore's strategic selfhood, we will see
how her poetry deconstructs the lyric "I," and even more radically, the
sexed body through which this "I" is made to seem essential. Like the
glacial octopod in "An Octopus," Moore's restless eye is discernible
only at moments of intricately palpable existence, the slippery but
tenacious tentacles of sensual connection. As we are led through layer
after layer of material detail in Moore's poems, we are taken farther
astray from any sense of an a priori or ontological perspective: 
<B></B> 
"Completing a circle, / you have been deceived into thinking that
you have progressed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 In marking subjectivity by sensual
response rather than sexual convention, Moore asks that we loosen sensual
experience from the dictates of sexuality, and in doing so, reformulate
what it means to have both a sex and a self.

<P>

Moore's poems are perhaps most recognizable by their acutely
descriptive observations, a point made manifest in the great amount
of critical work devoted to this aspect of the poetry.

Miller suggests that Moore's love of science, particularly her fascination
with physics' recently popularized quantum theory, helps explain Moore's
angle on vision. "According to quantum theory, an object manifests
itself differently according to the context of the experiment in which
it is seen," so that for Moore redefining "clarity . . . dovetails with
redefining authority, both positive values for Moore but only to the
extent that clarity does not entail transparency and authority does not
rest on inflexible notions of identity and truth" (<I>QA,</I> 47). As an
avid biology student at Bryn Mawr, Moore contemplated a major in science
but settled on history and political science instead. Her lifelong
devotion to scientific precision is evident in her poems as well as
her prose: "Do the poet and the scientist not work analogously?" asked
Moore in an interview with Donald Hall; "[e]ach is attentive to clues,
each must narrow the choice, must strive for precision. . . . [S]cience
is the process of discovering. In any case it's not a thing established
once and for all, it's evolving."

<P>
Of course fascination with scientific perspective and analysis was
not unique to Moore; Ezra Pound used metaphors of scientific method to
elucidate his "new" poetics, as Eliot did after him.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The
early imagists, led by Pound, Richard Aldington, and H. D., unsuccessfully
sought Moore's membership, urged by what seemed a mutual affinity for
"[d]irect treatment of the 'thing.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Like her modernist
contemporaries, Moore's allegiance to empirical acuity was in tension
with a skepticism of objective vision. For Moore, though, this tension
produced a contingent and partial, yet always self-possessed, lyric
"I." The object of her observation "means just as much or just as
little as it is understood to / mean by the observer" (<I>P,</I> 17);
or, in Wallace Stevens's words, "no individual fact is a universe in
itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The experience of observation was consonant with
writing poetry; Moore's "I" was precise in its efforts to delineate its
debts, as the extensive notes and habits of quotation suggest.

Moore's passion for partial vision finds a fitting explication in Donna
Haraway's notion of "situated knowledge," a "practice of objectivity that
privileges contestation, deconstruction, passionate construction, webbed
connections, and hope for transformation of systems of knowledge and ways
of seeing," where "partiality and not universality is the condition of
being heard to make rational knowledge claims."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 A feminist
historian of science, Haraway takes to task both the standard claims to
scientific objectivity and popular academic attempts to discount the
necessity of some such effort, warning that "[f]or political people,
social constructionism cannot be allowed to decay into the radiant
emanations of cynicism" (<I>SC,</I> 184). At the same time, mirroring
Moore's distaste for movements, Haraway cautions against the temptation
to replace one doctrine of transcendence--scientific knowledge--with
another--marxism, psychoanalysis, "feminist empiricism" (<I>SC,</I>
186), or, Moore might add, the autonomous lyric "I":

to faithful accounts of a "real" world. . . . Feminists don't need a

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For Haraway "feminist objectivity" is opposed to the search for identity
and an understanding of the self as whole, since "only partial perspective
promises objective vision" (<I>SC,</I> 190). Because "the knowing self
is partial in all its guises" (<I>SC,</I> 193)--because, as Moore's
"gossamer-like"
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 associations suggest, we are constantly
being constructed through our interactions with the world--we are
always "stitched together imperfectly, and <I>therefore</I> able to
join with another, to see together without claiming to be another"
(<I>SC,</I> 193). Thus it is at the very nexus of accurate description
("the objectification of sensual perceptions and states of mind") and
acknowledgment of that description as partial and contingent ("without
emphasizing self as subject") that what Haraway terms accountability, or
what Moore might call moral responsibility, is made possible. Transforming
the world in which we live, a goal Moore never would have expressed as
such but one with which her ambitious sense of fairness and duty is akin,
is achieved not by transcendence, but through "conscious fastidiousness"
combined with "armor's undermining honesty."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 "The only
way to find a larger vision," asserts Haraway, "is to be somewhere in
particular" (<I>SC,</I> 196).

<P>
Haraway is instructive when it comes to Moore's poetry because she
makes clear the potential of partiality, the possibilities of the
particular. Moore's "messages," in other words, are contingent upon her
method: "We do not seek partiality for its own sake, but for the sake of
the connections and unexpected openings situated knowledges make possible"
(<I>SC,</I> 196). I cannot think of a more apt theoretical paradigm for
the workings of Moore's poetic. Her sentences and stanzas, like the sea
creatures in "The Fish," "slide each on the other,"

By recalling Foucault's explication of knowledge as produced rather than

 Apparently static and immovable, "defiant" in

the sea; its inorganic nature seems to claim omniscience and thus a kind
of a priori realness. But the incessant, wavelike motion of the poem
disrupts this vision of impermeability, as Moore's highly constructed
"edifice" is seen to embrace the sea, which "grows old in it" (<I>P,</I>

The tide of the poem, the motion of the speaker's vision, erodes
the stability of the edifice by introducing, then interlacing, the
particularities of its inhabitants; consequently the "defiance" of the
edifice becomes a life-giving embrace. The juxtaposition of rocklike
cliff and life-drenched sea is confounded as each becomes the agent of
the other. Importantly, the sea "cannot revive" the cliff's "youth," and
vice versa--innocence

is lost in the wake of unfinished, as opposed to an
a priori, meaning. No lyric "I"/eye transcends this poem, and as we come
to understand the cliff as changing after all, we also learn that Moore's
"objective," partial vision is most promising in its exposure of our own.

It is crucial to focus on the transformative potential of Moore's situated
knowledge and partial objectivity because this method of observation has
been misunderstood as apolitical, superficial, or distancing. Various
critics, feminist and otherwise, have interpreted Moore's observational
verse as deflective, warding off connection with its dazzling surface
sheen. Echoed by Moore's eclectic vocabulary, weblike network of notes and
quotations, unconventional rhymes, midword enjambments, and fastidious
manipulations of form, Moore's strategic selfhood has seemed to many
the hallmark of a self-protective distancing. I believe, however, that
Moore is after just the opposite; by offering a remarkably precise vision
of her surroundings and a concomitant undermining of the "I"/eye that
frames the environment, Moore proffers poetry as an ongoing process in
which meaning is made through interaction with an audience, rather than
simply presented. (In this light we can better understand Moore's almost
unparalleled dedication to revision.) Just as Moore's poems displace
the static lyric "I," so they reveal the extent to which the poet is
implicated by her strategy of selfhood. Moore's poems are often followed
with notes that, unlike Eliot's, do not direct the reader to a fuller
understanding of the poem by way of broader contextualization, but rather
point one outward, toward an ever widening pool of associations that may
or may not add any discernible "meanings" to the poem. In this case the
poem emerges as a starting-point, an occasion for interaction with the
world, rather than a conclusion garnered from the roamings of a poet's
"I"/eye.

<P>
All of this means that Moore expects her readers to <I>work.</I> At
the same time we can rest assured that the energy we put into enjoying
her poems is surpassed by that which she gave them herself: "the most
difficult thing for me," Moore confessed, "is to be satisfactorily
lucid, yet have enough implication in it to suit myself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

What may seem to be an abstruse foreclosure is in fact Moore's attempt
to connect the reader with a challenge--what she calls "implication." A
lover of riddles from a very young age, Moore often found explicitness
disrespectful. For this reason she felt that William Carlos Williams's
"uncompromising conscientiousness sometimes seems misplaced; he is
at times almost insultingly unevasive."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Miller puts it
nicely: "Moore does not see the 'self' as a refuge against a hostile
outer world and therefore does not imagine her most essential 'armor'
as that which protects her from others; the difficult surface of her
poetry is not meant to keep a reader out or to protect a vulnerable
private poet but to promote 'inquisitive intensity' and hence enable
perception" (<I>QA,</I> 38).
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 The act of revelation is what
Moore is after and, as she knows, a mapped epiphany is a contradiction
in terms. For Moore complexity, not transparency, yields clarity.

"obliqueness was a varia- / tion of the perpendicular, plain to see and

On one level Moore is clarifying the perpetually thorny issue of
"implication," showing that, when "not a crime," "complexity" is
achieved with precarious balance: it harbors "much that is peculiar" (and
therefore much of the material of Moore's verse), 
<B></B> 
while simultaneously
avoiding "murkiness," "insistence," and the fallacy that "truth must
be dark." Complexity must allow itself to be the "pestilence that it
is." Clearly, complexity here is a challenge, even a burden, to be
confronted and perhaps even cured; when something is a pestilence
it nags, begging for attention, whether as an itch or an unsolved
problem. Complexity becomes "a crime," though, when it shuts people
out, when it attempts to "bewilder" and makes grandiose claims about
"truth" being "dark." Though the Adamic days of "prismatic color" were
free from murkiness, they were also void of the difference that engenders
complexity--both kinds. And as Moore's poetics repeatedly suggest, the
risk of "murkiness" is better than no risk at all.

<P>
Introduced as a kind of fairy-tale ideal of clarity, Adam's Eveless Eden
thus emerges as rather a bore--an opinion whose complicated profits are
manifested four years later in the brilliant achievement of "Marriage." In
a reading diary from which Moore worked when composing "Prismatic Color,"
she copied down a translated passage from Baudelaire's "Anywhere Out
of the World" that may further explain this sense of transparency as
tedium. Baudelaire is having a conversation with his enervated soul about
new places to live, trying to address his insatiable desire to be wherever
he is not. After a series of unsuccessful attempts at provocation, he
exclaims, "Let us set up our camp at the Pole! There the sun strikes the
earth obliquely and the slow alteration of light and night suppresses
variety and increases monotony--that better half of nothing." At this,
his soul finally "[breaks] forth" and "wisely" cries: "No matter where,
no matter where, so long as it is out of the world!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Given
the reference to "antipodes" in the penultimate stanza of "In the Days
of Prismatic Color" and "obliqueness" in the second, the connection
between Moore's poem and this passage is likely. Furthermore, Moore
uses the word "oblique" in the same way that the translated Baudelaire
does--not as the popularized term for "indirection" or "deviousness,"
but to delineate a sloping angle, a "varia- / tion of the perpendicular"
("ID," 49). But what is, in Moore's poem, "plain to see and / account
for" is, in Baudelaire, that which "suppresses variety," causing
"prolonged baths of shadow."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 The difference here lies
between Baudelaire's grounding in this world of complexity (to which
his soul's cry attests), and Moore's grounding in the Adamic land of
fantastical clarity; obliqueness can only seem plain when the word
"plain" itself has no meaning--when, in other words, there is nothing
but more plainness with which to compare it.

<P>
Miller suggests that the ideal days of clarity and color in Moore's
poem are an illusion, and that truth for Moore is found in the region of
"negation, contradiction, and modification, all verbal characteristics
in distinct contrast to Adamic language or Lacan's symbolic, with
its representation in the law" (<I>QA,</I> 82). I agree with Miller
that the progress of Moore's poem subverts the ideality with which it
ostensibly opens; after all, "[w]hat is more precise than precision"
but "[i]llusion"?
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 But what is so clever about this poem
is the way Moore subtly insists that this illusion is a product of our
own complexities. 
<B></B>

<P>
Reviewing the first stanza of the poem, we can see that the "fineness"
of the "days of prismatic color," recognizable as such "with nothing
to modify" it, is in fact constantly being modified --more clearly
than any other element of the poem--by the series of qualifications in
which it is couched. Indeed, our vision of this unmodified "fineness" is
actually produced by a succession of modifications: it is the fineness
"not in the days of Adam and Eve but when Adam / was alone" ("ID,"
49), "not . . . the fineness / of early civilization art" but fine
in its "originality." Moore's method of description thus contests the
possibility of the "days of prismatic color" just as she writes it into
the poem. At the same time, the halting effect of the first stanza's
numerous modifications is recalled in the "short-legged, fit- / ful
advance, the gurgling and all the minutiae" ("ID," 49) of the penultimate,
so that Adamic clarity becomes, in review, the double of complexity--not
the good kind, but the bad. Likewise, as the speaker moves from clarity
to "complexity" in the third stanza, the mood becomes decidedly more
declarative; phrases become shorter, no-nonsense: "it is no / longer
that," "complexity is not a crime," "it is also one of // those things"
("ID," 49). Ironically, what seemed so "plain" and up-front is the
epitome of obliquity after all.

<P>
At the end of the fourth stanza, Moore presents "sophistication,"
presumably in contrast to the earlier days of color and clarity, as that
which is

<P>
Juxtaposed with the apparent evolution from clarity to complexity--an
evolution that is, by this point in the poem, undermined by its own
"insistence"--"sophistication," in its age-old sameness, seems to be
what has been there all along. This is a stunning assertion on Moore's
part, given the "initial great truths" that open the poem--the story
of Adam and Eve and the Fall. Sophistication, then, is the result of
complexity, while the "initial great truths" are an illusion. But in
the process of differentiating sophistication from prismatic plainness,
the distance between the "initial great truths" that open the poem and
the illusion of clarity is elided: in search of clarity, we construct
"initial great truths" that claim, tautologically, they are the key to
their own construction. But in reality--the version of truth that ends
the poem by assuring us, as "sophistication" might, that "'I shall be
there when the wave has gone by'" ("ID," 50)--there is no such thing
as clarity, and to claim otherwise is to be duped into believing that
there once were days of only "fine" prismatic color.

<P>
It is now clear that Moore is making a parallel between the illusory
nature of our "initial great truths" and the story of Eve's fall. In
light of Moore's religious convictions this may seem unlikely, but given
her love of complexity and challenge, combined 
<B></B> 
with an unmistakable--if
sometimes subtle--distaste for masculinist presumption, it is actually
quite apt. Not only is Moore contesting the authority or "plainness"
of this mythic truth, but redeploying its very terms, constructing a
different truth, one that quietly but confidently ends the poem by
asserting its endurance. According to the story of the Fall, Eve's
introduction to the Garden of Eden summoned the end of innocence; by
eating the forbidden apple, Eve ushered in the world of knowledge, and
hence, enslavement and mortality. But Moore's poem mocks the innocence,
the clarity, that the Adamic "days of prismatic color" purport to have
offered. As in her later poem "Marriage," when Adam

Moore rejects nostalgia and celebrates complexity, the passion of
knowledge, and thus Eve's fall. Having chosen the myth of her native
culture most squarely concerned with heterosexual difference, Moore's
revisionist version should be read accordingly: it is the advent of women
in the poem that enables the complexity of which the poem itself is an
example. Clearly, the genesis of sexual difference and its relationship to
our "initial great truths" are at the core of Moore's thoughts in "In the
Days of Prismatic Color." However, it is crucial to remember that Moore
is most interested here in <I>complexity,</I> not women, and according
to the script of this poem, complexity would not exist in an Adamless
Eden any more than it would in an Eveless one. Most importantly, if
"the days of prismatic color" are indeed an illusion of our own making,
a making precipitated by the interaction of women and men, then nobody
is innocent--least of all Moore.

Understanding Moore's commitment to complexity as an invitation to
participate in the process of her poems is key to comprehending the
feminist tenor of her work. All poetry functions to a certain extent by
allowing readers to confront the limited terms of their selves, but Moore
invites a participation quite unlike that of her peers. In refusing the
parallel positions of either omniscience or innocence, Moore's strategic
selfhood imparts a remarkable <I>agency</I> to her readers. Within her
poems this sense of agency is most evident in the way Moore privileges
the animals, plants, objects, and scenes of which she writes rather
than her own perspective of them. Nevertheless, Moore has no truck with
a nostalgic view of nature; the world she 
<B></B> 
observes is wholly contingent
upon her framing of it. Again we are led to the tension between Moore's
partial "I" and her intensely detailed observations. Haraway can help us
to understand this methodology when she writes that "[s]ituated knowledges
require that the object of knowledge be pictured as an actor and agent,
not a screen or a ground or a resource, never finally as slave to the
master that closes off the dialectic in his unique agency and authorship
of 'objective' knowledge" (S<I>C,</I> 198). Simultaneously, "[a]ccounts
of a 'real' world do not . . . depend on a logic of 'discovery,' but on
a power-charged social relation of 'conversation.' The world neither
speaks itself nor disappears in favour of a master decoder. The codes
of the world are not still, waiting only to be read" (<I>SC,</I> 198).

<P>
The implications of this perspective on one's understanding of bodily
existence are particularly profound for feminism; if neither one's own
knowledge nor the outside world from which that knowledge is gleaned
has authority over the other, the distance between the two--one's
sense of inner and outer--is displaced. (It is amusing to note that
in 1906 Moore wrote home announcing she'd failed a biology quiz for
giving an external diagram of the grasshopper and lobster instead
of an internal one).
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 From this vantage point the body
becomes inextricably wed to its surroundings; fish are buoyed by the
sea in which they live, a chameleon feeds upon the light that paints
its skin. Moore's explorations of embodiment find current expression
in Haraway's cyborg, a fusion of human, animal, and machine, a being
"wary of holism, but needy for connection" (<I>SC,</I> 151), who has an
"intimate experience of boundaries, their construction and deconstruction"
(<I>SC,</I> 181). In the cyborg world, "[n]ature and culture are reworked;
the one can no longer be the resource for appropriation or incorporation
by the other. The relationships for forming wholes from parts, including
those of polarity and hierarchical domination, are at issue in the cyborg
world" (<I>SC,</I> 151).

<P>
"Black Earth" offers an early and telling confrontation of these issues
that lie at the heart of Moore's poetic--perhaps too telling, for Moore
never republished it after the poem appeared as "Melancthon" in her
<I>Collected Poems</I> of 1952. "Melancthon" ("black earth" in Greek)
is the name of the Protestant reformer Philip Melancthon, famous for
his distaste for theological dogmatism and subsequent importation of
humanism to the German reformation. (Moore had a windup toy elephant named
Melancthon as well.) In light of this later title, Martin has written that
"'Melancthon' addresses quite specifically the difficult and yet obvious
necessity of acknowledging another's perspective while remaining oneself"
(<I>SM,</I> 19). To this I would add that Moore also asks what it means
to <I>be</I> a self in relation to another's perspective. Moreover, the
most striking characteristic of "Black Earth" is its sensual immediacy;
as in "A Jellyfish" , "My Senses Do Not Deceive Me" , and
the later "An Octopus" , questions of identity are very clearly
questions of embodiment throughout the poem.

The relationship between the lyric "I" and material existence is

This speaker, one of the most unabashedly self-indulgent in Moore's
repertoire, "openly" declares its love of sensuous experience: "Now I
breathe and now I am sub/merged." The rhythm of the speaker's voice is
mesmerizing, so that we too are lulled into the languid pleasures of
sensual immersion. Indeed, the "I" with which this poem so emphatically
begins is only known to us through its bodily contact with the world
it inhabits--

<P>
Although the speaker suggests an essence that has been "there to
begin / with," somehow preexisting the "patina of circumstance" that
encrusts its joints, the fusion of river-bed and body undermines any
such possibility--were one to "do away / with it [the sediment of river]
. . . I [would be] . . . done away with" (<I>P,</I> 10). Suitably, the
speaker's body is red as its map: "This elephant skin / which I
inhabit, . . . is a manual for the peanut-tongued and the / hairy toed"
(<I>P,</I> 10)--literally a guide to <I>itself.</I> "[F]ibred <I>[sic]</I>
over like the shell of / the coco-nut," "cut into checkers by rut /
upon rut of unpreventable experience" (<I>P,</I> 10), the elephant's
skin bears the history of its experience, that which has engendered its
very being. Surroundings and selfhood, outer and inner, are collapsed,
and the utterance of "I" appears as "natural" as the alligator's swagger.

<P>
But even cursory familiarity with Moore asks that we examine such
self-indulgence; when we look closely it becomes clear that the
hippopotamus and alligator are exemplars of "naturalness" (<I>P,</I>
10) because they are not aware of themselves as such. In contrast, the
speaker's "I" is drenched in self-consciousness, and its attempt at
naturalness ("I do these / things which I do") becomes a parody of its
own self-confidence. 
<B></B> 
Indeed, as the poem progresses, the comfortable
"I" of the first few stanzas becomes increasingly unstable; as soon as
the speaker specifies its body as an elephant's, the narrative voice
shifts from an unmediated first- to a strangely detached third-person
voice, referring to itself no longer as "I" but as one of the generic
"peanut-tongued and . . . / hairy toed." The elephant/speaker's easy
existence is interrupted as it begins to question its own assertions:

<P>

Whether or not Moore intended here to invoke an understanding of bodies
as racially marked, her interrogation of embodied selfhood certainly
demands it. "[C]ut / into checkers by rut / upon rut of unpreventable
experience," one is, of course, constructed <I>as</I> a body, mapping
not only one's self, but also the "history of power." The ecstasy of
sensuous experience that opens the poem thus becomes tempered, as the
body itself is "checker[ed]" by experience; the elephant, by stanza
nine, is now "on [its] guard" (<I>P,</I> 10).

<P>
The second half of the poem (at seventeen stanzas this is the longest poem
Moore had written by the time of its 1918 publication) enacts a different
approach than the first, turning upon the relationship between embodiment
and intellection. Exactly halfway through the poem, the elephant tells
us that

but that "nevertheless," it "perceives feats of strength to be
inexplicable after / all" (<I>P,</I> 10). As the elephant becomes
conscious of its embodied vision (its partial perspective), the easy
union of body and speaking "I" turns elastic, more interactive than
fused. Simultaneously, the unity of the poem and the lyric "I" begins to
crumble when selfhood becomes an object of contemplation as a potential
strategy rather than a foundation for expression. Immersion in one's
self gives way to observation--

--then judgment: "I see / and I hear" (<I>P,</I> 11), says the
elephant. This hearing, though, is not like "the / wandlike body of which
one hears so much, which was made / to see and not to see; to hear and not
to hear" (<I>P,</I> 11). Contemplating the contingency between identity
and observation (Moore's primary concern), the speaker compares the
"wandlike" human, the marker of "external poise," to its

and assertively concludes the "I of each is to // the I of each, / a kind
of fretful speech / which sets a limit on itself" (<I>P,</I> 11). Egoism,
or "pride" (<I>P,</I> 11), does not enhance one's reach, but truncates it.

<P>
Technically, the "I of each"--the "pride" behind "external poise"--refers
to the human and coral, and not the elephant/speaker. But the close
repetition of "I"'s within the speaker's warning cannot help but
recall the emphatic "I" of the elephant that so heavily marked the poem
until now. Moreover, as if to contest the limit of this insistent "I,"
the narrative voice again immediately shifts to third person, asking
ironically what "the elephant is" (<I>P,</I> 11). The final three stanzas
of the poem are a labyrinthine answer to this question; the speaker
is no longer distinct as elephant, human, coral plant, or omniscient
"I," but exists as a fleeting interaction of them all:

<P>

The "it," the subject of this sentence, seems to be at once the elephant,

But <I>what</I> above formation? A "kind of

there is an answer to this question, that there is sense--literally--in
this concluding grid of metonymic metaphors, we are told that "it /
. . . is still / here; the name means thick." But as it happens, the
key to understanding lies in this confusion, in what Moore would call
"complexity": depth is depth, thick skin is thick, only to those who see
unreason under it. In other words, truth is more likely to be found in
the messy "patina of circumstance" than in "the days of prismatic color."

The emphatic "I" that begins "Black Earth," unmediated and whole,
gives way by the end to a radically unfixed voice no longer linked to a
self. Bonnie Costello writes that at this point "the self has become an
expansive term transcending discrete identity. . . . [It] incorporat[es]
the entirety of the world, physical and spiritual, rather than simply the
perimeters of the self."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 In other words, the distinction
between inside and outside has been collapsed. This process does not
enable omniscience or pure objectivity, however, because, continues
Costello, "the self that manipulates language is only a small part
of the totality it ponders. Like the six blind men of Buddhist legend
who were asked to describe the elephant, Moore can only name it part
by part."

<P>
Judith Butler's work on language and embodiment is helpful in
understanding this juncture in Moore's poetry between body and self, as
well as its implications for notions of subjectivity. Writing about the
culturally mediated "nature" of our bodies, Butler argues that

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
"Inner" and "outer" make sense only with reference to a mediating boundary
that strives for stability. And this stability, this coherence, is
determined in large part by cultural orders that sanction the subject
and compel its differentiation from the abject. Hence, "inner" and
"outer" constitute a binary distinction that stabilizes and consolidates
the coherent subject. When that subject is challenged, the meaning and
necessity of the terms are subject to displacement. If the "inner world"
no longer designates a topos, then the internal fixity of the self
and, indeed, the internal locale of gender identity, become similarly
suspect.

<P>
Given the blatant collapse between environment and inner self that begins
"Black Earth," we can understand the progressively troubled lyric "I"
of the poem as entirely logical. Concurrently, the "I" of the opening
stanzas, brazen in its collapse of environment and self, may be read
retrospectively as anything but natural; the speaker's initial ability to
gesture toward a "self" so surely seems almost comically self-conscious,
akin to those unenlightened who cannot see the "element of beautiful
unreason under it." 
<B></B>

<P>
This is, of course, another instance of Moore's strategic selfhood,
another angle of her situated knowledge. The most provocative aspect
of both Butler's formulation and Moore's "Black Earth," though, is the
troubled place the body occupies in terms of the unfixed lyric "I." As
both Butler and Moore suggest, the illusion of autonomous selfhood is
grounded in, or naturalized in regard to, the actual body. The speaker
of Moore's poem announces itself "openly," with all the "naturalness"
in the world, through the contours of its flesh: "Now I breathe and
now I am sub- / merged." Moore's poem, however, is a warning against
the limitations of that wallowing "I"; hence, the body as a foundation
for that "I" is also questioned. By the end of the poem, the speaker
floats among myriad metaphors of bodily existence: "translucent like
the atmosphere--a cortex merely-- / that on which darts cannot strike
decisively." Materiality still exists--"substance" "is still / here"--but,
unleashed from a fretful dialectic with the declarative "I," its reach
is significantly extended. The trade-off, as I have suggested, is the
"I" that is lost at the end of the poem. As Butler explains, "coherence is
. . . an effect of a corporeal signification. . . . [A]cts, gestures, and
desire produce the effect of an internal core or substance, but produce
this <I>on the surface</I> of the body, through the play of signifying
absences that suggest, but never reveal, the organizing principle of
identity as a cause."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Which is to say that one's physical
experience, though it is always from one's perspective, is not any less
mediated or any more innocent than the "self" that grounds itself there.

<P>
From such a vantage point, the body, like Haraway's cyborg, cannot be
understood as contained or passive. Instead, much like Moore's poems, it
is a continual process, marked by but not moored in its contingency with
the world it inhabits. The hierarchical relationship between body and
intellect is undermined: selfhood depends upon the sensual perceptions
of the body, but at the same time it cannot take refuge in, or find
legitimization through, the mutating dimensions of the flesh. In this
way we have come full circle. What began for Moore as a strategy of
selfhood has become a strategy of embodiment. Though Moore constantly
insists on the primacy of sensual experience within her poems, she also
shows perception to be a highly mediated means to knowledge. The notion
of a stable materiality, then, is not a priori to the perceptions it
enables, but is, in fact, like Melancthon's, a product of one's own
desire to ground one's "self."

<P>
This insight is both disturbing and exciting, and lies at the heart
of Moore's discomfort with sexually explicit and gender-specific
poetry. For if Moore's poetic asserts a mistrust of bodily "truth,"
then it simultaneously contests the sexed body as a viable foundation
for political <I>or</I> aesthetic agency. This conviction is ferociously
etched into the stylized portraiture of "Those Various Scalpels," a poem
Moore published in 1917, one year before "Black Earth." The speaker of
this poem itemizes with a majestic violence the various body parts of a
fantastic, ornately dressed woman, emphatically drawing our attention
to the constructed nature of her materiality.

At the same time, though, I would argue that "systemic reduction" is

Indeed, we should not overlook the fact that Moore's portrait is produced
by a poem whose stylistic structures draw as much attention to their own
constructedness as they do to the lady herself. Like the various parts of
the woman, the stanzas of the poem are highly irregular in shape, yet, as
is almost always the case with Moore's work, they are "consistently" so,
emphasizing the connection between artifice and autonomy, or repetition
and construction. For "construction," maintains Butler,

is neither a subject nor its act, but a process of reiteration by which
both "subjects" and "acts" come to appear at all. . . . Crucially, then,
construction is neither a single act nor a causal process initiated by
a subject and culminating in a set of fixed effects. Construction not
only takes place <I>in</I> time, but is itself a temporal process which
operates through the reiteration of norms; [the] sex[ed body] is both
produced and destabilized in the course of this reiteration.

Moore blatantly appropriates the Renaissance convention of portraying
a female beloved through an itemization of body parts, fantastically
exaggerating her own descriptions in an attempt to expose what Moore
calls the "inflection"--the gaps between Butler's "reiterations"--that
is usually "disguised" by such conventional poetics. In other words,
Moore's material reductions call attention to the sexed body as a process
of inscription. The poem wields "those various scalpels," whose "sounds
[are] consistently indistinct, like intermingled / echoes / struck from
thin glass successively at random." The sharp metallic clash of the
speaker's descriptions--a series of hard <I>C</I>s, piercing <I>S</I>s,
stony <I>D</I>s and <I>T</I>s--"echoes" the sound of scalpel on scalpel,
steel on steel. These sounds are clearly punctuated by stanzaic breaks,
halting enjambments, and lines ending midword, so that each echo is
unraveled from the other, even as each sound is rendered emphatically
distinct. This effect is mirrored by the dissection the poem enacts:
each body part is lavishly described through a metaphor that shares no
continuity with the next, a metaphor so elaborate in its associations
that moving from one to the other is like leaving behind an unfinished
story in order to start another. As we are led from "ting-cocks" to
"the cordage of disabled / ships" to "emeralds from / Persia," we are
introduced to a body whose only mark of coherence is her "hard majesty of
. . . sophistication," that which is "su- / perior to opportunity"--her
steely powers of deflection. Unlike conventional poems of this sort,
there is no recourse to totality through either a final image of integrity
or the grounding of a lover's lyric "I." Instead, the poem's "surgery,"
though clearly not "tentative," is no less "ambiguous" in its discovery
than the woman's raised hand; 
<B></B> 
"[a]re they weapons or scalpels?" Does this
dissection yield a more precise understanding of an interior state, or
does it ward off closer inspection?

<P>
Given the title and the weaponlike feel of the poem's imagery, this
question is (typically) misleading. The tools of dissection--the
speaker's gaze, the dialectic of subject/object through which identity
is formed--are both scalpels and weapons; in Butler's words, they
both "produce" and "destabilize" the woman's embodiment. Thus, her
ornate, larger-than-life appearance is "uniform / and at the same time,
diverse." As Heuving has implied, the emphasis here is on the process,
not the product, of construction. In effect, the speaker dissects its own
actions just as it depicts the woman; for this reason the poem, despite
its efforts, cannot provide a coherent image. Similarly, its final turn,
the question upon which the poem closes, must be read as ironic:

<P>

<P>
The parallel positions in the poem of "destiny" and the woman's body
(both are objects of dissection) suggest that they are one and the same,
that the woman's destiny is traced by her anatomy. In light of the use of
the word "tissues" instead of Moore's later revision to "components of
destiny" (<I>CP,</I> 52), this reading seems all the more accurate. But
as this poem elaborately reiterates, the woman's body is both created
and dislodged by the speaker's address; hence, an embodied destiny is
less "highly specialized" than the "instruments" by which it is shaped,
precisely because in its promise of ontological plenitude such "destiny"
is an illusion, a wry commentary suitably expressed without recourse
to a single gendered pronoun. Appropriately, the metaphors through
which the woman's body is established do not coalesce into some kind
of intractable casing, but rather deliver her beyond corporeal limits
and national borders, to Persia, Florence, "French ch&acirc;teaux," and
shipwreck sites. At the same time, it is her weaponlike body--her hair
like "ting-cocks" or "scimitars," her eyes like "flowers of ice,"
her cheeks "rosettes / of blood," her hand a "bundle of lances"--that
resists feminization, deflecting the speaker's gaze back to itself,
ultimately blurring the distinction between subject and object, gazer
and gazed-upon; throughout the poem, as with the whole of Moore's oeuvre,
it is the speaker's "self" who has been "consistently indistinct."

In <I>Bodies That Matter</I> , Butler explores the consequences for
feminism of an antifoundational view of bodily materiality, observing,
as Moore's poetics did nearly ninety years ago, that although "sexual
difference is often invoked as an issue of material differences," it
"is never simply a function of material differences which are not in some
way both marked and formed by discursive practices" (<I>BM,</I> 1). Often 
<B></B>
criticized as asexual, Moore has been largely misunderstood. Moore was,
on the contrary, fascinated by the "discursive practices" and cultural
markings that make up sex to begin with--the notions of bodily truth and
the autonomous self that roots itself there. By refusing the material
irreducibility of the sexed body, her poetics undermine the popular
distinction between gender and sex, suggesting that the latter is a
product of the former, and its antecedent: if "gender is the social
construction of sex," explains Butler, "and if there is no access to
this 'sex' except by means of its construction, then it appears not only
that sex is absorbed by gender, but that 'sex' becomes something like a
fiction, perhaps a fantasy, retroactively installed at a prelinguistic
site to which there is no direct access" (<I>BM,</I> 5). For Moore, to
ground one's politics, one's "self," or one's poetry within something
called female sexuality or female experience is to have been "deceived
into thinking that you have progressed." At the same time, Moore's own
life choices make it clear that an antifoundational approach to issues of
sexuality and selfhood does not foreclose the possibility of committed
political action; Moore was an avid suffragist throughout her years in
college and in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and continued to advocate women's
rights throughout her life. Nevertheless, by rejecting the sexed body
as a password, stamp of authenticity, or site of truth, Moore asks us
to review the ground upon which feminist poetics have traditionally been
recognized as such.

also idem, "Portrait of a Writing Master: Beyond the Myth of Marianne
Moore," in <I>Twentieth Century Literature</I> 30 (summer-fall

'the particular strength' that chastity confers, she writes from direct
experience" (Suzanne Juhasz, <I>Naked and Fiery Forms: Modern American
Poetry By Women</I> [New York: Harper and Row, 1976], 4). More recently,
Joanne Feit Diehl argues that Moore's poetic "reinforces a disengagement
of affect from voice. Moore's poetry displays the absence of eros and its
attending desires" (Joanne Feit Diehl, <I>Elizabeth Bishop and Marianne
Moore: The Psychodynamics of Creativity</I> [Princeton, N. J.: Princeton
University Press, 1993], 46), while Jeanne Larsen describes Moore's
poems as having the "appearance of neutered chastity" (Jeanne Larsen,
"Lowell, Teasdale, Wylie, Millay and Bogan," in <I>The Columbia History
of American Poets,</I> ed. Jay Parini and Brett C. Millier [New York:

Charles Molesworth, for instance, writes that Moore's work is "an
intimate modernism, almost precious, but redeemed from mere preciocity by
great skill and moral balance" (Charles Molesworth, "Moore's Masterpiece:
<I>The Pangolin</I>'s Alternating Blaze," in <I>Marianne Moore: Woman
and Poet,</I> ed. Patricia C. Willis [Orono, Maine: National Poetry
Foundation, 1990], 95). To his credit Molesworth does give important
insight into Moore's persona that directly challenges this "myth,"
particularly with regard to her early suffrage activities; see his
<I>Marianne Moore: A Literary Life</I> (New York: Atheneum, 1990). See

Daniel L. Guillory makes the argument that Moore's poetry,
specifically "her celebration of the hard, technological reality of things
surpasses that of her male contemporaries because she possesses a far
more technological <I>mind</I> than any of them" (Daniel L. Guillory,
"Marianne Moore and Technology," in <I>Marianne Moore,</I> ed. Willis,

concludes that Moore's poetic is "not altogether different from Frank
Lloyd Wright's use of exposed beams or unpainted and naturally oxidized
surfaces" .

Though no gendered pronouns are used in this poem to denote its
re's sex, Moore's mother, Mary Warner Moore, wrote a letter to Mary
Shoemaker on 21 April 1925 in which she briefly described the part of "the
lady's" hair in "Those Various Scalpels." I thank Dr. Evelyn Feldman at
the Rosenbach Museum and Library for drawing my attention to this letter
(a portion of which I read transcribed in Feldman's own notes). For
this reason, along with what I consider to be Moore's appropriation of
the Renaissance convention in which a female beloved is named through
the itemization of her body parts, I take the re of this poem to be
a woman.

During the earliest and most severe years of the Great Depression,
from 1930 to 1931, migrant laborers from Georgia to North Carolina
followed word of employment to work-camps near the mouth of a hydro
tunnel in the mountains of West Virginia. One of a series of massive
hydroelectric projects launched during the 1920s and 1930s, this
three-mile conduit had been licensed to divert water from the New
River to a nearby power plant, generating "white coal" for both public
and commercial use.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 From its inception in 1924, however,
Hawk's Nest Tunnel had been intended not as a public utility, but as
a power source for a new electrometallurgical complex--one owned by
Union Carbide and Carbon, the corporate entity that had commissioned
the tunnel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 With metallurgic processing apparently in mind,
engineers and geologists had plotted the tunnel to run through veins
of ninety-seven to ninety-nine percent pure silica.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 During
construction, these highly refined mineral concentrations were extracted
and sold to the Electro-Metallurgical Company for use in processing
steel. Large sections of the tunnel, those that contained the richest
deposits, had been widened to maximize profits from in-house transactions
(<I>HC,</I> 20, 27, 66). Licensed as a public utility, Hawk's Nest Tunnel
had been drilled as a silica mine.
<P>
Illicit dry-drilling practices, said to be three times faster than
drilling with water, sped the project toward completion, foreclosing
a possible shutdown by the Federal Power Commission (<I>HC,</I>
4-5, 59-62, 66). Coupled with substandard ventilation and
the contractor's failure to issue respirators to workers, high velocity
drilling had aggravated what industry specialists knew to be a dangerous
enterprise. During an epoch 
 
when displaced southern agricultural
workers found themselves vulnerable to industrial exploitation, racist
divisions of labor facilitated the reckless construction of an "oddly
obscure" landmark that still stands as a "marvel of engineering prowess"
(<I>HN,</I> 1, 22). Of the 2500 men who worked the tunnel's interior
between 1930 and 1931, a small percentage were white-coal miners and
laborers from the nearby town of Gauley Bridge. African Americans,
most of them emigrants from southern coastal states, made up eighty
percent of this low-paid work force; and they composed an even larger
majority of the tunnel's drillers, nippers, and muckers, workers whose
proximity to the drilling-face treated them to the highest concentrations
of silica dust.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 While it is still not known how many black
workers were killed by their exposure to the Gauley Bridge tunnel, it was
clear to many by the mid-1930s that a large number may have succumbed to
industrial disease. Living in segregated, company-owned work camps, and
earning subsistence-level wages, black migrant workers in particular
lacked the resources to resist hazards that resulted in close to 600
deaths.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
<P>
In late 1935, with rumors of mass graves in West Virginia now circulating
in the national press, the New York congressman and labor advocate Vito
Marcantonio called for an investigation into allegations of corporate
negligence in the suspected silicosis deaths at Gauley Bridge.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
A group of doctors, journalists, and former tunnel workers arrived
in Washington to testify in early 1936. At the congressional hearings
mandated by House Joint Resolution 449, a silicotic bench driller named
George Robison was asked to testify regarding the working conditions in
and around Hawk's Nest Tunnel. Robison spoke of threats and beatings
used by white foremen to coerce black workers back into the mountain
after interval dynamite blasts. Reentering the bore within minutes of
each shoot, teams of muckers and drillers could see only with difficulty
through a white haze of silica (<I>HC,</I> 58, 67). As work resumed
at the head, accelerated rounds of dry drilling forced fresh jets of
mineral straight back into the faces of workers. Pails of drinking water
carried into the shaft looked like buckets of milk. In describing the
deathly white residue that coated the tunnel's interior as well as the
"flour-sprinkled" woods around its mouth, Robison treated the white
congressional committee to an unsettling image. "As dark as I am,"
Robison told the committee chairman, "when I came out of that tunnel in
the mornings, if you had been in the tunnel too and come out at my side,
nobody could have told which was the white man. The white man was just
as black as the colored man" (<I>HC,</I> 67).
<P>
Previous federal and state trial testimony had referred to workers
lightened rather than darkened by their exposure to the dust in Hawk's
Nest Tunnel, and Robison himself had so far spoken only literally of the
whitening effects of silica (<I>HC,</I> 4, 37-8; <I>HN,</I> 46). Yet
none of the white congressmen questioning the former tunnel worker asked
Robison how a white man could be blackened by white dust. Untenable
as literal description, the image of workers blackened by silica was a
metaphor driven by tacit racial conventions. In an essay published in
1925 in Alaine Locke's anthology <I>The New Negro,</I> Jessie Fauset
described the deeply ingrained racial codes that restricted African
American contributions to drama. "There is an unwritten law in America,"
Fauset wrote, "that though white may imitate black, black . . . must never
<B></B> 
imitate white."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Fauset's observation that "grease-paint may
be used to darken but never to lighten" refers to the racial dynamics
of caricature; but a black witness such as Robison would have risked
breaching these conventions--laws that licensed blackness to whites,
withholding whiteness from blacks--by illustrating the lightening effects
of industrial contaminants. Barred from painting himself the color of
his superiors, Robison chose to switch the black-and-white terms of his
congressional testimony. In so doing, he reversed an image that might have
stood for the colorblindness of capitalist exploitation. Shifting literal
to rative description, the supernatural "blackening" of white workers
suggested that, far from being a class-based phenomenon, silicosis was a
disease of racial proportions. At the Gauley Bridge tunnel, the absorption
of white dust would have made a black man of even a white congressman
who emerged, in the morning that follows from a dark day of work, from
the opposite end of a racialized spectrum of exploitation. Within the
conventional limits of racial performance, Robison's metaphor suggested
that, if racial identities were initially written on the surface of the
body, they could be written more firmly across its invisible interior. The
idea that white men could be blackened by industrial poisons affirmed
not only that race was unfixed, but that, as a social construct, race
was central to the story of the Gauley tunnel disaster.
<P>
If conventions delimiting the performance of racial identities had
prompted Robison's shift to a metaphorical description of industrial
contamination, the striking medical imagery that surrounded Hawk's Nest
Tunnel lent a conceptual resonance to his image of white-blackened white
workers. Effecting shadowy reversals of visual and conceptual poles,
and displacing surface "appearances" with uncovered "essences," X-ray
testimonials provided an epistemological complement to the searching
conceptions of racial identity that the tunnel engendered. From the
beginning of the gradual public exposure of the disaster, X-ray pictures
had been instrumental in identifying the industrial nature of deaths
falsely attributed to pneumonia and tuberculosis. With state hearings
on the incident beginning as early as 1933, the story of the Gauley
tunnel incident had been suffused with images of dark chests illuminated
by bursts of white scars (<I>HC,</I> 4, 37-38). During the 1936
Congressional Investigation of the Health Conditions of Public Utility
Workers, X-ray pictures lent strange credence to Robison's exposure
of the hidden industrial origins of race. Robison's image of blackened
white workers at the daylit night mouth of the tunnel, for example, was
contained in the murky X-ray transparencies that specialists held up to
courtroom windows for jury inspection (<I>HC,</I> 96). What the daylight
released from these plates was an uncanny inversion of fundamental
conceptual and visual binary terms. The true industrial nature of
these workers' diseases could not be revealed through "indefinite"
symptoms; it was rather illuminated through a technology that collapsed
surface and depth, disclosing interior landscapes filled with negative
"white shadows" and the deathly "snow storm[s]" produced by dark scars
(<I>HC,</I> 27, 96). X-ray testimonials and Robison's testimony regarding
the industrial racial nature of the disaster at Hawk's Nest Tunnel were
conjoined by a shared set of visual and conceptual inversions.
<P>
Amid a series of Depression Era social documentary poems, including
Charles Reznikoff's verse renderings of southern court records , and
Mike Gold's and Tillie Olsen's poetic fashionings of letters from workers
, Muriel Rukeyser's "The Book of the Dead"  was unique in
its effort to adapt the conceptual premises of new visual technologies
to a documentary telling of the Gauley Bridge tunnel story. Plumbing the
disaster and its aftermath through trial transcripts, letters, interviews,
and descriptions of conventional and medical photographs, Rukeyser used
the penetrating gaze of the X-ray to bridge high-modernist with more
politically acute social-realist aesthetics. In her Gauley tunnel poem,
however, the poet's arcane exposure of capitalistic mechanisms of erasure
was bought at the cost of the historical racial dimensions of Hawk's
Nest. While the feminist social poet had been criticized by male peers
for promoting "unscientific" varieties of socialism in "The Book of the
Dead," her sharp portrayal of the class basis of industrial exploitation
was nothing if not doctrinaire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 In the congressional testimony
upon which Rukeyser based much of her poem, X-ray images had provided a
conceptual framework for George Robison's account of the racial makeup
of Hawk's Nest Tunnel. These same images prompted Rukeyser to envision
a gendered poetic release from industrial capitalist exploitation. But
modern visual technologies--particularly those deployed in state
photographic and radiographic campaigns--also blinded the social poet
to the black-and-white depths of the Depression Era's worst incident of
industrial poisoning. Excavating the material of class consciousness from
workers' bodies, and deciphering its encryptions through poetic methods
engendered by new visual technologies, Rukeyser restored a universalizing
whiteness to the blackened workers that Robison had summoned before the
congressional committee. Sacrificing racial to class interests, "The
Book of the Dead" illustrated that, during an epoch much celebrated for
its sweeping radical alliances, modern visual technologies could be used
to limit the spectrum that these alliances encompassed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
<P>
As a literary effort to "photograph . . . the voice" of a missing
industrial constituency, Rukeyser's tunnel poem was conceived in the
interstices of mass radiographic campaigns and the massive photographic
programs of the Roosevelt administration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Between 1935 and
1943, as mobile X-ray screening units began to circulate in England and
America, the Historical Section of the Farm Security Administration (FSA)
was "vividly demonstrat[ing] the value of the camera as [an] instrument
of government" by commissioning and exhibiting images of rural poverty
in the South and West.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Distributed to government agencies,
published in newspapers and magazines, and exhibited in museums,
schools, and libraries across the country during the late 1930s, FSA
images garnered support for New Deal social initiatives; and they
worked to restore a racially composed credibility to an administration
burdened by political and economic crises. By slanting its photographic
displays to feature disproportionately high numbers of white farmers
and laborers, the Roosevelt administration exhibited its capacity not
only to see but to circumscribe the human effects of environmental
and economic corrosion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In the racial management of FSA
photographic displays, the 
<B></B> 
humane objectives of New Deal reformers
seemed to harmonize with the universalizing class aims of more radical
contemporaries.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
<P>
Serving a range of institutional purposes, medical and conventional
photographic equipment carried vexed social and political overtones in the
late 1930s. Rukeyser portrayed the X-ray camera as a penetrating medium
that could retrieve emancipatory truths from Gauley tunnel. Displayed as
"map[s]" of a "country marked by error / and one air" (<I>US,</I> 61),
the scarred interiors of the legendary "walking skeletons" of "Silicosis
Village" provided more than empirical evidence of the human cost of
industrial production: they were potential guides to an afterlife, to an
enlightening political future.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Rukeyser derived the title
of <I>U. S. 1,</I> her 1938 collection featuring the long Gauley tunnel
poem, from a contemporaneous Federal Writers' Project travelogue called
<I>U. S. One: Maine to Florida.</I> In so doing, she cast "The Book of
the Dead" as a potent enhancement of the American Guide Series' effort
"to highlight the history, resources and points of interest in an area
of more than three million square miles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 What Rukeyser's
extension of this state-sponsored survey finally exposed, however, was
a crippling conjunction of somatic and institutional corruption.

Despite growing concerns for a nationwide epidemic of industrial dust
disease, bills to add silicosis coverage to worker's compensation met
with bipartisan opposition in the mid- to late 1930s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
Rukeyser charts this legislative failure in "The Book of the Dead" by
suggesting that, while the new medical gaze had the power to enlighten
and transform society, its emancipatory potential lay snagged in the gap
between diagnosis and cure. Versed in marxist conceptions of ideological
production, the radical poet understood that conventional photographs
and texts commissioned by the Works Progress Administration performed
a number of institutional functions. They worked to expose economic
hardships and iniquities, but they did so in a manner that placed the
solutions to social problems within the confines of corporate interests
and structures. In this sense, the reformist objectives of New Deal
documentaries dimmed the light that they shed on the national body's
interior. In her portrayal of the X-ray camera as a medium that was less
tainted and more encompassing than the conventional camera, however,
and in her suggestion that it modeled processes by which poems might
be made penetrate to real truths and identities, 
<B></B> 
Rukeyser failed to
identify the X-ray's own ideological functions. Her neglect of these
functions compromises not only her metaphor of the X-ray as map, but
also her portrayal of the Gauley tunnel incident at large. In the 1930s,
Rukeyser knew, conventional state-sponsored photographs served the
larger corporate interests of the liberal Roosevelt administration. But
the state- and corporate-sponsored medical imaging techniques that
exposed and publicized industrial abuses were themselves being used on
a mass scale to "survey" and "manage" "large populations" (<I>SB,</I>
147).
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Among these populations was a newly identified body
of silicotic miners and foundry workers. This lingering constituency
was believed to number between 100,000 and 500,000 nationwide, and its
members represented potential financial liabilities to companies that
neglected to screen them from hire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
<P>
If Rukeyser hedged in her celebration of the emancipatory power of
new medical pictures, she was sharper in her poetic condemnation of
conventional documentary images. Despite what we now recognize as the
racist nature of FSA displays and publications, the poet had praised
their capacity to "widen" social horizons in a <I>New Masses</I>
review.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 As a critic, Rukeyser was unstinting in her praise
of the work of government photographers like Walker Evans, Dorothea
Lange, Arthur Rothstein, and Ben Shahn; but in her poetry of the late
1930s, she exhibits a principled wariness toward state-sponsored social
photography. The proliferating images of glass and of cameras that
fill the opening passages of "The Book of the Dead" express a marked
ambivalence toward what Walter Kalaidjian calls the "emergent visual
culture" of New Deal America (<I>AC,</I> 166).

Noting that glass is a product of silica, the toxic mineral mined from the
tunnel, Kalaidjian suggests that Rukeyser here portrays the daily matter
of American life as tainted by the human cost of its production. Through
such a reading, the poet's references to the camera's own "groundglass"
(<I>US,</I> 10) work to implicate further the 
<B></B> 
state visual apparatus that
came to chronicle this life in the late 1930s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Identifying
the deathly material of the lens with the material of the town's
"deserted" inhabitants, the poet begins her expos&eacute; with an account
of alienation and complicity that indicts the state documentarian's
equipment. Visually undermining the town of Gauley Bridge by reducing
it to a series of refracting surfaces (doors, walls, windows, mended
roadway, race-marked skin), the poet will endeavor, in her own words, to
"widen the lens" (<I>US,</I> 71) of the New Deal documentary apparatus,
modeling her penetrating poetic gaze on the ghostly medical camera that
had become central to the exposure of the Gauley tunnel disaster.
<P>
If the early "photographic" passages of Rukeyser's poem serve to indict
state-sanctioned instruments of social investigation, later visual
images endeavor to revitalize these instruments by modeling them on
new medical visual technologies. In "The Book of the Dead," there is
a historical feminist component to the drive to bring the power of the
X-ray to the documentary lens. At a time when large numbers of American
women had already begun to participate in state-sponsored artistic and
sociological projects, medically affiliated critics discouraged the
feminist writer from entering into more strictly gendered institutional
domains.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Reviewing <I>U. S. 1</I> for <I>The New Republic</I>
in 1938, the poet-physician William Carlos Williams praised Rukeyser for
knowing "how to use the <I>language</I> of an X-ray report" (Williams's
emphasis).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Rather than "twist[ing]" her medical source
materials "in order to make 'poetry' of them," Williams wrote, the
selective young poet adhered to principles of straight presentation,
displaying her sources as artifacts, as things in themselves ("MR,"
141). It was in her faithful renderings of the language of X-ray reports,
renderings that conformed to aesthetic parameters mapped by masters like
"Pound in the material of his 'Cantos,'" ("MR," 141) that the ingenue's
otherwise "uncritical" "passion" ("MR," 142) as a social poet was tempered
and sharpened. Here, Williams's praise shored up the masculine borders
of both the medical and poetical professions. By dwelling on Rukeyser's
truthfulness to, not the content, but "the <I>language</I>" of materials
that were often gathered, but not deciphered, by female X-ray technicians,
Williams widened the gulf between apprentice and master, portraying it
as a gendered divide between physician and nurse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 What the
doctor conferred on "Miss Rukeyser" was the license to write poetry that
she would never qualify to read.
<P>
Rukeyser aspired to more than fidelity to the institutionally gendered
language of X-ray reports, however. In "The Book of the Dead," she
pointedly misread her medical textual materials, truing them to
the perceptual processes of the visual technologies to which they
referred. In a section of the poem drawn from congressional testimony,
for example, the poet edited and reshaped a lung specialist's lengthy
reading of radiographic encryptions (<I>HC,</I> 96-97). Trimming
the descriptive portions of his testimony, Rukeyser fashioned it into
a discursive descent, one that leads closer and closer to a luminous
core. "This is the X-ray picture taken last April," states an expert in
dust diseases:

In this passage, the mounting empirical precision of the scientist--"There
and there and there, there, there"--culminates and collapses in the voice
of a sufferer who grows "worse every day." In constructing this powerful
testimonial juncture, the poet burrows through layers of physical and
discursive surfaces, reclaiming the patient's experience from a clinical
illustration of the progressive stages of the disease. Here "The Book
of the Dead" elicits the human cost of Hawk's Nest Tunnel not through
straight presentation, but through a poetic approximation of the spatial
and temporal depths of modern medical visual technologies. Tunneling
through medical and personal testimonials, the poet photographed the
voice of an unburied casualty, a member of the "invisible" constituency
of the depression.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
<P>
The X-ray reports through which Rukeyser sought to recover the
hidden victims of Hawk's Nest Tunnel constituted a well fortified
discourse in the 1930s. Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison write
that the early-twentieth-century emergence of the X-ray photograph
precipitated a heightened attention to the precautions that ought to
surround the reliable production and dissemination of information from the
medium. 
<B></B> 
While appearing to penetrate to new foundations of reality, X-ray
imaging was in fact riddled with technical contingencies. Diagnosticians
had to learn first how <I>not</I> to shoot straight, mediating "the
mechanical procedure of X-raying with a knowledge of systematic deviations
between anatomy and its Roentgen [X-ray] representation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
Cognizant of the increasing juridical uses of photographs in the early
twentieth century, and frightened by the possibility of malpractice
suits based on a new visual medium that "fairly radiated authority,"
modern clinicians began to scramble for both mechanical and interpretive
control of a medium in which "the encryption of information takes place
in the technology itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Juridically minded clinicians
knew well that the X-ray presented challenges to the diagnostic and even
the semiotic authority of medical professionals.
<P>
In "The Book of the Dead," the documentary camera was shown to be
compromised by the deathly material of its lens. While the medical camera
had a greater emancipatory potential, it was still an intrinsically
complicit machine. Even the celebratory medical portions of Rukeyser's
Gauley tunnel poem contain hints of the X-ray's embeddedness in
capitalist structures of alienation. In her rendering of congressional
X-ray testimonials, for example, the shift from the specialist's voice
to the voice of the absent sufferer marks the estrangement of the
radiographed subject from his encrypted interior. The disjunctive union
of these voices dramatizes not only the physical distance of the patient
from the specialist who deciphers his X-ray, but also the discursive
remove accruing from the doctor's habit of looking and speaking through
machines.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Rukeyser's condemnation of new medical visual
apparatus was more restrained than her indictment of the documentary
camera in "The Book of the Dead," however, because X-rays finally marked
a turning of technology itself against the masculine institutions that
possessed it. Modern medicine had generated a self-encrypting machine,
one that robbed patients of the insides of their bodies as it wrested
powers of signification away from the professionals it served.
<P>
As uncertainties regarding how to see and read bodies were added to
the broader clamor of modern semiotic crisis, the defensive situation
of medical professionals came to resemble that of professional
poets.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 In an age of literary and cultural positivism, when
"unprejudiced observation" was said to have "put verbal notions out of
court," poets appeared to have lost their autonomy as readers of culture
in the way that machine-bound physicians had lost theirs as organic
readers of bodies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Male modernists in particular answered
charges of charlatanism with airs of hyped-up authority, dressing their
poetry with allusions and cryptic textual inscriptions. In the tradition
of Emersonians who used "Nature as [their] hieroglyphic," writers like
T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound began to unfold curative truths from mysterious
"anaglyphic" texts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 With their capacity to diagnose having
been infringed upon (in modern Britain particularly) by a new wave of
sociologists and new social-realist writers, these would-be philologists
traced debased words and customs to hidden originary reserves, mastering
Sanskritic thunder claps, and conjuring silk-and-stone visual essences
from classical Chinese ideograms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Marshaling the alienating
features of 
<B></B> 
emerging modern technologies to reactionary cultural ends,
high-modernist writers came to specialize in generating and deciphering
their own literary self-encryptions.
<P>
As a politically minded modernist poet, Rukeyser recognized that "radiant"
new visual perspectives could both blind and enlighten. On the one hand,
the infamous "Poster Girl" of proletariat literature heeded marxist
appeals to X-ray imaging as a means of enlightening the eyes and minds
of the masses.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Penetrating layers of flesh to exhume the
powerful texts buried within and among the proletariat body, the modern
medical camera united poets and workers as agents who could see, and
seek to publish, the invisible effects of capitalist exploitation. At
the same time, however, Rukeyser was criticized by radically minded
colleagues for skimming the "erudition" that surrounded the poetic trade
in arcanum.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Hidden in the allusive title of her Gauley
tunnel poem, for example, was a metaphor that mapped snowy silicotic
X-ray encryptions onto hieroglyphic writings buried with, and within,
the bodies of ancient Egyptian mummies. The lacing of the Gauley tunnel
story with prayers from amulets and papyrus rolls, however, was hardly
fashioned as an inflationary appeal to the arcane. Like mechanically
generated medical images that could serve to locate and enlighten a
poisoned industrial constituency, Rukeyser's funereal texts signified a
set of cultural practices that united, rather than separating, bodies and
signs. Prayers carved into stones to be sewn into bodies--"<I>My heart
my mother      my heart     my mother"</I> (<I>US,</I> 27)--were the mark
of a culture in which textual and physical ministerings were thoroughly
merged.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
<P>
Rukeyser's exploration of the cultural functions of bodily inscriptions
was based on contemporary medical testimony and on a plum-sized
funereal scarab exhibited at the New York Metropolitan Museum of
Art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Carved from near-black serpentine, and glinting with
fine white hieroglyphic inscriptions, the Heart Amulet of Hatnofer
was on display in the poet's own city between 1936 and 1937 ("CE,"
178-79), the years during which the poet wrote "The Book of the
Dead." Considered vital to the judgment of the soul and to its eventual
preservation after death, heart amulets such as this one were designed
to be wrapped over, or inserted directly into, the eviscerated chests of
embalmed kings and queens.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 The text on the Heart Amulet of
Hatnofer was characteristic of the texts carved into other such stones:
"Hatnofer says: Heart of my mother, heart of my mother! Heart of my
[present] form!" ("CE," 179). New Kingdom heart amulets were universally
inscribed with variants of a single small chapter from the hundreds
of papyrus rolls that make up the Egyptian <I>Book of the Dead,</I>
and it was with a translation of this chapter that Rukeyser elected to
introduce Egypt into Hawk's Nest Tunnel ("CE," 179). The snowy scoring
of the Metropolitan Heart Scarab's white-on-black encryptions, together
with the stone's location within the chest of its bearer, places this
particular textual artifact at the confluence of divergent modernist
streams in "The Book of the Dead."
<P>
Rukeyser hoped to "widen the lens" of the "paternalistic" New Deal
documentary apparatus not only by using medical visual technologies to
recover invisible texts, but 
<B></B> 
by challenging conventionally gendered claims
to the instruments of both medical and poetical seeing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
By exposing encrypted male interiors in her poem, and by foregrounding
the women--the journalist Philippa Allen, and the bereaved mother, Emma
Jones--who secured interviews, autopsies, and X-rays to uncover the
industrial truth of the tunnel incident, Rukeyser regendered her medical
reportage, restoring agency to women through a visual medium that was
conceived to erase it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The passage from the Heart Amulet
of Hatnofer, the first arcane inscription to appear in "The Book of the
Dead," paid tribute to the matriarchal aspects of a society that, at
the time of the production of the Eighteenth-Dynasty stone, was ruled
by an innovative queen, Hatshepsut, who had claimed for herself the
traditionally male role of sun god.

tunnel workers' lungs:

 Within the iconographic traditions of Western
science, on the other hand, modern women were more often the objects than
the agents of such knowledge and power. In her study of gendered imagery
in modern science, Ludmilla Jordanova finds a historical gendering
of the penetrating medical gaze in the macabre genre of anatomist
paintings. Reviewing a series of European and American paintings and
lithographs that depict scenes of dissection, Jordanova notes that
nineteenth- and twentieth-century artists broke with earlier conventions
by featuring not male or unsexed cadavers, but instead women as the
objects of the male anatomists' attention. Jordanova attributes this
appearance of the 
<B></B> 
sexed cadaver, whose once-living tissue is peeled back
like clothing, to the so-called romantic confusion of the erotic with
the deathly.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 In anatomist paintings, the male scientist's
unveiling of truth from the dead woman on the table invokes a traditional
association of women with nature's esoteric verities, providing a backdrop
for the ritualized containment of a pair of mysterious and threatening
forces.

In her own poetic unveiling of the truth of industrial poisoning,
Rukeyser's X-ray testimonials release a modern visual technology from
its historically gendered moorings. Lisa Cartwright attributes some of
the popular as well as professional fascination with turn-of-the-century
X-ray images to the same "stunning spectacle of death in life" exhibited
in anatomist paintings of the preceding decades (<I>SB,</I> 121). That
this spectacle was gendered in accordance with nineteenth-century
representations of medical dissection is suggested by Wilhelm
R&ouml;ntgen's decision to withhold from public view the first X-ray
image that he observed through the fluoroscope. What R&ouml;ntgen
photographed and published for scientific and popular consumption was
not his own hand, but rather his wife's (<A HREF="5.1kadlec_1.html"> 1</A>), with the skeletal
splay of her fingers gendered by the negative shadow of a wedding ring
(<I>SB,</I> 114-15).
<P>
In the latter years of the New Deal, mass X-ray screenings were
implemented both by public-health agencies and private corporations. In
these screenings, new visual 
<B></B> 
technologies were used to identify, and
ultimately to segregate, populations that included diseased women
and industrial workers. Insofar as women and workers were conjoined
as targets for tuberculosis and silicosis screenings respectively,
the emerging practice of mass radiography could be said to bolster
Rukeyser's feminist authority as an artist equipped to photograph the
invisible voice of the oppressed laborer. Here, X-ray screenings might
be said to trace the sources of oppression that, beginning around 1935,
forged the coalitional political alliances that made up the Popular
Front. Used by eugenically minded scientists to survey and manage those
subpopulations that threatened the political and biological integrity
of the nation, however, mass screenings were also directed at a larger
constituency, one that included many of the women and workers who were
specifically targeted. X-rays were also used to survey and manage a range
of "racial" populations that were threatening to a nation whose genetic
makeup had been altered by recent patterns of immigration. Deployed
in an effort to contain contaminating women and workers, then, mass
radiography campaigns served to cleanse "racial" and "ethnic" groups of
the very claims to identity that might enable them to identify their mass
subjugation. Penetrating visible markers of identity, X-ray screenings
hid the evidence of the racist work that they performed. The historical
erasure of this evidence casts a shadow over Rukeyser's marxist appeal
to the emancipatory potential of new visual technologies.
<P>
Beginning in the late 1930s British and American promotional films for
mass radiography--films geared toward women in particular--had begun to
portray women "as deceptive carriers of a disease that is invisible except
under the X ray, threatening the integrity of the family, the community,
and the nation" (<I>SB,</I> 146). Framing the disease as a corrosive to
both familial and national structures, these films played to lingering
perceptions of tuberculosis as an illness carried and spread not only
by women, but by foreigners and members of other "races."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
Here, the anatomist's cadaver was made to bleed into a range of modern
subjects who were perceived as threatening to the hereditarian integrity
of the "American race."

 During the 1910s and early 1920s, as
immigration swelled to peaks of close to one million newcomers per year,
racialist Americans came increasingly to echo Madison Grant, author
of <I>The Passing of the Great Race</I> , in warning against
the dilution of not only their Anglo-American cultural inheritance
but their "Nordic" American genetic makeup as well.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
The migration of African Americans from remote southern to northern
industrial centers contributed to diatribes against "mongrelization"
such as Calvin Coolidge's in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> in 1921, and it
encouraged the growth of the Ku Klux Klan in northern cities in the early
1920s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 But American racialists during the first two decades
of the century had begun to react also to the genetic threat posed by
"subspecies" of "whites."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 The vast majority of immigrants
entering the U. S. between 1900 and 1924 were newcomers of eastern and
southern European ancestry; and by popular modern racialist taxonomies
they were classified as belonging to distinctly inferior "Alpine" and
"Mediterranean" races.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 During the first decades of the
twentieth century, in forums ranging from medical conferences on immigrant
screening to prohibitionist rallies, the dilution of America's Nordic
genetic makeup 
<B></B> 
was linked to the spread of disease. African Americans
were grouped with newcomers ranging from Asians to Italians and Jews
as dangerous agents whose constitutions and habits predisposed them to
illnesses including syphilis and tuberculosis.
<P>
Sheila Rothman writes of the modern perception of tuberculosis as "a
disease of the masses," noting the upsurge during the immigrant boom
of the 1910s and 1920s in American legislation calling for involuntary
sanatorium confinement.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 In medical and legal efforts to
check the spread of immigrant diseases, the threat posed by women's
sexuality and the traditionally feminized specter of death in life merged
with the modern American eugenists' fear of racial contamination. From
a public health standpoint, there were certainly sound reasons for
implementing programs to manage large populations during the years
before the midcentury discovery of a chemotherapeutic "cure" for
tuberculosis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Still, when coupled with the historical use
of X-rays in the radiographic sterilization of women, the fact that
new medical imaging techniques were used to single out and designate
tubercular women for confinement suggests that TB screening campaigns
provided a complement to modern legislative efforts to regulate sexual
reproduction. If X-rays had been used in obvious ways to deprive women
of their social and sexual agency, however, their use against racial
and ethnic groups was a more subtle matter. Directed against the very
impoverished immigrant and African American populations that suffered
from the highest rates of tuberculosis infection, the penetrating gaze of
the X-ray performed a ghostly, essentializing function. It skinned away
markers of race and ethnicity in search of more clinical justifications
for containment and segregation.
<P>
If the gendered campaign for mass tuberculosis screenings was
undergirded by lingering racial anxieties in the 1930s, mass industrial
screenings compounded this cultural fear with a corporate fear of the new
labor-unionism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Although third-stage silicosis was usually
attended by the onset of TB, dust diseases differed from deadly infections
in that they could not be passed from host to host. As state legislatures
began to consider adding silicosis to the roster of afflictions covered
by worker's compensation laws in the mid-1930s, however, industries and
insurance companies came to fear dust disease as much as any contagion
("IMC," 198-99). Implemented in the late 1930s in major industrial
states, including Illinois and New York, industrial X-ray screenings led
to the immediate dismissal of miners and foundry workers whose chests
displayed signs of silicosis and related diseases. What these industrial
screenings unveiled was an objective criterion for protecting industries
from workers whose disease now threatened not the racial integrity
of the community or the nation, but rather the financial integrity of
the corporate body in the newly emerging welfare state. In the 1930s,
unskilled laborers were more than twice as likely as highly skilled
workers to suffer from work-related disabilities ("IMC," 196); and of
those at the bottom of the pay scale, African American and immigrant
workers were routinely coerced into performing the most dangerous
tasks. Industrial X-ray screenings demonstrated that, in industry's hands,
the medical camera could be used to peel back layers of racial identity
in order to provide an objective and essentializing ground for insulating
industries against the very bodies that it had formerly been 
<B></B> 
privileged
to waste. Here the power of the X-ray to penetrate surfaces toward buried
truths was deployed to conceal the practice of racial discrimination.
<P>
Rukeyser's rendering of the Gauley tunnel story was based on an emerging
visual technology that seemed powerful enough to overthrow its masters,
but in her displacement of race in "The Book of Dead" the poet also
partook of the essentializing premises of mass radiography. In mass
X-ray screenings, people were categorized and sorted according to visual
markers that seemed to run deeper than surface identities. Reading
identity as an encryption of "fitness," these screenings buried the
racial differences that often conditioned the entitlement to health. In
"The Book of the Dead," Rukeyser linked silica clouds with X-rays as
materials that could penetrate layers of "false consciousness" to reveal
the essential solidarity of industrial workers. This strange fusion of
visible with invisible particles emerges, tellingly, in the testimony
of an African American tunnel survivor. "As dark as I am, when I came
out at morning after the tunnel at night, / with a white man, nobody
could have told which man was white. / The dust had covered us both,
and the dust was white." (<I>US,</I> 34) Using greasepaint illicitly
to lighten rather than to darken, the "deserted Negro" from the poem's
opening stanzas describes a literal phenomenon that carries a new set
of overtones. In the context of Rukeyser's appeal to the bedrock of
class consciousness, the normative whitening of emerging tunnel workers
marks not the construction but a collapse of race itself. Adapting
George Robison's testimony to visual premises that strip the markings
of race from depths and surfaces both, the poet altered the worker's
account of the lethal dimensions of racial identity, converting it into
a specious tribute to the insignificance of skin color to Hawk's Nest
Tunnel. Here, amid the many racially unmarked tunnel workers who speak
through Rukeyser's poem, a single black survivor appears in whiteface to
eulogize the industrial solidarity of the victimized workers. Imaging a
revolutionary future in the tones of X-ray shadows and silica dust, "The
Book of the Dead" performs a service similar to that of mass radiography,
using its penetrating gaze to submerge differences central to the history
of American labor and poetry in the 1930s.
<P>
Mass screenings for tuberculosis and silicosis in the 1930s demonstrated
that the "radiant authority" of new medical visual technologies was
contingent on possession of the technology of surveillance. Cartwright's
assertion that subjects recognize themselves in terms of their
positions within "a social body" that is itself composed through
a selectively imaging "visual apparatus" suggests that identity is
profoundly conditioned by institutionalized rituals of seeing and being
seen (<I>SB,</I> 146). In the 1930s, acts of mechanical unveiling, of
peeling back layers that conceal the fitness of the core, displaced the
surface of the body as an open delineator of identity, and replaced it
with an encrypted interior that was seldom deciphered in the presence
of the subject who surrendered it. The texts inscribed on the scrolls
generated by mass radiography, like the increasingly remote texts
deciphered by modern poet-scholars in their scramble for cultural
authority, became the site of an escalating gendered and racial struggle
for the possession of the "subject," one that Rukeyser understood to
be literally waged upon and within the invisible bodies of the Great
Depression's 
<B></B> 
"negative phenomena," the "many people" who "just didn't
seem to be . . . about."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 By constructing a tale in which
modern women restore eyes to a constituency that drifts outside of the
frame of surveillance, Rukeyser sought to demonstrate that, placed in
the wrong hands, medical visual technology, like modernist esoterism,
could serve to expose the ideological nature of its construction and
use. The gaze of the modern medical camera, however, was too easily
adapted to the essentializing aims of a poet who anticipated a class-based
release from the veil of "false consciousness." Written out of Rukeyser's
brilliant exposure of corporate and state mechanisms of erasure are the
less-than-superficial racial dimensions of Gauley tunnel.

Testifying in 1936 before the house subcommittee appointed to
investigate the Hawk's Nest disaster, Dr. Emory Hayhurst, an expert in
industrial lung diseases, defined silicosis as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Silicosis is a disease which results from silica dust in the air being
inhaled into the lungs, where it sets up a gradual scar tissue formation
. . . in spots, or nodules . . . and those gradually increase in size
until they block the drainage from the lungs, and eventually they block
the blood supply, and then they block the air passageways. While this
is going on the person suffers certain symptoms, such as increasing
shortness of breath, and can't take a deep breath. He gets pains through
his chest, and he notices that he can't work as vigorously as before. He
is very apt to develop tuberculosis, much more susceptible as a result
of this silica in his lungs [<I>HC,</I> 85-86].

Cary Nelson portrays the 1930s as a time of broad artistic and
political alliances. Placing the poetry of this decade within a larger
Left modernist tradition in which "the poetry of the feminist movement
coexists with the poetry of the unemployed . . . and the poetry of
black pride," Nelson rues the more "fractured" appeals of identity
politics in the late twentieth century (Cary Nelson, <I>Repression and
Recovery: Modern American Poetry and the Politics of Cultural Memory,
1910-1945</I> [Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989],
234-35; hereafter abbreviated <I>RR</I>). Michael Denning offers a
similar but more historically nuanced account of the Popular Front as
a "coalitional" social and artistic movement that began to crumble in
the mid-1940s under the pressure of "postmodern" "racial realignments"
and especially "gender realignments" (Michael Denning, <I>The Cultural
Front: The Laboring of American Culture in the Twentieth Century</I>
[New York: Verso, 1996], 37, 29, 34, and 34, respectively; hereafter
abbreviated <I>CF</I>). Identifying the young Rukeyser as a "Popular
Front feminist," Walter Kalaidjian reads "The Book of the Dead" as a
poem that exposes, in one progressive sweep, the history of "gender,
race, and class oppression" alike (<I>AC,</I> 168).

sent vans equipped with X-ray machines into areas identified as sources
of TB infection. At this time, chest X-rays were also made a part of
routine hospital admissions procedures. Mass tuberculosis screenings
were instituted in England a few years later, in 1941, among civilians
in public air-raid shelters. See Lisa Cartwright, <I>Screening the

FSA photographs were used to garner public support for farm
relief funds. These funds were seldom distributed fairly. In states
like Mississippi, for example, low-income white farmers received
standard rehabilitation loans at up to seven times the rate of blacks
(Nicholas Natanson, <I>The Black Image in the New Deal: The Politics of
FSA Photography</I> [Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1992],
52; hereafter abbreviated <I>BI</I>). Although the white photographers
hired by the agency did produce more or less proportionate numbers of
portraits of African Americans in the rural South, the FSA's inability to
distribute relief across the southern "color line" was reflected in the
racial composition of public FSA displays (<I>BI,</I> 69-71). "The
agency's first traveling exhibit of 1936," writes Natanson, "hailing
the march from rural slums to 'new frontiers of farm independence,'left
black frontiers all but invisible, with only one black image among the
exhibit's forty" (<I>BI,</I> 217). FSA photos of black subjects were also
missing from the federally sponsored images that appeared in newspapers
(<I>BI,</I> 226).
<P>
<a NAME="FOOT13" HREF="#REF13">13</A>.
During the 1930s, the liberal Roosevelt Administration willingly
traded on race in its attempts to forge coalitions with radical political
movements. Speaking as a prominent white "racial progressive," for
example, FSA chief Will Alexander urged students at Howard University
to become "more class conscious and less race conscious" (<I>BI,</I> 50,
54). In so doing, he implied that the Roosevelt Administration was aiming
to eradicate racism by attacking it at its economic foundations. The
failure of Alexander's own agency to distribute photos of black
subjects, however, was hardly an instance of racial sacrifice on behalf
of revolutionary political change. The directives that the head of the
FSA's Historical Section sent to his traveling photographers indicate
that class consciousness was no more an aim of the agency than was
racial awareness. "[P]ut quite a little effort in getting us good land
pictures," wrote Roy Stryker to the photographer Walker Evans, "showing
the erosion, sub-marginal areas, cut-over land. These should be taken
whenever possible, showing the relationship of the land to the cultural
decay" (quoted in Walker Evans, <I>Walker Evans at Work</I> [New York:
Harper and Row, 1982], 118-19). See also Guimond, <I>American
Photography and the American Dream,</I> 117. In linking poverty to
environmental factors like erosion and clear-cuts, Stryker encouraged
his photographers to depict economic crisis as a temporary aberration
in a natural capitalistic order. In the pictures that he called for,
reform-based recovery would be as imminent as new spring growth.

Gauley Bridge had been christened "the village of walking skeletons"
by the radical editor Frank Palmer, who directed reportage on the tunnel
disaster in the Detroit-based <I>People's Press</I> in 1935 (<I>HN,</I>
75, 81-82). Resembling the London commuters who had shuffled through
the opening passages of T. S. Eliot's <I>The Waste Land</I> , "so
many" "undone" by "death," the more literally wasted res that Palmer
invoked had become marxist harbingers by the time of such polemical poetic
plaints as Edwin Rolfe's "Asbestos" (T. S. Eliot, <I>The Waste Land: A
Facsimile and Transcript of the Original Drafts,</I> ed. Valerie Eliot
[New York: Harcourt Brace and Company, 1971], 9; hereafter abbreviated
<I>WL</I>). In Rolfe's 1933 industrial elegy, a disease-stricken asbestos
worker sinks into his corporeal deathbed, where "the posts are made
of bone, spring of nerves, / the mattress bleeding flesh" (Edwin Rolfe,
"Asbestos," in <I>To My Contemporaries</I> [New York: Dynamo Press, 1936],
10; hereafter abbreviated "A"). "[D]ead / workers" such as Rolfe's "are
dead before they cease to be" ("A," 10) not because they trade their
passions, as do Eliot's disembodied masses, for numbing comforts that
"[p]icked [their] bones in whispers" (<I>WL,</I> 69), but because their
industrial deaths are so terrible and slow. Rukeyser owes something to
both portrayals of mass-cultural and working-class malaise. She trades
on images of surviving tunnel workers who "linger" (<I>US,</I> 25) in
a netherworld that is at once social and somatic. "I wake up choking,"
states a worker who is denied compensation, "and my wife / rolls me
over on my left side" (<I>US,</I> 24). Neither waking nor sleeping, as
in Eliot, "neither / [l]iving nor dead" (<I>WL,</I> 7), he resembles
the many corpses who lie uncounted and undiagnosed in silica-laden mass
graves (<I>US,</I> 43). By highlighting the anonymity of both living and
dead victims of Hawk's Nest Tunnel, Rukeyser displays the etiology of
acute silicosis as a metaphor not only for the excesses of capitalist
exploitation, but also for the more passive social pathologies that
facilitated such excesses in the American workplace. Before the passage
of the 1935 Social Security Act, and the later passage of comprehensive
worker's compensation laws, the industrial sources of their diseases
were no more visible to stricken workers than were their languishing
families visible to the government and the public at large. Here, the
walking skeletons in Rukeyser's poem work to reconcile the corporeal
losses elegized in poems like "Asbestos" with the crises of mass identity
depicted in Eliot's modern elegy.

Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner write that, during the depression,
legislative calls for workmen's compensation for silicosis victims were
attacked from both ends of the political spectrum. The "idiosyncratic"
course of silicosis was difficult to document precisely (Gerald Markowitz
and David Rosner, "The Illusion of Medical Certainty: Silicosis and the
Politics of Industrial Disability, 1930-1960," in <I>Framing Disease:
Studies in Cultural History,</I> ed. Charles E. Rosenberg and Janet
Golden [Brunswick, N. J.: Rutgers University Press, 1992], 197-98;
hereafter abbreviated "IMC"). Anticipating mass filings by previously
exposed workers, insurance companies quadrupled their coverage rates and
forced industries to adopt preemptive screening procedures. Labor was
thus forced "to choose between health and jobs" ("IMC," 198). Faced with
mass layoffs in such sectors as the foundry industry, labor federations
sometimes sided with industrialists in support of jobs. In "The Book of
the Dead," Rukeyser documents the failure of these legislative efforts
in an ambiguously titled section called "The Bill":

Lisa Cartwright notes that X-ray technology began to serve an
array of medicojuridical screening functions in the latter part of
that decade. Beginning in 1937, X-rays became the predominant means of
monitoring and managing those sectors of the population deemed responsible
for public health threats like tuberculosis (<I>SB,</I> 147-52).

Calling for a national conference on America's silicosis epidemic
in 1936, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins publicized the plight of
the 100,000 workers believed to be suffering from the long-term effects
of silicosis. The Department of Labor estimated that another 500,000
workers had been exposed to dangerous levels of silica dust (<I>HN,</I>
109-10). Rukeyser inflated Perkins's estimates: "There are today
one million potential victims. / 500,000 Americans have silicosis now. /
These are the proportions of a war" (<I>US,</I> 60). After the national
silicosis scares of the mid-1930s, industries began to use X-rays in
the screening of silicotic miners and foundry workers ("IMC," 196,
197-98).

Kalaidjian links the "camera-glass" in the above-quoted passage
to another camera reference in the poem's opening lines: "[V]iewing on
groundglass an inverted image" (<I>US,</I> 10) a visiting photographer
presents a false first glimpse of West Virginia, a vista yielded to
incoming tourists: "resorts, the chalk hotel. / Pillars and fairway"
(<I>US,</I> 9-10). While the glass in both passages implicates
the conventional camera in the deadly excavation of silica, Kalaidjian
traces the photographer's mechanically inverted vision to one of Karl
Marx's early metaphors: "If in all ideology men and their circumstances
appear upside-down as in a <I>camera obscura,</I> this phenomenon
arises just as much from their historical life-process as the inversion
of objects on the retina does from their physical life-process" (Karl
Marx and Frederick Engels, <I>The German Ideology,</I> ed. C. J. Arthur
[New York: International Publishers, 1989], 47). See also <I>AC,</I>
166-68. Kalaidjian suggests that Rukeyser finally surpasses the early
materialist Marx, however. She does so by mobilizing "heteroglossic"
collage methods toward, not a class-based recovery of "historical
'life-process,'" but a richer discursive recovery of the "history of
gender, race, and class oppression" that lies hidden beneath Gauley
Bridge (<I>AC,</I> 170, 168, and 168, respectively). By invoking a
broad-based alliance among, not only the workers, but also the women
and the African Americans who are suppressed by the very conventional
ideological equipment that distorts Gauley Bridge, the poet sets right
the image on the ground glass, while at the same time critiquing the
narrowly conceived materialism that facilitates its simple inversion. I
think that Kalaidjian is wrong when he claims that "The Book of the Dead"
uncovers the "history of . . . race . . . oppression," but I agree with
his reading of the poem's conventional camera as a vexed instrument
that both produces and cures "false consciousness" (<I>AC,</I> 168,
288-89 n. 17). Kalaidjian's conception of Rukeyser's camera as a
double-edged <I>pharmakon</I> is based on W. J. T. Mitchell's reading
of Marx's metaphor of the camera obscura; see his <I>Iconology: Image,

As a leading proletariat writer of the 1930s, Williams was familiar with
the Soviet Proletcult genre of "worker-correspondent" poetry; and he would
have certainly noted this related source stratum of Rukeyser's poem. By
suggesting that Rukeyser's skills as a poet are better measured through
her rendering of doctors' than through workers' words, Williams implies
that medical discourse is more remote from the poet than is the language
of miners. Williams seems to suggest that gender, as opposed to class,
is a divide that doctors and poets should labor to uphold. For accounts
of Mike Gold's promotion and production of "worker-correspondent" poetry
in the <I>New Masses</I> and <I>The Daily Worker,</I> see <I>RR,</I>

Rukeyser appears to have based this portion of "The Book of the
Dead" on Dr. Emory Hayhurst's 1936 Congressional testimony. Hayhurst's
"reading" of a tunnel worker's chest X-rays is extensive and detailed:

Answer. I am informed this was the X-ray picture that was taken last
April, and I would point out to you here the fact that these are the
ribs; this is the region of the breast bone; this is the heart shadow;
the heart being more or less solid, filled with blood, makes the wide
white shadows you see. The breast bone itself comes down only about that
wide. In here, of course, are the swallowing tube, or esophagus, and the
windpipe, which comes down to about this level. We note that those parts
are in this central dark shadow, and then the windpipe divides up and its
divisions go out into the lungs. These are the spaces between the lungs.

Answer. Between the ribs. These are the collar bones. This is the
diaphragm or muscle separating the chest from the abdomen. You will
notice that we are looking at this man from the rear, so that his heart
is on the left side. The diaphragm is higher over here which is his
right side, because the liver is under there, a large organ that is held
rather high, and lifts it up. The diaphragm top is lower over at this
point. You notice there is a pretty clear area between the box of the
chest and the diaphragm clear down into the corners. Now, this lung, for
our purposes in diagnosing silicosis, shows a beginning mottling in all
of these areas. It looks, as some say, like a snowstorm had struck the
fellow's lungs. They are fine in this stage, ten months ago, but they
are all about alike, that side and this side, top and bottom. That is
first stage silicosis in this period in the case. [<I>HC,</I> 96]

William Stott identifies a perception among middle-class Americans
in the 1930s that economic "depressions" were invisible because they
consisted "of things not happening, of business that was not being
done" (William Stott, <I>Documentary Expression and Thirties America</I>
[1973; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986], 67-68; hereafter
abbreviated <I>DE</I>). Stott quotes Frederick Lewis Allen, who wrote that
the crisis of the early 1930s "was . . . nearly invisible to the casual
eye (and to the camera, for that matter). To be sure, the streets were
less crowded with trucks than they had been, many shops stood vacant,
. . . and chimneys which should have been smoking were not doing so. But
these were all negative phenomena. There just didn't seem to be many
people about." (Frederick Louis Allen and Agnes Rogers, <I>I Remember
Distinctly: A Family Album of the American People, 1918-1941</I>

During the first decades of the twentieth century, reactionary
modern poets shared a conviction that words had grown debased over
time. This belief contributed to imagistic efforts to replace the
poetic "symbol" with the "natural object"; and it led to other more
elaborate efforts to stabilize language. In <I>The Waste Land</I>
and <I>The Cantos,</I> for example, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound each
retreated into flights of imaginary philology, tracing archaic and often
exotic words to foundational sources. In so doing, they endeavored
to combat the Western tendency toward abstraction that had caused
modern words to become self-referential (for Eliot, modern religious
rituals, too, had been lifted away from their vital sources). In <I>The
Waste Land,</I> Eliot delineated a series of overly abstract Christian
principles--"give," "sympathize," "control"--and tried to restore them to
Sanskrit terms that were onomatopoetically linked to rejuvenating natural
processes. The root word "DA," he suggested, had been distilled from
the rumbling of thunder itself, which continued to echo through variant
forms such as <I>"Datta"</I> (give); <I>"Dayadhvam"</I> (sympathize);
and <I>"Damyata"</I> (control). See Hugh Kenner, <I>The Pound Era</I>
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971), 109-10. Pound
believed that modern linguistic and economic systems had estranged
people from the very generative transactions that astute readers could
find preserved in ancient Chinese ideogrammatic compounds.

Dora Marsden, "The Art of the Future," <I>The New Freewoman,</I>
1 November 1913, 181. As the editor of <I>The New Freewoman,</I> a
1913 London journal that provided a venue for Pound's early writings,
Dora Marsden posed a formative challenge to the poet whom she hired to
edit the journal's literary pages. In a published response to Pound's
treatise on "The Serious Artist," Marsden asserted that scientific
seeing, or "unprejudiced observation," had rendered poetry hazy and
ineffectual. Daniel Tiffany provides a fascinating account of Pound's era
as an age of positivism in <I>Radio Corpse: Imagism and the Cryptaesthetic
of Ezra Pound</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1995),

Between 1913 and 1914, Pound fashioned Imagist poets as agents who
offered organic correctives to the "mechanis[tic]" excesses of Fabian
socialist authors and the new sociologists whose studies the Fabians
admired and made use of (Ezra Pound [Bastien von Helmholtz, pseud.],
"Suffragettes," <I>The Egoist,</I> 1 July 1914, 255). Imagists combated
abstraction by adhering not to the generalized principles of social
scientists, but to the strict observation utilized by physicists
and biologists. Imagist poems were of "permanent" value to society
because they provided a better index of local conditions than did the
"universalizing" contributions of the very "theorists" alongside whom
poets seemed outmoded (Ezra Pound, "The Serious Artist," <I>The New
Freewoman,</I> 15 October 1913, 163). The latter trafficked in "chicane"
and "catchwords" (Pound, "Suffragettes," 255).

Rukeyser was tagged the "Poster Girl" of proletariat literature
by William Phillips and Philip Rahv in "Grandeur and Misery of a Poster
Girl," <I>Partisan Review</I> 10 (September-October 1943): 471. While
X-ray images per se were not commonly associated with the emancipatory
enlightenment of the proletariat, new technologies that facilitated
seeing were fashioned as politically revolutionary not only by Russian
photographers and filmmakers in the 1920s, but also by American poets
affiliated with the so-called Dynamo group in the mid-1930s. These
Russian and American artists both drew from Vladimir Lenin in associating
technological development, and electrification particularly, with social
transformation. Addressing the Eighth Congress of Soviets in 1920, for
example, Lenin declared that Russia's recalcitrant peasantry had long
dwelled in ideological darkness, and that it could be coaxed from this
darkness only if the party worked to "convert every electric power
station . . . into a stronghold of enlightenment" (Vladimir Lenin,
"Communism and Electrification," in <I>The Lenin Anthology,</I>
ed. Robert C. Tucker [New York: W. W. Norton, 1975], 495). See also
Margarita Tupitsyn, <I>The Soviet Photograph, 1924-1937</I> (New
Haven: Yale University Press, 1996), 11-15, 177 n. 15. In poems
like "Dnieprostroy" , American Dynamo poets like Sol Funaroff
echoed Lenin's call for technoenlightenment by celebrating "suns of
photo-electric eyes" and the "new love" that "burns with tigris eyes /
Billions of kilowatt hours" (<I>AC,</I> 155). See also Estelle Gershgoren
Novak, "The <I>Dynamo</I> School of Poets," <I>Contemporary Literature</I>
21, no. 4 : 526-39. Franklin Roosevelt established his own
vigorous rural electrification programs in the mid-1930s, but opponents
of these more consumerist initiatives criticized them as pages taken
from "the Russian primer" (William E. Leuchtenburg, <I>The FDR Years:

John Tagg, <I>The Burden of Representation: Essays on Photographies
and Histories</I> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993),
9. Writing of the early institutional functions of photographic images,
Tagg describes the Roosevelt administration as a "paternalistic"
instrument of "corporatist reform," one that "mobilis[ed] documentary
practices across a whole series of agencies" not only in order to
"assemble propaganda for its policies" but also to "[deploy] a rhetoric
with . . . claims to retrieve the status of Truth in discourse, a
status threatened by crisis but whose renegotiation was essential if
social relations of meaning were to be sustained and national and social
identities resecured, while demand for reform was contained within the
limits of monopoly capitalist relations" (8-9). Honoring a more
comfortable divide between the medium and the message, Nicholas Natanson
suggests that Roosevelt's political objectives were less intrinsically
bound to the documentary modes that his administration exploited: "The
implicit conservatism, the implicit paternalism of New Deal policy-making
(creative reform seen as coming from the government, not from grass
roots activists) found its way into aspects of FSA image-making"
(<I>BI,</I> 83).

Women including the New York social worker and journalist Philippa
Allen, U. S. Labor Secretary Frances Perkins, and Rukeyser herself
played prominent roles not only in the exposure of the Gauley tunnel
disaster, but also in subsequent calls for the containment of a
national silicosis epidemic. See <I>US,</I> 13-15, 60; "IMC,"
199-200; and <I>HN,</I> 71, 85. In their respective journalistic
and poetic expos&eacute;s of the Hawk's Nest Tunnel incident, Allen and
Rukeyser both portrayed the West Virginia mother Emma Jones as the heroic
catalyst for the more than five hundred lawsuits that survivors leveled
against Rinehart and Dennis and the New Kanawha Power Company. Jones
would eventually tell her story to a national radio audience. See
Philippa Allen [Bernard Allen, pseud.], "Two Thousand Dying on a Job,"

Archaeologists sponsored by the Metropolitan Museum had discovered
this heart scarab on the mummy of a woman named Hatnofer. According
to archaeological notes published in conjunction with the exhibition
of this scarab in New York in 1937, Hatnofer had been buried in the
mortuary temple of Hatshepsut because her daughter had served as an
official in the court of the female pharaoh for whom the temple had
been built. See "CE," 179; and Ambrose G. Lansing and William C. Hayes,
"The Museum's Excavations at Thebes," <I>BMMA</I> <I>[Bulletin of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art]</I> 32 (January 1937): 20. For an account of
Hatshepsut's significance as one of the New Kingdom's two matriarchs, see
Quirke, <I>Ancient Egyptian Religion,</I> 36. The Metropolitan Museum's
1912-36 excavation of the temple of Hatshepsut is discussed in
David O'Connor, "The American Archaeological Focus on Ancient Palaces
and Temples of the New Kingdom," in <I>The American Discovery of
Ancient Egypt,</I> ed. Thomas, 81-84. Although Rukeyser does not
trade on its racial significance in her poem, ancient Egypt had long
been viewed by African Americans as the black African seat of Western
civilization; see Paul Gilroy, <I>The Black Atlantic: Modernity and
Double Consciousness</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press,
1993), 59-60, 207-9. During the first decades of the twentieth
century, a rash of spectacular archaeological discoveries had rekindled
debates regarding the racial makeup of the ancient Egyptians. In his
own analysis of the published photographs of newly excavated icons,
for example, W. E. B. Du Bois included Queen Hatshepsut among the New
Dynasty rulers who possessed "Negroid face[s]" (W. E. B. Du Bois, JWJ
MSS 8, box 2, folder 52, W. E. B. Du Bois Collection, Beinecke Library,
Yale University, New Haven, Conn.). A retired black worker spoke of
Egypt as a black hearth in a 1939 Federal Writers' Project collection
of oral interviews entitled <I>These Are Our Lives:</I> "The reason
[whites] don't want to give the 'Gyptians credit is cause they's niggers"
(<I>DE,</I> 205). In splicing Mrs. Jones's testimony to a prayer lifted
from a matriarchal heart scarab stone, however, Rukeyser's "Book" values
Egypt more as a gendered than a racialized source.

Testifying before the house subcommittee, Emma Jones recalled
"beg[ging] money" to pay a hospital to take "X-ray pictures" of her
dying children's lungs (<I>HC,</I> 38). Together with the diseased lungs
themselves, which she had asked doctors to extract after her sons had
died, these X-rays provided some of the first hard evidence that Gauley
Bridge tunnel workers were suffering from industrial poisoning. In
"The Book of the Dead," the West Virginia mother's stark testimonial is
only loosely based on Emma Jones's recorded congressional testimony. It
bears a stronger resemblance to Philippa Allen's earlier prose account
of the West Virginia mother in her <I>New Masses</I> expos&eacute; on
the Gauley tunnel disaster. (Allen later read from this account in her
own congressional testimony.) In Rukeyser's poem, the grieving mother's
words are taken directly from Allen's third-person account, with the
first-person pronoun used in place of the woman's name. See Allen,
"Two Thousand Dying on a Job," 19; and <I>HC,</I> 6.

Promotional films distributed by public health officials between
1938 and 1950 identified "the home" as the center of both contagion and
containment, portraying women as both sanitizing agents and as the primary
carriers of the TB virus. In making a healthy and glamorous spectacle
of chest X-rays, these films endeavored to enlist women not only as
homemakers who would check the spread of TB at its domestic source, but
also as dutiful patients who would submit to screenings and ultimately
to sanatorium confinement (<I>SB,</I> 148-49). In a small number
of these promotional films, TB had specific racial as well as gendered
affinities. Most TB screening films featured tubercular white women;
but a few, including <I>Let My People Live</I> , and <I>Another to
Conquer</I> , featured working-class African American women, and
Navajo women, respectively, as the primary carriers of TB (<I>SB,</I>
149-50, 187 n. 17). By trading on the widespread belief that Native
Americans and African Americans possessed either constitutions or cultural
practices that left them vulnerable to TB, these promotional materials
merged the disease's gendered markers with markers of class, race, and
ethnicity. In medical films and literature of the late 1930s, the female
cadaver that graced anatomist paintings was revived in a range of living
subjects whose potential to contaminate was discovered first upon and
then under their skins.

During the early 1920s, advocates of immigration restrictions invoked
apocalyptic scenarios derived from the writings of Lothrop Stoddard, a
racialist associate of Madison Grant. Stoddard wrote of the imminent
destruction of the white race by "teeming" darker races that would
gradually out-breed them. Worldwide, "whites" would soon be supplanted
by the "colored" races that they had ostensibly come to colonize. And on
American shores, whites of "Nordic," or northern European ancestry, were
now being genetically swamped by "Alpines" and "Mediterraneans," inferior
"subspecies" of whites who were immigrating from eastern and southern
European countries. See Lothrop Stoddard, <I>The Rising Tide of Color
Against White World-Supremacy</I> (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons,
1920), 298, 309. Walter Benn Michaels argues provocatively that, while
Stoddard's white supremacist views are rehearsed, sometimes earnestly,
sometimes mockingly, in such canonical modern literary texts as <I>The
Great Gatsby,</I> Stoddard's real significance to modern literature
lies less in his flagrantly racist writings than in his eventual call
for Americans to identify themselves as a body unto themselves. In
1924, immigration quotas had been implemented to stabilize the makeup
of America's white population, and it was only after the passage of
the so-called National Origins Act that the author of <I>Re-Forging
America</I>  began to foreground the criterion of racial difference
over that of racial inferiority or superiority. For Michaels, the
"nativist pluralism" of the late 1920s, the belief that Americans
should put aside universalizing racial standards in favor of the more
locally derived standard of Americanness itself, was inseparable from
the linguistic identitarian concerns rehearsed by modern artists who
were preoccupied with the materiality of their mediums. "[N]ativism and
modernism," Michaels argues, came to be powerfully united "as efforts
to work out the meaning of the commitment to identity--linguistic,
national, cultural, racial--that . . . is common to both." (Walter Benn
Michaels, <I>Our America: Nativism, Modernism, and Pluralism</I> [Durham,
N.C.: Duke University Press: 1995], 2-3; see also 14-15, 23)
Nativist pluralism, however, appears to have been engendered through a
modulation of the category of "race" itself. Insofar as modern Americans
were inclined to trade racial for cultural awareness, they did so not only
because immigration quotas made it safe to do so, but because meaningful
racial differences had already been strategically displaced into the
more manageable confines of a struggle between "subspecies" of whites
(145 n. 22).

claiming that the "how" of my talk will be exhaustive or even particularly
compelling as a way of reading Gertrude Stein's <I>How to Write,</I>
allow me to construe the expression "How to Read <I>How to Write</I>"
appositionally, as if the two parallel, infinitive expressions "how to
read" and "how to write" were separated by one of those "servile" commas
that Stein so mistrusts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The apposition permits a desperately
interrogative tone to emerge--"How to read? How to write?"--quite at odds
with the forthright sense of Stein's title and of my own today, if rather
more faithful to most readers' experience of Stein's work of the period.

<P>
I say "most readers," but I am interested first in Stein herself. The
accounts of her past work that she provides between 1928 and 1936 or so
are indeed divided internally between prescriptive and interrogative
stances, between forms of ex-pression asserting that this is "how to
write," and forms of ex-pression much more cautiously asking how,
after all, one <I>can</I> write. There are compelling reasons for
giving this hesitation a primarily psychological explanation. These
are years in which Stein is resolutely crafting a public persona and
seeking to consolidate a reputation that seems always in danger of
being obscured by much lesser talents. Stein notoriously accomplishes
this complex project of self-legitimation socially by greatly changing
her circle of acquaintances, and intellectually and professionally
by reading and discussing her work openly, hence by normatizing her
reception, by giving it certain visible 
<B></B> 
rules, by a process one could
call self-commodification--certainly a way of establishing herself and of
fixing the value of her writing, but also, and as she saw clearly, a way
of foreclosing the subtle pleasures of an unruled reception.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

What could be more natural than that her work of the time should express
a certain hesitancy?

<P>
But it would be a mistake when approaching this self-commodification
to ignore either Stein's specific conceptual projects of the time,
or their broader discursive context. The relation these bear to each
other, and to the affective considerations I've just mentioned, remains
complex--appositional as well as predicative, the "concept" following from
the "psychology," and both from the "discursive context," but each also
apposed to the others. "Apposition" and "predication" may seem cavalier
in this context, but note that Stein herself provides strong grounds for
applying broadly the rather restricted grammatical terminology with which
I opened. With <I>How to Write</I> Stein begins to address specifically
the relation between paragraphs and sentences--roughly aligned, as she
describes it, with the affective difference between the emotional and
the nonemotional, between the natural and the nonnatural. That alignment
of grammatical and linguistic terms with affective and organic states
is enough to suggest briefly that the question or injunction "how to
write" concerns also a disposition toward experience: how to write how
to live. Allow me then to underscore four aspects of the imbrication
of the grammatical and the autobiographical projects in the years
surrounding <I>How to Write</I>'s publication. In the first place,
Stein's reflections at this time upon the passage between the form of
the sentence and the form of the paragraph cannot be dissociated from
the project of self-legitimation she carried out in and through those
very texts. The discursive models available to her for construing the
passage from "sentence" to "paragraph" had also to serve to construe the
process of self-legitimation, and vice-versa--or else be set aside. In
the second place, the "legitimacy" derived from these two projects would
necessarily be <I>formally</I> tied to the question of the normative
status of the <I>example</I> (of Stein's work). When Stein answers
the question "how does one write?" <I>by example,</I> her work serves
both as a singularity (that is, an instance whose authority is drawn
from Stein's exceptionality) <I>and</I> as an instance of a broader
concept (the question or injunction bears upon a general dilemma,
of which Stein is an instance among many--exemplary precisely in not
being singular). In the third place, and relatedly, notice that the
project of self-legitimation has an irreducibly temporal dimension:
earlier works are narratively characterized as leading to the one in
which they are being discussed--<I>The Making of Americans</I> and
"Melanctha" leading gradually to "The Gradual Making of the Making of
Americans<I>,"</I> to "Poetry and Grammar" and to <I>How to Write,</I>
and so on--and that story is inflected with an eye to what interest may
accrue to the narrator from its outcome. In that sense, the narrative
of the emergence or the arrival--a word whose importance for Stein I
hope to make clearer below--of an instance of subjectivity is radically
perfective, "completely completing," as Stein says elsewhere, just as any
injunctive or any pedagogical project is radically <I>infinitive</I>:
"how I wrote," "how I write," "how I will write" underlie the more
general question of how to write. 
<B></B> 
So too does the relation between
the sentence and the paragraph have an irreducibly temporal dimension,
though the exact nature of that relation is not yet established, and
may not finally be easy to square with more conventional narratives of
legitimation. In the fourth place, and <I>if</I> one grants that the
perfective shape of Stein's self-commodification can indeed arrive at
any sort of infinitive, general case, <I>if</I> one grants the elision
of the singular, authorizing instance with the general condition, then
Stein's reading of Stein can function as a determining example for
subsequent efforts to read Stein--and hence the question (or is it a
description?) of "how to write" bears also and perhaps primarily upon
how <I>we</I> write about Stein today.

<P>
I say "if," because although there is no reason in principle to
concede these propositions, especially as they might only derive from
the particular anxieties of the historical Gertrude Stein, neither can
they be dismissed or even classified as merely particular anxieties to
be apposed to the conceptualization of writing in high modernism, or to
the problem of the value-form in the language of economics between the
wars. The knot of fantasy that Stein's grammar of self-commodification
ties for us bears crucially upon the <I>historical</I> constitution of
the passage from particularity to generality in descriptive discourses, of
the passage from events as such to their grammar or their morphology, of
the passage from instance to example or (commodity) value (the value that
one ascribes to a body of work). It bears, in short, on how after Stein
we learn to read and write the story of the value of a thing--a life, for
example, or a name. How does commodity-value accrue to a name? According
to what rules and necessities? To what <I>grammar</I>? To what time? What
follows here is a brief sketch of the knot of fantasy that <I>How to
Write</I> ties from these questions, and which Stein seeks to teach us
how to cut as we read <I>How to Write.</I>

<P>
1. This is a general way to tell this story. In order to pass from
sentence to paragraph, and in order to establish the value of her work,
Stein crosses the languages of economics and of psychoanalysis with a
reflection upon the philosophical problem of naming that has much in
common with the roughly contemporaneous projects of Bertrand Russell and
Ludwig Wittgenstein. In particular, Stein draws upon and complicates
a model of structural reserve common to those languages and to the
dominant formulations of the problem of naming in the first quarter
of this century. By "structural reserve" I mean two things, and I mean
them in two ways. In the first place, I mean the conceptual practice in
classical, Ricardian economics of indexing commodity value against a
"mystical" constant. This constant determines the nature of commodity
exchange, and is itself nonexchangeable (no other constant will do in
its place) and not susceptible to accidental changes of value. This
indexing constant does not have to exist visibly or concretely; it
can be understood as a metacommodity held in reserve abstractly,
perfectively producible in the last instance, whose "intrinsic value"
is entirely secondary to its functional value as a standard<I>.</I> The
debate in England and the United States in the years between 1928 and
1939 about the return to the gold standard for currency, and the first
desubstantializations of the index-category of labor in Fredrick Taylor
and Isaac Rubin, were in fact the more 
<B></B> 
restricted case of the broader
anxiety about the stability of commodity values that followed the vast
inflation of the late Weimar and the economic disasters of the late
1920s. The concurrent aesthetico-political debate over the legacies of
early modernism cannot be separated from these broader crises in the
conceptualization of the value-form.

<P>
By "structural reserve" I mean also the determining, resistant
<I>opacity</I> of concepts of the unconscious, or of the unconscious
<I>tout court,</I> in the languages of psychoanalysis following the
publication of <I>The Interpretation of Dreams.</I> I hardly need to
review the analogy between indexing constants in commodity exchange on one
hand, and on the other the construction that classical psychoanalysis puts
upon the originary structuring of libidinal economies (whether according
to a theory of types or according to one of drives); the analogy is
already very much a part of the dominant languages of psychoanalysis
and of economics at the time that Stein begins <I>How to Write,</I> and
the peculiar futures of the term "fetish" attest to its endurance. The
unconscious is indeed the most influential model of the "reserve"
of this century; the explanatory primacy granted in Freud's writing
through <I>Moses and Monotheism</I> to the universality of the Oedipus
complex is perhaps the most notorious instance of the fetishization of a
libidinal object-choice as a <I>constant</I>; finally, Freud's comments
on the coprophilic ground of the gift and consequently of economies of
value have by 1928 become an uncomfortable pendant to classical economic
theory in some circles. One does not have to search long to discover this
structure of "reserve" at work in William James's prescient definition
of the "nucleus of the 'me,'" which is "always the bodily existence felt
to be present at the time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Alongside and determining of any
appropriative act of recollection or cognition, this "bodily existence
felt to be present at the time" exists as <I>feeling</I> and never as
thought; that is, it is never present to consciousness except imperfectly,
and its <I>present</I> is the rational hypothesis of that imperfection,
kept as a notional and regulative moment <I>for</I> consciousness but
temporally <I>excluded from</I> the horizon of consciousness.

<P>
From this general account, bear in mind both the notion of a
<I>structural</I> reserve--that determining excess of the (economic or
psychic) structure with respect to individuals (or to individual acts)
within that structure--and the complex reliance on <I>temporality</I>
that the economic and the psychoanalytic model of the reserve
share. (The reserve, whether the content of the "unconscious," the
"drive," or the index-commodity, has no "present" and no "presence,"
except as an unbounded field of ruled effects--of transactions,
substitutions, investments, and counterinvestments of value and of sense:
a <I>grammatical</I> field, in brief--either of the constant that remains
to be disclosed in the last instance, or of a primal repression.)

<P>
And again, I mean this story in two ways. In the first place, as
a description of the discourses available to Stein in constructing
a commodity-image of herself, and in making the conceptual passage
from sentence to paragraph. But I also mean it as a description of the
constitutive elements of that fantasy we call "Stein" today. For note
that the detour through the reserve in commodity-value indexing and
in psychoanalysis 
<B></B> 
has not taken us far from the question of Stein's
exemplarity. Stein's readings of <I>How to Write</I> can be examples
only if they bear a relation to a general concept to which <I>other</I>
readings, our own included, can be related, or against which they can
be indexed. The authority of Stein's singularity--the pendant ground of
her commodity-value--derives from the foreclosure of that concept, its
displacement from the arena of exchange and capitalization into that of
the uneconomizable, primal represession. What is the paradoxical nature
of this "reserve" of exemplary value in Stein?

<P>
2. Here is another account of that story. Let me tell you the unhelpful
punchline first, then fill in the events that lead to it. Grammar is
the "reserve" of value in Stein, exceeding but enabling her work's
self-commodification as well as the emergence of "emotion" in her
writing. The concluding lines of Stein's "More Grammar for a Sentence"
make clear what <I>How to Write</I> obscures: that the passage between
sentence and paragraph concerns the relation between the grammar of
expressions and the claims of ontology.

<P>
In these lines the definition of identity as repetition--the coming-back
of the sentence, its meeting-itself-again-as-itself, the re-cognition
of the sentence--is made to contrast with the "arrival" and "finishing"
of the paragraph. And yet the paragraph is made up of sentences: at some
point, and through some means, apposed sentences--which, being identical
to themselves, finally express nothing other than that identity itself: "A
sentence is a sentence"--these apposed sentences seem to <I>arrive</I> at
the paragraph, to be perfected in it. Note the different possible models
Stein provides and rejects for this process of perfecting. In the first
place, an enumeration--if a paragraph is not a single sentence, neither
is it "many more" sentences "exactly," as this "many more" would not in
principle be closed, finished. A paragraph must, it seems, finish; what
"exactly" that "finishing" consists of is not yet clear, but it cannot
simply mean either that a paragraph exhausts the number of sentences or
that it completes a series of (numerically) related sentences. In the
second place, a relation of part to whole--a sentence is not a part of
a paragraph, if by "part" one merely means that an additive principle is
"added" to the sentences so as to yield the paragraph. In the third place,
a subsumptive relation between sentences and "[r]ival" sentences that
merely "arrive," that merely "come and meet" the sentence as a repetition
that is also a rivalry. "[I]f they are happy," such rival sentences do
indeed "meet" the sentence, arrive at it, and become its contradictory
repetitions. But Stein forecloses this route immediately when she shifts
tenses to the past or to the subjunctive: 
<B></B> 
"[I]f they were happy," she
writes--and how does one decide whether the statement is a descriptive,
historical account or a counterfactual one? Because "happiness" has no
present indicative tense, such meetings end unhappily, Stein suggests:
"They will part"; no amount of rivalry, no persistence of the conflict
or the negation will ever manage to produce the finished and finishing
paragraph from the unhappiness of the sentence.

<P>
One recognizes in these three discarded strategies the intricately
related philosophical positions of Humean skepticism, Coleridgean
transcendentalism, and a Hegelian procedure of negation. Stein's
solution in "More Grammar for a Sentence," as in <I>How to Write,</I> is
quite different. When she writes that "a paragraph finishes" she takes
advantage of the double aspect of the term "finishes," functioning both
as a defining attribute of the paragraph itself (a paragraph is that
substance or that substantive that comes to an end) and as a transitive
verb (a paragraph ends or finishes <I>something</I>). This transitive
aspect is itself unfinished in Stein's formulation (what is it that the
paragraph "finishes"?), and for that reason it never "meets" the first
sentence when it arrives ("a paragraph [is that which] finishes"), and
never "arrives" as "a rival": the object of the predication falls outside
of the act, and because one cannot decide grammatically which aspect of
these sentences is primary, the paragraph never itself "returns"; it is
never identical to itself in the way that "a sentence is a sentence." The
paradox remains acute, until one realizes that the sentence "a paragraph
finishes" must also be a paragraph, but that this "must be" does not
designate any traditional form of identity, or necessity. The copulas
in the statement "A sentence is a sentence" and in "the sentence 'A
paragraph finishes' is a paragraph" do not in fact "meet" as one, but
neither are they "rivals."

<P>
Say instead that Stein is laying stress upon the term "arrive." "A
sentence is a sentence," Stein writes. "This may be but it is not with
arrive. Arrival. A Rival Sentence." By "not with <I>arrive</I>" she
must mean something that precedes the construction of "arrival" as the
arrival of a "Rival Sentence" or of a substance, what could be called a
prepredicative and presubstantial event: an aspect or a predisposition of
the grammar that stresses the verb precisely in the infinitive form "to
arrive," the form that, like the paragraph, unfinishes the present. Where
does "arrive" arrive from, before its inevitable substantialization? The
tense gives us an indication: "This may be but it is not": "arrive" <I>may
be,</I> that is, it may "arrive" in the future and from the future, in the
double sense that it is permitted (only) to arrive from or in the future,
but also in the conditional sense that it may or may not arrive. How
can the reserve of grammar be both prepredicative and presubstantial,
<I>and</I> imagined conditionally as arriving from and in the future? Do
not forget that the question is also ontological, that something else is
substantialized here: that which is met or will be met, in the insistent
narrative of meeting that is both grammatical and descriptive, is nothing
less than "me" and "my" excitement or emotion. "Grammar" is the mystical
reserve-form governing and adding value to the story of how "me" arrives
on the scene between sentence and paragraph, from what that passage
holds back, as both the precondition and the future of an act of writing. 
<B></B>

<P>
3. There is another story told in <I>How to Write</I> in which "me" never
quite arrives and is never quite met. The account of this failed meeting
no longer concerns grammar alone, the grammar of a field of effects,
or the grammar of self-legitimation, and it crops up just where Stein
disjoins "narrative" from "grammar." "I am a grammarian," Stein writes
in the short section of <I>How to Write</I> called "A Grammarian"--and
then she proceeds to parse that proposition, to decline it into "I am a
grammarian in place," "I do not hesitate but I rearrange prepositions,"
"I believe in duplicates," "A grammarian is so," "I think of the
differences there are," and a number of other statements.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

She also provides a set of short propositions about grammar itself:
"The essence of grammar is that it is freed of following" (<I>HW,</I>
106), "Grammar does not play a part" (<I>HW,</I> 108), "Grammar little
by little is not a thing" (<I>HW,</I> 108), and so on. Set aside the
particulars of these propositions, and questions crop up pertaining
to the temporal and causative relation between "I" and its grammatical
articulation: what is the relation between the two sets of definitions
or pseudodefinitions of grammar? Does grammar provide the means by which
"I" becomes one or another thing--a grammarian, for example? Does the
subject of "I am" precede its grammatical articulation? Which pre-poses
the other? At the center of the section Stein seems to provide one
answer, in the shape of an identity: "The subject is grammar" (<I>HW,</I>
106), she writes--apparently broadening the initial statement so as
to render "I am a grammarian" as "I is grammar," and so as to make
all questions of the relation between the two terms a (moot) matter of
definition alone. Apposed, neither poses nor defines the other. And yet
this assertion of identity between subject and grammar is manifestly
inadequate to the complexity of Stein's position, even if one takes
into account the secondary senses of "subject" as "grammatical subject"
and as "subject matter." What this specular or repetitive structure
lacks is briefly, unsystematically hinted at: "On the edge of grammar
is why they make things" (<I>HW,</I> 109), "Forget grammar and think
about potatoes" (<I>HW,</I> 109), and "Now think of the difference of
repeat and duplicate" (<I>HW,</I> 110). This "edge" of grammar, this
"forgetting" of grammar, and this "difference" of "repeat and duplicate"
form the beginning of a thought about the ways in which grammar may not
quite "meet" or "arrive at" itself, and about the "why" of "making," about
the "thinking" that attends this nonidentity to itself of grammar. What
does grammar--the reserve of a writing understood to "make" things like
"emotion," "paragraphs," and incidentally "me"--itself hold in "reserve"?

<P>
Difficulties with Stein's argument immediately surface. In what way does
the nonidentity to itself of grammar "make" anything, without falling into
the "snare of language"--the expression comes from <I>On the Genealogy
of Morals</I>--that makes all "making" into the predicate of a necessary
agent?
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Does this nonidentity then serve as something akin
(again) to that notional, mystified "neutral agent" kept in reserve
"behind" all "doing," in Nietzsche's marvelous words?
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

If the infinitive "to repeat" is a temporal, phenomenal category,
"duplicate" in its substantive form is not--and this difference can
then be thought according to grammatical categories (tense, case). And
yet the grammaticization of their difference, of their "edge," is again
clearly 
<B></B> 
inadequate to Stein's argument, as it merely repeats the naive,
predicative construction of "subject" and "grammar" that this section
of <I>How to Write</I> brings into question. With these questions left
polemically unanswered, "A Grammarian" closes, and at this point one is
inclined to understand this section's last sentences as an acknowledgment
of failure, the graceful balancing of "it" and "you" as stylistic rather
than conceptual: "It stops because you stop. Think of that. You stop
because you have made other arrangements" (<I>HW,</I> 111).

<P>
Here is the next chapter of Stein's story. Consider these lines from
the opening of "Poetry and Grammar":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I really do not know that anything has ever been more exciting than
diagraming sentences. I suppose other things may be more exciting to
others when they are at school but to me undoubtedly when I was at school
the really completely exciting thing was diagraming sentences and that
has been to me ever since the one thing that has been completely exciting
and completely completing. I like the feeling the everlasting feeling
of sentences as they diagram themselves. In that way one is completely
possessing something and incidentally one's self. ["PG," 210-11]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Much diagraming of these sentences could indeed be done, though it
is not clear that one could thereby ever touch the extraordinary,
mysterious use of "excitement" to refer to so mechanical a project. Note
the conclusion: the "incidental" possession of "one's self"--the
"arrival" and substantialization of "me" that we saw in "More Grammar
for a Sentence"--derives from the "everlasting feeling of sentences as
they diagram themselves." Stein's remark should not be overlooked as a
commonplace either of modernist aesthetics, subordinating the subject to
a primary cultural material that defines its attributes and extension, or
of a Jamesian critique of transcendental psychology. The paragraph shifts
one's sense of the "I" of which it seems so firmly possessed throughout,
the concrete autobiographical "I", Gertrude Stein's "I." It first allows
us to grasp in familiar, resolutely phenomenological terms the child's
experience of diagraming sentences, and then requires that this possession
be understood as the infantile precursor of what is still enjoyed. The
self becomes incidental to the process, its contingent effect--and the
"feeling <I>of</I> sentences as they diagram themselves" poses the
agency and the emotion of the moment where they least belong--in the
self-diagraming of the sentence. "Diagraming sentences" turns out not
to be a case of what "I" do, but itself the subject and object of a
"doing" of which "I" am the incidental product.

<P>
It's important to understand Stein's use of the term "incidentally." The
self is possessed incidentally to the self-diagraming of the sentence and
to the "feeling of sentences" in both subjective and objective senses. The
scopic pleasure of witnessing, rather than the active pleasure of doing
the parsing, incidentally produces a pleasure from which the possession
of the self arrives. By "incidentally" Stein must mean, precisely,
agrammatically, that the possession of the self arrives outside a
regulated or economized field of effects. This scene from "Poetry and
Grammar" allows the 
<B></B> 
name--any name, and "Gertrude Stein" in particular--to
forget its infinitive case, and this forgetting "incidentally" poses two
<I>specific</I> selves for us and for Stein to possess: the persona of
the schoolgirl whose enjoyment of the "diagraming of sentences" links her
substantially rather than appositionally to the persona of the speaker,
the adult Gertrude Stein; and the persona of the author of <I>How to
Write,</I> linked substantially to the Stein who in "Poetry and Grammar"
establishes the value of, then takes up, "diagrams," and clarifies her
earlier theses. The restricted question of the imbrication of grammar
and autobiography, self-legitimation or self-commodification, turns not
only upon the abstract question of grammar's incidental or fundamental
connection to the possession of the self, but also upon the role that
the "diagraming of sentences" plays in producing a self for Stein to
possess, a self that can be possessed as a thing is possessed--in a
word, and as she has just told us, a named self. The excitement of and
capitalization upon names and naming is for Stein no longer a matter of
grammar, sentences, paragraphs, or prose, but of <I>poetry.</I>

<P>
Stein writes that prosaic nouns are given or called out once to name the
object, after which they stay the same. To read and write poetry is,
however, to attend to a second call, a sort of echo: poetry dwells on
the noun, returns to the love of naming. "You can love a name," Stein
writes in "Poetry and Grammar," "and if you love a name then saying
that name any number of times only makes you love it more. . . . And so
that is poetry really loving the name of anything and that is not prose"
("PG," 231-32). The story that Stein tells in "Poetry and Grammar"
has an ascetic shape comparable to the brief <I>Bildungsroman</I> that
attends the child's "diagraming of sentences." First, one classically,
prosaically, calls the object by name--one nominalizes it. Then one
calls that name insistently in the place of the thing named, on the model
of a fetish-love. Finally, one feels so strongly about the thing named
that one produces the thing and the name no longer as stand-ins for each
other, but as separate expressions whose connection is not based on any
"inner balance" but on qualities intrinsic to both the name and the thing
in itself. This position is at least superficially a vulgar Kantian,
or perhaps more properly a roughly Wittgensteinian, position. Take, for
instance, the question of the noun, the act of naming, that first "call"
or "calling." Stein seems to be moving toward an argument that the noun
can be dispensed with as a definition for the object; in place of such
a definition, and as the language of "love" and "feeling" suggests, she
would be proposing something like a calling or an indication, or perhaps
that every "calling" of an object or a concept by name apposes to the
active verb an infinitive inflection to the "call." Wittgenstein refers
to this as an ostensive function--an act of definition by means of an
implicit, and implicitly public, act of ostension: "This is it," as Stein
puts it in closing "More Grammar for a Sentence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The name
accordingly does not "stand in" for a concrete object, but rather it
ostensively indicates--"This"--a fuzzily bordered concept--"it"--whose
correspondence to the object <I>is part of</I> the language game (whose
rules are pragmatic, that is, they are not held formulated in reserve,
but are always at play in a process of testing). Such games hold only
three things in reserve: a procedure 
<B></B> 
for checking and an injunction to
do so (this is not the same thing as verifying, since one is checking
on the communicative value of propositions, not on their agreement with
an established real), the criterion of communication as the horizon for
any language use, and a regulative disposition toward a future in which
the rules of the language game could be seen or glanced over.

<P>
Call this ascetic narrative a movement toward <I>poetry,</I>
lodged at the "edge" between grammar and its temporal extension in
narrative. This movement toward the ostensive structure of poetic
naming in turn provokes another crisis. The economic and psychological
burden of the lectures, and of "Poetry and Grammar" in particular, is
the production and commodification of a name--"Stein"--as necessary
rather than contingent, as <I>nonincidental</I> to the diagraming of
(Stein's previous) sentences. The commodity-value of the early Stein
must stand indexed to a form held in reserve throughout her work--as the
excitement of witnessing sentences diagram themselves becomes intrinsic
to the substantial identity of the child and the older writer. Again
Hume comes to mind. <I>How to Write</I> must be read in "Poetry and
Grammar" from the vantage of the prosaic relation between sentence and
paragraph. "Poetry and Grammar" thus completes the earlier work rather
than being simply apposed to it. This "completely completing" of the
old in the new (to return to the language of "Poetry and Grammar"),
though, requires that the strong notion of the incidental possession of
the self--what in the <I>Treatise of Human Nature</I> Hume discusses
as the solution to the vulgar "confounding" of the ideas of identity
and of diversity in judgments concerning natural objects--be banished
from the present and placed forever in a "reserve" that has no present,
to which no name can be given, and that cannot work necessarily to
<I>give</I> a name, to dwell lovingly upon one, or to value, with the
terrible poetic force of the fetish, a name already given.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

For the conceptual burden of both <I>How to Write</I> and of "Poetry
and Grammar" is to show the necessity of the incidental appearance of
"me," to show that the "incidental" arrival of the self is an event of
naming that keeps working lovingly after the name is given, that is,
that the arrival of the self is a perpetually repeated event of poetic
naming, the contingent form of the permanent refetishization of the noun
with respect to the substance that it organizes.

<P>
This reserved form no longer works in the way "grammar" does for Stein;
neither can it be called "poetry" in any simple sense. Not, of course,
that Stein's definition is finally so simple. The notion of poetry
that Stein advances in "Poetry and Grammar" extends the act of naming
into a series of repeated occurrences or events: the call or the name
endlessly--infinitively--changes the (value of the) thing, and that
"effect" of the name on the thing named names the temporality of their
relation. Infinitively, but also incidentally: poetry's "love" of the name
affects the thing named contingently rather than necessarily, "meeting"
or "arriving" at it to find it elsewhere again. The contradiction is
now stark. From the point of view of the <I>self,</I> of "me," poetic
temporality has the shape of a narrative, the narrative of a common
experience of pleasure or pain on which the substantial identity of
the self can be posed as a thing 
<B></B> 
to be possessed and enjoyed, whether
in retrospect or in the determining image of a "completely completing"
future. But from the point of view of the <I>name</I> that supports the
fiction or the narrative of the self, this temporality is not associated
with narrative but with repetition or with Stein's word "duplicate"
in both the substantive and the verbal sense, with the paradoxically
repeated, contingent event of the call of the name. Or, to return to
Stein's terms, the self produces as an attribute of the self the narrative
of its origination and "completing," but this narrative is contingently,
"incidentally," related to the production and possession of the self. In
the unbounded pleasure of the sentence that diagrams itself, the self is
incidentally named and possessed repeatedly without thereby "meeting" or
"arriving at" itself.

<P>
Let me conclude by giving you an example that may help to clarify why
it is so disruptive to make of poetry's love of the name anything like
the reserve-form or the index-commodity with which to gauge the self's
possession. In "Arthur a Grammar," among the most baffling sections of
<I>How to Write,</I> Stein interrupts her consideration of grammar with
these words: "Narrative is it for one. Narrative conceived and developed
really only filling and so not connected with for grammar." (<I>HW,</I>
70) The pleasures one can derive from such diagraming are not slight. They
include the comforting sense that "for one," that is, for the sort of
self that one can name and possess and that the enjoyment of "grammar"
is supposed to produce contingently, narrative is it, that "one" need
not go past narrative, itself "not connected with for grammar." This
is a far more familiar account than the impersonal story of incidental
production in "More Grammar for a Sentence" or in "Poetry and Grammar":
"narrative" here seems the royal way to arrive at "me" or "one." Not all
of this diagraming is pleasurable, however, or at any rate one should
recognize that the pleasures and excitements of this sentence are wrought
with propositions whose perplexities derive from the distinction between
the sentence's grammar and its "incidental" naming of a subject and a
self. For the complex core of the first sentence--"Narrative is it for
one"--turns not upon the fuzziness of the concepts ostensibly indicated
by "it" or "one," but on the grammatical indistinguishability between
a principle of substitution ("it" for "one" or "narrative" for "it")
and a principle of elimination organizing the relation between those
concepts--"Narrative is it for one" in the sense in which one says,
"That's it for you, buddy." "It" for "one" then replaces an impersonal
for a (nominally) personal pronoun, though one already torn between
singularity ("one") and generality ("one" as in "anyone" or "everybody,"
as the title to Stein's 1936 <I>Everybody's Autobiography</I> already
suggests); Stein thereby tells the characteristically modernist story
of the becoming-thing or becoming-"it" of "one," a story about the
subject's alienation familiar in the years before World War II from the
languages of political economy (Luk&aacute;cs and other Left Hegelians)
and psychoanalysis. Surely she registers too some anxiety in this
decade of self-promotion about her own desire to change her status
as a cultural commodity, some anxiety about becoming a mere "it" in
the literary market, after having belonged as "one." Anxiety: for in
contrast to the contemporaneous treatments of economic and political
alienation, 
<B></B> 
Stein's "it"--"narrative," if that's it--spells the end of
a model of the self as "one," but without substituting in its place any
other pronoun, noun, or subject (class or revolutionary consciousness,
aesthetic panhistoricism &agrave; la Pound, or even the shattered
Freudian "subject"). Narrative conceived in this sense, conceived with
an irreducible "reserve" of something like grammaticality, is indeed
"it" for "one." Narrative is a principle of impersonal repetition at
the heart of every singularity, of every instance of autobiography, of
narrative construction, of self-legitimation. Stein, who discovers well
before Lacan and Zizek that the object is a
fetish of the name, itself the fetish-form of the primal infinitive "to
name," poses the object "me"--herself, but also her notional readers,
consumers of the commodity-form "Gertrude Stein"--in the regressive
narrative of the refusal of (the arrival of) poetry, a narrative that
allows the name to substantialize and hence forget its infinitive case, a
narrative that could neither read nor write a sentence like "Narrative is
it for one," a narrative, finally, that can neither read nor write <I>How
to Write.</I> The burden this poses for <I>us</I> is triply heavy. Not
only are we readers of Stein deprived of every normative example, and
of every comfort, for learning how to read and how to value <I>How to
Write;</I> not only are we denied the pleasures of the "incidental"
posing and "possession of self" that might derive from grammatical or
diagrammatical criticism of "Stein"; but we can no longer rest assured
that the "Stein" we think we read is "one," or even that another "Stein"
remains mystically elsewhere, in reserve, always before one as she lies
before us, an unspoken and unnarratable "it" for every "one" who seeks
to learn how to read (and) how to write.

Randall Jarrell (1914-65), American poet, critic, and teacher, was
a refractory heir of high modernism. His genealogy is clearly traceable
to T. S. Eliot via John Crowe Ransom and Allen Tate, but if he was an
apt pupil he was also a wayward disciple, both in his criticism and
in his poetry. Though his reviews of fellow poets inspired fear and
respect--so fierce and devastating were his witty dismissals, so incisive
his praise--his poetry has often been dismissed as sentimental. Bristling
with ambition and competitiveness, he nonetheless preferred to more
prestigious appointments his position at a small southern woman's
college. He suffered fools badly and impatiently but was legendary
for his kindness as a teacher of the unsophisticated. His longtime
colleague Peter Taylor described his "irrepressible" laughter as "cruel
<I>and/or</I> gleeful," a combination that typified his personality and
was sometimes bewildering to his intimates.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>


<P>
Reviewing his career, one is reminded of the climactic lines of his
poem "A Girl in a Library": "and yet--and yet."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 These
apparent contradictions result in part from Jarrell's testy and
self-conscious resistance to pigeonholing. As he wrote the war poems
that established his reputation with <I>Little Friend, Little Friend</I>
 and <I>Losses</I> , he sighed to his first wife Mackie
in a letter that in the next war he would seek "an executive position
with the Campfire Girls."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 He provocatively declared to the
conscientiously masculine Allen Tate that he himself had a "semifeminine
mind."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Elizabeth Bishop described him, forgivingly, as
"difficult, touchy" (<I>RJ,</I> 20).

<P>
Behind these stubborn idiosyncrasies lie Jarrell's quarrels with the
categories that constituted American modernism between 1932, when he
enrolled as a student at Vanderbilt, and 1965, the year of his death. His
aesthetic values were shaped by, but also consciously contrary to, the
increasingly professionalized form of literary criticism (usually labelled
"New Criticism") that came to dominate university teaching during those
years. He developed and sharpened that aesthetic for nearly twenty years
in a classroom populated exclusively by women, a point that has been noted
but never sufficiently studied.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 If John Guillory is right
in asserting that "the social space of literary culture is necessarily
<I>institutional,</I>" then attention to the particulars of where, how,
and to whom modernist poetry was taught ought to constitute a significant
chapter in literary history.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 By considering the sources of
Jarrell's contrariness and by analyzing his investment in his students,
I seek to complicate that history. My analysis of his career, viewed
in the context of high-modernist influence on criticism, poetry, and
education in the 1940s and 1950s, furnishes a necessary reminder that
neither modernism nor New Criticism--nor indeed the academy itself--is
a monolithic institution.

<P>
The classroom matters to modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 The American strain of
modernist poetry and criticism was, from its earliest phases, aware
of and to a crucial degree dependent upon the schools.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<I>Pace</I> Ezra Pound's gleeful announcement to Harriet Monroe that
T. S. Eliot had "actually trained himself <I>and</I> modernised
himself <I>on his own,</I>" the evidence is not weighted toward
autodidacticism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Instead, one may see the imprint of
the intellectual ivy league everywhere, not only in allusions to the
curriculum (philology, Dante, cultural anthropology, and so on) but also
in the expectation that poetry, to be serious, must have intellectual
heft. The ideal reader of the modernist poem must bring the fruits of
higher education to the poems, or be willing to do the homework necessary
to take those fruits away from the poem. Either way, the reader is
exchanging what Guillory and others have called cultural capital. Over
time, this demanding dimension of modernist poetry has become linked
to the name of T. S. Eliot, who has provided a serviceable icon/straw
man either for celebrating what Richard Poirier has called the famous
"difficulties" of modernism or for unmasking those difficulties as
covert intellectual fascism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 And of course Eliot has been
widely mythologized as the father-re responsible for New Criticism,
which dominated American classrooms throughout the years under analysis
here. As literary historians investigate the legacies of modernism, then,
colleges and universities will be necessary objects of that analysis.

<P>
The story of Eliot's association with New Criticism and its ascendancy
in the American academy is one of the sturdiest narratives of modernist
scholarship. The plot includes Jarrell's own entry into the academy. In
its most schematic form, a crucial chapter of that narrative goes
as follows: In 1937 John Crowe Ransom proposes to Allen Tate that
"the professors are in an awful dither trying to reform themselves and
there's a big stroke possible for a small group that knows what it wants
in giving them ideas and definitions and showing the way."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

In 1938 Ransom moves from Vanderbilt to Kenyon, founds the <I>Kenyon
Review,</I> becomes director of the Kenyon School of English. Two of
Ransom's former students, Cleanth Brooks and Robert 
<B></B> 
Penn Warren, publish
<I>Understanding Poetry</I> in 1938, and Brooks publishes <I>Modern
Poetry and the Tradition</I> in 1939. By this series of events, a new
kind of "university-based criticism" is, as Gerald Graff expresses it,
"disseminat[ed]."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Despite some initial resistance among more
traditional scholars (philologists, literary historians and biographers,
and the like), the methods of the so-called New Criticism achieve wide
acceptance and the professors cease to be uncertain about their methods
and mission.

<P>
Even in much less condensed versions of this history, certain elements
remain consistent: the project was tied to schools from its inception; it
aimed to garner respect for the reading and writing of poetry, rescuing
both from their reputations as pursuits for dithering professors and
society ladies; it sought to protect literary criticism from charges
of subjectivity by replacing appreciation with analysis; the leading
textbook of the era led to a codified teaching method that strongly
favored text over context; and--finally (as Graff's verb implies)--not
only the leaders of the project but most of the influential students were
male. Jarrell studied at both Vanderbilt and Kenyon during the seminal
years (1932-39), published his earliest work in magazines edited
by either Ransom or Brooks and Warren, and received his first academic
appointment at the University of Texas on the strength of Ransom's,
Tate's, and Warren's recommendations; thus his early career intersects
at key points with this tale of the modernist tribe.

<P>
Recent scholarship has taken this narrative seriously by questioning and
attempting to revise it. Terry Eagleton and Harold Bloom, for instance,
see modernism's influence in the universities, particularly influence of
the Eliotic variety, as a pernicious strain of authoritarian cultural
ideology.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 The linking of modernist poetry with formalist
criticism becomes in this view elitist and repressive, an instance
of the predictable practices of a self-referring and self-promoting
privileged class. In another kind of critique, feminist scholars have
devoted their energies to exploring and complicating the phallocentrism of
the received narrative: recovering the erased female contributors to the
modernist project, analyzing the misogynistic rhetoric of its manifestos,
examining the gender preferences of its aesthetic values.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

Both kinds of critical approaches have enriched and usefully complicated
the portrait of what modernism was.

<P>
Paradoxically, however, the vigorous rewriting of modernist literary
history has had the effect of reifying the old narrative. And, as
revisionists chip away at the monument of high modernism, some important
features are defaced. The result is a kind of amnesia about dimensions
of modernism not defined by male-dominated, high-culture axiology,
particularly when the re under consideration is male. Michael Levenson
argues that "modernism was individualist before it was anti-individualist,
anti-traditional before it was traditional, inclined to anarchism before
it was inclined to authoritarianism," and there is ample evidence that
these insurgent energies never entirely disappear, despite the reactionary
elements that evolve out of revolutionary beginnings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

The oppositional forces within modernism are particularly apparent
when we study books like Shari Benstock's <I>Women of the Left
Bank.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 But such subversion, innovation, and excitement
tend in current criticism to be attributed to the 
<B></B> 
women of modernism,
not the men, and certainly not to the southern sons of Ransom and Tate.

<P>
Clearly, Jarrell doesn't belong on the Left Bank. He neither drank
nor smoked, felt uncomfortable at parties, and was something of a
homebody, attached to his wife and his cat. Like other poets of his
generation, he struggled with mental illness, but compared to the more
operatic Robert Lowell, for example, his troubles were for the most
part undramatic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 However, if Jarrell seems misplaced
as a bohemian, neither does he fit comfortably into the discourses
of tradition, authoritarianism, and conservatism so often used to
describe his teachers. His politics were marxist, not Agrarian. His
poems are often talky and inconclusive rather than dense and tightly
organized. Indeed his poetic practice veers so sharply away from the
complex, paradoxical, densely allusive, and highly finished aesthetic
favored by textbook New Criticism as to suggest an explanation for his
status as a minor poet. John Berryman complimented his "neglect" of theory
about either poetry or criticism at a time when a systematic critical
vocabulary was becoming established in both journals and classrooms
(<I>RJ,</I> 13).
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 And finally, as a teacher, he chose to
spend his time with Greensboro women, not Princeton men. These less
than predictable choices, I suggest, are conscious choices, made with
full recognition of both their symbolic value and their likely effect
on his reputation. His conception of theory and literary criticism, his
attitude toward his students, and his conscientious unpredictability are
intertwined because all of them are responses to what he perceived as
the professionalization of poetry. Literary and academic culture were
increasingly inseparable spheres in the period from 1935 to 1960; for
Jarrell, they were an unholy alliance that brought corporate practices
into the study and the classroom. He aligned himself instead with those
unbusinesslike values--sentimentality, femininity, gentility--that
modernism had sought to jettison.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>


<P>
A key word for understanding Jarrell's choices is "sentimentality." The
<I>New York Times</I> review of Jarrell's last book of poetry, <I>The Lost
World</I> , accused the poems of flatness, passivity, tear-jerking,
dismissing the poems as "indulgent and sentimental Mama-ism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

The cruel tone of such responses was devastating to Jarrell, but the
message cannot have been entirely new to him. Mentors and peers had
complained in letters that somehow his poems lacked backbone, and
critics had been concerned about the "voice" of his poems since the
1948 volume <I>Losses.</I> In reviewing it, W. S. Graham complained that
the poems were "loose and casual" and that Jarrell was a sucker for the
"pseudo-profound."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Himself a regular reviewer of poetry,
Jarrell knew the literary climate, knew what was likely to be admired,
and yet he repeatedly turned to the rather unpromising subject matters of
childhood, fairy tales, and sad women--in short, to subjects associated
with naive or sentimental storytelling.

<P>
The tendency of the sentimental to occasion queasiness may be measured
in the entry for "sentimentality" in <I>The New Princeton Encyclopedia of
Poetry and Poetics.</I> "Sentimentality in poetry:  poetic indulgence
in the exhibition of pathetic emotions for their own sake;  poetic
indulgence of more emotion (often self-regarding) 
<B></B>
than seems warranted
by the stimulus;  excessively direct poetic expression of pathos
. . . without a sufficient artistic correlative."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Among
the possible causes are "self-pity," "the absence of mature emotional
self-control," and an "uncritical romantic sensibility," which looks
upon "dogs, children, old women, and the deprived" not only as "objects
of pity" but as "objects of reverence and even envy." Dogs don't often
re in Jarrell's poetic world, but the other characters do. He cannot
have been unaware of the riskiness of his subject matter.

<P>
The disgusted tone of the <I>Princeton Encyclopedia</I> entry registers
the degree to which sentimentality is understood to violate the decorum
of serious poetry. Reading on, one finds the adjectives "popular,"
"low," "subjective." By implication good poetry would be none of these
things. Most importantly, the entry continues, emotion or pathos must
be "adequately registered in the specific means of poetry and thus
transformed from emotion into art." The emotion must have "located its
poetic correlatives." Some of these dicta seem sensible and persuasive, of
course; bad poetry <I>is</I> often marked by free-floating abstractions
and vaguely realized emotion. One scarcely need read between the lines,
however, to see how much this definition of sentimentality is shaped
by assumptions articulated by Eliot in <I>The Sacred Wood</I> and then
given institutional life by textbooks like <I>Understanding Poetry:</I>
the "objective correlative," and the "impersonal" theory of poetry are
strongly implied. All of these formulations--those of the encyclopedist,
of Eliot, of Brooks and Warren--work to keep the personal, the emotional,
at bay or under control.

<P>
The aesthetics of antisentimentality, according to Suzanne Clark in
<I>Sentimental Modernism,</I> exhibit a "gendered logic."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

"The story of desire for American critics has had an Oedipal shape--the
subject gets over his imaginary attachments in order to take his place
in culture as a man." (<I>SM,</I> 8) By this logic, he must grow out
of the tropes, tones, and subjects of "Mama-ism": the comforts of
genteel domesticity, reassuring routines of dailiness, physical and
emotional softness, unearned sympathy, accessibility or transparency
of meaning, overt attempts to persuade, acknowledgment of audience,
abundant verbiage, and (often) conventional choices of either form or
subject. It is the province of what Patricia Parker has dubbed "literary
fat ladies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 By contrast, he must adopt other postures
and attachments: urbanity, anomie, irony, self-consciousness, asepsis,
evidence of rigorous intellect, toughness, the line that declares its hard
edge. By such shorthand, the tough-minded modernist maintains a knowing
distance from weepy females, and, by implication, from the popular, the
easy, and the base. He favors a correspondingly obdurate style. Modernist
poetry is to be more rebarbative than genteel verse, more demanding than
linear narratives, more stimulating to the mind than those lyrics and
tales that appeal to the foolish heart. And in staking out those generic
and stylistic territories, the unsentimental modernist establishes himself
as quite different not only from his immediate, genteel precursors, but
also from the generation once removed, the romantic poets. Statements
like Pound's 1913 Imagist manifesto, by strongly favoring the hard,
the clean, and the spare, make the break from the emotional excesses of
romanticism 
<B></B> 
seem irrevocable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Such declarations privilege
certain genres and tones for the expression of a modern sensibility and
make it appear that the innovations of modernism eclipse the achievements
of the poetic past.

<P>
Early and late in his career, Jarrell was publicly skeptical about this
cutting of the apron strings. By 1942, just three years after receiving
his master's degree from Kenyon, Jarrell confidently challenged the
commonplace that modernism was a genuine break with the past. The thesis
of his essay "The End of the Line" is bold and direct: "Modernist
poetry--the poetry of Pound, Eliot, Crane, Tate, Stevens, Cummings,
MacLeish, et cetera--appears to be and is generally considered to be a
violent break with romanticism; it is actually, I believe, an extension
of romanticism, an end product in which most of the tendencies of
romanticism have been carried to their limits."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 The essay
has the quality of the <I>enfant terrible</I> that Ransom observed even
in his earliest dealings with Jarrell. The voice of the precocious child
who is only pointing out for informational purposes what is entirely
clear to him--that the emperor has no clothes--would remain an important
keynote of Jarrell's prose. But the essay also manifests his desire
to praise what he believes is great. "[E]ulogy," Lowell wrote, "was
the glory of Randall's criticism" (<I>RJ,</I> 104). Jarrell concludes
the essay with a list of names: Wordsworth, Blake, Heine, Baudelaire,
Corbi&egrave;re, Hardy, Yeats, Rilke. A "'classical' prejudice . . . that
these poets were somehow deceived and misguided," he remarks, "seems
every year more grotesque." (<I>K,</I> 83) He will not be a recruit to
the antiromantic program of modernism, especially not if by signing on he
has to relinquish his approval of those poets. There is something more
than mere contrariness in this studied difference from the mainstream;
Jarrell is endorsing a more inclusive and more complex standard of
judgment than that permitted by the "'classical' prejudices" of modernism.

<P>
Twenty years later, in the essay "Fifty Years of American Poetry,"
Jarrell would repeat this rhetorical strategy and produce a similar
effect. Speaking at the National Poetry Festival in Washington, D. C.,
on 22 October 1962, before the most distinguished American poets and
critics of the day, he assumes the voice of the future in evaluating
Eliot, "the most famous and influential of American poets":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Won't the future say to us in helpless astonishment: "But did you actually
believe that all those things about objective correlatives, classicism,
the tradition, applied to <I>his</I> poetry? Surely you must have seen
that he was one of the most subjective and daemonic poets who ever lived,
the victim and helpless beneficiary of his own inexorable compulsions,
obsessions? . . . But for you, of course, after the first few years,
his poetry existed undersea, thousands of feet below that deluge of
exegesis, explication, source listing, scholarship, and criticism that
overwhelmed it."

<P>
It is of course not the Future who speaks here, but the prescient
Jarrell, who refuses to admire "the right poet" for the "wrong reasons,"
preferring the suffering, compulsive, and subjective man to the symbol of
the critical industry.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 He rejects the New Critical Eliot,
rejects the impersonal bard channeling the "mind of Europe"--those
dimensions that then made Eliot seem unassailable--and pictures instead
a 
<B></B> 
poet who is fallible, troubled, and driven--those dimensions that now
make Eliot seem to some indefensible.

What links these two essays is Jarrell's stance of being attentive
to poets and poems rather than to dominant theoretical templates
for poets and poems. Here, his New Critical allegiances are evident:
the poem is its own excuse for being and contains within itself all
necessary explanations. Even his view of Eliot derives not from external
biographical material but from intensive readings of the poems. Informed
by, but not limited to, Freudian vocabulary, his psychological portrait
of Eliot is grounded in the dense annotations observable in his copy of
<I>The Complete Poems and Plays, 1909-1950</I> (<A HREF="5.1mcdonald_1.html"> 1</A>). Next to
the "yellow smoke" passage of "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,"
for instance, he has written "the wild bad alley Tomcat that does all
the things well-brought up Persian kitten would, could never do--but
he too ends in nothing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Words are underlined, repetitions
noted, puns observed, sounds of words connected. Why, given such tenets
of poetic autotelism and such practices of microscopic inspection, should
he need to defend poems from critics?

<P>
The answer, like the question, is based in the hegemony of New
Criticism. The most sustained explanation Jarrell offers is in the
essay "The Age of Criticism," first published in <I>Partisan Review</I>
in 1952. In it, he declared that criticism had become "astonishingly
graceless, joyless, humorless . . . self-important, clich&eacute;-ridden,
prestige-obsessed, [and] almost-autonomous."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Again, as in
the 1942 essay, he notes the patronizing dismissal of Wordsworth--"poor
Wordsworth I almost wrote"--and associates the dismissal of Wordsworth
with condescension toward his friend, a novelist who was not a
professional literary critic.

But the critics could not help being conscious of the differences between
themselves, and Wordsworth, and my friend: <I>they</I> knew how poems
. . . are put together, and Wordsworth and my friend didn't, but had
just put them together. In the same way, if a pig wandered up to you
during a bacon-judging contest, you would say impatiently, "Go away,

<P>
Jarrell perceived that what had begun as a critical movement to make
poetry autonomous had evolved into a movement in which criticism had made
itself autonomous; he detected the inevitable moment at which a profession
becomes as propelled by its forms, conventions, and hierarchies as by
its reason for being.

<P>
Jarrell delivered "The Age of Criticism" as a lecture while participating
in the Indiana School of Letters (founded by Ransom) in the summer of
1952. Some of the audience reacted, Jarrell reported in June 1952 to Mary
von Schrader, "as if, to a bunch of junior executives, I'd questioned
Free Enterprise" (<I>L,</I> 358). The letter dramatizes his outsider
status. "All in all I had rather a sense of how lonely you are when you
come out on the side of life and risk-taking and thinking works of art
are live and mysterious and unaccountable; on the side of everything
that can't be institutionalized and handled and graded by Experts. Most
academic highbrow people really do go along with the critical abstract
categorizing mind." (<I>L,</I> 359)
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Jarrell had in 1939 
<B></B> <B>[Begin Page 9]</B>
unapologetically explained to Allen Tate that he couldn't "put any
real faith in abstractions or systems" (<I>L,</I> 19). It was his
"<I>really</I> unsystematic" mind that he labelled "semifeminine"
(<I>L,</I> 19; Jarrell's emphasis).

<P>
Taken together, the essays of 1942, 1952, and 1962 show a remarkable
consistency in Jarrell's opinion of the appropriate relationship
between the poem and the critic. Repeatedly he is drawn to discourses of
capitalism or "free enterprise," competition, careerism, territoriality,
and bureaucracy to decry the ways in which the act of reading poems
has been, as it were, taylorized, made efficient and productive. The
criticism business, for Jarrell, exudes the arrogance of power. Leslie
Fiedler, who spoke the day after Jarrell that summer in Indiana and who
was in sympathy with him on that occasion, later wrote that for Jarrell
"an essential function of the critic is to free the loving reader from all
orthodoxies as well as all methodologies" (<I>RJ,</I> 66). This notion of
value-free, disinterested reading may, in the wake of post-structuralist
criticism, seem hopelessly benighted. To take this view, however, is
to tell a very clever pig he knows nothing about bacon. In other words,
Jarrell's lecture and Fiedler's evaluation of his critical stance must
be considered in the context of the orthodoxies and methodologies they
worked within and against. For Jarrell especially, the agenda was to
find a way to put romance, mystery, and sentiment (the stereotypes of a
feminized sensibility) back into the mix of critical values. Jarrell's
stance, Fiedler perceived, is that of a courageous, rescuing prince in
a fairy tale; his princess, the loving reader, possesses that feminized
sensibility. "Rescue" and "love" are very nearly embarrassing terms to
use in describing the work of literary criticism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 This
embarrassment, as Suzanne Clark points out, is tied to conceptions
of maturity and gender: "Becoming an intellectual in America is sort
of like being inducted into the army . . . and learning not to be a
sissy." (<I>SM,</I> 12)

<P>
Randall Jarrell knew the code of the intellectual army. His academic
posts, his fellowships and grants, his appointment at the Library
of Congress, his prizes--all are the benefits of increasingly well
organized professions. His competitiveness impelled him to seek those
rewards and want others. Nevertheless, Jarrell insisted that this
culture be accessible to amateurs, indeed that their disinterested
and marginal status in the culture of reading gave them a particular
authenticity. And, in his teaching career especially, he questioned
whether the characteristics denigrated as "sissy" ought to be so
cavalierly dismissed. To be a sissy is to "sit out" the contest,
and Jarrell preferred that reading not be a contest. Describing his
generosity to his students and herself, Eleanor Ross Taylor writes, "We
were likely to do nothing for him in return, as people not on committees,
not writing recommendations, not mentioning things to powerful people,
not promoting, arranging, appearing. He battled for the survival of such
people" (<I>RJ,</I> 237). It is precisely the absence of power that drew
Jarrell to these women. To the problem of "The Obscurity of the Poet"
, he offered no solution, believing there was none. High modernism's
program to make poetry matter by making it new was a failed dream, and
Jarrell agreed with Auden that "poetry makes nothing happen."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

"There is nothing to do different from what we already do:
<B></B> 
if poets
write poems and readers read them, each as best they can--if they try to
live not as soldiers or voters or intellectuals or economic men, but as
human beings--they are doing all that can be done." (<I>PA,</I> 21) To
actors in the powerful institutional spheres of politics, education, and
economics, Jarrell opposes human beings, presumably defined as somehow
outside those spheres. Traditionally, and certainly at the time that
Jarrell wrote those words, the person outside those spheres was female.

<P>
Jarrell came to what was known as the Woman's College of the University of
North Carolina in 1947, on the recommendation of Peter Taylor, who was to
be his colleague, and with a letter of support from Ransom.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

In the background of his appointment stands Tate, who taught at the
college before he moved to Princeton in 1939. Jarrell had had previous
teaching experience: instructor of English and Director of Tennis
at Kenyon, then instructor of English at the University of Texas at
Austin. After military service, he acted as literary editor of <I>The
Nation</I> while teaching at Sarah Lawrence, an experience that helped to
shape his satiric novel <I>Pictures from an Institution.</I> His teaching
career is typical of the time in its cobbling together of jobs (a poet
who must write criticism and teach to make a living); it also signals one
way in which the literary and academic establishments had become partners.

<P>
The institution at which Jarrell taught from 1947 until his death
in 1965 was, in his own wry description to Lowell in 1947, "pastoral"
(<I>L,</I> 177). In the late 1940s and 1950s, it enrolled two thousand to
twenty-five hundred women, three-fourths of whom were North Carolinians,
a substantial percentage of them from small rural towns. Some were the
daughters of wealthy planters, but others were children of small-town
newspaper editors, orphans on scholarship, and children of sharecroppers,
again on scholarship.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 It was not a finishing school, nor
was it experimental in the way of Sarah Lawrence. Like many another
woman's college, it was founded as a "normal" school with the primary
purpose of training teachers. By the 1940s, however, students came with
other aims as well, some to spend a couple of years preparing to go to
other schools, some to study the "Home Ec." and "Phys. Ed." that Jarrell
ridicules in "A Girl in a Library" (<I>CP,</I> 17), and some--the group
that would most engage Jarrell's attentions--to avail themselves of the
college's growing reputation as a school for serious study of the arts,
creative writing, and literature. For nearly twenty years of his teaching
career, Jarrell was in daily contact with a kind of student who, however
bright, stood outside the corridors of intellectual power. Thus his
work as a teacher helps one to focus on an overlooked group of legatees
in the transmission of cultural capital. The ideal audience imagined
by the influential male modernists did not include small-town southern
"bobbysoxers." And yet this was the audience to which Jarrell dedicated
himself. His pedagogic commitment is of a piece with his edgy relationship
to the critical mainstream.

<P>
Robert Lowell's affectionate and perceptive description of Jarrell as
a teacher is worth quoting at some length:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
He once said, "If I were a rich man, I would pay money for the privilege
of being able to teach." Probably there was no better teacher of
literature in the country, and yet he 
<B></B> 
was curiously unworldly about it,
and welcomed teaching . . . in the shade or heat of his little-known
Southern college for girls. . . . There his own community gave him
a compact, tangible, personal reverence that was incomparably more
substantial and poignant than the empty, numerical long-distance blaze
of national publicity. He grieved over the coarseness, unkindness, and
corruption of our society. . . . He said bitterly and lightheartedly
that "the gods who had taken away the poet's audience had given him
students." Yet he gloried in being a teacher, never apologized for it,
and related it to his most serious criticism [<I>RJ,</I> 105].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Jarrell made the remark about paying to teach on more than one occasion
(<I>L,</I> 435, 453). Because this is the sort of thing teachers say on a
good day, when teaching feels like more than a job, it is a comment easy
to dismiss. But Lowell's vocabulary coheres with the rhetoric of Jarrell's
critical essays, echoing their defense of the unaccountable. Jarrell's
attachment to the students in his classroom signals "curiously unworldly"
allegiances. The world to which Lowell and Jarrell respond is one that
expects seriousness to be linked to money, publicity, coarseness, and
unkindness, one that denigrates the personal and the reverential as
poignant, even sentimental. That Jarrell expected this position to be
attacked as sentimental is evident in a 1959 essay, "Poets, Critics,
and Readers." He offers as a counterproposition a diagnosis by Hugo von
Hoffmannsthal: "Each epoch has its own sentimentality . . . its specific
way of overemphasizing strata of emotion. The sentimentality of the
present is egotistic and unloving; it exaggerates not the feeling of love
but that of the self" (<I>K,</I> 310). This self-regard, Jarrell argues,
made the critic the competitor of the poet and his criticism a means
to a self-promoting end. At the conclusion of the essay, he recalls an
interview with a critic in which the critic admits to reading Kipling's
<I>Kim</I> for pleasure every year. "[F]or a moment I had left the gray,
dutiful world of the professional critic, and was back in the sunlight and
shadow, the unconsidered joys, the unreasoned sorrows, of ordinary readers
and writers, amateurishly reading and writing 'at whim'" (<I>K,</I>
317). The "contemplative and sympathetic hours of our reading" are an
alternative to "the active, greedy, and powerful hours of our lives"
(<I>K,</I> 318). Jarrell's professional critic has become the Man in the
Gray Flannel Suit, that icon of the 1950s rat-race.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 The space
he carved out at Greensboro was "pastoral" in this way, as well; in his
estimation, it was the green-world alternative to the self-aggrandizing,
product-driven occupation that had become literary criticism.

<P>
The green world has its annoyances, too, of course, and Jarrell
acknowledged these with his usual piquancy. Shortly after his arrival
in 1947, he wrote to Hannah Arendt, "I have several good students in
modern poetry and writing[;] . . . the first day one of them, to my great
amazement, turned in a faithful imitation of Robert Lowell. But the only
thing to do with the freshmen here is to write a ballet with a Chorus
of Peasant Girls for them" (<I>L,</I> 180). The Carolina drawl grated on
him; in 1949, he described himself to Margaret Marshall as "knee-deep in
violets and whine-y Southern girls" (<I>L,</I> 219). Over time, however,
the caustic remarks diminish, giving way to frequent assertions of his
devotion to the women at Greensboro. He wrote to Robert Penn Warren in
1962 that, after his two years as Poetry Consultant to the 
<B></B> 
Library of
Congress, his return to his classes "made me want never to be without
them again" (<I>L,</I> 461).

<P>
The components of this dedication are a complex mixture of the
personal and professional, and not all of the elements are flattering
to Jarrell. He was by many accounts narcissistic, mirror-obsessed, and
proud of his mind; friends and colleagues grant those characteristics even
when they wish to be sympathetic to Jarrell. The role of adored teacher,
inspiring the reverence to which Lowell refers in his description, is
powerfully attractive to such a personality, and its potency was probably
complicated as well by student "crushes" and erotic energy, heady boosts
for any ego.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Jarrell's competitiveness is also a factor:
at Greensboro he was the teacher to study with, the poet to know, the
famous man. This adulation undoubtedly compensated for other ways in
which he might have felt slighted by the literary establishment. One may
suspect him, accordingly, of preening himself on his role as master and
of dominating his students with his superior mind. In fact, however, the
oral histories I have assembled in interviewing colleagues and former
students and the memoirs of students I have read emphatically contradict
that possibility, a point to which I will return. I do not want to move
too quickly past the question of domination, however, precisely because
the record of opinion Jarrell left in his criticism is so frequently
concerned with the exercise of intellectual power.

<P>
Jarrell's poetic treatment of this subject is invariably ambivalent
and entangled in complicated ways with gender. Langdon Hammer, in a
persuasive reading of "A Girl in a Library," suggests that the poem's
tenderness may be a veiled assertion of male superiority: "her passive
cooperation with his vision, her lack, even, of dreams; and his decision
to address her, which allows him to occupy the position of the master
(even--or especially?--a gentle one), begins to look like a way of
preserving male authority by making it appear benevolent." "What
would the girl say," Hammer asks, "if she woke up?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 In
one sense, this is an unanswerable question. What would the Solitary
Reaper say to Wordsworth? It is, however, a question that provokes
the imagination in reminding us of the ways that the verbally gifted
dominate the silent in colleges everywhere. The poem invites us to notice
gender, of course. The male speaker is both revolted by and drawn to the
sleeping girl's stolidity; she is condescendingly portrayed as close to
nature (thus base in her aspirations), while he is bodiless. The male
is an intellectual, the library his workplace; she is an interloper
there. But because the poem's texture relies upon literary and other
forms of high-art allusion, "A Girl in a Library" should also be read
as a meditation on the roles of teacher and student and on the sleeping
girl's curriculum, particularly the limiting practicality of it. Her
subjects--Home Ec. and Phys. Ed.--are the "narrow stream" that confine
her (<I>CP,</I> 16). His subjects--opera, Russian poetry, the stuff of
dreams and fiction--are the romantic visions that remove him from the
things of this world. What good does it do the man who is awake to know
the things he does? And if he values them, must the sleeping student? The
speaker's tone is uncertain, though his own commitments are clear. For
all his satiric wit, the speaker is a decidedly unauthoritative authority
re, who admits that the world ("the world contracts around you"
[<I>CP,</I> 15]) 
<B></B> 
has made a student "good enough for it" (<I>CP,</I>
17). The bookish speaker asserts that "the soul" that "neither cooks /
Nor referees" (<I>CP,</I> 16) is superior to the "calm slow factuality"
(<I>CP,</I> 17) of this contracted world; yet he also allows that the
"inconceivable enchantment" (<I>CP,</I> 17) he values so highly is of
little consequence to it. "each poem guaranteed," as he puts it in
"A Conversation with the Devil," "a lie or permanently irrelevant"
(<I>CP,</I> 29). Furthermore, his fictions depend upon the facts she
embodies; the consolations and pleasures of her life, on the other
hand, are "innocent" (<I>CP,</I> 17) of his fictions. "A Girl in a
Library" is, in this sense, a poem about a teacher whose student does
not want what he has to offer. What matters is not only that she is a
girl, though gender-focused readings help us to understand the effects
of that representation, but that she is a girl whose world has taught
her to seek intellectual sustenance in Home Ec. and Phys. Ed.

<P>
In "The Taste of the Age," first published in 1958, seven years after "A
Girl in a Library," Jarrell returned to the subject of home economics. He
discovers in conversation with an eighth-grade student that she does
not know who Charlemagne was.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The little girl who didn't know who Charlemagne was had been
taught, I found, to conduct a meeting, to nominate, and to second
nominations; she had been taught . . . the right sort of story to
tell an eighteen-months-old baby; and she had learned in her Domestic
Science class to bake a date pudding, to make a dirndl skirt. . . . She
was being given an education suitable for the world she was to use it
in; my quarrel was not so much with her education as with her world
[<I>K,</I> 300-301, 303].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The world that Jarrell deplores on her behalf is the same one that absorbs
the sleeping girl in a library, the same that causes the woman in his poem
"Next Day" to move in a trancelike state down the supermarket aisles, that
makes the hallucinating speaker of "Seele im Raum" feel she must choose
between "sense" and "truth" (<I>CP,</I> 39). In this world, to return to
the terms Jarrell uses in "The Obscurity of the Poet," women are voters
(able to second a nomination) and economic entities (able to shop and
do domestic work), but something less than human beings. "Marriage with
the Corn King was the only game in town," Mary Jarrell said in a recent
interview about Jarrell's teaching. "Randall thought they were better
than that."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>


<P>
Imagery of entrapment and confinement is countered in Jarrell's portraits
of women by imagery of animals and wilderness. The observer thinks of a
trapped animal as he watches the girl in the library: "Many a beast has
gnawn a leg off and got free / . . . The trap has closed about you and
you sleep" (<I>CP,</I> 16). The image of the eland, real to the woman
in "Seele im Raum" and imaginary to her family, shifts by the poem's
end to the German <I>elend</I> (wretched), registering her inescapable
domestication. "The Woman at the Washington Zoo" says to the "bars of
my own body, open, open! / The world goes by my cage and never sees me"
(<I>CP,</I> 215). The troubled but liberating dream that concludes
"The Night before the Night before Christmas" takes place in fields
where "There is not one thing that knows / It is almost Christmas"
(<I>CP,</I> 50). Evocations of wildness are often poignant in these
poems because they are imaginings only, a strongly felt but ineffectual
protest against 
<B></B> 
the various cages in which the women find themselves: the
bars of their own mortal and aging bodies and the compartments of their
social personae. Stanley Kunitz's essay "Out of the Cage" summarizes the
centrality of this topic: "All the voices in all of Jarrell's poems are
crying, 'Change me!'. . . In the mythic imagination metamorphosis is the
great theme underlying all others. To the individual psyche it is the way
out of the cage. 'Self-transformation,' said Rilke, whom Jarrell revered
and translated, 'is precisely what life is'" (<I>RJ,</I> 99-100). For
Jarrell, uncaged wildness is an assertion of that vitality.

<P>
Jarrell also employs the metaphor of wildness in describing his function
as critic and teacher. The <I>enfant terrible</I> is an <I>enfant
sauvage.</I> After lunching at Princeton in 1952, Jarrell lamented
R. P. Blackmur's having become part of the "whole literary-academic
. . . world." "Believe me," he wrote to Mary, "I'm glad I'm marrying
a wild tribe and am not institutionalized myself." (<I>L,</I> 338)
His self-positioning outside this institution allied him with the
amateur reader he imagined as ideal. These readers, described in
"The Age of Criticism," are "almost as wild a species as writers"
(<I>PA,</I> 80). Critics, on the other hand, "are so domesticated as
to seem institutions"; they remind him of "the Wall standing between
Pyramus and Thisbe" (<I>PA,</I> 80). Beneath the cleverness of this
image, which evokes the cloddish stupidity of the domesticated critic
and makes lovers of the reader and her book, Jarrell expresses serious
disapproval of the divisions and obstacles he consistently associates
with the academization of reading. Wildness, for Jarrell, resists the
psychic, social, bureaucratic compartments that make lives small.

<P>
That there could be bigger lives--and that the study of literature
might include the possibility of self-transformation--is a repeated
theme in the comments of Jarrell's students. "It is difficult," wrote
Bertha Harris Wyland (class of 1959),

<P>

to describe the effect, as it was then, on someone like myself who came
from a small town of regular church-going, Saturday night picture shows,
and <I>Saturday Evening Post</I> habits. It was like being suddenly
snatched off the assembly line, taken apart, reassembled. Most of
us were first or second-generation college students. . . . We walked
into the place inviting it to reassemble us; we demanded to be lighted
up.

"Teaching was his essence, his core," Heather Ross Miller (class of 1961)
believes. "Randall cared more about our silly stories and poems than we
did ourselves. It was his special talent, his gift--and those of us in
the writing workshops felt baptized in some exuberant mixture of fire and
spirit and mineral water."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Student testimonials to beloved
teachers tend, by their nature, to be hagiographic, but as Jarrell's
biographer William Pritchard also found, there is remarkable consistency
in what they praise. The memoirs of Jarrell's students reiterate the
metaphors of electricity, explosion, change. His colleague Robert
Watson describes the students of that period as "skyrockets waiting to
go off."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>


<P>
This sense of nascent vitality may be one of the reasons Jarrell compared
the college at Greensboro to a fairy tale, a genre to which Jarrell was
drawn throughout his 
<B></B> 
career. "Gee, I'm glad to get back here," he said to
Robert Watson in 1953 after two years away. "This college is like Sleeping
Beauty." (<I>RJ,</I> 258) Perhaps Jarrell referred only to the general
sleepiness and small-town atmosphere, perhaps to the restfulness of
being out of the more competitive atmosphere of Princeton. But Fiedler's
characterization of Jarrell as wanting to "free the loving reader" comes
irresistibly to mind. And since sleep in this tale acts as a form of
captivity, the allusion recalls the captives and enclosed res of
Jarrell's poetry. That he should see himself as come to liberate these
res from their sleep may betray the arrogance of which he accused
American literary criticism. "I think that he felt he <I>was</I> in a
prince capacity," Mary Jarrell laughed when I questioned her on this
point. But she was quick to add that the students "were not puppets on
a string. They were being guided and encouraged. . . . Leadership is
one thing, leading by the nose another."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>


<P>
Jarrell acted on two principles that make accusations of intellectual
domination seem oversimplified. First, he knew that education was not
a panacea. As much as the girl in "The Night before the Night before
Christmas" may want to believe that the world could be saved by study of
Marx and Engels, the poem's conclusion makes plain the inescapability of
loss and injustice. "There is something deep / Under her will, against her
will, / That keeps murmuring to her, 'It's so'" (<I>CP,</I> 47). Second,
he knew that the fairy-tale princess could become, as in "Cinderella,"
"A sullen wife and a reluctant mother" (<I>CP,</I> 217). Unhappy endings
were just as likely as happy ones, and magic kisses might in any case
be refused. In "Hope," he revises the story of Sleeping Beauty.

Despite these potential failures and rejections, Jarrell remained
both imaginatively and practically dedicated to the possibility of
transformation. What Fred Chappell, his colleague at Greensboro, has
said about his poems is also true of his classroom: "In Jarrell's
poems the discourse of books and pictures and statues and buildings
and music impinges upon the characters and makes a real difference in
their lives."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>


<P>
To assess this real difference, emphasized repeatedly by his students,
is to understand not only Jarrell's investment in his work as a teacher
but also to understand what poetry meant to young women at a small-town
college at midcentury. I suggest that the now-suspect notion of the
transformative power of poetry, which motivated Jarrell's commitment and
which he knew was rooted in a highly romantic ethos, seemed viable at
Greensboro precisely because of the feminine nature of the institution
and its students. Robert Watson told me that Jarrell "hated teaching at
Princeton. Their attitude was, 'Show me. I'm bright. I'm very bright. I
may be 
<B></B> 
brighter than you are. I know I am going to be much richer than you
are and more powerful.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 He spent his time there answering
challenges that distracted attention from the poetry. The Greensboro
women were not without questions, nor did Jarrell simply hold forth in
the classroom. On the contrary, he customarily encouraged discussion
and response. But the Princeton experience was, for Jarrell, infected
with the competitive atmosphere of professional criticism in ways that
Greensboro was not. In preferring his quiet principality at Greensboro,
then, he was opting out of that particular contest. His was not merely
a negative choice or evasion, however; it was taking a stand.

<P>
If the history of New Criticism's influence on the academy may be
seen as a series of strategems to separate the reading of poetry
from the emotional, the personal, the feminine, and all taint of the
self-indulgent, then Jarrell's choice seeks to restore gravity to
what had been deemed trifling. In the same letter to Allen Tate in
which he explains his "semifeminine mind," he reports an anecdote
about a conversation with Philip Rice. "Rice was talking the other
day about women--and Southerners, as I remember--taking people just as
people, and putting too much importance on that, instead of considering
mostly their ideas . . . and I laughed to myself and thought, 'I should
hope.'" (<I>L,</I> 21) Jarrell's defense of the particular and ordinary
human being, linked paradigmatically to southerners and women even in this
early letter, is the sign of his opposition to a programmatic criticism
that makes expertise in critical vocabulary and "ideas" necessary
concomitants of reading, and thus the province of sophisticated male
experts. Did he, in his defense of the feminine, romanticize women
in ways that make his defense of them suspect? Considered from some
perspectives, the answer must be yes. Heather Ross Miller recalls that
"it was always a shock for him to discover how much we knew about mules
and sex and hard work and other crudities."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Suzanne Rodgers
Bush (class of 1955) remembers having to educate him about majorettes
and cheerleaders: it <I>was</I> possible to lead cheers and be a serious
student of poetry.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Although he took these lessons with
grace and good humor, he remained faithful to an idealized femininity
that was unspoiled and humble. To assume that he would therefore
see the women as inferior, however, is seriously to misapprehend his
principles. Jarrell consistently affirmed the superiority of unspoiled
humility, particularly that of readers unspoiled by the sophistications
of the critical profession and humble before artistic achievement. He
wished himself to be such a reader. His culture, in any case, presented
him with narrow choices: to be attached to the things he was attached
to was, within his time, to be "semifeminine" in one's preferences. To
be a poet at all, as Frank Lentricchia has demonstrated, was to wrestle
with anxieties about gender.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Sentimentality about women's
education looks daring in that context.

<P>
For the women at Greensboro, the Jarrell era was not sentimental, but
thrilling. The Woman's College sponsored a student-edited literary
magazine, <I>Coraddi,</I> that published the writing not only of
Greensboro students but of students all over the country. The 1947 issue
included work by Anthony Hecht, Donald Justice, and 
<B></B> 
Flannery O'Connor;
the 1948 issue included Guy Davenport and "Jim" Dickey; the 1951, Donald
Hall. At a yearly Arts Forum, student writing was discussed by visiting
artists and critics. Between the years 1944 and 1964 visitors included
Lowell, Lionel Trilling, Robert Frost, Robie Macauley, Robert Penn Warren,
Richard Wilbur, Jean Stafford, R. P. Blackmur, Katherine Anne Porter,
Elizabeth Bowen, Karl Shapiro, John Dos Passos, Caroline Gordon, and
Adrienne Rich.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Every year, the largest room on campus was
filled to capacity, and not only by the students who considered themselves
artsy but by the Home Ec. and Phys. Ed. students as well. These were the
wonder years; every teacher or student I spoke to expressed a sense of
astonishment that this could have been happening at Greensboro, never
a wealthy school. The students were the beneficiaries of the network
of Jarrell's and other faculty members' professional contacts. Some
undoubtedly came to the Arts Forum the way another student might go to a
football game, as something to do. Some may have been lured by the famous
names, the phenomenon of poet-as-celebrity. These are motives with which
Jarrell would have had little patience. He wanted his students to see and
hear <I>as people</I> the poets whose poems they were reading. Poetry
was to be an ordinary occupation, as Robert Watson put it: "People
like Randall and Peter [Taylor] expected their students to turn out to
be writers. . . . It was the natural thing to do. It wasn't something
special and different that you were doing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 The visiting
poets read and discussed the students' poems as if they mattered--and
to Jarrell they did. He was, Betty Watson said, "wild with joy when he
liked something."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>


<P>
What Jarrell kept in the foreground of his teaching, in the classroom
and out, was the idea of reading and writing poetry as a normal human
activity. "Mr. Jarrell was good," as Suzanne Rodgers Bush put it,
"for us ordinary students."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Pritchard notes that "his
method was unacademic, insofar as he did nothing more complicated--or
more difficult--than to read poems and stories aloud and then discuss
them with his students . . . [who] were held by the look of his face
and the sound of his voice."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 His methods were intense and
perceptive appreciation, excited praise, an enactment of the series
of discoveries that careful reading revealed. The "ordinary" student,
Mrs. Bush, recalled with pleasure that as she wrote her examinations
she was quoting the poems from memory, so strongly had her teacher's
readings impressed her. Forty years later, she was still able to quote
lines from poetry she studied under Jarrell.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 In the context
of modernism's argument for poetry as a specialized language requiring
specialized techniques of analysis--a context that worked to separate
form from content and erudite from common readers--Jarrell's method
looks retrogressive, a throwback to the "appreciative" writing of the
previous century. His method was in fact a conscious protest against
the elevation of poetry to a "members only" status. And paradoxically
his insistence on the ordinariness of poetry worked simultaneously to
restore an aura of enchantment around poetry, a point not lost on his
students. Heather Ross Miller detects a subversive underside to the
story of Sleeping Beauty: "the possibility of danger: the dangerous
bride. You remember what happened to all those first princes who tried
to get through the thorns to her? . . . [Jarrell] certainly 
<B></B> 
brought
to me the strong sense of something going on, an enchantment, that was
both beautiful and dangerous--and you'd better be careful how you woke
that thing up."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 It is the interdependence of the enchanted
and the quotidian ("What a girl called 'the dailiness of life,'" as he
expresses it in "Well Water" [<I>CP,</I> 300]) that shaped Jarrell's
writing and teaching.

<P>
At the conclusion of "Poets, Critics, and Readers," Jarrell writes,
"The work of art, Rilke said, says to us always: <I>You must change
your life</I>" (<I>K,</I> 318; Jarrell's emphasis). Jarrell knew that
such metamorphosis, though a powerful possibility, would remain for most
merely that--a possibility. But on the strength of that possibility he
imagined his students waking up not as brides, voters, and shoppers,
but as readers and poets. <I>Contra</I> James Joyce, he restored the
idea of poetry for ladies, but with the difference that Jarrell did
not consider "ladies" a derogatory term. A point that has been made
repeatedly in recent years--and with considerable force of persuasion--is
that Jarrell sentimentalized women, appropriated them, and impersonated
them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Another interpretation, one that does not necessarily
foreclose those readings, is that Jarrell chose to align himself with
the feminine as a means of advocating values that had been dismissed by
the modernist movement. <I>The Lost World,</I> Jarrell's last volume of
poetry, is a compendium of the forbidden sentimental subjects--animals,
women, children, nostalgia--tough-minded modernism thought it had left
behind. And, as James Longenbach has remarked, Jarrell is now speaking
in his own voice, not through a female mask.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 These are, I
believe, his best poems; they evince a settled air of accepting his own
sentimentality and a finely nuanced understanding of its consolations and
liabilities. These would include the danger of writing poetry that would
be dismissed as self-indulgent and tear-jerking. In a 1942 appreciation
of Marianne Moore's <I>What Are Years,</I> Jarrell concludes by noting
the usual objection to her poems: "'They are so small.'" "Yes," he
responds, "they are as small as those animals which save the foolish
heroes of fairy tales--which can save only the heroes, because they are
too small not to have been disregarded by everyone else." (<I>PA,</I>
184) Jarrell might be said to have made a speciality of regarding what
others disregarded. His oppositional stance is similarly "small" in
dimension. Writing his poems, crafting his essays, teaching his students,
he undramatically but persistently labored to deflate the self-importance,
pretension, and mystification that separated the reader from her book.

"Why," Wittgenstein asks himself, early in part two of <I>Philosophical
Investigations,</I> "does it sound queer to say: 'For a second he
felt deep grief'?" The tentative response that follows ("Only because
it so seldom happens?") seems to posit an empirical basis for the
impression. Yet the full "remark," or <I>Bemerkung,</I> suggests that the
oddity is due not to empirical limitations but to logical and grammatical
ones: "'For a second he felt violent pain.' --Why does it sound queer
to say: 'For a second he felt deep grief'? Only because it so seldom
happens?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The syntactic similarity of the two utterances
juxtaposed here--"For a second he felt violent pain," "For a second
he felt deep grief"--turns out to be misleading, because "the concept
of grief" is used differently, and therefore differs grammatically
from "the concept of a sensation" like pain. Wittgenstein explains:
"'Grief' describes a pattern which recurs, with different variations,
in the weave of our life. If a man's bodily expression of sorrow and
of joy alternated, say, with the ticking of a clock, here we should
not have the characteristic formation of the pattern of sorrow or of
the pattern of joy." (<I>PI,</I> 174e) Grief just isn't the sort of
thing that possesses the regularity of the ticking of a clock, which
can be timed to the nearest second, as a sensation may be measured. This
account certainly does get at some of the queerness of "For a second he
felt deep grief." Even so, it seems to me that Gertrude Stein offers a
better, albeit a complementary, explanation, one that is more radically
grammatical and hence, in the end, more Wittgensteinian.

"A sentence is not emotional a paragraph is," Stein famously wrote,
arriving at this gnomic conclusion, which served as the subtitle of
her 1930 study in grammar, "Sentences and Paragraphs," in the course
of meditating on sentences that sound queerly like Wittgenstein's:
"He looks like a young man grown old." "It looks like a garden but he
had hurt himself by accident." "A dog which you have never had before
has sighed." "Once when they were nearly ready they had ordered it to
close."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>


<P>
"For a second he felt deep grief." In her recent study of Wittgenstein as
literary modernist, Marjorie Perloff demonstrates how for each of these
sentences of Stein's, a narrative context may be devised in which it would
make sense for someone to utter so extraordinary a remark.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Of
course one would have to wait a long time for the appropriate situation to
arise. As Wittgenstein observed, "it so seldom happens" that one finds
the occasion to say, for instance, "He looks like a young man grown
old," and not turn out to be misspeaking, or speaking inexactly. In
composing sentences like these, however, Stein was no more interested
than Wittgenstein in narrative completion. Rather, she was interested
in how the grammar of such sentences enabled them to form emotionally
resonant wholes--as sentences in ordinary prose cannot--even as her
well wrought compositions-in-minimum remained unmoored and open-ended,
so obviously, deliberately, incomplete.

<P>
<I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</I> provides a charming account
of Stein's "discovery" of the precise manner in which sentences and
paragraphs differ:

We now [the spring of 1929] had our country house, the one we had
only seen across the valley and just before leaving we found the white
poodle, Basket. He was a little puppy in a little neighborhood dog-show
and he had blue eyes, a pink nose and white hair and he jumped up into
Gertrude Stein's arms. A new puppy and a new ford we went off to our new
house and we were thoroughly pleased with all three. Basket although now
[the summer of 1932] he is a large unwieldy poodle, still will get up
on Gertrude Stein's lap and stay there. She says that listening to the
rhythm of his water drinking made her recognise the difference between
sentences and paragraphs, that paragraphs are emotional that sentences
are not.

<P>
Stein had written to Sherwood Anderson in February that she was "making
a desperate effort to find out what is and isn't a sentence, having
been brought up in a good old public school grammar and sentences are
a fascinating subject to me."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 The same month she informed
Virgil Thomson, "I do want to know if there is a sentence, I thought
perhaps there wasn't but I am almost beginning to be able to explain
that there is."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Having completed "Sentences," a hundred
pages of "sentences about the sentence," shortly after arriving that
spring at the new house, she continued her "intensive study . . . of
the sentence" over the course of the next year, in Paris as well as in
the countryside.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 From "Saving the Sentence" she graduated to
"Sentences and Paragraphs" and then on to "More Grammar for a Sentence."

<P>
The first of these works expressly concerns the "caniche" Basket,
beginning with the French phrase, "Qu'est-ce que c'est cette
com&eacute;die d'un chien," and including such grammatical observations as
"When a dog is no longer a lap dog there is a temporary inattention" and
"Hers and his the houses are hers and his the valley is hers 
<B></B> 
and his the dog named Basket is hers and his also the respect of the populace is
hers and his."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 In this work the sentence requiring "saving"
was still the locus of Stein's attention. By contrast, "Sentences and
Paragraphs," as the title suggests, is an intermediate work in which Stein
sought to determine, as she put it in 1934, "exactly what the balance the
unemotional balance of a sentence is and what the emotional balance of
a paragraph is and if it were possible to make even in a short sentence
the two things come to be one" ("PG," 225-26). The result was the
"series" of attempts "to save a sentence" cited above, such portmanteau
sentences as "He looks like a young man grown old" and "A dog which you
have never had before has sighed": so like, and yet unlike, Wittgenstein's
"For a second he felt deep grief."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 What Stein takes to be an
unambiguous expression of a manner of being (or more exactly, of a manner
of being <I>there</I> and hence of a particular experience), Wittgenstein
perceives to be an error of judgment. Finally, in "More Grammar for a
Sentence," as its original title ("Paragraphs") confirms, the emphasis
is less on the sentence and more on the "More" and just what it is that
distinguishes paragraphs from sentences. It is here, in the sequence of
passages excerpted below and in particular those I've emphasized, that
Stein portrays the connection between the emotional nature of paragraphs
(although she uses the term "emotional" only once in the piece) and the
rhythm of Basket's drinking. <I>"To think well of any paragraph,"</I>
she writes, <I>"they must have affection":</I>

<P>
With these last sentences, and the closing, "never [quite] finished"
three-word paragraph, this sequence of grammatical investigations into
the grey area that lies outside the confines of the sentence comes to
a ringingly ostensive conclusion.
<B></B>

<P>
To be sure, Stein's thinking about sentences and paragraphs didn't end
here. In 1935 she summed up the current state of her investigations
in the second of her lectures on narration: "[T]hink," she instructed,
"how a sentence is made by its parts of speech and you will see that it
is not dependent upon a beginning a middle and an ending but by each part
needing its own place to make its own balancing, and because of this there
is no emotion, a sentence does not give off emotion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Despite
the fact that anything "balanced within itself does not give out nor have
within any emotion," when sentences are arranged "in succession one after
the other and make a paragraph," they turn out to "have the emotion that
any succession can give to anything" (<I>N,</I> 22). Whereas each sentence
"exists within by the balance within[,] . . . the paragraph exists not
by a balance within but by a succession. Anybody really anybody can
realize this thing" (<I>N,</I> 22), just as "anybody listening to any
dog's drinking will see what I mean" ("PG," 223). <I>"He drinks as if
in wishing. He drinks of if in washing. . . . A paragraph always lets it
fall or lets it be well and happy or feels it to be so which they never
were themselves as worried."</I> The rhythm of canine drinking exists
not by achieving a balance within (like a sentence, with its parts of
speech) but by means of succession (like a paragraph, with a beginning,
middle, and end). "[O]ne sentence coming after another sentence makes a
succession and the succession if it has a beginning a middle and an ending
as a paragraph has does form create and limit an emotion" (<I>N,</I> 23).

<P>
Having demonstrated that sentences and paragraphs are logically or
grammatically distinct, Stein proceeded to speculate on the possibility
of deconstructing the traditional, empirical form of the distinction. She
did this by calling into question the apparent inevitability of widely
accepted norms of prose composition or, to use Wittgenstein's phrase,
the "language game" of prose composition: prose having, as she put it,
"for a long time . . . been made of sentences and paragraphs" (<I>N,</I>
22). "[P]erhaps now there is no longer any need for a sentence to be
existing," she suggested, no need, that is, for a paragraph to require the
"internal balancing" of individual sentences (<I>N,</I> 18). Moreover, she
cautioned, "do not forget that . . . [s]ucceeding one thing succeeding
another thing is succeeding and having a beginning a middle and an
ending is entirely another thing" (<I>N,</I> 23). Because "these are
two things" and "not one thing," paragraphing might avoid the rather
limited progressive form that it had traditionally taken, so long as it
continued to "make a succession" and therefore conveyed the impression
of movement and emotion (<I>N,</I> 23). Indeed, sentences like "He looks
like a young man grown old" and "Once when they were nearly ready they
had ordered it to close" were neither sentences in the traditional sense
nor did they "depend upon a beginning a middle and an ending" (<I>N,</I>
22-23). In addition to being internally unbalanced, if not exactly
unhinged, they utilized nonprogressive succession to "create and limit
an emotion." Sentences like these "save[d] the sentence," although at
the expense of the traditional rationale for sentences, which so long as
it required internal balancing couldn't be saved. As the language games
of the twentieth century have often brutally revealed--with "language
game" understood as applying broadly to all forms of organized human
behavior 
<B></B> 
as well as, more narrowly, to writing like Stein's and
Wittgenstein's and yours and mine--such internal balancing is and has
always been an empirical rather than a logical necessity, hence not a
necessity at all.

<P>
In a 1934 lecture Stein offered a set of complementary descriptions of her
"discovery" of the fundamentally combinatory nature of language games. The
account itself partakes of the combinatory logic it outlines, and takes
the following form: first Stein announces that "in a book I wrote called
<I>How to Write</I>" (which included "Sentences," "Saving the Sentence,"
and "Sentences and Paragraphs"), "I made a discovery which I considered
fundamental," namely "that sentences are not emotional and that paragraphs
are." She then proceeds to "something else" that she found out at the
same time: "I found out about language that paragraphs are emotional
and sentences are not and I found out something else about it. I found
out that this difference was not a contradiction but a combination and
that this combination causes one to think endlessly about sentences and
paragraphs because the emotional paragraphs are made up of unemotional
sentences."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 At one level, that of relatively abstract
thought, Stein proposes a disjunction between unemotional sentences and
emotional paragraphs; yet at the more concrete level of experience, she
posits a conjunction of the same ("emotional paragraphs are made up of
unemotional sentences"). This is Stein's argument and at the same time
it is the mechanism by which her argument is realized: three sentences
and a paragraph combined in a heterogeneous dialectic, the beginning of
endless thought. Moreover, the picture of the sentence swimming in the
stream of thought that Stein revises here, the picture sketched with
such vividness by William James in his <I>Principles of Psychology,</I>
is the very picture Wittgenstein sought to emend in his grammatical
investigations. Stein's beloved mentor played an equally significant
role in the development of Wittgenstein's philosophy, and it is largely
due to James that the relation between these two life-long students of
grammar isn't merely analogical.

In June of 1912, at the end of his first year in Cambridge and shortly
after having turned twenty-three, Wittgenstein wrote to Bertrand
Russell, "Whenever I have time I now read James's 'Varieties of
Religious Experience.' This book does me a lot of good. I don't mean
to say that I will be a saint soon, but I am not sure that it does not
improve me a little in a way in which I would like to improve <I>very
much:</I> namely I think that it helps me to get rid of the <I>Sorge</I>
(in the sense in which Goethe used the word in the Second Part of
<I>Faust</I>)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Brian McGuinness alludes to this letter when
he comments that a year later Wittgenstein still "felt that his life had
no meaning, he was afflicted with the sense of futility, the <I>Sorge,</I>
he mentioned to Russell in the previous summer. He could recognize his own
condition in William James's chapter on 'The Sick Soul,'" in which James
quoted extensively from Tolstoy's "A Confession<I>."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 ("A
wonderful account," James commented, "of the attack of melancholy
<B></B>
which led [Tolstoy] to his own religious conclusions.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 In
a letter to Ottoline Morrell in late 1919 reporting his first meeting
with Wittgenstein in six years, Russell recalled the early influence of
James's <I>Varieties</I> and filled in some of the details of Tolstoy's
subsequent effect on the young logician:

I had felt in his book [the <I>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</I>]
a flavour of mysticism, but was astonished when I found that he has
become a complete mystic. He reads people like Kierkegaard and Angelus
Silesius, and he seriously contemplates becoming a monk. It all started
from William James's <I>Varieties of Religious Experience,</I> and grew
(not unnaturally) during the winter he spent alone in Norway before
the war, when he was nearly mad. Then during the war a curious thing
happened. He went on duty to the town of Tarnov in Galicia, and happened
to come upon a bookshop which however seemed to contain nothing but
picture postcards. However he went inside and found that it contained
just one book: Tolstoy on the Gospels. He bought it merely because
there was no other. He read it and re-read it, and henceforth had it
always with him under fire and at all times. But on the whole he likes
Tolstoy less than Dostoewski (especially Karamazov). He has penetrated
deep into mystical ways of thought and feeling, but I think (though he
wouldn't agree) that what he likes in mysticism is its power to make
him stop thinking.

<P>
Traces of James's Gifford lectures may readily be discerned in the
"syntactical mysticism" that Russell attributed to his former student,
and Wittgenstein continued to have, as one of his own students reported,
"a great admiration for James," with <I>Varieties</I> being "one of the
few books he insisted I must read."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>


<P>
It has also been suggested, quite plausibly, that the notion of "family
resem-blance" derives from James's account of the "varieties" of the
subject under study.

[a]t the beginning of his second lecture on <I>The Varieties of Religious
Experience,</I> James writes that "Most books on the philosophy of
religion try to begin with a precise definition of what its essence
consists of"; and a little later says: "The theorizing mind always tends
to the oversimplification of its materials. This is the root of all that
absolutism and one-sided dogmatism by which both philosophy and religion
have been infested. Let us not fall immediately into a one-sided view
of our subject but let us rather admit freely at the outset that we
may very likely find <I>no one essence but many characters which may
alternately be equally important to religion."</I>

All the same, it was principally Russell whom Wittgenstein sought
to build on and correct in the <I>Tractatus.</I> Yet by the time
Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge a decade later, Russell had long
ceased to provoke him into thought, and over the next decade James
came to assume a role in Wittgenstein's meditations comparable to that
formerly occupied by Russell: not as the author of <I>The Varieties
of Religious Experience,</I> however, but of the earlier masterpiece,
<I>The Principles of Psychology.</I>

<P>
Before World War I, experimental psychology had provided Wittgenstein
with much-needed diversion from his work in logic, and after he
resumed his philosophical 
<B></B> 
studies in the late 1920s he often
quarried psychology for examples of grammatical or "philosophical
mistakes"
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 due to the virulent combination of "experimental
methods and conceptual confusion" (<I>PI,</I> 232e) that characterized
experimental psychology and cast doubt on the discipline's legitimacy as
an empirical science. Instead of leading to valid empirical propositions,
Wittgenstein argued, the experimental methods of psychology compounded
the conceptual confusion endemic to the discipline. "The existence of
the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the
problems which trouble us; though problem and method pass one another
by" (<I>PI,</I> 232e). Or, as he observed in <I>Remarks on Colour</I>
(1950/51), where he linked "James's psychology," in particular his theory
of emotion, with Goethe's <I>Farbenlehre</I> (Theory of colors): "Goethe's
theory of the origin of the spectrum isn't a theory of its origin that has
proved unsatisfactory; it is really not a theory at all. <I>Nothing</I>
can be predicted with it. It is, rather, a vague schematic outline,
of the sort we find in James's psychology. There is no <I>experimentum
crucis</I> for Goethe's theory of colour."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Ever careful to
distinguish his own "remarks on the philosophy of psychology" from the
empirical study of psychology (which he regarded as based on sleight
of hand, or sleight of mind, since psychology was neither empirical
nor theoretical in the way that physics was), Wittgenstein typically
used statements made by James in <I>The Principles of Psychology</I> as
starting points for the psychological investigations that preoccupied
him in the mid- and late 1940s, and which were already central to part
one of <I>Philosophical Investigations.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 The 1970
<I>Wittgenstein Workbook,</I> for instance, lists nearly a fifth of
the remarks in part one (composed between 1936 and 1945), and fully
a quarter of those in <I>Zettel</I> (dating for the most part from
1945 to 1948), as directly paralleling passages in James's textbook on
matters ranging from "feelings of <I>if, but,</I> etc." to "feelings
of tendency," "'fringe' experiences," "producing and understanding
sentences," "thought without language (the Ballard case)," "the
Self of selves," and "emotions and bodily feelings."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 In
investigating how we talk about psychology, Wittgenstein was in fact
investigating how <I>James</I> talked about psychology. One student
recalled him "frequently referr[ing] to James in his lectures, even
making on one occasion--to everybody's astonishment--a precise reference
to a page-number!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Another student reported that "[w]hen
he was lecturing on belief," Wittgenstein uncharacteristically read
aloud "from James's <I>Principles of Psychology,</I> and discussed [it]
critically."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 The grammatical investigations of psychology
of this most independent-minded of philosophers turn out largely to have
been grammatical investigations of <I>The Principles of Psychology.</I>

<P>
Of particular interest, in the context of Stein's claims for the emotional
character of paragraphs and the unemotional nature of sentences, are
several remarks of Wittgenstein's in which he revisits James's theory of
emotion. The first of these dates from 1934-35, making it exactly
contemporaneous with Stein's six-month tour of the United States during
which she delivered her <I>Lectures in America</I> and the four lectures
on narration at the University of Chicago. "You will find," Wittgenstein
observes,

that the justifications for calling something an expression of doubt,
conviction, etc., largely, though of course not wholly, consist in
descriptions of gestures, the play of facial expressions, and even the
tone of voice. Remember at this point that the personal experiences of an
emotion must in part be strictly localized experiences; for if I frown in
anger I feel the muscular tension of the frown in my forehead, and if I
weep, the sensations around my eyes are obviously part, and an important
part, of what I feel. This is, I think, what William James meant when he
said that a man doesn't cry because he is sad but that he is sad because
he cries. The reason why this point is often not understood, is that we
think of the utterance of an emotion as though it were some artificial
device to let others know that we have it.

James first proposed his account of emotional experience in an 1884
article entitled "What Is an Emotion?" "My thesis," he wrote, "is that
the bodily changes follow directly the perception of the exciting fact,
and that our feeling of the same changes is the emotion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

In attributing the experience of "emotional consciousness" to its
"so-called 'expression,'" James reversed the viewpoint implicit in
the characterization of certain bodily movements as "expressions" of
emotion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Emotional consciousness, he asserted in his final
article on the subject, "The Physical Basis of Emotion" , was
"not a primary feeling, directly aroused by the exciting object or
thought, but a secondary feeling indirectly aroused" by "the organic
changes, muscular and visceral, of which the so-called 'expression' of
the emotion consists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>


<P>
James's point of departure for these claims was Charles Darwin's classic
study <I>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</I> ,
yet whereas Darwin had focused on the causal mechanism linking prior
sensation to subsequent bodily movement within an overall context of
emotional experience, James proposed that movement and emotion were
related causally as well. To the Darwinian mechanism of a sensation
undergirding "the perception of the exciting fact" and automatically
causing the body to move, James added a further physiological step,
with the body registering its own movement by means of a second, or
"secondary," sensation. It was this auto-sensation, the body feeling
itself move in response to an initial sensation, which one experienced
as emotion. This, in a nutshell, was James's theory of emotion, although
it was not the theory Wittgenstein attributed to him. Consider, for
example, the following remarks, which date from 1946/47:

451 And how does it come about that--as James says--I have a feeling
of joy if I merely make a joyful face; a feeling of sadness, if I make
a sad one? That, therefore, I can produce these feelings by imitating
their expression? Does that shew that muscular sensations are sadness,
or part of sadness?

A decade earlier Wittgenstein had quite correctly suggested that James's
theory of emotion differed from ordinary accounts in that James held the
"expression" of the emotion to be "a constituent part" of the emotion's
<I>internal composition</I>--hence contributing to the way the emotion
feels to the person feeling it--and only secondarily a symptom, or sign,
permitting an external viewer to infer the emotion from "gestures, the
play of facial expressions, and even the tone of voice." "If I weep,"
Wittgenstein had observed, "the sensations around my eyes are obviously
part, and an important part, of what I feel. This is, I think, what
William James meant when he said that a man doesn't cry because he is sad
but that he is sad because he cries." Had this been all James meant, then
he was guilty only of expressing a noncontroversial or "obvious" point
in a rather exaggerated manner. In his subsequent criticism, however,
Wittgenstein took James's manner much more seriously; the neat inversion
of "a man doesn't cry because he is sad but . . . is sad because he cries"
turned out to involve considerable cognitive distortion, in particular
the supposed reduction of emotions to sensations no different in kind
from those one feels "around [one's] eyes when one is crying."

<P>
Wittgenstein insisted that, due to the grammar of his theory, James
mistakenly imposed a third-person perspective on an inherently
first-person experience. It was as if an emotion were "[s]omething
that could only be established through an act of looking," whether by
inspecting one's own face in order to determine "the muscular feeling
of a smile" or by introspecting "localized feelings" "in the breast and
belly etc." Now, it is quite true that James alluded to feelings that
were "localized" internally, as in his comment in "The Physical Basis of
Emotion" that the sensations of internal bodily activity that accompanied
externally observable bodily movement were undoubtedly "localized in
divers parts of my organism," however "hard" it proved "to describe"
them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Yet James distinguished <I>these</I> sensations
from the "sensible quality" that initiated the bodily movement in the
first place. The experience of an emotion wasn't simply the summation,
in no particular order, of a set of sensory "components" (such as "the
perception of the exciting fact" plus "the muscular feeling of a smile"
plus several localized feelings "in the breast and belly etc."), but
the experience of a particular "succession" of sensations, sensations
that, in Stein's phrasing, "make a succession" together.

<P>
James did not wish to "shew that muscular sensations <I>are</I> sadness,"
nor that such sensations are "part of sadness" in the sense that there
is something <I>prima facie</I> emotional about them. As Wittgenstein
himself observed a year later, even as he was yet again taking James
to task for supposedly equating a "bodily sensation," in this case an
imagined one, with an emotion or "something like it": "Is it clear a
priori that whoever 
<B></B> 
imitates joy will feel it? Couldn't the mere
attempt to laugh while one was feeling grief bring about an enormous
sharpening of the grief?" (<I>R2,</I> 61e). The only problem with this
remark, practically speaking, is that, far from demonstrating the
inadequacies of James's theory, it actually proves quite consistent
with it. Despite Wittgenstein's contention that James relied on a
misleading analogy between sensation and emotion, the formulator of
radical empiricism no more identified sensation and emotion than Stein
equated sentences and paragraphs. Just as "emotional paragraphs" were
"made up of unemotional sentences," emotions were composed of unemotional
sensations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 What Stein recognized as she watched her poodle
drinking water was that sentences and paragraphs were related in exactly
the same way that sensations and emotions were; indeed, her thesis
concerning the emotional nature of paragraphs was itself a variation on
James's theory of emotion, only extended to writing.

"A More Comprehensive Syntax"
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Wittgenstein's own mistake in the <I>Tractatus,</I> he explained to
Friedrich Waismann and Moritz Schlick late in 1929, a year after his
return to Cambridge, was in having relied on too circumscribed a notion of
syntax. As a result he had failed to attend to "the inner connection of
propositions," that is, the grammatical connections between propositions
that formed "a more comprehensive syntax about which I did not yet know
anything at the time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Consequently, his "philosophical
task," as Ray Monk observes, "now lay in describing this more complicated
syntax, and in making clear the role of 'internal connections' in
inference."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Nevertheless, what Stein demonstrated in her
investigations of the paragraph, composed coincidentally the same
year that Wittgenstein began to map his more comprehensive syntax,
is that even as he extended the parameters of syntax, his conception
of grammar remained overly circumscribed. The model of a sentence
swimming in the stream of a particular language game rather than in
the stream of consciousness, an emendation both of James and of his
own earlier conception of the sentence entirely removed from the stream
of consciousness, left no place for the paragraph. Despite, or perhaps
more exactly, due to his conception of "a more comprehensive syntax," the
sentence remained the largest grammatical unit short of an entire language
game. Yet, as anyone familiar with Wittgenstein's later work will know,
the basic compositional unit of his own writing shifted from the discrete
sentence in the <I>Tractatus</I> to the paragraph, whether in the form of
"remarks" <I>(Bermerkungen)</I> or "cuttings" <I>(Zettel).</I> This makes
the neglect in his "philosophical grammar" of the intermediate unit whose
grammatical significance Stein was investigating in compositions like
"More Grammar for a Sentence" all the more striking.

<P>
The difference between Stein and Wittgenstein on the subject of
grammar may be summed up (although it certainly doesn't exhaust their
differences) in the contrast between the phrasing of what each took to
be the minimal requirement for judging 
<B></B> 
the import of a proposition:
"a more comprehensive syntax," in Wittgenstein's case, and in Stein's,
"more grammar for a sentence." Whereas Wittgenstein proposed an expanded
notion of syntax that remained continuous with the ordinary notion, Stein
speculated on the possibility of a grammar that, without contradicting
the syntactical structure of the sentence, nonetheless combined
syntactically discrete units to provide "more grammar," more breathing
room, more life, as it were, "for a sentence" than the exclusively
spatial forms of even an extended syntax were capable of doing. The
so-called syntax of a paragraph wasn't anything like the syntax of a
sentence, and consequently Wittgenstein's expansion of the notion of
syntax from sentence to language game skipped over a crucial stage in
the production of meaning. In the Wittgensteinian universe, sentences
only made sense in the context of use determined by particular language
games; for Stein, by contrast, the minimal context in which a written
sentence made sense was the paragraph. Although a given language game
provided a more or less stable background, the sentence made unambiguous
sense only with respect to the manner of "succession" that determined
the "emotional balance" of the paragraph containing it. The meaning of
any particular sentence proved willy-nilly a function of emotion (and
ultimately of physiology). Wittgenstein, on the other hand, eschewed
both emotion and physiology in seeming to bridge sentence and language
game without a hitch.

<P>
Needless to say, emotion returned through the back door in Wittgenstein's
writing. For what he didn't say, he showed: not because it was logically
impossible to state, as he suggested in the <I>Tractatus,</I> but because
it was inconsistent with his theory. Wittgenstein once observed that
Russell's, and his own, failure to provide specific examples of the
elementary propositions posited by Russell's logical atomism should have
indicated to them that there was something wrong with the theory. The
equivalent problem with his own "practical holism," as David Stern has
labeled the perspective expressed in Wittgenstein's later philosophy,
wasn't, to be sure, the insufficient number of examples--there is
no shortage of these--but rather just what the examples are examples
<I>of.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Does the imagined utterance "For a second he felt
deep grief," for instance, acquire its significance or lack thereof (as
an example of the sort of senseless non sequitur Wittgenstein sought to
expose throughout his career) in the broader language games of English and
German syntax, or only in the context of his immediate remarks, remarks
that so often took the form, in his later writing, of discrete paragraphs?

<P>
Although Wittgenstein's idiosyncratic manner of composition was part of
a long tradition of aphoristic, paragraph-length meditations in German-
and French-language philosophical prose, he tended unsurprisingly
to narrate the development of his style within the frame of his own
career. In the most celebrated of these accounts, the 1945 preface to
<I>Philosophical Investigations,</I> he confessed that "after several
unsuccessful attempts to weld my results together into . . . a whole,"
in which "the thoughts should proceed from one subject to another in a
natural order and without breaks," he

realized that I should never succeed. The best I could write would never
be more than philosophical remarks; my thoughts were soon crippled if
I tried to force them on in any single direction against their natural
inclination.--And this was, of course, connected with the very nature
of the investigation. For this compels us to travel over a wide field
of thought criss-cross in every direction.--The philosophical remarks in
this book are, as it were, a number of sketches of landscapes which were
made in the course of these long and involved journeyings. [<I>PI,</I> ve]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In other words, because his "natural inclination" was to presume that
everything was connected, and yet he rejected (on the basis of his own
argument in the <I>Tractatus</I>) the idea that a part was capable
of synecdochically serving as a key to the whole, the only viable
option was to "travel . . . criss-cross in every direction." Yet,
in characterizing the resulting "album" as "the <I>precipitate</I>
of philosophical investigations" that had "occupied" him, as of 1945,
"for the last sixteen years" (<I>PI,</I> ve; my emphasis), Wittgenstein
confirms the impression suggested by his subsequent reference to the
"short paragraphs" in which he had "written down [his] thoughts" (ixe) as
comprising "a number of sketches of landscapes . . . made in the course
of . . . long and involved journeyings" (<I>PI,</I> ve). Clearly, he
conceived of grammatical phenomena as features of an external rather than
an internal landscape, in which meaning was a function of precipitation
(on the model of chemical processes) rather than of emotion (on the
model of physiology). This is not to say, of course, that he understood
philosophy to be a sort of chemistry or physics, but rather that the
increasingly comprehensive syntax he outlined was consistent with
the external perspective of physics rather than with the internal or
physiological perspective of James's radical empiricism.

<P>
Another account of his compositional practice, dictated to a
student a dozen years earlier, took its lead from "Schopenhauer's
view that philosophy is an organism, and that a book on philosophy,
with a beginning and end, is a sort of contradiction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

Wittgenstein continued, "One difficulty with philosophy is that we lack
a synoptic view. We encounter the kind of difficulty we should have with
the geography of a country for which we had no map, or else a map of
isolated bits. The country we are talking about is language, and the
geography its grammar." (<I>WA,</I> 53) Observing that each problem
in philosophy might be likened to a road on a map of this country, he
added that "[i]n philosophy matters are not simple enough for us to
say, 'Let's get a rough idea,' for we do not know the country except by
knowing the connections between the roads." "So I suggest repetition,"
he concluded, "as a means of surveying the connections" (<I>WA,</I>
53). In <I>Philosophical Investigations</I> he elaborated:

The same or almost the same points were always being approached afresh
from different directions, and new sketches made. Very many of these
were badly drawn or uncharacteristic, marked by all the defects of a weak
draughtsman. And when they were rejected a number of tolerable ones were
left, which now had to be arranged and sometimes cut down, so that if
you looked at them you could get a picture of the landscape. [<I>PI,</I>

<P>
This is the closest Wittgenstein gets to discussing his compositional
practice of "remarks" and "cuttings," but it is enough to demonstrate
that although he denied the possibility of a "synoptic view" of the
geography of language, he still conceived of grammar as "[s]omething
that could only be established through an act of looking" and hence
from the third-person perspective of traditional science (as he quite
rightly suggested emotion could not be). Although Stein also stressed the
centrality of looking in her compositional practice--"it is her eyes and
mind that are active and important and concerned in choosing" (<I>AA,</I>
75), she observed of herself--there was one crucial difference. Stein
conceived of such "active" looking along physiological lines rather than,
like Wittgenstein, exclusively as a function of optics. "[Y]ou see," she
might thus explain to Toklas in the <I>Autobiography,</I> concerning the
"surpris[ing]" absence of anything written in French among her reading
matter: "I feel with my eyes and it does not make any difference to me
what language I hear, I don't hear a language, I hear tones of voice and
rhythms, but with my eyes I see words and sentences"--and, one might
add, paragraphs (<I>AA,</I> 70). "[T]here is for me only one language
and that is english" (<I>AA,</I> 70). "Feeling with one's eyes" is not
exactly what Wittgenstein had in mind in composing <I>Philosophical
Investigations</I> as he did, yet his writing inevitably calls forth
some such experience in the reader determined to make sense of this most
Emersonian of twentieth-century albums.

<P>
"The actual key to understanding" Wittgenstein's philosophy, Michael Nedo
has suggested, "is the study of the connections between remarks: the
complex trains of thought which run from one to the other" (<I>WA,</I>
53). This is no doubt true, and it is certainly what Wittgenstein
himself implies, yet it also raises two questions: first, why should the
remarks so consistently take the form of paragraphs; and second, what
is such blatantly psychological phrasing ("complex trains of thought")
doing here, when Wittgenstein expressly sought to substitute a logical
and syntactical account of meaning for the traditional psychological
account? The answer to both questions is not, it seems to me, that Nedo
has made an embarrassing slip but that Wittgenstein's paragraphing does
the work, in his adamantly nonpsychological account, of the emotional or
physiological mechanisms of psychology, without which neither he nor his
readers would be able to get on with the masterful job of "surveying the
connections." Such surveying requires the projection of "body feelings"
whereby, as Susanne Langer argues, one models "the very existence of
'things' . . . on [one's] own inward expectation of strains, directions,
and limitations of [one's] felt actions," in addition to modeling the
"wholeness and simplicity of molar objects on that of [one's own]
soma."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 To acknowledge this is certainly not to deny the
great value of Wittgenstein's account of grammar, and the even greater
value of his grammatical investigations, yet it does require that one
reject the residual appeal of an elegance capable of producing the sort of
self-contradiction that exists between his elegant, homogeneous model of
grammar as syntax and the actual grammar of his investigations, composed
of differences that, in Stein's terms, function not as contradictions
<B></B> 
but as combinations. This state of self-contradiction, it should
be noted, contrasts sharply with the phoenix-like self-immolation that
concludes the <I>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.</I>

<P>
Late in part one of the <I>Investigations</I> Wittgenstein rounded off
a brief remark with the obscure observation, "Meaning is a physiognomy"
(<I>PI,</I> 151e). He was alluding here to a line of reasoning that
stretched back at least a dozen years, to the "Big Typescript" of 1933,
where he had characterized the procedure of grammatical investigations
such as his, in gradually mapping out "a more comprehensive syntax," as
"mak[ing] a tracing of the physiognomy of every error" in order to make
sense of its lack of sense.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 "The point is to hit upon the
physiognomy of the thing" ("P," 165). By contrast, for Stein, as she
put it in <I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</I> (composed in 1932,
published in 1933), "the human being essentially is not paintable," due to
the inherently flat surface of painting (<I>AA,</I> 119). Hence, from her
perspective, Wittgenstein's likening of meaning to a physiognomy that one
might trace was an error of precisely the kind he was using the analogy
to specify. "If I correct a philosophical mistake," he had proposed,

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
and say that this is the way it has always been conceived, but this
is not the way it is, I always point to an analogy . . . that was
followed, and show that this analogy is incorrect. . . . The effect of
a false analogy . . . is as if a thing seemed to be a human being from
a distance, because we don't perceive anything definite, but from close
up we see that it is a tree stump. ["P," 163]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Drawing an analogy between meaning and a traceable physiognomy had the
consequence, from Stein's perspective, of removing the emotional or
physiological dimension from human beings and, in effect, reducing "the
human form and the human face" to something compositionally analogous
to a tree stump.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>


<P>
"The philosopher strives," Wittgenstein continued in his remarks in the
"Big Typescript," "to find . . . the word [or the correct choice of
words] that finally permits us to grasp what up until now has intangibly
weighed down our consciousness": to "make a tracing of the physiognomy"
of this "grammatical unclarity," this false analogy or "false thought
process" ("P," 165). For in grasping the error <I>as</I> an error, in
"hit[ting] upon the physiognomy of the thing," one rids oneself of
something whose effect has been "a constant battle and uneasiness"
("P," 163). Wittgenstein further likens this constant irritability to
the experience of having "a hair on one's tongue: one feels it, but
cannot grasp it, and therefore cannot get rid of it" ("P," 165). When
"the irritating character of grammatical unclarity" is removed, one
is then able to move forward unimpeded: "the car [now] placed on
the tracks precisely so . . . can keep rolling correctly" ("P," 166,
165). "Philosophical problems arise," as Wittgenstein famously remarked
in the <I>Investigations,</I> "when language goes on holiday" (<I>PI,</I>
19e). "The confusions which occupy us arise," that is, "when language is 
<B></B> 
like an engine idling, not when it is doing work," with the idling
experienced as a quasi-neurasthenic irritability (<I>PI,</I> 51e).

<P>
In hitting upon the physiognomy of the thing, then, one sees its
true face and its true character. One sees what it means--<I>meaning
is a physiognomy</I>--and in the case of error, or false analogy,
one sees that it is actually a non sequitur, and therefore without
meaning. Within this framework meaning is understood to be a function of
"a more comprehensive syntax" that operates on an exclusively analogical
basis. Hence "tracing the outline of [a] thing's nature" (<I>PI,</I> 48e)
involves tracing the network of analogies that constitutes it. Yet is this
physiognomic frame itself immune from the criticism Wittgenstein directed
in <I>Philosophical Investigations</I> at "philosophical problems" in
general and at those that had concerned him in the <I>Tractatus</I> in
particular? In philosophy, he observed, "naming appears as a <I>queer</I>
connexion of a word with an object":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
--And you really get such a <I>queer</I> connexion when the philosopher
tries to bring out <I>the</I> relation between name and thing by staring
at an object in front of him and repeating a name or even the word "this"
innumerable times. For philosophical problems arise when language <I>goes
on holiday.</I> And <I>here</I> we may indeed fancy naming to be some
remarkable act of mind, as it were a baptism of an object. And we can also
say the word "this" <I>to</I> the object, as it were <I>address</I> the
object as "this"--a queer use of the word, which doubtless only occurs
in doing philosophy. [<I>PI,</I> 19e]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Similarly, he remarked, in commenting on proposition 4.5 of the
<I>Tractatus</I> ("The general form of propositions is: This is how
things are"): "That is the kind of proposition that one repeats to oneself
countless times. One thinks that one is tracing the outline of the thing's
nature over and over again, and one is merely tracing round the frame
through which we look at it." (<I>PI,</I> 48e) In the <I>Tractatus</I>
"[a] <I>picture</I> held us captive," Wittgenstein concluded: "[a]nd
we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language
seemed to repeat it to us inexorably" (<I>PI,</I> 48e). Such idling, the
compulsive repetition of this picture of propositional syntax, was due to
"grammatical unclarity," and could only be resolved by exactly tracing
the physiognomy of the false analogy in terms of which it was framed.

<P>
Yet a picture held Wittgenstein captive in the <I>Investigations</I> as
well: the picture of <I>looking</I> (understood exclusively as a form
of analysis, the tracing of syntactical relations) that he carried
over to philosophy, analogically, from physics. Hence, according to
Wittgenstein, when "William James got the idea," through a process of
introspection, "that the 'self' consisted mainly of 'peculiar motions
in the head and between the head and throat'" (<I>PI,</I> 124e), what
such "introspection [actually] shewed" was "not the meaning of the word
'self' (so far as it means something like 'person,' 'human being,' 'he
himself,' 'I myself'), nor any analysis of such a thing, but the state
of a philosopher's attention when he says the word 'self' to himself
and tries to analyse its meaning" (<I>PI,</I> 125e). Wittgenstein is
mistaken here, however. James's state of attention was not the ordinary
"state of a philosopher's attention," not at least of the sort of
philosopher who compulsively repeats "this" or "this is how things are"
<B></B> 
or even "this is how things look, analogically speaking." In
fact, Jamesian introspection didn't show a "state" of attention at all,
but a physiological <I>process</I> of attending; and Wittgenstein's
description of James may usefully be contrasted with Stein's description
of Picasso's manner of looking, in her 1938 account of his career--a
very different form of physiognomic attention, indeed: "[T]he souls
of people do not interest him," she observed; "that is to say for him
the reality of life is in the head, the face and the body and this is
for him so important, so pertinent, so complete that it is not at all
necessary to think of any other thing and the soul is another thing"
(<I>P,</I> 40). "A child," she explained,

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
sees the face of its mother, it sees it in a completely different way
than other people see it, I am not speaking of the spirit of the mother,
but of the features and the whole face, the child sees it from very
near, it is a large face for the eyes of a small one, it is certain the
child for a little while only sees a part of the face of its mother, it
knows one feature and not another, one side and not the other, and in
his way Picasso knows faces as a child knows them and the head and the
body. [<I>P,</I> 41]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In other words, the child does not see the parts of its mother's face as
being each in an <I>analogous</I> relation to a whole, and consequently
the child cannot trace its mother's physiognomy, "trace the outline of
[her] nature." It isn't that there is something <I>there</I> that the
child fails to see; rather, as Stein said of Picasso, it is a matter of
"things [being] seen not as one knows them" (<I>P,</I> 41), not as a
function, that is, of one's prior "convictions about what people are"
(<I>P,</I> 40) and what "the human form and the human face" (<I>P,</I>
40) are, but of things seen "as they are when one sees them without
remembering having looked at them" (<I>P,</I> 41), the way an infant
sees. In this way one actively "feel[s] with [one's] eyes," as Stein
suggested she did in her writing, and as Picasso did in painting
and James in introspecting, rather than passively "tracing round the
frame" through which "the physiognomy of the thing" is registered as a
physiognomy--as Wittgenstein continued to do in conceiving of "[m]eaning
[as] a physiognomy."

In another set of remarks composed in the late 1940s regarding
James's suggestion that "the emotion consists in the bodily feeling,"
Wittgenstein concludes with the instruction to "[c]ompare fear and anxiety
with care," adding: "And what sort of description is this: '<I>Ewiges
Dustere steigt herunter</I> . . .'?/ One might describe a pain like that;
even paint it" (<I>R1,</I> 132e-133e). In the most thorough account
of Wittgenstein's readings of James to date, Joachim Schulte has observed
that "[t]he original German word translated as care is <I>'Sorge.'</I>
And Wittgenstein continues by asking himself what sort of description
is given by words like 'Ewiges Dustre steigt herunter,' translated as
'Perpetual cloud descends.' These words are spoken by the re of Sorge
in the last act of Goethe's <I>Faust</I>" (Joachim Schulte, <I>Experience
and Expression: Wittgenstein's Philosophy of Psychology</I> [Oxford:
Clarendon Press, 1993], 128). Schulte is quite right in proposing
that Wittgenstein invokes <I>Sorge</I> here because it is an emotion
typically "without a clear cause or object," in contrast to fear and
anxiety. Yet it does not follow that the emotion is "[un]accompan[ied]"
by "strong . . . physical feelings," as Schulte asserts; rather the
feelings are less likely to be felt as impacts and hence due to external
influences. None of this is inconsistent with James's theory of emotion,
of course. Moreover, through the reference to <I>Sorge</I> Wittgenstein
joins his early interest in <I>The Varieties of Religious Experience</I>
and his subsequent engagement with <I>The Principles of Psychology,</I>
particularly with the James-Lange theory. For additional discussions
of Wittgenstein and James centered on the James-Lange theory, see

that it would induce such vibration in the line forming it." "[I]t was

artist, "that conceived mathematically influenced Marcel Duchamp and
produced his The Nude Descending the Staircase" (<I>AA,</I> 120).

When many millions of people all over the world demand security and
a state that must guarantee it, that's one thing. But when bowlers or
batsmen, responsible for an activity essentially artistic and individual,
are dominated by the same principles, then the result is what we have.

--C. L. R. James, "The Welfare State of Mind"
<!--_/attribution-->

<P>
In his State of the Union address of 1935, Franklin Roosevelt reaffirmed
his commitment before Congress and the American people to make it his
"first and continuing task" to provide for the "security of the men,
women and children of the nation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
Later that year, as he
signed the Social Security Act into law, he explained that the legislation
was a necessary response to the facts of the modern industrial world. A
national insurance plan like Social Security, designed to provide some
minimal form of protection from adverse contingencies that individuals
could neither anticipate nor control, was needed because "the civilization
of the past hundred years, with its startling industrial changes, has
tended more and more to make life insecure."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Acknowledging
that it was impossible to "insure one hundred percent of the population
against one hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life,"
he nonetheless expressed the hope that Social Security would give "some
measure of protection to the average citizen."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>


<P>
Two years later, in his essay "Insurance and Social Change," Wallace
Stevens defended the Social Security Administration to his coworkers at
the Hartford Fire and Indemnity Company, 
<B></B> 
rebutting the claim that the
welfare-state incursion into insurance practice would fragment an already
diminished market. Stressing the fact that the private industry looked
to offer "insurance for everything," as opposed to the government's
"insurance for all," Stevens argued that federal insurance, far from
competing with private insurance, provided the precondition for the
latter's efforts to "perfect" insurance coverage. "To be certain of a
regular income, as in the case of social security," reasoned Stevens,
"is not the same thing as to be able to repair any damage, or to meet any
emergency."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Indeed it is only when Americans were certain of
a regular income that they could afford the "insurance for everything"
offered by the private industry.

<P>
Social Security was seen in this way to offer one solution to the
depression specter of "underconsumption," the notion that the nation's
economic troubles were traceable less to excessive industrial production
than to the failure of Americans to consume what was produced. "Insurance
and Social Change," however, also suggests a more literary solution to
the problem of underconsumption. According to Stevens, nothing stimulated
demand more than representing a product in its perfected form. Stevens
reasons, for example, that "it helps us to see [the value of] insurance
in the midst of social change to imagine a world in which insurance has
been made perfect" ("ISC," 234). He goes on to observe that H. G. Wells
revitalized the field of mechanical science in this manner, coyly noting
that "If Mr. Wells has preferred the machine to insurance as his field,
he has only left insurance to others" ("ISC," 234). Thus Wallace Stevens,
poet, makes his bid to be the H. G. Wells of insurance. But Stevens goes
farther still. In "Adagia" (1934-37), he claims not simply that
poetry might usefully represent the workings of perfect insurance, but
that it can actually perform them. "Poetry," he writes, "is a purging
of the world's poverty and change and evil and death."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 This
statement doubles the assertion in "Insurance and Social Change" that
perfect insurance brings about "a world in which nothing unpleasant can
happen" and where "all our wishes . . . come true" ("ISC," 234). Indeed
given these criteria, one might reasonably argue that perfect insurance
could be found <I>only</I> in poetry: where else but in a poem could a
wish eliminate evil and death?

<P>
The suggestion that poetry might somehow "eliminate" evil and death,
however, was more likely to consign it to social irrelevance than
establish it as an active force in the mitigation of insecurity. Nothing
was more common throughout the 1930s, and more potentially damning, than
the claim that poetry provided a safe haven from the withering realities
of the depression, a place as insulated from want and suffering as the
shimmering worlds projected in the nation's movie theaters. Speaking
from a proto-Popular Front Left in the 1935 <I>New Masses,</I>
Stanley Burnshaw makes the scathing observation that "contemporary poets
. . . have all tramped off to some escapist limbo where they are joyously
gathering moonshine."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 At the other end of the political
spectrum, the southern Agrarian John Crowe Ransom in 1938 derides the
poet who invents "a private world where . . . injustice cannot be and
enjoy it as men enjoy their dream."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Bread lines called for
more than fantastical worlds, and Burnshaw and Ransom were just two
of many who felt that the depression made 
<B></B> 
unavoidable the differences
between security of an imaginative and a substantive financial kind.

<P>
Yet condemnations of inexcusably "private" retreats into the poetic
imagination do not so much undermine the analogy between Stevens's poetry
and insurance as explain why that relationship is constructed through a
defense of Social Security. It is in this respect crucial that Stevens
defends Social Security in "Insurance and Social Change" by insisting that
"perfect insurance" needed to take an unmistakably public form. Stevens
asks, for example, that we "Compare the man who, as an individual, insures
his dwelling against fire with that personality of the first plane who, at
a stroke, insures all dwellings against fire; and who, without stopping
to think about it, insures not only the lives of all those that live in
the dwellings, but insures all people against all happenings" ("ISC,"
234). The identity of this personality is left suggestively nebulous;
he seems at once Roosevelt, God, and a messianic poet turned insurance
provider. But whoever or whatever it is, Stevens's personality does
not retreat from the world into a private imagination. In fact, the
office this personality performs seems public precisely because it is
opposed to thought of any kind. Stevens's poetic corpus of the 1930s
and early 1940s opposes "stopping to think" to public action in just
this manner. Stevens's poetry persistently stages the substitution of
thought with the "impersonal" representation of social relationships;
hence his aphorism "People take the place of thoughts" ("A," 198). For
Stevens, then, insurance and poetry both supervene at the limits of
intentional agency; in his conception of both insurance and poetry, the
objectification of social relationships compensates for the fact that
no premeditated plan can ever make the future sufficiently secure.

<P>
"Insurance and Social Change" therefore marks the moment at which Stevens
comes to understand poetry as being importantly related to the necessarily
public activities of America's first welfare state, in particular to
the federal "insurance for all," Social Security, that has emerged as
the New Deal's most sacrosanct legacy. "We feel threatened," Stevens
notes at his first public lecture in 1936; "[w]e look from an uncertain
present toward a more uncertain future. One feels the desire to collect
oneself against all this in poetry as well as in politics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

Roosevelt would of course "collect" against the future in a strictly
economic sense: "We must begin now to make provisions for the future," he
declared during a Fireside Chat on 28 April 1935.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Nonetheless,
poetry and politics alike would after 1935 address themselves at a much
deeper level to structures of agency defined in relation to necessarily
imaginative invocations of the future.

<P>
"Relatively to a given human being," reasons Oliver Wendell Holmes in
<I>The Common Law,</I> "anything is accident which he could not fairly
have been expected to contemplate as possible . . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

Accidents have meaning, Holmes makes clear, only to the extent that
they mark a transgression of our imaginative capacities, our ability
to envision future states. It is in this context hardly surprising
that a poet as concerned with the imagination as Stevens would work in
close orbit to a government committed to providing for the future. The
suggestion that accidents are defined 
<B></B> 
only in relation to what cannot
be anticipated might lead to the conclusion that shoring up individual
agency meant expanding the individual's imaginative capacities such
that he could be able to anticipate all future contingency. Yet this
suggestion just as plausibly leads to the opposite conclusion, namely,
that individuals could protect themselves only by renouncing the value
of the imagination per se. Stevens, I have already suggested, reached
the latter conclusion. Thus his project of affixing the poetic to the
rising star of an increasingly interventionist government did not call for
the integration of life and art, nor did it make claims for the literal
outcomes poetry might effect. Far from a self-confident activism, the
insistence on the provision of security instead marked the outer limits
of federal as well as poetic agency; after 1935, welfare government and
poetry both would work to compensate, after the fact, for all they could
not imagine, for all they could not prevent.

<P>
Michael Denning notes in <I>The Cultural Front</I> that "the public
cultural apparatus was virtually invented by the New Deal."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

He explains, "The state sponsorship of writers, artists, theaters, and
musicians that began in the spring of 1935 under the Works Progress
Administration as relief from the present crisis became an attempt to
redefine American culture and to create a 'culture of democracy' by
establishing a bureaucracy that would provide 'culture' for the people"
(<I>CF,</I> 44). This culture of democracy is not Denning's primary
concern. Far from it; his book is instead devoted to demonstrating
the existence of a broadly conceived "cultural front" that was "not
simply New Deal liberalism" (<I>CF,</I> xvii). The Left during the New
Deal, he claims with equal anxiousness, was not simply "the product
of the new cultural apparatuses of the state and industry" (<I>CF,</I>
96). Thus <I>The Cultural Front</I> sets out to recover a substrata of
working-class radicalism, a "laboring of American culture" that remained
distinct from, and ultimately survived, New Deal liberalism. But beyond
the fact that he uses it as a foil for cultural-front radicalism, it
remains entirely unclear throughout what exactly Denning means by New
Deal liberalism. Denning's refusal to reveal the criteria that might
distinguish New Deal liberalism from a capaciously defined cultural
front turns out seriously to compromise his ability to understand the
public cultural apparatus the New Deal did in fact invent.

<P>
In what follows, I will insist that insofar as there was a coherent
New Deal liberalism, it was organized around not a nebulously conceived
culture of democracy, but what Roosevelt termed his "security legislation"
(<I>FDR,</I> 86). The Social Security Administration and the Works
Progress Administration in particular formed what he called a "new order
of things," of which "every major legislative enactment of . . . Congress
should be a component part" (<I>FDR,</I> 82, 83). The Federal Writers'
Project--part of this new order--supported more than seven thousand
writers at its peak in 1937. More importantly, by 1937, the project's
commitment to security had 
<B></B> 
produced an entirely new set of answers to
what John Dos Passos, writing on the nature of literary professionalism,
called "the whole question of what writing is."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>


<P>
The official New Deal answer to Dos Passos was implicit in the wage
structure that the Writers' Project offered: according to Harry
Alsberg, director of the project, writing could be secured from
economic contingency only when it was more a public activity subject
to regulation than a privately owned product. The weekly salary paid
writers for producing material they would never own and never have to
sell (usually between $20 and $30) made this unmistakably clear. Thus
when Richard Wright notes in "How Bigger Was Born" that "just as a man
rises in the morning to dig ditches for his bread, so I'd work daily
[writing <I>Native</I> <I>Son</I>]," his invocation of labor carries
a literal force that a phrase like "the laboring of American culture"
does not: Wright was working for a Writers' Project wage when he started
writing <I>Native Son,</I> a novel that would "strive to heighten the
consciousness of the [petty bourgeoisie] to all those progressive forces
making for security in American life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Wright in fact was
on the federal payroll even <I>as</I> he was writing it, for he was a
member of the elite Creative Writers' Project, a unit of the Writers'
Project that paid writers to work on their own material (in this case
material that would comprise <I>Native Son</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>


<P>
Moreover, the rise of New Deal patronage led a broad contingent of
writers--including those who had not themselves been made "clients"
of the New Deal by working on the projects and those who were at best
ambivalently associated with the Left--to theorize the relation between
the specific modes of support used to enable writing and the aesthetic
criteria used to justify that support. Robert Frost's pre-New Deal
claim in "Build Soil, A Political Pastoral"  that "Thought product
and food product are to me / nothing compared to the producing of them"
left Burnshaw unsure of the poet's political affiliations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

The political commitment to writing as labor and the concomitant
generality of the antimarket sentiment that the lines convey could
not then be specified with any kind of accuracy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 By 1935,
however, Ernest Hemingway's antithetical and quintessentially modernist
claim that his writing was something "round and whole and solid" could
be understood as inseparable from his often scathing criticism of the WPA
and the salary it provided its workers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Hemingway's relation
to the New Deal can be most successfully elaborated through his aesthetic
convictions; Hemingway would repeatedly make clear that his writing was
above all else an artifact, and in "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" and <I>To
Have and Have Not</I> this artifact is shown not only to be impervious
to the woundings that plague the characters, but finally to be more
resilient to unexpected change than any person putatively secured by
the New Deal.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>


<P>
But even Frost's "Build Soil," first delivered during the primaries
for the 1932 presidential election, provides a compelling example of
how "security legislation" ideas inflected, <I>avant la lettre,</I>
modernist efforts at poetic self-definition. Modeled on Virgil's "First
Eclogue," the poem takes as its subject the social obligations incurred
with different forms of literary patronage: should the poet Tityrus,
the poem asks, somehow address in his poetry the impoverishment of his
peer

Meliboeus, who is struggling at self-employment? Unlike Meliboeus,
both Virgil's and Frost's Tityrus draw their respective wages from
public institutions meant to secure them from the market: Virgil's
from the Roman state, and Frost's from a university poets-in-residence
program (presumably like the one at which Frost himself was then
employed).

In both Virgil's and Frost's pastorals, Tityrus is asked for help by
the farmer Meliboeus; in both he refuses the plea for assistance. In
"Build Soil," Tityrus tells the suffering farmer that the only revolution
available is a "one man revolution":

Thus even though Frost seems to champion something like Social Security
when he writes elsewhere that it is "Better to go down dignified / With
boughten friendship at your side / Than none at all," Tityrus claims
that poetry is most valuable in its ability to counterbalance the
forms of interpersonal association that programs like Social Security
demanded.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 "We're too unseparate out among each other" insists
Tityrus, and we are meant to believe that poetry, imagined as a private
form of nonmarketed labor, compensates for this fact ("BS," 324).

<P>
It is of course not clear how this advice helps Meliboeus, particularly
because Tityrus's refusal to take his thought product to market is
not private in any clear sense--on the contrary, it is underwritten
by a salary unavailable to Meliboeus. Meliboeus therefore concludes
the poem by ironically paraphrasing Tityrus's incoherence, stating that
"going home / From company means coming to our senses" ("BS," 325). If a
reassuring poetic retreat from a threatening reality is a familiar theme
in pastoral, then so is the pronominal oscillation that here confuses the
isolate with the collective.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 What does it mean, for instance,
that "we" come to "our" senses only when "we" are most alone? In what
respect does the often conflicted movement to collective pronouns that
marks pastoral generally and Frost's poem specifically alter Tityrus's
claim that poetry is the last bastion against the eroding of private and
autonomous experience? These questions point to what recent critics have
seen as the defining problematic in New Deal writing. One critic argues
that James Agee's <I>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</I> (the preeminent New
Deal pastoral) "is a product of the Great Depression, which," he insists,
"still occupies a mythic place as the moment when irrepressible private
suffering publicly marked a faltering of capitalism." This critic then
goes on to note how the work "replicate[s] the antinomies of private
and public as a tension between artistic independence and corporate
patronage."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 In this account independence seems to mean
privacy, and we are meant to understand that the history of art since
the New Deal has been the history of art's 
<B></B> 
betrayal at the hands of
government and corporate modes of patronage antithetical to that privacy.

<P>
This kind of nostalgia for "artistic independence" misses entirely the
significance of those formal and stylistic developments brought about by
the rise of both state and corporate patronage--misses, in other words,
the transformations undergone by American modernism as it impacted with
the New Deal. Stevens's poetry in particular does not dramatize the
<I>antagonism</I> between private independence and public support so much
as it demonstrates how the rise of corporate patronage facilitated and
was perfectly consistent with a relocation of poetic interest, already in
progress, from the private "I" to the public "we." Stevens will show what
is implicit in Frost's poem, namely that valuing literary labor at the
expense of the literary artifact is significant not because it enables a
private retreat from the market but because it relocates the poetic domain
from private experience to public paradigms that authenticate experience
in the process of making it reproducible. Alsberg would proudly declare
that his project provided writers with a form of collective and impersonal
artistic labor unavailable since the late Middle Ages, suggesting in
this way a necessary relation between the project's employment structure
(writers would punch a clock on group projects that rarely bore their
names) and the value of the work it produced. Modernist impersonality
would loom large in Stevens's work as well; he declares in "Adagia" that
"Poetry is not a personal matter" ("A," 189), and would use his own
source of income--the insurance company--to understand the ways in which
the regulation of objectified social relationships enabled rather than
threatened the sanctity and security of the individual, both in poetry
and business.

<P>
All insurance practice, private or public, poetic or political, aggregates
social relationships. Before any insurance practice becomes concerned
with the ways it will sell its product to individual persons, it works
to understand those persons in terms of population groups. The category
of risk in particular identifies the frequency with which a given
outcome will occur in a generalized target group. Actuarial science in
this manner calculates the probability of specific outcomes occurring
in specific populations. But in fact, risk is not predictive for the
individual at all, for while it might make sense to say, based upon past
calculations, that thirty percent of all adult males in a given test
group will be in at least one automobile accident before they are forty
years old, it does not make sense to say that there is a thirty-percent
risk that a given adult male within that group will have an automobile
accident before that age. "Risk is collective," explains Fran&ccedil;ois
Ewald. "Whereas an accident, as damage, misfortune and suffering, is
always individual, striking at one and not another, a risk of accident
affects a population. Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as an
individual risk."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>


<P>
The point here is that an insurance practice is able to order and
systematize what seem to be random events by studying those events as
they occur in population groups. In "The Vice of Gambling and the Virtue
of Insurance" , George Bernard Shaw asks, "how is it possible to
budget for solvency in dealing with matters of chance? The answer is that
when dealt with in sufficient numbers, matters of 
<B></B> 
chance become matters of certainty."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 As Shaw goes on to explain, insurance is used
to account for events in their most public and generalizable form, and
as such is relatively uninterested in the irreducibly private dimensions
of personal experience. This is why, for example, insurance is of such
interest to a thinker like Michel Foucault. Foucault sees insurance as
insistently, almost coercively, collective and consequently identifies it
as one of the principle mechanisms through which the modern state manages
population groups.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 It is crucial to insurance practice
that it "secure" the population group more than any one individual
within it. Insurance cannot guarantee that individuals do not experience
accidents, and the indemnification it offers is never an exact substitute
for the loss incurred in any given experience. Instead, insurance
guarantees that one person's experiences will not be transferred to others
as a loss (when, for example, an insured individual is able to continue to
meet his financial obligations after a work-stopping injury). Insurance
underwrites, as Stevens puts it, "a world in which nothing unpleasant
can happen," not by somehow insulating private experience from public
reality, but by relocating the social significance of experience from
the private and the subjective to the public and the transferable.

<P>
Frost's phrase "boughten friendship" is useful here, for it exemplifies
how insurance transforms relations once thought to be the product of a
private proclivity into generalizable economic relations newly dependent
upon the "interpersonal" nexus Frost's Tityrus so despises. Stevens's
third-person lyric achieves this same interpersonality, for it shifts
poetic identification from inner experience to objectifications of
the social never reducible to any one person's experience. Indeed
Stevens brings to the fore the actuarial nature of his poetry in a poem
explicitly about the transition from a first-person voice committed to
the "private" imagination to a more scientific means of representing
public relationships.

<P>
Reviewing Stevens's <I>Ideas of Order,</I> Burnshaw claims in 1935 that
in "The Idea of Order at Key West," "contradictory notions" produce
a poem in which "uncertainties are unavoidable."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 When
later asked the perceived source of that uncertainty, Burnshaw answered
that the middle-class and politically unaffiliated Stevens was "unable
to make alliance with what we considered to be the forces that would
make things better."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 But Stevens does very specifically
refer to a compensatory mechanism designed to "make things better"
(insurance) when he insists to his editor just after this review that
"in 'The Idea of Order at Key West' life has ceased to be a matter of
chance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Stevens explains his comment by noting, "it may
be that every man introduces his own order into the life about him and
that the idea of order is simply what Bishop Berkeley might have called
a fortuitous concourse of personal orders. But still there is order"
(<I>L,</I> 293).

<P>
It is not immediately clear what it means for chance to be replaced by a
"<I>fortuitous</I> concourse of personal orders." If the elimination
of chance is "fortuitous"--and not the result of the personal agency
gestured to in the phrase "every man introduces"--then in what respect
has chance been eliminated? Stevens's comment, however, 
<B></B> 
makes perfect sense in the context of the actuarial science just discussed: to recall
Shaw, "when dealt with in sufficient numbers, matters of chance become
matters of certainty." What appears fortuitous to one person is, from
a more totalized perspective, part of a predictable pattern; as one
economist explains insurance, whereas "individuals may face uncertainty
. . . society can face approximate certainty."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 As I will
show below, "The Idea of Order" depends upon this move from the isolated
individual to the population group, which is why Stevens can explain
the elimination of chance in that poem with the simple but authoritative
assertion, "But still there is order": chance becomes probability--becomes
calculable--the moment that a set of what at first seem to be discrete
accidental events takes on a recognizable pattern if viewed at the level
of an entire population. Paradoxically, life becomes a matter of risk
when it "ceases to be a matter of chance." Stevens's desire to collect
oneself against uncertainty consequently emerges here with a literal
force: uncertainty is eliminated when individuals are "collected" into
population groups impersonal enough to turn chance into probability,
impersonal enough to warrant Stevens's third-person lyric. That Frost,
committed as he was to the inviolate privacy of the poetic experience,
should write to Burnshaw at this time that "it was chance when the right
subject matter and the right words came together" is in this context
not surprising:
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 looking "inside in," a poetic devoted to
the private will invariably experience as accidental those events that,
seen from a totalizing perspective, constitute the most perfect of orders.

If Frost had reason to associate his job at a university writing program
with more overt modes of government employment, Stevens, who had been
made vice president of Hartford Fire and Indemnity in 1934, had even
more reason to believe he was working for a corporation that was in
many respects indistinguishable from the New Deal. This was viable in
part because by 1935 Roosevelt had made the New Deal stand or fall on
its ability to provide security. More importantly, the modes of social
organization intrinsic to insurance provided the pattern for many of
the New Deal's economic and social programs. Long before the New Deal,
the insurance company had offered the preeminent model for what would
come to be called the welfare state: Oliver Wendell Holmes remarks in
1881, for instance, that "[t]he state might conceivably make itself a
mutual insurance company against accidents, and distribute the burden
of its citizens' mishaps among all its members. There might be a pension
for paralytics, and state aid for those who suffered in person or estate
from tempest or wild beasts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 However fanciful this proposal
might have seemed to Holmes, it usefully demonstrates how easily private
insurance practice did in fact become public. Indeed by 1939, a novelist
like Josephine Herbst refused to distinguish between private and public
forms of insurance: she writes that the New Deal had entered into a
"conspiracy" with the insurance company; "as long as <I>this government
<B></B> 
exists,</I>" a character exclaims in her <I>Rope of Gold,</I> insurance
is the one basic reliable investment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>


<P>
For Herbst, to be committed to insurance was in some sense already to
be committed to the New Deal. Just as the private insurance industry
promised security in its ability to extend to its clients an artificial
and financially defined family, Roosevelt's security legislation promised
a form of "boughten friendship" as a function of American citizenship
itself. To the extent that modern life left the individual unable to plan
or effect his future, Roosevelt offered him security by facilitating and
regulating his access to those resources at the disposal of an officially
sanctioned national-population group. "A million persons organized as a
state can do things that cannot be dared by private individuals," notes
Shaw, things that "no private company can do."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>


<P>
In the years leading up to the establishment of the Social Security
Administration and the WPA, however, it seemed that an interventionist
state might do more than simply provide for individual security. At
first, the acknowledgment that the individual is unable to cause or even
foresee the conditions of his economic existence led to the hope that
government might secure for itself the agency unavailable to individual
persons. During the early years of the New Deal (1933-35), public
opinion overwhelmingly supported the pooling of more than financial
resources; it supported, that is, a form of national planning that
would locate in government the capacity for intentional agency that the
uncertainty of modern life was seen to threaten. The desire for economic
centralization, which gave the state the power not to ameliorate the
effects of economic downturns but to direct the course of the economy
such that there would be no downturns, resulted in what Frank Warren has
called "an apotheosis of the idea of planning, in which planning became
almost synonymous with liberalism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>


<P>
Thus whereas Soviet and German economies--both committed to national
planning--turned to an increasingly authoritarian centrism, the New
Deal's "associational" economy, orchestrated by the National Recovery
Administration (NRA), was sold as the culmination of democratic
representation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 "There is nothing complicated about it,"
Roosevelt declared of the NRA during a Fireside Chat. "It goes back to
the basic idea of society and of the nation itself that people acting
in a group can accomplish things which no individual acting alone could
even hope to bring about" (<I>FDR,</I> 65). But the NRA was seen to
articulate and organize more than collective accomplishments, more even
than collective hopes. "The social will," noted Rexford Tugwell while
presenting his case for what would shortly thereafter become the NRA,
"is a vague and elusive thing, difficult to apprehend, more difficult
to pin down to specific issues."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 "Governments," however,
"presumably, are expressions of [the] social will. That is their excuse
for being."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Thus the plans formulated by the NRA were sold
as the product of a national collectivity: Roosevelt would describe the
NRA as a brain trust of macro-economic proportions. During the years
leading up to the dismantling of the NRA in 1935, Roosevelt described
the New Deal as "the public's government" because it articulated nothing
less than the public will (<I>FDR,</I> 128). <B></B>

<P>
According to Walter Lippmann, any endeavor like the NRA was doomed from
the start, not because Roosevelt's economic council would ignore the
public's will, but because the public did not have a will. In <I>The
Phantom Public</I> , Lippmann, responding in large part to
Herbert Hoover's repeated corporate-liberal invocations of the public
interest, insisted that a public was not a person, and that there was
no meaningful sense in which a public could be said to have interests,
let alone intentional agency. Intentional agency dissolved during the
move from the individual to the public; there was, he claimed, only a
virtual and impersonal public, one that by definition could not formulate
designs. "A mere phantom," "an abstraction," the public was not "a fixed
body of individuals," and therefore could never "direct . . . the course
of events."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>


<P>
Lippmann's claim that a collective entity like the public could
only mistakenly be conceived of as an agent would become recast as a
central criticism of the welfare state in the hands of a laissez-faire
conservative like Ayn Rand. In <I>Atlas Shrugged</I> , her
libertarian <I>&Uuml;bermensch</I> John Galt hijacks a radio broadcast
from a band of aging New Dealers and speaks to a captive audience: "The
good, say the mystics of muscle, is Society--a thing which they define as
an organism that possesses no physical form, a super-being embodied in no
one in particular and everyone in general except yourself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

But as Rand would insist again and again, "Mankind is not an entity,
an organism, or a coral bush."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 There was no sense in
which one could attribute intention of any kind to a collective. Howard
Roark, the modernist hero of <I>The Fountainhead</I> , Rand's most
explicitly anti-New Deal polemic, puts this most simply during the
trial at the close of the novel. Roark stands accused of blowing up a
government housing project that he designed, but that has been altered
by others. "The mind is an attribute of the individual," Roark explains:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For Roark, as well as for Rand, the welfare state rested on the faulty
premise that public, collective groups could perform those functions
reserved for private, necessarily singular persons. In this instance,
Rand's caricature was not without its basis. In <I>Liberalism and
Social Action</I> , a defense of an "organized social control of
economic forces," John Dewey claimed that the state "has to assume the
responsibility for making it clear that intelligence is a social asset,
and is clothed with a function as public as its origin."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>


<P>
On the other hand, John Maynard Keynes's <I>General Theory of Employment,
Interest, and Money</I> , perhaps the most important influence on
the future of the American welfare state, made clear in economic terms
that intelligence was not a social asset, particularly in the case of
nationally planned economies. National planning, 
<B></B> 
Keynes reasoned, had
embraced the faulty proposition that the state's involvement in the
economy needed to proceed by refining technologies of representation,
by deciding how successfully to personify and so represent collective
agency, by deciding how a board, a president, or even an entire government
might think and plan for the larger totalities they represented. Keynes,
however, argued that there had been "a fundamental misunderstanding of
how . . . the economy in which we live actually works," and maintained
that personifying groups did not address the fact that there was no way
for groups, or the persons they were made to resemble, to intend the
economies they comprised.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>


<P>
Moreover, Keynes maintained that like individual persons and
collectivities, government had no significant intentional agency in
matters of economy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 The organic complexity of economies
meant that no government plan, however comprehensive, could anticipate or
account for economic contingencies as they developed. Keynes would argue,
for example, that a traditional actuarial calculus could never accurately
measure probability in questions of macro-economics--the government,
for example, could never foresee exactly how many unemployed would
need each month to claim unemployment benefits from the Social Security
Administration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Thus he argued that continual regulation of
fiscal and monetary policy was necessary because the international nature
of the modern economy guaranteed that government could never anticipate
or stabilize the contexts in which it would execute its plans. In fact,
Keynes saw the controlled circulation of money as the consummate means of
addressing the inherently uncertain nature of modern economies, writing
with emphasis that <I>"the importance of money essentially flows from
its being a link between the present and the future"</I> (<I>GT,</I>
293). Thus while governments did not know what was done with the money
they regulated, money remained one of the only traceable lineaments
connecting governmental actions and their outcomes.

<P>
The legislators of the world, acknowledged and unacknowledged both, were
retrenching, for the 1930s and 1940s would find Stevens fascinated with
these same issues, such that he could claim, for example, to be interested
in what he called "up to date capitalism" (<I>L,</I> 292), a claim that
might begin to explain his famously cryptic proclamation that "Money is
a kind of poetry" ("A," 191).
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 This assertion seems to find
Keynesian explanation in "The Pleasures of Merely Circulating," as well
as in <I>Owl's Clover,</I> where the injunction "To live incessantly
in change" is enabled by the command "turn / Your backs upon the vivid
statue."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Stevens would in fact take this opposition into
the concluding cantos of "Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction" , where
he contrasts the civic aggressions of an architect and sculptor who
"builds capitols" and "establishes statues of reasonable men" to the
intrinsically poetic song of a robin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Whereas the sculptor
attempts to impose an artifactual order of his own making on a public
world, the robin produces art in the simple process of singing. In this
way the public circulation of money that funds the sculptor is transformed
into a poetic commitment to circulation as such, for the robin's songs

<P>
Here, then, is one context in which to understand the poem's edict
"It Must Change" ("NT," 389). Poetry--like an act of establishing, but
unlike the statue that is finally established--is thus conceived of as
"[a]n occupation, an exercise, a work."

<P>
The idea that circulation could itself become an aesthetic value was
far from the mind of a writer like Anzia Yezierska when she declared
of her experience on the Federal Writers' Project that "every day it
became harder to blind ourselves to the cold fact that we, like the
privy-builders and road-makers of other public projects, were being paid,
not for what we did, but to put money into circulation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>

Yezierska, the author of successful novels that had become still more
lucrative when they were made into films, refused to imagine herself a
wage laborer. Stevens, however, would cannily suggest that the commitment
to producing a literary artifact (as opposed to simply circulating)
opened one up to precisely the uncertainty both he and the Writers'
Project were committed to protecting against. <I>Owl's Clover,</I>
for example, does more than simply relocate poetic value from the
artifact to a process of making--it associates the fixity of the statue
with the inevitable uncertainty of how others respond to it. Richard
Wright, veteran of the Writers' Project, claims that he doesn't care
if either critics or consumers decide whether "<I>Native Son</I> is a
good book or a bad book" because "the mere writing of it will be more
fun and a deeper satisfaction than any praise or blame from anybody"
(<I>N,</I> 540). Hence Wright, dubbing writing "a significant kind of
living" (<I>N,</I> 535), absolves writing from the unpredictability of
consumption in much the same way that Keynesian theory, committed to the
ongoing regulation of monetary and fiscal policy, absolves governments
from having to anticipate future economic contingencies. Indeed neither
author nor government could anticipate the whims of the consumer. Thus
whereas the second stanza of <I>Owl's Clover</I> begins, "So much the
sculptor had foreseen," the third stanza represents a consumer of the
statue that the sculptor "had not foreseen," in this way explaining why
poetry might want to hypostatize the regulated circulation of money and
commit to the trope of continuous labor.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>


<P>
But Keynesian economics provides more than an homology for Stevens's
substitution of a "going round // And round and round" for artifactual
art, for Keynes would argue as early as 1936 that government
spending on the arts was an ideal way 
<B></B> 
to put federal money into public
circulation. Keynes was in fact the first head of Britain's Council for
the Encouragement of Music and Arts, established in 1941, and later
founded and ran the British Arts Council. Like the New Deal's Arts
Projects, both organizations would work to implement his claim, made in
1936, that the performative arts in particular were ideal recipients of
government spending. In "Art and the State," Keynes reasons that

It was of course the aim of Keynesian economics to demonstrate that this
hypothetical common man could not meaningfully imagine himself part of
a community able to affect the economy. But if collective agency was
dead, the common man might receive art in its stead. The artist, Keynes
reasons, in need of "economic security and enough income" ("AS," 372),
would thus become the "servant of the public" ("AS," 372), an expressive
vehicle for what by his own account cited above was a mostly fictive
"spirit" ("AS," 374), when his art was at its most "ephemeral" ("AS,"
374). Artists, as well as "architects and engineers," might in this way
"embody the various imagination . . . of peaceful and satisfied spirits"
("AS," 374). The reflexive and placating moment of performance, he
declared, was "an immortal function of the state, an art of government
regarded at most times as essential" ("AS," 373).

 Does the singer orchestrate the sea

correlative meant to "embody the various imagination . . . of peaceful

beyond the control of any imagination?

<P>
However these questions are answered, it is clear that the poem, in its
relentless quest to locate the origins of order and in its opposition,
fundamental to modern political theory, between the natural and the
social, speaks in potentially expansive registers. "Order has to be
created," Keynes insisted, "It is not natural."

 There was,
he maintained, no systemic genius; laissez-faire could in the end lead
only to what "The Idea of Order at Key West"--seeming to compare waves
to stockmarkets--will call "meaningless plungings" ("IO," 129). Stevens
raises the possibility of such analogies when he notes on the jacket
cover of <I>Ideas of Order</I> that "We think of changes 
<B></B> 
occurring
today as economic changes, involving political and social changes. Such
changes raise questions of political and social order." "[I]t is
inevitable" he continues, "that a poet should be concerned with such
questions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>


<P>
If <I>Ideas of Order</I> reveals this concern, then the poem "The Idea
of Order at Key West" does so even more pointedly. The year Stevens
wrote the poem, 1934, saw the high-water mark in a federal and state
publicity campaign that held Key West up as the perfect encapsulation
of the early New Deal. The Roosevelt Administration lauded Key West as
"an illustration" and "model" of the goals of its work-relief programs;
the town was declared "New Deal Town" as newspapers across the country
followed Roosevelt's lead in associating the isolated island with the
possibilities of a federally orchestrated economic recovery.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

Liberal intellectuals were just as sanguine. "In that isolated microcosm
you could study the whole issue of disinterested collective planning
versus interested private enterprise," writes Elmer Davis of Key West in
1935. This leads him to conclude with grandeur that Key West had become
nothing less than "the New Deal in miniature."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>


<P>
This was the case, Davis reasoned, because "City and county had
surrendered their powers, via the Governor, to experts from Washington
backed by Federal funds" in their efforts to rebuild Key West after it was
devastated by a hurricane in 1934 ("NW," 641). By July 1934, Julius Stone,
the ranking Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) officer in
Florida, had assumed control of the town and began disbursing the $935,000
the FERA would spend on the now-stranded island in its first year alone.

<P>
But for Davis, Federal Relief had done more than save Key West; it had
transformed it into something of an intellectual hot-house: "It was
Greenwich Village, Montparnasse, Provincetown--on a little tropical
island" ("NW," 648). The hot topics, however, were not those that had
characterized other centers of modernist bohemia; Davis claims that
"groups of men and women" would sit up "till two A. M. discussing problems
of administrative technique, and having as good a time as they would
have had at the nightclubs" ("NW," 649). "The dominant interest," Davis
explains of these discussions, was "the application--however hampered
and unsuccessful--of the trained and disinterested intelligence to
the problems of collective welfare" ("NW," 649). This celebration of
"administrative technique" and those "disinterested intelligences" who
would perfect it is cause for suspicion as well as for marvel, for Davis
laments that if the New Deal "had got started earlier, the rehabilitation
of Key West would have been a really collective enterprise; now it cannot
help looking to many people like something imposed by outside authority"
("NW," 650). Thus we are left, Davis concludes, with "a picture of a
group of intelligent men and women applying their intelligence (under
whatever handicaps, with however limited success) to the problems of a
community which could not save itself" ("NW," 652).

<P>
The imposition of order "by outside authority" on a "community which could
not save itself" speaks directly to "The Idea of Order at Key West"'s
organizing question--"Whose spirit is this?" But it is the opposition
Davis sets up between the civic planning of administrative experts and
a planning that might "have been a really collective 
<B></B> 
enterprise" that
speaks most directly to the poem, which is meant precisely to moot the
opposition between these two alternatives, both of which presume that
human agents impose order on the world through constructive imaginative
acts. Key West was the New Deal in miniature for Stevens as well as for
Davis, but the insurance executive saw what the future head of the Office
of War Information did not, namely that welfare government would be felt
most powerfully not in the worlds it built, but in the provisions it
made for its inevitable failure to secure those worlds from the hazards
of the unforeseen.

<P>
"The Idea of Order" is most explicitly about the difficulty of discerning,
let alone controlling, the causes of events. The lines of influence
between woman and sea are next to impossible to discern, as when the
speaker notes that "The song and water were not medleyed sound / Even if
what she sang was what she heard, / Since what she sang was uttered word
by word" ("IO," 128). Amid the qualification, the words seem to utter
themselves, lending force to the ambiguous phrase at the beginning of
the stanza, "No more was she" ("IO," 128).

<P>
But if this phrase suggests the irrelevance of the individual agent
in the face of sublime, natural forces, the speaker's desire to know
"Whose spirit is this?" continually searches for an intentional agent as
the source of what he sees. The relentless personification in the poem
is perhaps the most telling sign of the speaker's efforts to locate this
agency. The sea is produced as a personification ("the ever-hooded, tragic
gestured sea" ["IO," 129] has a "genius" ["IO," 128], a "body" ["IO,"
128], "sleeves" ["IO," 128], and a "dark voice"["IO," 129]) precisely
so the speaker can treat it as a potentially intentional agent equal to
the singer. Genius and body, however, are not interchangeable aspects
of personhood; rather, the former designates the capacity to control and
direct the latter. Thus the sea is least like an intentional agent when
the speaker notes that "the water never formed to mind or voice, / Like
a body wholly body" ("IO," 128).

<P>
Similar mind-body dualisms pervade Stevens's writing: the possibility
that a genius or spirit--like Lippmann's phantom or Rand's society, an
"organism that possesses no physical form"--might transcend and intend an
otherwise inhibiting physical world is wholly consonant with the utopic
vision in "Insurance and Social Change" of a "perfect insurance" under
whose aegis all wishes instantly become reality. More specifically, in
"Surety and Fidelity Claims" , his only other surviving essay on
insurance, Stevens imagines an insurance agent whose body vanishes into
his work as a result of his ability to guarantee plans: the surety agent,
who provides bonds guaranteeing the fulfillment of contracts, "finds it
difficult sometimes to distinguish himself from the papers he handles
and comes almost to believe that he and his papers constitute a single
creature, consisting principally of hands and eyes: lots of hands and
lots of eyes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 As pure interpersonal, communicative facility
(with hands, eyes, and a body of text), Stevens's agent guarantees the
elimination of chance and the fulfillment of contract by dispossessing
himself of the bulk of his body. This is the panacea of national planning:
a vision of the private imagination gone public, 
<B></B> 
the beginnings of a
truly collective agency enabled by minds acting and thinking together
in spite of all physical demarcation.

<P>
It is, however, a panacea "The Idea of Order" will dismiss. The fourth
stanza in particular makes clear that the difficulty of the question
"Whose spirit is this?" is that bodies and voices designate the only
recognizable markers of human identity and agency. Lippmann's public
and Keynes's spirits are in the end impotently passive precisely because
they are abstract entities. Likewise for Stevens, if spirit is completely
disembodied, it becomes invisible and potentially manifold, difficult to
identify and understand as a coherent intentional force. In the fourth
stanza the speaker is thus unable to locate any origin for the cacophony
of voices he hears--without any one body, spirit seems to transcend the
sum of its sources:

What first promised to be a poetic event caused by one intentional agent
goes on to emerge as a sublime and agentless natural event; "meaningless
plungings" and "bronze shadows heaped / On high horizons" ("IO," 129)
overcome the speaker in all their accidental grandeur, overwhelming his
efforts to imagine one mind capable of serving as a cause for the tumult
before him.

<P>
What follows at first seems a typical compensatory gesture designed
to consolidate the autonomy and cognitive powers of the isolate and
intentional mind. Almost inexplicably, the speaker now appears to accord
the singer her constructive powers:

At first glance, these assertions seem successfully to mitigate the
sublime excess to which the speaker just bore witness. Yet this is at
best an ambivalent moment of compensation, 
<B></B> 
for it insists upon the
necessarily hermetic nature of the imaginative powers conceded the
singer. The seemingly definitive claim "She was the single artificer
of the world" is qualified by the enjambed phrase "In which she sang,"
suggesting that the world in which the singer sings is not necessarily
the same as the world in which the speaker moves. The claim made in the
stanza's final two lines similarly allows a world-constructing agency at
the moment that it signals the singer's potential alienation by qualifying
the parameters of her world. Indeed the qualifying "for her" looms large
in a line that sets off the claim for world-making with the assertion
of the social "we" speaking the poem: "Then <I>we,</I> / As <I>we</I>
beheld her striding there alone, / Knew" (emphasis added).
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>


<P>
The speaker does not know, however, who or what makes the order in
the town, which stands in marked contrast to the natural setting of
the first half of the poem. The singer having concluded her song, the
speaker wants to know

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Still searching for an agent--still, that is, unable to answer the
question "Whose spirit is this?"--the speaker tentatively attributes
agency to synthetic as opposed to natural phenomena, such that "the lights
in the fishing boats" have "Mastered the night and portioned out the sea."

<P>
The rationalized and geometric nature of the civic displaces as well an
expressive privacy that stands in opposition to the public of two that
observes the singer. Subject to the sustained critical observation of
two male viewers, it is her mind, not her body, that most forcefully
registers the singer's isolation from the social, and her concomitant
intimacy with the natural. Throughout the 1930s Stevens would dissociate
the intentional mind from public order--he writes in "Adagia" that "The
poet represents the mind in the act of defending <I>us</I> against itself"
("A," 199; emphasis added). After noting that "The mind is not equal to
the demands of oratory, poetry etc." ("A," 200), he goes on to declare
that "Poetry is a cure of the mind" ("A," 201). Hence the prevalent
critical conviction that in Stevens the mind is most suspect when it
seeks to realize itself in a publicly apprehensible reality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

Poetry did not, as Frost's Tityrus suggests it should, rescue the private
imagination from the public sphere so much as it rescued collective
groups of persons existing in a public sphere from their commitment to
the private imagination, and from their corollary belief that they could
make life secure by somehow realizing in a social domain the worlds they
collectively imagined.

<P>
The fifth stanza therefore concludes by confirming the incompatibility of
the singer's song with the world to which the speaker and his companion
return in the 
<B></B> 
last stanza of the poem, a public world in which lights
on fishing boats are the only identifiable traces of an agency that now,
more than ever, seems to have no identifiable source. "Turning," in what
looks to promise a quintessentially modernist act of poetic conversion,
"Toward the town" ("IO," 130), the speaker turns toward a public sphere
dominated by bodies open to experience but unable to direct the course
of their world. Rather than getting rid of bodies, Stevens gets rid
of minds; here too "People take the place of thoughts." It is not
until the cryptic emergence of "ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds"
("IO," 130) in the poem's last line that we begin to understand what
this conversion promises.

In his landmark essay "The Relation of Habitual Thought and Behavior to
Language" , the linguist Benjamin Whorf proposes that hearing is the
most notable of those "nonspatial" perceptions that are rendered "spatial"
by "linguistic metaphorical system[s]."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 This linguistic
production of order is at times a risky business, for it contributes to
"behavior evincing a false sense of security or an assumption that all
will always go smoothly, and a lack of foreseeing and protecting ourselves
against hazards" (<I>LT,</I> 154). The "indifference to the unexpectedness
of life" (<I>LT,</I> 154) built into Standard Average European language
groups motivates the essay, committed as it is to demonstrating that
specified language patterns form the bedrock upon which individuals build
their perceptual abilities and ultimately their behavior.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>


<P>
Whorf's first ideas on this topic were formed, he claimed, while working
"in a field usually considered remote from linguistics" (<I>LT,</I>
135). That field was insurance, and the insurance company for which Whorf
worked was Stevens's, the Hartford Fire and Indemnity Company. Whorf
consequently published the findings that formed the basis for "The
Relation of Habitual Thought and Behavior to Language" in <I>The Hartford
Agent,</I> the house journal that first carried Stevens's "Insurance
and Social Change." In fact, it was while Stevens was vice president of
Hartford that Whorf conducted experiments in how different phrases on
fire-warning labels enabled individuals to perceive danger. Individuals
anticipated future danger, Whorf insisted, through language, specifically
through highly specified language patterns. Correctly phrased labels,
reasoned Whorf, might thus key the individual into a perceptual
mode adequate to the situation at hand, a mode meant to register the
ghostly presence of risks that are themselves only fictions of the
potential, inductions from past events. The warning label, then, was
seen to function in a manner strikingly similar to the way the insurance
company's proliferation of risk groups keyed individuals into potential
dangers of which they were previously unaware; a person informed he is
part of a given risk group, for example, will discover danger in actions
and behaviors once thought to be harmless.

<P>
If warning labels represented one way specialized language systems
enabled individuals to discover hazard in the world around them, Whorf
reasoned that poetry was 
<B></B> 
another (<I>LT,</I> 260). Stevens--still
Whorf's boss when he made this suggestion--was of course himself
concerned throughout his poetic career with how poetic language enabled
individuals to refine their perceptions of an impersonal world they
could not control. "Esth&eacute;tique du Mal" , for example, is
an attempt to generate an apparatus of perception for danger and pain
in a world that has come to think of both in abstract and impersonal
terms. "Life is a bitter aspic," the poem insists. "We are not at the
center of a diamond."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Thus the third-person conditional
claim in the poem "That he might suffer or that / He might die" is met
with the compensatory suggestion that poetry might do more than simply
smooth the edges of looming suffering and death.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Poetry,
Stevens would claim in poem after poem, addressed the reality of pain and
suffering by enhancing empirical perception; it was, he claimed in "The
Man with the Blue Guitar" , "A composing of senses."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>


<P>
"The Idea of Order" ends with just such a composing of senses, with
the cryptic emergence of "ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds" from
"[t]he maker's rage to order words of the sea" ("IO," 130). That the
poem's demarcations have been ghostly throughout hardly needs reinforcing;
moving from sea to town, the speaker remains unable to distinguish cause
from effect. What is significant, however, is the insistence that "keener
sounds" emerge precisely in his inability to distinguish between the
two. Only in giving up the search for the origin and source of effects,
the line suggests, do individuals begin to experience these same effects
with heightened acuity, with an enhanced ability to distinguish, to
refine, to classify. "Keener sounds" is in this respect the poem's true
compensatory offering, a tendering of Whorfian logic--that poems, like
all language systems, guard against chance by producing the awareness
of risks--in the wake of the speaker's realization that he cannot locate
the ultimate source of any order, either natural or synthetic.

<P>
But then who creates the order that does organize the town at the close
of "The Idea of Order at Key West"? Who is the maker of which the final
stanza speaks? Is he or she what Stevens calls elsewhere "a separate
author, a different poet, / An accretion from ourselves, intelligent /
Beyond intelligence, an artificial man"?
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Is this "separate
author" the "personality of the first plane" Stevens speaks of in
"Insurance and Social Change"? Whorf would refer the ability of this
personality to act "without stopping to think"--Stevens's essay is
published in the company journal just two years earlier--to his efforts
to personify language as a mass mind that legislated the actions of
individuals. "It is as if the personal mind," he argues, "which selects
words but is largely oblivious to pattern, were in the grip of a higher,
far more intellectual mind, which has very little notion of houses and
beds and soup kettles, but can systematize and mathematize on a scale
and scope that no mathematician of the schools ever remotely approached"
(<I>LT,</I> 257).

<P>
What matters most in "The Idea of Order" however is the simple fact
that no human being within the poem can be this kind of separate author
or different poet. Most of all, the author of the poem itself does
not qualify. "[T]here are words / Better without an author, without a
poet," Stevens writes in "The Creations of Sounds" 
<B></B> 
.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>

Throughout his career Stevens would suggest that--like the solitary singer
who cannot definitively be said to order her world--not even the poet
could experience the meaning of the poem as willed or intended. Stevens
notes in "Adagia" at this time that "a poem is like a natural object"
("A," 205) and that "It is not every day that the world arranges itself in
a poem" ("A," 191). Thus Stevens invents the quintessential mystification
of poetic authority, a mystification that formalizes the refusal of
intentional agency thematized in "The Idea of Order" itself. "Poetry
has to be something more than a conception of the mind," he writes;
"It has to be a revelation of nature" ("A," 191).
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>


<P>
By the seventh stanza of the poem, then, the frames collapse even the poet
into an all-inclusive population marked by the impotency of the mind: "the
maker's rage to order words of the sea" offers knowledge "of ourselves
and of our origins" ("IO," 130) at the precise moment that the referent
for "ourselves" and "maker" is expansively inclusive. The speaker, like
those around him, like the poet himself, does not personally intend or
otherwise cause the aggregation of this collectivity; in "Notes Toward a
Supreme Fiction," Stevens, in the process of rejecting public statuary
in favor of continuous song, explains that this is the gift of public
experience, "To discover an order . . . to find, / Not to impose, not to
have reasoned at all" ("NT," 404). Indeed membership in this population
group is defined by all those things individuals <I>cannot</I> impose
upon the future, and by these criteria, the reader, like the author, is
as much a member as any character in the poem.

<P>
But what exactly does it mean to claim that the poem itself has no
maker? Stevens's poetry after the New Deal, as well as the New Critical
theory his poetry was so influential in establishing, would answer this
question head-on. His poetry staged the incapacity of intentional agency,
and he maintained that their making and reception rehearsed the same:
"The basis of criticism is not . . . the hidden intention of the writer"
(<I>L,</I> 390), he writes in 1941. It would remain for the New Critics
to theorize this quintessentially New Deal disavowal: "The poem is not
the critic's own and not the author's," note W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe
C. Beardsley in "The Intentional Fallacy"; "it is detached from the author
at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or
control it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Here again we see the insistence that poetry
and criticism address themselves to the abdication of control, to the
fatuity of the intentional.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 Control and intention certainly
are not recouped in Wimsatt and Beardsley's "The Affective Fallacy,"
where the two make clear that the reader does not determine or cause the
poem any more than the poet or critic. This seems to leave a vacuum:
exactly who does intend or control the poem; exactly who is the maker
of a poem? Having disqualified all the individual sources of agency that
might make claim to that office, Wimsatt and Beardsley move, in a by now
familiar fashion, to the necessarily impersonal mechanism of the public
itself, claiming that "the poem belongs to the public."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>

What that public could finally be, and how a poem could actually belong
to it, remains a concern, a question of literary theory on the one hand,
and federal funding for the arts on the other. <B></B>

and Money,</I> vol. 7 of <I>The Collected Writings of John Maynard
Keynes</I> (1936; Cambridge, U. K.: Macmillan, 1973), 13; hereafter
abbreviated <I>GT.</I> From Keynes's perspective, national planning
picked up on a faulty premise central to classical economics, namely that
personified collectivities directed the course of the economy by entering
into contracts with each other. Whereas classical economy was based on the
idea that individual agents could never control the consequences of their
actions on the economy as a whole, it had nonetheless relocated their
agency to abstractions seen to possess the contract-making potential of
persons. Thus while individual workers, and even individual unions, might
never have the power to set their own wage levels, classical economy
nonetheless held that there was a source of collective and intentional
agency implicit in an aggregate of individual actions. "Labor" did in
fact determine its wages, for the actions of every worker and union
constituted the contract into which the abstract personification "labor"
was invariably seen to enter. Keynes argued that there was no way to exert
this kind of agency in the economy, however the agents themselves were
conceived. He insisted that "there may exist no expedient by which labour
as a whole can reduce its <I>real</I> wage to a given re by making
revised <I>money</I> bargains with the entrepreneurs" (<I>GT,</I> 13).

Alan Brinkley explains that the introduction of Keynesian economics
into the New Deal led to the belief that "the industrial economy was too
large, too complex, too diverse; no single plan could encompass it all"

and Fall of the New Deal Order, 1930-1980,</I> ed. Stephen Fraser
and Gary Gerstle, 1989 [Princeton, N. J.: Princeton University Press],
93). The welfare state emerges most clearly in its contrast with the
planned economy; as Robert E. Goddin points out,

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The point of welfare state interventions is to remedy unplanned
and unwelcome outcomes. The welfare state strives to produce a
post-fisc[al] distribution of certain goods and services that is
preferable to the pre-fisc[al] one. In a planned economy, by contrast,
all outcomes are the outcomes of planning. Not all are necessarily
intended or welcome outcomes, to be sure. But correcting planning
errors is surely qualitatively different from correcting the market's
unplanned perversities [Robert E. Goddin, "Reasons for Welfare: Economic,
Sociological, and Political--but Ultimately Moral," in <I>Responsibility,
Rights, and Welfare: The Theory of the Welfare State,</I> ed. J. Donald

Burnshaw was suspicious of the poem for exactly this reason, and notes
that before he wrote his infamous review he began to wonder "which world"
it was that the singer actually made ("Interview with Stanley Burnshaw,"
124). Harold Bloom sees the song as evidence of Stevens's interest in a
transcendental order that is "not our own," but can be located "nowhere
else" but in ourselves (Harold Bloom, <I>Wallace Stevens: The Poems of
Our Climate</I> [Ithaca, N. Y.: Cornell University Press], 101). Despite
his avowed interest in the topographical, J. Hillis Miller, like Bloom,
has recently located the poem's order in the romantic imagination and
voice of the singer, and not in the town toward which the speaker turns
(<I>Topographies</I> [Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press,

Citing his mentor Edward Sapir, Whorf claims that "the cue to a
certain line of behavior is often given by the analogies of the linguistic
formula in which the situation is spoken of, and by which to some degree
it is analyzed, classified, and allotted its place in that world which
is 'to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of
the group'" (<I>LT,</I> 136). This claim would find its way into college
textbooks during the second half of the century, as anthropologists and
psychologists debated the validity of a debased "Whorfian Hypothesis,"
most often simplified into the claim that Eskimos could see distinctions
between different kinds of snow that English-language speakers could not,
because Eskimos used more words to describe snow. Hence the notoriously
post-structuralist conclusion always lurking in Whorf's work: reality is
in the end a linguistic construct. In its most simplified version, then,
the Whorfian Hypothesis suggests a striking similarity to a simplified
but nonetheless critically popular version of Stevens, one that sees the
poet committed to the proposition that reality, far from being a fixed
constant, is instead constructed by imaginative paradigms hammered out
in the forge of poetry.

If I'm not mistaken, Professor Lezra's narrative of the contradiction
inherent in Stein's construction of herself alternately as a "public
persona"  and as a contingent self, posed "incidentally"  in
the immediacy of the act of writing, together with his analysis of the
implications for subjective agency of the Steinian sentence, "Narrative
is it for one," lead him to conclude that we cannot read <I>How to
Write</I> after all. I want to refute this conclusion by offering two
methods to circumvent the critical binds Lezra proposes: the first is to
situate the texts of <I>How to Write</I> historically in the chronology
of Stein's work, and the second is to provide a compositional context
for the sentence Lezra isolates. I'll offer a reading of "Arthur A
Grammar," the text Lezra finds "baffling" , in order to demonstrate a
compositional approach to reading <I>How to Write.</I> Here I take issue
with Lezra's method since, read compositionally, the line "Narrative
is it for one" does not occur as an interruption to the discourse on
grammar as he insists , but as an integral part of an interrogative
series in which Stein compares the functions of grammar to those of
vocabulary, explanation, description, and narrative. In order to answer
whether grammar or the subject pre-poses the other, and before we can
speculate about the allegorical readings of formal equations that might
be implicated--grammar as the structure of identity, of resemblance,
of marriage, of publication--we'll need to know first what the working
practice of 
<B></B>
grammar <I>is</I> in the Steinian text. For this kind of
inquiry, we have to understand the importance of Stein's compositional
writing method.

Written after Stein's Cambridge and Oxford addresses in 1926 and before
her 1934-35 lecture tour in America, the compositions collected
in <I>How to Write</I> do not exemplify the crisis of writerly anxiety
that awareness of an audience was to cause Stein. Prompted by writing the
lecture "Composition as Explanation," Stein continued to write exercises
on the properties and operations of language structure itself. <I>How
to Write</I> collects some of these compositions written between 1927
and 1931 including "Sentences and Paragraphs," in which Stein questions
whether the sentence can be made to carry the emotional valence ordinarily
distributed in the paragraph, and "Arthur a Grammar," which circulates the
question "What is grammar."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 In my view, the texts of <I>How
to Write</I> are best considered members of a series of experiments with
language structure that begins with the composition "An Elucidation"
written in 1923, followed by her lecture, "Composition as Explanation,"
and then the individual compositions of <I>How to Write.</I> In this
series of investigations of both discursive operations and explanation,
the texts before and after the lecture are <I>the least constrained</I>
by the complications of self-presentation, and best exemplify Stein at
work on open-ended explorations in the fundamental operations of writing.

<P>
Concern for identity based on recognition, with its thematics of
historical time--memory and continuity--disrupted Stein's writing in the
mid-1920s when she was invited to lecture at Cambridge and Oxford, and,
again, famously, in the crisis after the success of <I>The Autobiography
of Alice B. Toklas</I> , when the fact that she had an audience made
it difficult for Stein to write. Questions about the relation of identity
and creativity recur and are critical to Stein's texts in the 1930s in
particular--<I>Four in America</I> (1932-33), <I>The Geographical
History of America or The Relation of Human Nature to the Human Mind</I>
, and <I>Ida a Novel</I> (1937-40).
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The anxiety
Stein felt at having agreed to explain her work, or at least to put
herself in a position where such an account could be expected, erupts
in the texts she was writing at the time she accepted the invitation to
lecture in England. According to Ulla Dydo, a "shrill sound" interrupts
the meditation of <I>A Novel of Thank You</I> when the speaker recalls
that she has been asked to give

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happened that the one who was the heroine had been asked to go if it
were not troubling her unduly was asked to come and if at that time there
had been no use if at that time it had been of no use asking would it
perhaps not be at all and more when there could be no difficulty might
she not present herself. And if she might what would she say and what
would she say when she was attentive.

Stein tried different methods to ameliorate this anxiety--to free her
writing self from the narcissistic impositions of the autobiographical
re. We can think of "Stanzas 
<B></B> in Meditation," for example, the
companion text she wrote concurrently with <I>The Autobiography of Alice
B. Toklas,</I> as private compensation for the public exposure. And
in <I>The Geographical History of America</I> we might consider the
distinction Stein draws between Human Mind, the self freed of personal
identity, historical time, and the source of creativity; and Human Nature,
the self bound by the preoccupations and fears of personal identity and
the source of personality, as Stein explaining <I>to herself</I> the
relation to personal identity necessary for her to continue writing.

The thing one gradually comes to find out is that one has no identity that
is when one is in the act of doing anything. Identity is recognition,
you know who you are because you and others remember anything about
yourself but essentially you are not that when you are doing anything. I
am I because my little dog knows me but, creatively speaking the little
dog knowing that you are you and your recognising that he knows, that
is what destroys creation. That is what makes school.

<P>
As readers of Stein we are faced with the problem of how to reconcile the
explanations of her work that she gave in lectures and the elucidations
in her work written as open-ended explorations in composition. Lezra
rightly notes the collision between the perfective descriptions of
writing projects in the lecture accounts and the infinitive state of
self Stein posited as necessary for writing--a contradiction Stein was
well aware of. The public lectures and experimental compositions are
very different texts in their claims and style: in its experiments with
the relation of examples and precepts, "An Elucidation," for instance,
is an experimental text much more faithful in its working articulation
of Stein's anti-substitutive theory of explanation than her lecture,
"Composition as Explanation," where composition cannot entirely replace
explanation because Stein has to use her own work as examples. As
critics we must decide how to treat the texts written for an audience
in our discussions of the experimental texts; we must devise critical
approaches that do not impose the theoretical frame of the lectures onto
the experimental texts, making the latter serve merely as examples for
findings we expect rather than making our own, present-day discoveries.

<P>
And we have the related problem, which Lezra indicates when he notices
the numbers of "Steins" proliferating, as to what stance to adopt before
Stein's insistence that the autobiographical self can be suspended in
its temporal concerns and memories, so that genuinely creative writing
can be done: "nobody sees the human mind while it is being existing, and
master-pieces well master-pieces may not be other than that that they do
not exist as anybody seeing them and yet there they are."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

For some readers, this proposal of an occlusion of the self is not
desirable; for others, convinced of the "imbrication of the grammatical
and the autobiographical" , it is not possible. There remains the
question as to whether there is any reason to believe that this state
of identity is importantly connected to creativity. Yet the suspension
of identity based in recognition is, Stein assures us, commonplace, a
habit we all share with writers of genius. In "What Are Master-Pieces
and Why Are There So Few of Them," she asserts, "At any moment when
you are you you are you without the memory of yourself because if you
remember yourself while you are you you are not for purposes of 
<B></B> 
creating you."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 As a procedural tactic, we can ask what we have to
gain if we go along with Stein's proposition that this dismantling or
suspension of autobiographical identity will disarm the assumptions
of a self predicated on memory--the self, in other words, who feels
sure she knows what grammar is, and who cannot "begin again." We can
then investigate how "Arthur a Grammar" elucidates the question it
repeats, by reading this "treatise in sound and sense" (<I>HW</I>, 70)
word-for-word and compositionally--for the distribution of sense as an
all-over effect of the exchanges, contradictions, and indeterminacy
of grammar under investigation. Or, to borrow Wittgenstein's phrase,
we read grammar as a subject of the text "that becomes surveyable by
a rearrangement."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 In order to give a reading of "Arthur a
Grammar," I propose that we bracket Stein's retrospective teleological
narratives of her compositional methods in lectures such as "Poetry
and Grammar"  from the infinitive state of self Stein invests
with agency to experiment in the composition itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 If we
understand that Stein's impetus to stage a present-tense, contingent
self was to enable a compositional form of inquiry, the results needn't
cancel out our readerly agency since surely such agency does not depend
altogether on narrative versions of the self.

<P>
As I've said, "Arthur a Grammar" is one in a series of writing
exercises that begin by posing questions about language structure and
its operations--vocabulary, grammar, sentences, paragraphs--and that
investigate elements of literary discourse such as description and
narrative. Some of these were published in 1931 with the title <I>How to
Write</I> in the Plain Edition series edited by Alice Toklas. The titles
in the collection reveal the playful and earnest tone Stein adopted
toward her subject. In the sequence of composition these are: "Regular
Regularly in Narrative," "Finally George a Vocabulary for Thinking,"
"Arthur a Grammar," "Sentences," "Saving the Sentence," "Sentences and
Paragraphs," "A Grammarian," and "Forensics."

<P>
"Arthur a Grammar" begins with the sentence, "Successions of words
are so agreeable," and immediately begins to test whether grammar is
something more than or other than succession: "Are allow discover
over cover an over coat. This is not a grammar." (<I>HW,</I> 43)
Obviously, the syntax of the sample sentences in this inquiry puts
Stein at risk of presupposing what she sets out to investigate--the
nature of grammar. Therefore, Stein parses grammar self-reflexively by
shifting among multiple articles and prepositional handles in a series
of questions, examples, and tentative assertions across the text. Her
method amounts to "auditioning" grammar in use (in Bruce Duffy's nice
description of Wittgenstein's practice).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>


<P>
There is a series of statements that combines indexical and appositive
operations in "of" constructions: "A grammar of appointment" (<I>HW,</I>
57); a series in which grammar predicates: "Consider grammar. Grammar
makes merry related" (<I>HW,</I> 76), "Grammar makes a mother" (<I>HW,</I>
75); a series of identity propositions about grammar: "Grammar is the
same as relative" (<I>HW,</I> 49), "Grammar is not grown" (<I>HW,</I>
58); and a series of statements formulated with the article "a": "What
is Arthur a grammar. Arthur is a grammar. Arthur a grammar." (<I>HW,</I>
63) Varying prepositional phrasing and articles amounts to declining
grammar's operations; that is, through repeated and multiple prepositional
handles, Stein parses "grammar" as a singular noun, a collective 
<B></B> 
noun, and as subject case through nominative, genitive, dative, accusative,
and vocative cases. In particular, the use of articles results in a
paradox in the way in which grammar emerges as a subject--"a grammar"
is representative, exemplary, singular, and, simultaneously, one of
many grammars. "Arthur a grammar" implies that there are others. And so
there are: "Winifred a grammar. . . . Louis. A grammar. . . . Louisa a
grammar. . . . Archie a grammar. Ernest William a grammar. . . . Alice
a grammar." (<I>HW,</I> 86-93) This list combines fictive proper
names with names for grammars (and suggests an imperative: "Bring me
a grammar!"), which effectively compounds the subject cases possible
for the word "grammar": subjective, objective, or possessive case. Thus
far, we can consider the composition as a succession <I>in</I> grammars,
a succession <I>of</I> grammars, a series of grammars named "Arthur"
("Every little Arthur"), and a series of "beginning again and again" to
ask the question, "What is grammar."

<P>
By shifting back and forth to treat grammar as subject (performative
agent) and as object, Stein opens up the composition to contradictory and
startling definitions of grammar. Once begun, her catalog of grammatical
operations and habits seems inexhaustible; the piece defines grammar as
resemblance, preparation, strategy, design, expansion, etiquette, and
addition. Definition by avalanche. "A grammar has been called a grammar of
diagram. This is not to be selfish." "A grammar has been called a list
of what is to be done with it." (<I>HW,</I> 56) "Grammar is occupied
allowances." (<I>HW,</I> 74) "Grammar is how are you." (<I>HW,</I> 95)

<P>
Stein next considers the semantic implications of the formal relations
grammar determines in the sentence. Since the principles of grammar
repeat, regardless of differences in terms, does this lead to error? Does
grammar flatten differences by treating individual words as markers to
fill "parts of speech" slots in preestablished sentence sequence?

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
With this question about resemblance, Stein shifts from definitions
of grammar to questions about its operations or uses. Does grammar
require preparation time? "Whenever words come before the mind there is
a mistake. This makes instant grammar." (<I>HW,</I> 66) What is grammar
for? Is it something other than "a vocabulary for thinking"? "The question
is if you have a vocabulary have you any need of grammar except for
explanation that is the question, communication and direction repetition
and intuition that is the question. Returned for grammar." (<I>HW,</I>
60) To explore the "need of grammar" Stein generates a series of
grammar's operations and properties, 
<B></B> 
then elaborates on the phonetic
associations these propositions engender. Grammar continues to be
linked to explanation: "Grammar makes a little boy explain that it was
by the time he could not remember." (<I>HW,</I> 65) Grammar has designs
on one's attention: "Grammar. It is very strange when the attention is
very definitely designed the dropping of scissors is noisy." (<I>HW,</I>
68) It creates a two-fold illusion of an interior--grammar puts sentence
components "in" order, and grammar itself is "in" the sentence: "There is
a difference between grammar and a sentence this is grammar in a sentence
I will agree to no map with which you may be dissatisfied and therefore
beg you to point out what you regard as incorrect in the positions
of the troops in my two sketches." (<I>HW,</I> 72) Grammar is useful:
"A grammar loads hay on to a wagon" (<I>HW,</I> 66). Grammar imposes
order, but it may miscarry: "Grammar may rain. It may thunder and it may
lighten and electricity may give out may be out of order." (<I>HW,</I>
100) So, nothing to fear: "Grammar is in our power." (<I>HW,</I> 73)

<P>
As we can see with the pun on "reign/rain," words used to denote
grammatical operations multiply their semantic resonance in a
verbal surface composed of associations, puns, homonyms, and graphic
look-alikes. The compositional charge of recurrent words with different
senses gives the inquiry a narrative feel without developing a plot. And
this method means that the analysis of grammar cannot be separated from
the affective suggestions woven into the propositional trials. We do
well to read as Marjorie Perloff advises, "<I>literally</I> as well
as <I>contextually,</I>" to catch the references to grammar (in often
hilariously literal phrasings) as well as the references that imply the
life lived is a context for grammar's uses.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 For instance,
Stein treats grammar literally as an operation that makes appointments
of order and place for parts of speech within the sentence: "A grammar of
appointment." (<I>HW,</I> 57) This leads to: "Grammar makes dates. Dates
are a fruit that may be pressed together or may be lain in a box
regularly still attached to a stem" (<I>HW,</I> 57). The word "dates"
leads to thought of documents that require dates such as wills --"will
well or need be time there when freight is dated articles might do"
(<I>HW,</I> 45)--and to time spent together: "Hour our last hour glass"
(<I>HW,</I> 49).

The Difference Between
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
I'd like to close by returning to the <I>form</I> of the question
"What is the difference between resemblance and grammar?" Throughout
"Arthur a Grammar," Stein describes grammar as it differs from other
discursive forms including succession, vocabulary, description, and
explanation. The sentence Lezra quotes must be understood as one in this
series of comparisons--in this instance a question about the relation
between grammar and narrative: "Narrative is it for one. Narrative
conceived and developed really only filling and so not connected with
for grammar." (<I>HW,</I> 70) But, as Stein affirms, "a grammar is in
need of little words" (<I>HW</I>, 73), so that to test the differences
between grammar and narrative or grammar and description means to try out
the effects of these discursive operations on sample words, phrases, and
sentences. For example, to explore the relation between vocabulary and
grammar 
<B></B> 
("if you have a vocabulary have you any need for grammar"), Stein
writes sequences in which the "vocabulary" remains the same and grammar
stands out as the difference: "Consider a house. . . . Consider. Hours
in a house. A house held ours." (<I>HW,</I> 61) With different grammars,
can these sentences be said to have the same vocabulary? Do they express
the same sense? Grammatical structure may be identical although the
meaning of sentences differ, or grammar may be different when meanings
are congruent: "Critically. Good flour can make good bread is not the
same as good flour does make good bread." (<I>HW,</I> 90) For Stein, as
for Wittgenstein, the difference Frege identified between declarative and
assertoric sentences is not a distinction that determines meaning. What
difference does? I want to propose that one of the intriguing findings
in "Arthur a Grammar" is that grammar can't be defined, finally, by a
definition posed in the form of differentiation--"what is the difference
between." I'll say more, but let me first review the expectations of
explanation that we need to set aside.

<P>
With the language games that open <I>Philosophical Investigations,</I>
Wittgenstein discredits the Augustinian picture theory of
language acquisition and use--that words name objects, and that by
"hear[ing] words repeatedly used in their proper places in various
sentences, [one] gradually learn[s] to understand what objects they
signif[y]."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 This concept of referentiality may lead us to
expect explanations of meaning that take the form "The word 'grammar'
signifies . . ." Or, we may be tempted by the form "'Grammar' is the
name of a . . ." These models of explanation come about for two reasons
according to Wittgenstein: an illusion of uniformity of function, or, more
subtly, from noticing the <I>differences</I> of function between words,
that is, noticing the analogy in the lack of analogy. Either way, through
uniformity or difference of function, we've imposed uniformity on diverse
types of expression and obscured the actual practice of our language use.

<P>
Likewise, in "Arthur a Grammar," the difference between grammar and other
discursive forms won't tell us what grammar <I>is</I> because, in both
sample sentences and in the series of propositions that cross the text,
the uses of grammar depend on the play of difference and similarity in
the construction of meaning. In each particular instance, grammar can be
regarded as an imposition of structural resemblance, or as the medium that
makes possible the recognition of difference-in-sameness. Since the text
employs the word "grammar" as both subject and object, it effectively
flattens the operations of second-order propositions; although we are
continuously challenged to consider the difference between discursive
forms <I>X</I> and <I>Y,</I> we realize that for each phrase we must sort
<I>likeness</I> and <I>difference</I> between literal and rative uses
of words. "Be very careful of having had a little longer in obliging
whichever it was for. Forbidden." (<I>HW,</I> 66) "Forbidden" gets its
effect by forcing us to notice that it is comprised of permissory words
--"for" and "bidden"--yet, taken together, the meaning is prohibitory. But
the word has compositional punch because of the shift in grammatical
forms of "for" from the line <I>before</I> this.

<P>
Like Wittgenstein's philosophical method, Stein's treatise on grammar does
not provide stable definitions but instead, enacts an alternate model
of explanation, written 
<B></B> 
according to Stein's principles of elucidation:
 that you do not know in advance the answer to what you set out
to explain;  that you put down each time what you know (which may
require beginning again);  that you include everything;  that what
you know is not a restatement of prior learning; and  that what you
want to know in composition is inseparable from how you live your life.

<P>
Although the pleasure of reading the text can't be paraphrased,
"Arthur a Grammar" is a primer of grammar in which the repetition of
naming functions and the cumulative effect of repeatedly asking "What is
grammar" block the initial expectations writer and reader might bring to
bear on grammar--that it orders, that it points indexically. Instead,
"grammar" is its use in the text; it cannot be defined in second-order
statements that displace individual statements of the text. As Stein
puts it, "Grammar is restless and earned" (<I>HW,</I> 60). "Arthur a
Grammar" is a text that traces an emotional trajectory from resistance to
grammar to gratitude for its usefulness. It was written during a time of
"coming to terms" for Stein, a review of her work and personal history,
and is imbued throughout with repetition of the word "will" and has as
a result a future-looking cast, as though making a will and making a
grammar were preparations. Or, in Stein's words: "Living by reason by
years or by now might make grammars" (<I>HW,</I> 86).

 the shifting uses of the words "some" and "one" in Stein's 1912 portrait

 [more] comprehensive gravitational field, which can be observed only in
 the forces created as sentences engage one another" (Charles Altieri,

There are, of course, other tactics for treating the impingements
 of the autobiographical self on the writing. One can read biographical
 details, as Ulla Dydo does, as "centripetal" and "centrifugal" references
 to both the lived life and to word use in the composition ("<I>Landscape
 is Not Grammar,</I>" 102). Dydo notes that Stein and Toklas made their
 wills in 1927-28, and therefore traces recurrences of the word
 "will" in "Arthur a Grammar." Or, even stickier, one can speculate about
 the influence in style and word choices that rereading earlier work
 for publication had on Stein's current work. While writing pieces of
 <I>How to Write</I> in 1927 and early 1928, Stein also corrected proofs
 for the collection <I>Useful Knowledge,</I> and prepared a manuscript

Perloff likens Stein's compositional method to Wittgenstein's

An organization of forms expresses a confluence of forces. . . . For
example, if you clap a strong magnet beneath a plateful of iron filings,
the energies in the magnet will proceed to organize form. It is only
by applying a particular and subtle force that you can bring order
and vitality and thence beauty into a plate of iron filings, which are

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Recently I attended an extraordinary conference, "From Energy to
Information," at the University of Texas at Austin. Scholars there
did superb ground-breaking work showing how deeply modernist art was
engaged in the issues and the themes developed by the sciences. But
the very power of these presentations made me sufficiently anxious to
want to address the dangers involved in this historical enterprise. On
the most fundamental level, establishing scientific contexts for the
arts raises the problem of just how we state the relationship between

<B></B>

what seems to be the artist'ss intention and what we can say
about the frameworks within which that intention is articulated? And
that question requires our clearly addressing two closely related but
importantly distinct issues: how such contexutalizing will change our
interpretations of these writers and artists as historical agents, and
how such a stance will modify our own perspectives as we try to evaluate
what claims their work has on our present?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My fear on the first issue is that, simply because we can find
analogies or because the artists and writers make vague claims about
matters like the fourth dimension, we will go on to use our knowledge
of the science to force strong thematic analogies on to the work. If
we rely too directly on these invocations of science, we run the risk
of underplaying the considerable uneasiness most of the modernists had
about such dependencies. Were they fully to embrace science, they might
have to accept both the impersonal subject positions cultivated by the
sciences and the ideals of impersonal verification fundamental to their
sense of community. But such commitments were not easy to correlate
with the seductive appeal of the alienation-postures still underlying
much modernist work or with the emphases on feeling and on constructive
will that the artists and writers hoped might counter or dignify that
alienation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However liberating science's version of impersonal dehumanization might
prove, artists almost always had to restore some aspects of the romantic
values they were ostensively denying, as in Eliot's claim that only
those who knew what it meant to suffer from personality would appreciate
the impersonality he was calling for. And however exalting science's
models of universalizing abstraction and its promise of progress, the
arts had to restore the rative and exemplifying power of individual
compositions as their instruments for realizing how nature's deep laws
took effect.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 So on the most general level I think we have
to find a perspective for dealing with responses to science that float
warily between two quite different positive appeals--the opportunity
for specific thematic allegories drawn from ideas like "the fourth
dimension" and the promise of an experimental method that would replace
allegorizing entirely by giving access to realities that are immediately
present in their abstract elemental force and hence do not depend at
all on speculative interpretation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One way the modernists handled their ambivalence in relation to such
appeals was to explore possible allegiances with with more mystical
versions of science, versions that Bruce Clarke shows were dangerously
close to a scientism in which experimental method yields to allegorical
procedures.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Therefore it is reasonable to examine just how
deeply into their work such explorations went. But these invitations also
bring with them a double problem. Not only do we have to be careful to
connect the interest in science to the modernists' other basic concerns
(especially with formal innovation), but we also have to worry about
whether pursuing the scientific analogies will help us capture what
to other artists and writers has seemed the most imaginatively vital
features of their work. If we are not careful on this matter, the effort
to contextualize the art within the parameters of modern science will
end up reducing modernism to charming mystification. We will stress
what was the least intensely invested and is the least intellectually
challenging dimension of the art, in the

<B></B>

process losing both what
seemed most innovative at the time and what has the richest possibility
for engaging contemporary imaginations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to avoid these problems, even while learning from the efforts
creating them, I will explore a way of acknowledging what the artists
sought in their forays into science without forcing the art within the
straitjacket imposed by the specific, historically dated scientific
doctrines the modernists invoked. And I hope to develop a more general
theoretical account of how the effort to find thematic analogies deeply
misconceives the overall ambitions driving the artists' versions of formal
experiment. By turning from the specific details of modern science to
what seems the basic desire underlying the artists' use of such details,
I hope we can keep foregrounded those aspects of their art that do not
go gently into the dump that history keeps in wait for them. My model
for specifying the terms of this desire will be Hegel's work on the
concept of force. Using this model will not entail claiming that the
modernists read Hegel, although Hegelian ideas are basic to some of the
spiritualisms that fascinated them. Nor will I claim that the artists and
writers had a coherent and articulate concept of force. I will use the
concept of "force" to characterize how a substantial body of modernist
art makes compelling and still vital imaginative structures out of their
interests in quasi-spiritual claims about latent dynamism that we find
in thinkers ranging from Bergson to Eddington. A short catalogue would
point to Mondrian on "dymamic equilibrium," Malevich on the fourth and
fifth dimensions as aspects of non-objective force, and the literary
metaphors developed to adapt to the plastic tensions made popular by
Cubism. All of these emphases share with the sciences a commitment to
the most elemental dynamic building blocks of contemporary life, but they
also insist on representing that dynamic dimension in ways more directly
connected to the life of the mind than all but the most mystical and
problematic of the prevailing scientific perspectives allowed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hence Hegel. Hegel on force enables us to address both problems I have
been discussing--what modernists seek to make articulate and how we can
best develop value languages for that work. The concept of force helps us
get close to the artists' intentions because it keeps attention focussed
on dynamic physical dimensions of affective life and because it demands
a notion of the psyche in deep sympathetic vibration with the modernists'
intense suspicions of humanist ideals. It is not a large leap from Hegel
on force to the following sentiment by Nietzsche:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It is not all necessary to get rid of the "soul" . . . and thus to
renounce of the most ancient and venerable hypotheses--as happens
frequently to clumsy naturalists who can hardly touch on the "soul"
without immediately losing it. But the way is open for new versions and
refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions as "mortal soul"
and "soul as subjective multiplicity," and "soul as social structure
of the drives and affects," want henceforth to have citizen's rights
in science.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even more important, relying on Hegel on force provides an overall
methodological contrast to work straightforwardly elaborating analogues
between modernist art

<B></B>

and modern science. Rather than fit the art
to science's explanatory schemas, we can explore the ways in which the
concern for the dynamic actually modifies how works are constructed and
relations to audiences envisioned. We cannot deal with force simply as
an idea. We have to see how it is embodied, or how it affects ideals
of embodiment. And that means treating the arts in roughly the same
phenomenological fashion that Hegel demonstrates is necessary to talk
about force at all in so far as force is engaged as an actual dimension
of our experience. So critical work in this spirit has to shift its
focus away from which ideas link the arts with science and toward
the distinctive uses which the art works make of science in their
specific modes of unfolding before audiences. Finally this connection
to phenomenology will enable us to clarify how treating the works as
appearances establishes an imaginative realm within which the artists'
work can retain currency long after the specific sciences they allude
to are at best remote footnotes in textbooks.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hegel's basic treatment of "force" takes place early in his
<I>Phenomenology of Spirit</I> as his means of establishing the
inadequacy of any pure perception-based empiricism; then later in
the <I>Phenomenology</I> he uses the same basic logic to criticize
Enlightenment science's version of covering laws. But in order to show
how his account will matter for us, I want first to set up an example
that I will then keep central in my exposition. The example is Kasimir
Malevich's <I>Red Square Black Square</I>--in part because the painting
so dramatically sets something like force against something like the
conditions of extensional empiricist description, and in part because we
will have a strong example of how artists like Malevich melded idealist
thinking into the quasi-scientific vocabulary that abstract painting
was eager to appropriate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In my <I>Painterly Abstraction</I> I make three basic points about
Malevich's painting that bear repeating here.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 First, it calls
attention to the dialectic established by the painting's structure. The
tilt of the smaller red square refuses subordination to the spatial
frameworks imposed by the black square and by the frame. That negation
then becomes a demand that the viewer bring to bear a second system of
coordinates in which the tilt itself determines alignments within the
painting. Attending to these coordinates then turns the surrounding white
space into an active field helping to constitute an intricate balancing
of both organizational principles in relation to now dynamic color,
texture, and size contrasts. What could have been simple flat surfaces
echoing each other becomes instead a dynamic field reconciling potential
motion in several dimensions with an overall compositional harmony.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My other two points involve the thematic possibilities that these visual
relations elicit. For example it is difficult not to treat Malevich's
tilt as also a means of foregrounding the intricate ontology that his
abstraction affords. On one level the world of sensation is reduced
entirely to purely extensional flat colored surfaces. There is no illusion
at all, except perhaps for the hints of depth set up by the relation
of the

<B></B>

two squares. Yet this reduction to pure visual matter also
seems to sustain a powerful transcendental movement. It may be precisely
as pure extensional surface without illusion that the painting produces
the dynamic intensive balances that I will elaborate as a thematics of
the tilt. Here abstraction literally marries the possibility of meaning
to pure sensation and hence opens a realm of metaphoric possibilities
based not on what the painting represents but on what its elements do.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My third claim offers specific ways to read those metaphoric
possibilities. Minimally, Malevich is playing on the relation of art to
life and mind to matter. This painting is so elemental that it could not
be a found object; only mind could make it with such delicate balances
of shape and color. These flat shapes are and are not simply objects,
since within the painting, within the frames provided by art conventions,
the shapes work as relationships and the relationships open metaphoric
implications that do not displace but pervade the material elements. It
seems as if intelligence literally inhabited these otherwise purely visual
elements. In fact the material tilt here becomes a powerful emblem for the
relation of art to life and of art to the representational traditions
underlying this play of intelligence. In coming alive as a work of
art, this conration literally enacts a tilt, both acknowledging
and providing alternatives to the coordinates established by purely
extensional seeing. Malevich's painting invites us to participate in a
metaphorical dwelling within what it has reduced to purely extensional
marks, so that painterly intelligence becomes simply the possibility of
maintaining just such an imaginative space, reducing representation to
marks in order to free intelligence from the confines of description
and dramatic interpretation. Finally, because that intelligence makes
its own place, the painting ultimately offers itself as a self-reflexive
embodiment of all those features of our lives where the only difference
between pure extensional matter and what we have called spirit is a simple
tilt producing an irreducibly "non-objective" dynamics. What else makes my
body and world into a subject's? And what else can define an ontology for
the mysteries of loving and caring that seem very difficult to account
for within standard Enlightenment principles. Tilting is a purposive
but not rationalized model for how we inhabit extensional objects.

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It should be easy now to see why it was so tempting for my <I>Painterly
Abstraction</I> to treat the self-reflexive participation that such
paintings invite in terms of thematics of agency. I thought this could
capture the dynamic features of Malevich's ontology, but now that I have
read Hegel I have a measure of how my own metaphoric register was severely
limited by its anthropomorphic investments. Hegel's chapter on force in
his <I>Phenomenology of Spirit</I> allows us to stay at a threshold where
the human remains intricately caught up in what cannot be humanized. He
accomplishes this by locating the non-objective in a very elemental
but irreducible supplement to those extensional features that can be
adequately handled by empirical description.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<B></B>

Hegel's
preceding chapter had been devoted to the certainties of sense, and
hence provided a picture of what his extensional knowledge could be. He
turns to force in order to establish dialectical transitions between the
world of pure perception and one in which awareness of the world proves
inseparable from the intricacies of self-consciousness. Once that link is
established the rest of the <I>Phenomenology</I> can go on to elaborate
"what consciousness knows in knowing itself" (<I>PS,</I> 103). But
Hegel's chapter on force does not quite yield to this faith in ultimate
absolute knowledge. Instead Hegel focusses not on how consciousness knows
itself but on how consciousness is solicited into attempting to situate
itself within the world of appearances that its own activity renders
incomplete and problematic. So on this level of Hegel's story there
need be no talk of absolutes or even of the dialectical interplay of
substance and spirit. Here Hegel offers only an account of those demands
and embarrassments that both torment and fascinate consciousness as it
seeks to articulate its fundamental relations to the sensual world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Let me then take a few moments to trace the basic movements in Hegel's
discussion of force so that the case can create intellectual resonances
for Malevich's painting, while the painting provides a concrete
image grounding the philosophy's abstract arguments.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 For
Hegel, our most elemental experience of force is as something whose
effects are visible in or upon the objects of perception but which
cannot be the simple object of our attention, since we cannot refer
to the force within the same pictorial model we use to refer to the
objects. As examples one might think of electricity or gravity or, more
metaphorically, of desires and emotions. We can characterize force and
even regulate it, but we cannot represent it as force except through
abstract formulae. Therefore any description that wants to preserve the
qualities that lead us to speak about force, without reducing these
to static pictures, will have to vacillate between phenomenological
and explanatory perspectives. Because force both invites and repels
description, Hegel can use it as his means of shifting from the static
unities that consciousness establishes to the constant differing from
itself which is characteristic of self-consciousness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hegel begins his account of force by claiming that it becomes manifest
as active resistance to the plenitude of universals put in place by
perception. Perception depends on universals because it has to work
within established categories, has to see something as only a positive
identity (<I>PS,</I> 80). We perceive a light bulb as on or off. But
suppose we begin to ask what produces that difference (or ask what
makes us ask about that difference). We cannot answer such questions
simply by observing. They move us from a world of objects perceived
to one where perceptions are only appearances, only phenomena whose
shape and effects depend on something that cannot be located entirely
in the object. Awareness of force, then, makes it impossible simply to
treat the object as an isolated, self-sufficient particular. Force acts
upon the object, rendering it passive in relation to the being of some
other reality. And in so doing it also opens the possibility that this
object has kinship with other apparently independent objects. Once we
grasp electricity as a force, even without understanding how

<B></B>

that
force works, we see that all light bulbs seem to work in the same way
by responding to some general feature we now have to add to our sense
of what counts as real.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hegel insists on providing an ontology for these relational
properties. Thus force is characterized as gathering "otherness itself,
into itself" because it literally gets its identity as the substance of
its differences from the universalizing thought perception relies on. Most
philosophers would avoid the expression "otherness itself, into itself,"
because that gives a positive existence to what Hegel's account presents
primarily as negative. But Hegel takes that risk because he wants to
develop parallels between the force that we observe and the forces that
are involved in our observing. If we try to understand what underlies
the coming on and off of light bulbs at various moments, we have to see
ourselves both negating and sublating any model of thinking bound only to
the particular object. We have to hypothesize some supplemental factors,
within and without. Yet our new account still has to preserve our direct
awareness of the specific light bulb. Similarly, we find our relations
to ourselves closely paralleling the relation we posit between object and
force: we are driven by something we cannot picture, yet it is awareness
of our subjection to that "something" which ultimately allows us to bring
into one framework the differences our activity generates. We, in effect,
are aspects of the turned on lights that have to recognize how through
our observing we differ from the simple states from which we began.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Once the psyche enters, Hegel's account gets even more interesting,
since there are at least three concrete ways in which the distinctions he
generates to handle questions about force in the object world also clarify
principles we need for talking about the psyche. First, once consciousness
concerns itself with force, what had been objects that simply constitute a
world become appearances beneath which some other factors are responsible
for the manifest effects. Second, when appearances can no longer be
treated adequately by the languages we apply to objects, there emerge
questions about expression. What do the appearances make visible that is
not suited to purely descriptive languages, and what then is the specific
relation between the being that appears and these underlying factors now
also part of the scene for consciousness? And third, trying to understand
that relation between appearance and what underlies it creates often
unresolveable concerns about which aspects of the expression are active,
that is controlled by the mode of appearing, and which aspects show how
the being is acted upon by some ancillary conditions. Active forces reveal
the being for itself, eagerly "soliciting" what might complete it, while
what seems passive requires our asking how one enters the role of being
"solicited" as a being for another whose controlling presence we then
have to speculate upon.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 For example, if our light bulb were
to dim, we might have to explain that dimming as caused by the specific
condition of the light bulb, or its part in the home's specific electrical
structures, or a symptom of some system-wide failure. Human dimming and
brightening allows richer possibilities for talk of activity, but also
requires more complex stories suspicion about the actual impact of the
soliciting forces exercising their influence from without.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At this point in Hegel's exposition the interplay of active and passive
becomes far too complex for me to track. But although we probably
already have enough background to understand what Malevich is making of
his nineteenth-century sources, I want to provide at least some of the
flavor of that dialectic. If the light here dims too much, please just
skip the next three paragraphs.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We have just seen that what seems active as force in relation to an object
can also seem passive as an effect of some more comprehensive system. But,
Hegel insists, there cannot be any simple one way relation between what
he calls the comprehended and the comprehensive aspects of force. For
we have to posit a force working through objects and a force working
through mind, and we have to see that while mind organizes physical
relations, it is these relations that both solicit and influence how the
mind develops those organizations. In Hegel's terms, the notion of force
"becomes actual through its duplication into two forces" (<I>PS,</I>
85)--one the grounding element and the other the manifest medium of the
effect of that ground. Both phsyical and mental activities function as
ground and as medium.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We can see the mind determined by the body or the mind giving purpose
to what otherwise might give purpose to it. This duplicity then creates
for each locus of activity the danger that it will seem to lose its
particularity as force because its activity vanishes into the concepts
we use to fix it or into the objects we use to trace its diminishment
(such as spirit becoming only body). At the opposite pole each locus has
the corresponding possibility of actively standing over against concepts
or objects by managing to define its own expressive capacities. We
can lose the phenomenology of electricity to purely general analyses
or to specific accounts of what happens in particular objects; and we
can lose the phenomenology of self-consciousness to the satisfactions
of dwelling simply within the generalizations that are developed to
explain how electricity works. Conversely there remains the capacity
for expression to break through repression--either in sudden glimpses
of why we are fascinated by electricity or why we are fascinated by our
own processes of thinking on the topic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hegel's chapter's richest concrete speculations on this interplay of
active and passive, phenomenological and structural, take place when
he turns to discussing how attention to force leads necessarily to
the positing of laws. Laws offer a mode of universalization quite
different from those of perception, since a law is not simply a
category for particular objects but a way of giving objectivity to
relations among objects. Law is "the stable image of unstable appearance"
(<I>PS,</I> 90). By postulating laws we produce sameness out of the play
of difference. Even when the eye sees only differences, the mind can
register underlying identities because of how the differences participate
in the same structural necessities. Law, then, regularizes flux into
deeper structures, and it creates the possibility that knowledge itself
extends beyond appearances.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Law makes force one thing rather than many. But this unity is at best an
incomplete one, because the concept of law is not sufficiently attuned
to the variety that it organizes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 So the very unity law
brings opens the way to further division. Spirit finds itself having
to account not only for how law relates to its objects but also how it
both

<B></B>

creates and is created by subjects. Law seems the within of
appearances, but its distance from what it claims to regularize also
makes it an appearance through which we seek some other within. That
within turns out to be another manifestation of force, since whatever
seems to underly our attributions of lawfulness has the same dynamic
and ungraspable relation to universals that force does in its simpler
manifestations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now Hegel is ready to show what will be involved in consciousness
becoming conscious of itself. There is one law that seems as if it can
actually capture necessity because it makes the Kantian shift from
what underlies objects to what underlies our experience of making
sense of those objects. This law takes form as a generalizing of the
very process of self-consciousness that is emerging--namely, "that
<I>like</I> becomes <I>unlike</I> and <I>unlike</I> becomes <I>like"</I>
(<I>PS,</I> 96). Whatever consciousness grasps it inverts, turning force
into concept and law and casting those universals back into the play of
forces that constantly solicit them. Such self-consciousness can have
certainty of itself because of its capacity to provide form for force,
and, through that, to feel its powers to make attributions about a
"supersensible." Yet this "supersensible" need not be trapped in the
same static world as Kant's transcendental reasoning because whatever
force consciousness feels must remain tightly wound into the structure
of appearance. Any other version of force called up by consciousness
will soon be revealed as empty, or merely mystical because it will not
be situated within what actually solicits consciousness. Reflecting
on the relation between force and self-consciousness then leads us to
realize that the supersensible is entirely immanent--not the other of
appearance but an other within appearance that allows us to formulate
the concept of "appearance qua appearance" (<I>PS,</I> 89). Rather than
dwelling beneath appearances, the supersensible consists in the mind's
simultaneous sense of its bondage to appearance and its freedom to bring
our values and causes within a world that now on one level exists for
consciousness, hence <I>as</I> appearance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hegels <I>qua</I>, in other words, is inseparable from Malevich's
tilt. Consciousness feels itself as the point of transfer between
appearance and appearance seen as appearance, and hence as involving
complex relational dependencies on what makes appearance different
from perception. And self-consciousness emerges as the awareness of
the interplay of negative and reconstructive powers that enables us
to appreciate those relational dependencies and treat them as complex
balances. In one dimension the tilt is a simple occurence, almost a
whimsical variation manifesting the simple force of change. But in the
very process of registering that effect, the painting also establishes
a supremely confident moment of self-consciousness both defining
its capacity to engage new coordinates and coming to appreciate the
overall relational structure that this gesture creates. Solicited by the
shift from object to appearance, self-consciousness can explore its own
soliciting powers, until they become their own opposite, mainfesting the
painting's sense of being solicited by something that seems more capacious
and structural within appearance than individual self-consciousness. What
emerges as agency now is inseparable from a mediating process that such
consciousness can no longer pretend to control, even though it cannot
stop trying.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Providing an intellectual context for reading one Malevich painting
does not a theory make. But it does offer one example of how we can
interpret modernist work so as to acknowledge its interest in the spirit
of science without turning it into a thematic analogue for specific
scientific doctrines. Malevich uses a scientific atmosphere as a frame
for an experience whose specific unfolding requires a quite different
vocabulary and a quite different interpretive stance. I have tried to
clarify the vocabulary; now I will turn to developing a few theoretical
consequences that follow from emphasizing those dynamic aspects of
the art works foregrounded by the concept of force. First, though, a
brief caveat. Shifting to theory here will demand walking a delicate
line between claiming that the concept of force can make a substantial
difference in our discourses about the arts in general and isolating
values distinctive to modernist experiments in the arts. But there is
a reward for facing this problem, since this balancing act is one we
will share with the modernists. They felt the need both to break from
their heritage and to use that break as a means of revitalizing their
heritage in the arts (or, as Hegel would have put it, to extend their
heritage by negating it in ways that make articulate latent forces that
in fact keep the heritage unified).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Let me, then, keep modernist abstract painting as my specific focus,
but I will concentrate on issues sufficiently theoretical to suggest
an overall perspective quite different from both classical and Kantian
aesthetics and quite resistant to the thematizing of analogies, scientific
or moral or social. Using the lens of what Hegel on force dramatizes
in modernist abstraction, I hope to clarify how we locate expressivity
in art, how art works can engage emotions in ways that complicate
standard notions of subject-object relations, and, finally, how we
understand the role of theory in these inquiries. But I cannot do this
without presupposing my conclusions on the last of these topics. I will
proceed under the assumption that one need not treat theory in the arts as
high-level explanation but can instead approach it as oriented towards the
phenomenological thickening of appearance so that we ultimately find the
<I>qua</I> of appearance charged with intellectual resonance. Rather than
place particulars within categories, this perspective uses generalization
to suffuse those particulars with meanings that give self-consciousness
both peace and substance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My first claim is my most general, potentially least contentious, and
probably most important. Hegel on force makes clear why any work of art,
perhaps any particular we come to value, cannot be treated entirely in
descriptive or pictorial terms. One must capture the tension between force
and objects of perception, and consequently one must preserve the dynamic
relation between appearance and some constitutive other to the object
that emerges when it becomes seen as appearance. To do that theory has to
introduce concerns for expressiveness, concerns which require attending
to relations among what is hidden and what manifest, to the play of
soliciting and solicited features, to the work of postulating universals
or laws and the recognition of their limitations, and to the intricate
ways that these various aspects fold into and out of one another.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such concerns are basic to any theory of expressiveness. Hegel on force
makes possible a distinctive theory because he deals with such elemental
features of expressivity that we need not rely on specific psychological
hypotheses. Perhaps more important, this focus on elements links Hegel
to Levinasian concerns for an otherness fundamental to eliciting human
responses (without requiring Levinasian conclusions). Expressivity is not
simply a matter of how agency is deployed or emotions made manifest:
expressivity remains a relational structure between something not
stateable and necessarily incomplete efforts to frame what appearance
manifests.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The best way to bring out the value of basing the analysis of expressivity
on Hegel's treatment of force is to develop a contrast with the far more
influential Kantian analysis of the immanence basic to the appearance
(<I>Schein</I>) constituting aesthetic objects. For Kant art works matter
because they are radically particular and yet give pleasure in a mode
that can be called judgment because the pleasure appeals for universal
assent. That radical particularity stems from "purposiveness without
purpose," that is from marks of a shaping intelligence that cannot be
successfully subsumed under any concepts, and hence that manifest a
genius giving the rule to art. From Kant on, then, positive accounts
of immanence in art works have emphasized the work that psychological
or formal or interpretive intelligences do in giving shape to inchoate
worlds. Such assumptions have bound theory to a fairly narrow range of
evaluative principles like those stressing complexity or intricate unity,
in part because the stress on formative intelligence makes it extremely
difficult to talk directly about emotions or about how audiences are
positioned and acted upon. Analogously, the Kantian line of argument
entails treating all struggle that matters in a great work as part of
the author's plan, rather than resistances from the material or from
contradictions the author refuses to face.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There have been strong objections to this aspect of Kant, of course, but
for the most part they derive from psychoanalytic criticism (that has
trouble dealing with art as art) or from a rhetoric of common sense or
from oppositional claims to expose the underlying contradictions. And
all of these critiques continue to rely on the binaries Kant set
up. Those binaries in turn make it difficult for theory to account for
the emotional component of aesthetic experience because they force us
to treat everything we cannot locate as specifiable formal properties
within the object as necessarily elements attributable to entirely
private subjective response. Similarly, when Kant's stress on authorial
intelligence is challenged, it is done by reducing art works to semiotic
weavings that critics fit into various allegories subordinating internal
energies within the work to the critic's theoretical schema.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Concentrating on Hegel on force allows us a very different view of
expressivity and the structure of emotions that expressivity elicits. From
a Hegelian perspective, specific works can be seen as embodying an
interplay between force and appearance that does not reduce force to
intelligence, nature to either heteronomy or lawfulness, or response
to already constituted empirical subjects. Instead expressiveness gets
located in the processes that emerge as forces working within and
against appearance. These processes retain their concreteness while
taking on a suggestiveness that

<B></B>

seems generalizable yet resistant
to concepts. Such concreteness obviously can produce a wide variety of
effects. But two effects seem to me especially worthy of notice because
they have substantial implications for how we value the arts. Noam
Gabo neatly summarized the first when he characterized the "absolute
shapes" of abstract art as manifesting "all the properties of a real
force having a positive and a negative direction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Kantian
aesthetics treats the object only as a positive structure, generating
aesthetic value primarily by internal relations. Gabo's modernism, on
the other hand, emphasizes the reality of the object as object so that
we will attend not only what it asserts but to how that assertion is
positioned in relation to what it rejects or sublates. Unlike concepts
of form, those of force treat objects as embodying transitions between
states, and hence as exemplifying actual struggle. Expression is also
resistance; construction also vital negation working to justify negative
processes like the act of abstraction itself.

Heidegger then adds a second aspect to this sense of how art works
are active within the world. His entire aesthetic is based on Hegel's
ideal of having appearance emerge <I>qua appearance</I>. Art works can
have compelling immanence because "the work opens up a <I>world</I> and
keeps it abidingly in force."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 In so far as the art manifests
its powers as work, it establishes a "world," a "forever non-objective"
concrete situation in which things "gain their lingering and hastening,
their remoteness and nearness, their scope and their limits." "A work
by being a work makes space for that spaciousness" by which "the world
worlds" (<I>PS,</I> 45). What remains in excess of appearance does
not become law but instead becomes a condition of activity inseparable
from what the work makes manifest. Consequently it cannot suffice to
"interpret" works of art. Interpretation must be kept in continual
tension with an awareness of how the work maintains its "appearance,"
engaging through that an interplay of soliciting and solicited forces
that refuse to settle into any one determinate entity for the imagination.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In an essay related to the present one, I try to build from this analysis
a specific theory of expressivity in the arts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 But here I
can only posit as my second basic claim a brief case that this approach
to expressivity emphasizes both the affective life within the work and
the possibility of our recasting the psychology by which we characterize
that life. Let me use Pound's vorticist poem "Heather" as my example:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
The black panther treads at my side,
<BR>
And above my fingers
<BR>
There float the petal-like flames
<BR>
The milk-white girls
<BR>
Unbend from the holly-trees,
<BR>
And their snow white leopard
<BR>
Watches to follow our trace.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
First, if we concentrate on how art objects intensify Hegelian versions
of force, we can see as part of their power their capacity to keep
us fascinated by what remains an "other" to discursive intelligence,
an "other" keeping intelligence dialectically

<B></B>

aware of its own
limitations and its own imperatives. Ultimately Malevich's painting
remains an arrangement of shapes and colors that enter into relations
evoking thought and even exemplifying certain powers of mind, yet these
relations lose their vitality if they lose their concreteness or prove
mere instances of some general law or perspective. And in Pound's
poem almost all the effect depends on its keeping the ground of the
contrast between the black panther and the white leopard just beyond
the intellect, so that the sexual trace claimed by the end of the poem
extends into strange necessities that in turn suggest entrance into
disturbing psychological sites.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This otherness then has at least two important consequences. Minimally,
such art does not allow self-sufficiency to any knowledge
position satisfied by description and by subsuming particulars under
generalizations. Responsiveness to art is also recognition that these
knowledge positions must also be seen as themselves positioned by
factors that cannot be entirely transparent to consciousness. On that
basis, I think, we can then add the stronger claim that even within the
processes of establishing knowledge claims we find an active negative, a
non-objectivity that is not simply an <I>aporia</I> but an immediacy and
silence which point beyond our practical sense of ourselves as agents. We
experience intentionality as situated at a margin of sense where it
is composed as much as it composes, and hence where we appreciate the
imperative within art to break human images down into elemental factors
not quite intelligible within the selves we compose for direct action. In
this regard abstraction is the progenitor of Picasso's monster-artists
and Surrealism's reconrations of agency in terms of body-parts.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My second claim about affect simply extends this sense of irreducible
otherness to the domain of emotions evoked and constructed within the
work of art. It is a commonplace to say that modernist emotions resist
narrative organization, but we rarely get good accounts of why the quest
for alternatives to narrative seemed so pressing a goal. If we focus on
how force is established as resistance to appearance, we can explain the
rejection of narrative as a refusal to treat powerful emotions as if they
were something we could understand simply by placing them in developmental
contexts. Emotions must be allowed their strangeness, their capacity to
make demands on the intellect that the intellect cannot satisfy. And,
more important, an adequate artistic rendering of the force of emotions
must evoke different dimensions of self-consciousness than those that
narrative calls upon. When we are confronted with emotional demands that
do not easily contextualize, we are invited to appreciate the degree
to which the life of the passions is not congruent with the grammars
that arrange experience in terms of intellectual categories, especially
categories based on sharp boundaries and on clear distinctions between
active and passive or subject and object. Such force restores instead
the complex grammar of "feel," with its intricate interrelations of
active and passive elements.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Think again of Pound's trace or of Malevich's dynamic tilt. In one sense
the feelings elicited are aspects of hyper-conscious attention to how
particular elements are related. Yet this very intensity of consciousness
is not easily attributed entirely to active agency--for either artist
or audience--because of the degree to which we find

<B></B>

ourselves
literally "moved" by what partially comes to determine how our individual
investments in the world get deployed. The force in art works sets up an
intricate flow of traces and possible sources positioning the psyche as
simultaneously deep in its absorption and transparent in its openness and
manipulability. Even that understanding we do manage for representing
how we are moved seems very close to an illusion or evasion that we
create, as if we arrived at what we could contain in our representation
because of forces impelling us to just this form of containment. The
tear in appearances penetrates the psyche, so that emotion too has its
fullness only by taking form within the work as emotion qua emotion. And
that makes it dizzyingly difficult to say just who is it who responds to
and as the locus of those emotions. Is it really my empirical ego that
responds to the tilt or that feels itself deployed in the expression
"our trace" that ends Pound's poem?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, we arrive at my third and last general claim. This aesthetics
of force changes our model for what is at stake in how art crosses other
domains of life, and hence for the preferred roles interpretive theory
can play. Here I ask you to recall the central passage of Pound's Canto
II.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 There Pound stages as "a breathing out of nothing" a
theophany that embodies a pagan incarnation--not the word become flesh
but the world become metamorphosed into the presence of the god. Then he
turns to the effect this incarnation has on the one witness not caught
up in violent blindness toward that god. All that character says is "I
worship,/ I have seen what I have seen." Yet that is all he need say:
what matters is not how he interprets the event but how his openness to
the event modifies him. Force is not something added to details; rather
it is the sense of demand built into the details, so that the effect is
not something we reason to but something that provides a basis for the
giving of reasons. Force is the dimension of experience where all the
ladders start.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Correspondingly, theory seems most useful not for telling us what the
witness should have seen but for fleshing out terms for what might
be seen and how that seeing might have direct effects on further
interpretations. Historically, such experiences require a Nietzschean
hermeneutics and provide one measure for the importance of Nietzschean
psychology, especially in relation to the issue of how modernism's
relation to science might be interpreted. Using Pound as my example,
I suggest that modernism in the arts gives considerable urgency to at
least the negative side of Nietzsche's powerful contrast between the will
to truth and the will to power. And in so doing such work makes clear
what we lose if we ally the arts too closely to even what is best in the
sciences. For each involves at bottom a quite different version of the
will to power and consequently of what constitutes interpretive community.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Let me be schematic, even though careful distinctions are
necessary. Nietzsche saw the dominant tendencies of his culture as
manifestations of a will mired in epistemic commitments. Truth seemed the
highest state that persons could achieve, and nobility involved making
the sacrifices necessary to bind oneself to one's capacity for rational
analysis, whether that be Kant's deontology or Bentham's empiricism. But
when truth is so idealized the personal becomes its antagonist. All
the most intense states of the individual person must be suppressed or
repressed in order to align the

<B></B>

individual to the normative power
of rationalizing disciplines. Yet while these disciplines offered the
power to deny such personal states, they lacked the power to comprehend
them. The personal would always be the marginal, the disturbing, and
the disruptive. Science itself cannot adequately explain the personal
ambitions for power of its protagonists nor adequately direct public
ambitions for the use of such power, at least insofar as the methods
of science proved difficult to correlate with needs shaped by local
traditions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Recognizing the force of Nietzsche's criticisms here does not warrant
embracing his own alternative. On the one hand, the same criticisms
can be used simply to weaken what counts as "truth" so that we can use
pragmatist stances that bring the will to power under social control. And
one might also cite vague ideals of resistance or sentimental calls for
response criticisms and other forms of subjectivism that complement but
do not really change the normative structure of the will to truth. On
the other hand, there is the constant danger of taking Nietzsche's own
alternative too literally, so that the arts become emblems for a will
to power that takes on the right to decide in our public practices what
will count as "truth." Pound made that mistake. But the terms of his own
epic vision need not lead in that direction. They require only that we
recognize how desire sets the stage for what counts as truth, and hence
that we devote our theorizing about the arts to speculations that flesh
out what is involved in different kinds of loyalties. At stake is not
so much how we decide among those loyalties as how fully we let those
loyalties themselves make claims upon us that we can only express in
the mode of witnessing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such witnessing involves a testimonial model of criticism. But such
testimony is not based on identity politics or on any claims organized
in terms of how our expressions might originate in specific experiences
or conditions of victimage. The object of testimony is not who we are
as empirical agents but who we become when we find ourselves moved to
intensities that have no explicit grounding separable from the direct
expression of loyalty--I have seen what I have seen, and I worship until
some more powerful god comes along. Of course for an entire polity to
live in accord with such intensities we have to keep art's way of being
public from taking over recieved measures for deciding on rights and on
justice. But we are only faithful to the most intense forces in the arts
when we recognize with pain how thoroughly those concessions contradict
the imaginative attitudes cultivated by the arts. And now science reenters
my story--as the basic cause of that pain because for it witnessing
only makes sense within a rationalizing discipline. Confronted by that
demand, art's silences become socially ineffective, and historians rush
into the opening void.

The relation of avant-garde constructivist movements towards Futurism
seems to me a telling
example of how the modernists tried to have the
cachet of science without binding themselves to its specific theses. While
all the artists acknowledged the importance of Futurism's commitments to
the notions of energy and power basic to modern machine culture, they
also labored to create substantial distance from the Futurists' direct
pictorial relation to those social factors. Futurism might be only
another version of impressionism, an art of surface appearances that
would block access to deeper dimensions of feeling and of constructive
intelligence for which art might provide modern witness. Here, for
example, is Ezra Pound on this subject: "Futurism is descended from
impressionism. It is, in so far as it is an art movement, a kind of
accelerated impressionism. It is a spreading, or surface art, as opposed
to vorticism, which is intensive. . . . Vorticism is an intensive art. I
mean by this, that one is concerned with the relative intensity, or
relative significance of different sorts of expression" (Ezra Pound,

I offer a passages from Malevich's prose to indicate how close his
thinking on the tilt is to Hegel's fascination with aspects of phenomenal
experience that cannot be contained within frameworks developed for
dealing with the sensible world, and hence which allow us to speak about
the "supersensible" without relying on any mystical claims. For Malevich
everything I have been saying about the tilt can be summarized under
the rubric "the spirit of non-objectivity."

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
"No more likenesses of reality," no idealistic images--nothing but
a desert! But this desert is filled with the spirit of non-objective
sensation which pervades everything. Even I was gripped by a kind of
timidity bordering on fear when it came to leaving "the world of will
and idea," in which I had lived and worked and in the reality of which
I had believed. But blissful sense of liberating non-objectivity drew me
forth into the "desert," where nothing is real except feeling . . . [his
ellipses] and so feeling became the substance of my life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(Kasimir Malevich, <I>The Non-Objective World,</I> tr. Howard Dearstyne
[Chicago: P. Theobald, 1959], 68.) I should add that this passage is cited
by Linda Henderson, <I>The Fourth Dimension</I> (Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1983), 289, as part of her effort to show that Malevich
was influenced by discourse about that fourth dimension. I am persuaded
that Malevich knew about the fourth dimension and used it as one metaphor
for this ideal of "liberating non-objectivity." But from my perspective
invoking the fourth dimension is simply one way of talking about some
"other" to extensional understanding. For me, and I think for Malevich
and Mondrian and Picasso, the specific metaphors used are less important
than the underlying logic enabling one to characterize the tilt into
non-objectivity. That task is better served by Hegel than by Ouspensky,
if only because Hegel too sought to show how elaborate value structures
could be based on a concrete version of the "supersensible" as simply what
could not be handled adequately within languages devoted to the sensible.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT8" HREF="#REF8">8</A>.
In the following discussion I will not try to follow all the turns
of Hegel's argument, especially when he gets into the complexities of
contradictions between identity and non-identity and when he sets up his
idealist ontology in which force and spirit prove identical. I want only
to make clear, historically and analytically, how the general outlines
of Hegel's thinking help clarify aspects of the concept of force that
influence the arts and should inform theorizing about them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT9" HREF="#REF9">9</A>.
Here is Hegel's most succinct formulation of how awareness of force
modulates into self-consciousness:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
This curtain of appearance hanging before the inner world is therefore
drawn away and we have the inner being gazing into the inner world--the
vision of the undifferentiated
self-same being, which repels
itself from itself, posits itself as an inner being containing
different moments, but for which these moments are immediately not
different--<I>self-consciousness</I>. [<I>PS,</I> 103]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This could be Malevich talking about how art's engagement with inner
and outer aspects of experience leaves it simultaneously a thing and a
non-thing, literal in more than one world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT10" HREF="#REF10">10</A>.
Those speculations can become means by which the passive being
restores the capacity to become a soliciting force, and then the ideas
themselves become beings for it. These vacillations then admit endless
twists and turns which I do not think are relevant here, although my
gesture of dismissal of course makes them soliciting features for a
deconstructionist argument.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT11" HREF="#REF11">11</A>.
This sentence is my attempt to make sense of the following Hegelian
passage: "The soliciting force, e.g. is posited as a universal medium, and
the one solicited, on the other hand, as Force driven back onto itself;
or is it really the latter that is the soliciting force for the other and
is what makes it a medium. . . . The external, soliciting Force appears
as a universal medium, but only through its having been solicited by
the other force to do so" . I am leaving out of my account Hegel's
brilliant analysis of how law must undergo a splitting that parallels the
one between soliciting and solicited force. We can state this tension in
two ways. First, there is not one law but always many: the general law
does not give a unity of specific laws but "leaves out their specific
character." So the unifying law must always be supplemented by specific
ones it cannot quite contain in their specificity. Hegel's example is
the relation between the general law of attraction and any specific set
of practical principles like the laws of electricity or of gravity ,
but I think even practical matters of jurisprudence manifest the same
problem. The particular law is not clearly contained by any determinate
chain from only one set of more comprehensive principles. And, second,
as a consequence of this multiplicity of law, there is no stable way
at this level for understanding where the necessity lies that the law
attributes. Clearly the notion of Law gives consciousness self-certainty,
since the positing of law makes it possible for reflective spirit to
see itself producing unity for different manifestations of force. But
law too has its solicited dimension as well as a soliciting one, so
consciousness wobbles between seeing itself as the ultimate substance
or seeing itself as completed in something beyond itself. Scholars may
explain the world, or, as Daniel Dennet puts it, they may be mere sememes
that libraries generate so as to reproduce themselves.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT12" HREF="#REF12">12</A>.
Once again Hegel's specific formulation deserves careful attention
that I cannot give in my argument:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Infinity, or this absolute unrest of pure self-movement, in which whatever
is determined in one way or another, e.g. as being, is rather the opposite
of this determinateness, this no doubt has been from the start the soul of
all that has gone before, but it is in the <I>inner</I> world that it has
first freely and clearly shown itself. Appearance, or the play of forces,
already displays it, but it is as 'explanation' that it first freely
stands forth; and in being finally an object for consciousness, as that
which it is, consciousness is thus self-consciousness. [<I>PS,</I> 101]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Bloomsbury"--you hear people say today, and it's not a
compliment. Applied correctly and incorrectly to a number of persons of
the highest individual distinction, as a collective noun it is used to
express a complicated reaction, including envy and dislike. Never wholly
admiration or praise. And this essay is an examination, an explanation--or
an attempt to show the justice and the injustice of this.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Say "Bloomsbury" and then, on the Freud Game, only too often a string
of words will follow, varying with the player: "The Intelligentsia
in excelsis." "Oh, that lot," "those barren leaves." "N. B. G." [No
Bloody Good], "<I>faisand&eacute;s,</I>" "awful warnings," "mental
hermaphrodites," "brittle intellectuals," "<I>that</I> bunch." These
applied to a group who, as individuals, are admitted to high distinction
and a very real place in our national life. Yet, as a group, a
picture-world follows them about, a popular film, of untidy res in
shapeless, expensive tweeds and horn-rimmed glasses, or of dark women,
unfashionably bobbed. A fragment, quite worthless, except as a "trailer"
for a much more interesting picture. Or as light on the question--how
a group of people,

<B></B>

united by birth and training, who, after the
War, made a startling bid--not in the arts only, but in most vital
activities--to lead our culture, twenty years later should have come
to stand for something that has not succeeded; that is felt at once to
be equivocal and portentous, or as a simple-minded adversary would say:
"no bon."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A quick answer leaps to mind--that it is only the common English shame
and fear before the fact of intelligence, an attitude the press have
been quick to exploit. Or the centrifugal forces in our culture trying
to assert themselves against the centripetal, that constant rhythm
which, as Lytton Strachey pointed out, for the first time since the
early nineteenth century, has become dominant again.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What truth there may be in this is too obvious to need working out. In
our time the public, the press, have always been like that. For the true
meaning we must look deeper. For the cultural importance, or impotence of
the group we call "Bloomsbury," for many reasons negative and positive,
is of very great significance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From about the year 1918, with the return of the Diaghilieff Ballet,
the youth of England, starving for its lost education, turned again
to the arts of peace. First there was the Ballet, with its appeal to
them all, and the roar and leap of <I>Prince Igor</I> first thundered
on the stage of the Coliseum, London at least became very much aware of
this Bloomsbury group, who had made itself liaison-officer for this new
wonder out of Russia, interpreters of its more "difficult" efforts to
a starving world. <SUP><A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</A></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Perhaps, at that moment, those leaders of "Old Bloomsbury," Fry and
Bell and Maynard Keynes, ceased for a moment to be protestant, mere
critics of our ignorance and insularity, but with the Ballet for excuse,
the production for their future productions, did for a moment lead our
culture as a movement in the nation's ballet. For the &eacute;lite only,
but that, after all, is the way--or one way--this work gets done; and
backed up by great ladies and great parties, splendidly and publicly
done; so that ever since those short months remain in memory, charged
with a power that those who have lived through them will never forget.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Also, at that same moment, unexpected but perfectly timed, came one of
the earliest productions of Old Bloomsbury, one entrancing, brilliant
and utterly unexpected work of art, the <I>Eminent Victorians</I> of
Mr. Lytton Strachey.<SUP><A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</A></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Always good at timing, that was their moment. Intelligent enough to
associate themselves with the Ballet, strong enough to force down the
public throat the new painting out of France; with Mr. Clive Bell's <I>On
Art</I> for theory--the starting-point of a generation's discussions,
they finished their first circumference, closed their first circle with
a masterpiece of their own.<SUP><A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</A></SUP> They were now a ring, a magic
ring, within which was gathered all that had been saved from the War--or
as much as they thought worth saving; within whose circumference English
creative ability could express itself again.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Eminent Victorians</I> was a piece of delicate explosive that, until
quite lately, has still been going off in gay little bangs. Followed by
the orgy of debunking which, with the tact of genius, Lytton Strachey
saw how to head off; though he little saw what it was to lead us to.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With results which everyone might have expected and nobody did--so that
everything of this new author's work was copied, except his learning,
his intelligence, his wit, the essentials of his pure style; while his
malice, his blind spots, his prejudices, his strange ignorance, his
occasional sillinesses, these, to the discredit of our letters, have
been put even to infamous use.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This certainly was one effect of his genius, the genius of Old
Bloomsbury in its highest form. One aspect rather, for genius carries
its own antiseptic, and there are other results from Lytton Strachey
of which our letters can be glad. He took the triple tombstone, the old
three-volume Life and Letters, smashed it to bits, and showed once and
for all how to reassemble its fragments. Also, in the writing of history
he illustrated the overwhelming importance of rhythm, design, a point
of view, and above all, of scale.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So "Bloomsbury," "Old Bloomsbury," "Upper Bloomsbury" started off well,
and in those early years admitted to their numbers--as Roger Fry said in
1922--one specimen from across the ocean, the new Englander, T. S. Eliot.

As Strachey said on Essex's choice of a bride, they "made an impeccable
choice," the future poet of "The Waste Land," the one great poet of
that generation (unless you count Edith Sitwell), the one poet of the
group. Though here and later on, much later on, we come to the ways'
crossing, the poet of Catholic Christianity.

Another candidate who "passed" at the same time, by grace and election
as well as birth, was Aldous Huxley--the Aldous Huxley of <I>Leda</I>
and then of <I>Antic Hay.</I> A book that to many of us remains his best,
with a tune to it and a pace, a design inherent in the action, as though
there had passed into it something of the Ballet itself:

Meanwhile, what were the other writers of England, who had survived the
war, writers and artists whose names were known, or who would soon be
known? What were they making of it?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One was too young to judge, sitting in Roger's studio in Fitzroy Street,
being painted by him, enjoying what one had never enjoyed before, contact
with a superb and generous mind. Mind and understanding that allowed
for one's own, that did more than tolerate, that encouraged one's crude
immaturities--not with patience, not with tolerance even, but with grave,
sometimes even excited interest. Youth and maturity neck to neck, it
was all adventure, discovery, an unenvious race.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That was this writer's introduction to Bloomsbury, indeed the only time
that one was in any deep and immediate contact with them, and then only
through him. Yet, even then, even in those early years, there went with
it an equally divided judgement. Unequally but deeply divided between
gratitude, affection and intellectual delight. These and the secret
rapture of a country-bred child before the rich comic possibilities
that seemed on one's own up-bringing inherent somehow in the whole
situation.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet now, looking back on those years, one is reminded--one was even
dazed at the time--was it a sequence, what was once called a Signature,
an example out of Mr. Dunne?<SUP><A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</A></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Years before, when the Titanic went down, Thomas Hardy published a
poem ["The Convergence of the Twain"]. One of those poems which, as
Lytton Strachey says, without a single poetic grace, have the secret
of touching the marrow in one's bones. I only remember one line, but
in it he describes the assembling, the growth of a great ship; and how
at the same time, in the fog and chill darkness of Polar Seas, nature
"grew the ice-berg too." So that the mind was haunted by the vast, the
universal implication of this.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To find its sudden application.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Roger Fry at Cambridge had been getting his double-first, when
St. John Hutchinson was being called to the Bar, when Aldous Huxley
was preparing for Eton, there was--as H. G. Wells said of Cato of
Utica--running about some garden a horrid little boy, a sturdy man-child,
bearing a name not unknown in Victorian history.<SUP><A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</A></SUP> A boy
who was to fling himself into the War, as an Artillery Officer--become
something of a soldier, take hold of battle with both hands and endure
it nearly unto death.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A thing no Bloomsbury ever did. A thing I could not but accept. Then,
after a time at the Slade, on the strength of his obviously immense
gifts, he was to be found for a while at that strange workshop, at once
one of Bloomsbury's completest failures, yet which the world has never
quite managed to forget.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And if ever a group warmed a serpent, help hand-rear a doom, grew a ship
while nature grew the ice, it was when young Wyndham Lewis went to work
at the Omega.<SUP><A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</A></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Then he left it, just at or just before the time when I was with Roger
Fry almost every day. That happy interregnum--Roger by day and Ballet by
night--then it was that the berg moved into action, and there appeared
the first counter-attack, criticism, caricature, challenge, first steps
of the anti-masque to their masque, goat's-foot beat of a very different
measure of antic hay.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>The Caliph's Design,</I> he called it, and loyalty apart, it was
clear that a new and formidable voice was speaking. On behalf of all
the arts, in being or to be. On behalf of every other artist in England
outside the Bloomsbury ring? No, not that. Hardly at all. A lone voice
speaking, a more violent gift, experimental, unfinished, "futurist" was
the current label; exceedingly male in quality, by no means free from the
neuroticism of virility, and above all contemptuous of the intricacies,
the private jokes, the derivative, feminine elements, the snobberies,
the pedantries of culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now, at this moment, in the common mind, there is a complex reaction to
the profound culture that was Old Bloomsbury's distinguishing asset. The
old sheer respect for scholarship, for pure learning, for the educated
man, at least in cities, is gone. The popular press is producing the
shoddiest imitation of it, by which the semi-
and very recently literate
are taken in. Yet, like love or fine breeding or the arts, it is one of
the values that cannot be faked, the slightest attempt shows itself up
instantly. You have either entered into the work, the books, the music,
the building of such and

<B></B>

such masters. Or you have not. At the same
time, real knowledge, real familiarity lends itself to a kind of family
shorthand exasperating to those outside.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With Bloomsbury it was absolutely genuine, natural, happy, and, within
their idiom, profound, fused with their entire nature, their approach
to life. Yet, even within, there were factors in their knowledge that
weakened them; and in their inherited, inherent liberalism, pledging
them, so to speak, in advance to Advanced Thought; that, for another
thing, forbade their panache, or pride in high position or an honourable
name. Physical elegance they despised. Who, on what seemed arbitrary,
<I>&agrave; rebours</I> principles, their private virtuosity, a family
chic, called people beautiful, who, to the eye of youth were merely
queer. Who could always justify this by some recondite example, some
<I>trouvaille</I> out of the past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was in this knowledge of theirs, I think, that they felt safe and their
mastery each of his own special knowledge. It was their sure ground--the
wonderful, disciplined knowledge, the power to go lightly back into the
past and bring back treasure, arguments, examples, parallels, precedents,
illuminations, from every art and action, thought or work or personality
that has ever been.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet there it was, at that very moment, moving out of its original
darkness, its isolation and its proper mystery, the berg arrived upon
their seas, grown and ready for action. A powerful intelligence, confident
also of ability to beat them at their own game; outside them, yet in
possession of some of their secrets--a sea mountain, a sea monster they
had thought once to have in tow.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As Lytton Strachey said of Voltaire's <I>Akakia,</I> <I>The Caliph's
Design</I> was written by a demon with a grudge. A strong demon, and
as tough a customer as ever lived--the hard-bitten soldier, back from
that Occurrence they had tried to ignore; and it is the measure of
their <I>superbit&agrave;</I> that they nearly did so. For these were
no garden-city cranks.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To return though to <I>The Caliph's Design.</I> Its key passage, from
the point of propaganda, was a malicious, searching, savage, scandalously
witty attack on Roger Fry, to which even his tolerance was unequal. "Only
pretending to be a bee"--that was the measure of Roger Fry, the measure
of them all. Pretending to be the honey-makers, the rock-comb builders, the fertilisers, the "holy, light and
wing&eacute;d." Only in a papier-mach&eacute; garden of waxed flowers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"<I>Faisand&eacute;</I>"--"high"--and again Lewis had scored. They were
setting off the young Kunstforchers of England up the garden path, and the
wrong garden at that, making them liable to become art-fanciers, turning
their taste only too devoutly towards wax fruit and flowers made out of
feathers, things made of one substance pretending to be things made out
of another; leading young craftsmen to turn out their (often pleasing)
variations of those themes; young painters to an orgy of still-lives--very
<I>natures mortes</I>--and strictly non-representational portraits. A
good game while it lasted, but they made too much of it. Until it was
an essay by Aldous Huxley which sounded the call to order, with the
simple reminder that between a nineteenth-century ivory and a bowl of
wax fruit, between a Hepplewhite chair and

<B></B>

a shell and gilt inlay
round a panel painted with a view of Windsor Castle, there is a difference
not relative, but absolute.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was a game they were playing. And Art is not a game. A game with
values, and the values of art are ultimate values. That was the substance
of the attack in <I>The Caliph's Design</I>--which one read, loyalty
apart, with a delight one could hardly explain in its savage vitality,
its creating sentences, half stumbling, half revealing, its tiger spring.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"The snap of a fine gut string." So that was how it went, was it? That
was what art was like. As one read, a cord of one's own allegiances
snapped. Personal affection could not change, but the people who were
going to make art come alive again in England were not necessarily going
to paint or write like Wyndham Lewis, but go his dangerous road. A
much longer road, a stony, lion-haunted road. A hardy, dangerous,
beautiful road. Inside the Bloomsbury garden there would be flowers
grown, interesting plants, Mayan rarities, pastiche, for all I knew,
on the Fan tribes, or carpet-bedding brought up to date again. Only not
those flowers which, after all, are the gardener's first care, not the
rose or the iris, the larkspur or the lily, the poppy or the hyacinth,
the great hieratic flowers. Or, if you found them there, could you be
sure they were not copies; how sure were you that you might not even be
stung there--by a synthetic bee?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The work that draws its life from the centre, from the source, from
Plato's country, that does not depend, ultimately, any more on religion,
on tolerance, or elegance of outlook or on "vain learning"--the work
that uses these things, but is not in bondage to them--of that work and
its origins the tough who had written <I>The Caliph's Design</I> had
blasphemed a warning and a reminder.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
You could see him with a bayonet on his chimney-piece, not with a wax
pear. You could see him tight, but not on aesthetic emotions; you could
see him with a harem--and heaven help it! not with a lady-like boy. You
could not see him on his knees to man or woman, painting or devil. You
could to God.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He believed in the supernatural. They did not.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So much for slowly-elicited first thoughts.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Youth, under one formula or another, cannot do without moralities, and,
as such, moralities were forbidden in Bloomsbury. Where it seemed to
be assumed, either that one was perfect in them, or that they did not
exist. An assumption that all civilised beings, just because they were
civilised, had solved the questions of ethics, had no difficulty in
doing instantly what they should do.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What ethics were there implicit in <I>The Caliph's Design?</I> None to be
written home about, but, such as they were, they were not negative. Very
far also from the apotheosis of tolerance, leading, as it sometimes
seemed to do, to a kind of rather self-conscious naughtiness, and a belief in humanity which appeared to go so
far and not far enough, that one had observed in Old Bloomsbury.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet at the time much of this passed over one's head, who was away on
adventures of a very different kind in another land, saving what could be
saved of one's youth

<B></B>

from the war. Yet always just sufficiently in
touch with that brilliant group to mark their progress in time. Who were
to be admired, decried, imitated, attacked, snubbed, snobbed--until the
people getting born when I was young have grown up and entered Bloomsbury;
and the term has widened, and the term has narrowed, and as individuals
they have justified their fame.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So, again, it seems that the moment has come to ask: "What has it all
meant?" "What has it stood for?" "What are its casualties?" "Its final
successes?" "Is it over?" "Why?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Roger Fry is dead. So is Lytton Strachey. T. S. Eliot apart, perhaps
their chief claim to incontestable fame. The Sitwells (if you count them)
seem settled down as <I>litt&eacute;rateurs.</I> Unless you count Duncan
Grant, they have not yet produced a first class painter.<SUP><A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</A></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Surely, in those first years, they might fairly claim that, the ancients
apart, nearly all the living art in England grew in their garden
enclosed. (What has been the succession from <I>Blast</I>?) "So much
for the worse for English art," said the Designer. To which the reply,
perhaps too easily made, is "sour grapes." There was Aldous Huxley
with his extremely individual work, whose substance is <I>accidia in
excelsis.</I> Eliot added to his handful of poems, whose trouble was
that they had to carry within their compass the whole weight of a new
aesthetic, the burden of another major poet's life work. Only, with
that, he had his review to spread the light, and there was all the <I>New
Statesman</I> to play with.<SUP><A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</A></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Again, there were the Sitwells (can you count the Sitwells?), who were
never really Bloomsbury, but Chelsea-Mayfair. There was Virginia Woolf and
her husband. There was Maynard Keynes and Oliver Strachey at the Foreign
Office to carry on the tradition that attached them to public life, there
was St. John Hutchinson and Montague Shearman at the Bar.<SUP><A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</A></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There was Lowes Dickinson, and in the earliest days, Jane Harrison in
scholarship, and to hold down the chair of music for them at Cambridge,
Edward Dent. In science, Julian Huxley and James Strachey and his
wife.<SUP><A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</A></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A pretty wide corporation--with its eyes ever open for new talent; yet,
as Lytton Strachey said of Congreve, their feet so down in good English
earth that more than once the called did not remain the chosen, and
Mr. Middleton Murry came--and went.<SUP><A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</A></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There was Waley, with his Chinese translations, doing what no one had
ever done before; and here, there and everywhere there was Clive Bell,
with his gay, excited theorisings for comp&egrave;re and producer and
publicity-man. There was E. M. Forster, their J. M. Barrie, whose one
masterpiece was a bestseller. There was Desmond MacCarthy for critic
and imcomparable wit; and David Garnett to make them little toys in
letters, bibelots as charming as anything out of the cases at the Chinese
Exhibition.<SUP><A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</A></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There was more young entry, highly intelligent young men and women. Two of
the Davidson brothers, the painter and the critic of painting. There was
Ray Strachey, who out of her family papers produced that most fascinating
book, <I>Group Movements in the Past.</I><SUP><A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</A></SUP> All these and
many others, and the type that is now called "Bloomsbury" beginning to
impress itself upon the public mind.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now it is impossible to underestimate or to be ungrateful for all
this. The first time for a very long time (Disraeli was an exception) that
a group has made a bid for power and cultural leadership whose appeal
was based on reason and on intellect; whose eclecticism, in practice,
left out of count all those sides to men's nature that lie deeper than
the purely rational mind. I do not mean that they left psychology out--no
one, for example, played more happily with psychoanalysis than they did.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet, here it is that we come to the ready, the obvious criticism. Their
attempt was legitimate, but in handling it they made an error, an
ingenuous one for men and women of their intelligence, showing them
as blind to their own blind spot as the most bird-witted of their
philistine opponents. Whose confidence they have shaken, but not shaken
enough. Because it is not enough to despise the Philistine, or from the
most real authority thrust him aside, annihilate him, strip him, make
game of him. Dance circles round him, a witty dance, a ballet of their
own composition. "My men like satyrs. . ." It was excellently done. Only
it was not enough. Their enemy was not the real enemy. Their enemy was
not an enemy at all, but the man they could not make friends with. (The
Philistine is easy game.) But there remained all around them that "real"
world, the larger world of men of good will; the world that does not
want satyrs dancing at it all the time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Roger Fry, Eliot? No, Eliot, for reasons which will be seen later, stands
apart; and Roger, one of the oldest of them, had in him some quality which
seemed, to me at least, as if it were something remaining; something,
as it were, left over from "a cleaner and lordlier world."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For all the rest, there was a quality exceedingly hard to describe, that
for all their learning, their science, their wit, their considerable
art of living, carried with it an all-pervading insufficiency. A kind of
hole in the centre, into which the mind fell instantly, the moment the
question was asked, and very soon it began to be asked, "What is the real
meaning of all this?" "These people touch on life at every side. What, if
they had their way, would be the result, the pattern, the intelligible
whole?" Or simply: "What are they letting us in for?" Questions that
were not answered. That never have been answered. That were not often
even intelligently put.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Remember all this time, now coming closer with every year, the realignment
that is going on in human society. A regrouping whose kind what follows
should attempt to make clear. Remember now that as Old Bloomsbury went
on from triumph to triumph, easy triumph to easy triumph--too easy?--the
same anti-masque attended their masque, and the Caliph's Designer rarely
let his pen rest.

He did. That all this was leading us up a blind alley; that in the end
all this would not do. He saw enemies everywhere (especially among his
friends). But he saw the

<B></B>

Enemy also. The Enemy of souls, busy over
the world to its damnation. He did not put it like that, but that is
what he meant.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As he showed, justly and unjustly, but with little points of appalling
discernment, among the instruments of the Enemy, the high, gay,
confident persons of Old Bloomsbury. Because what they had done would not
do. Because they had led the world a dance, a ballet, which was only a
family charade. Because they were a mutual admiration society. Because,
<I>au fond</I> they were not serious at all. Frivolous, the wrong order
of frivolity. (Not his kind, <I>bien entendu.</I>) A man against a group
who could never share the same jokes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He was crabbed, rude, unkind, ill-bred, unjust. He allowed for nothing
that they could do, for Strachey's crystal style, for Roger Fry's
magnanimity. He seems to have taken particular care that not more than
one man in ten should understand what he has to say. He was uncharitable,
bitter, unperceptive. He left most readers in a very dim state as to in
what he himself put his trust.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet, through it all from <I>The Caliph's Design</I> to <I>The
Childermass,</I> from his drawings and his manifestos, he gives an
overwhelming impression (much as he would blaspheme the imputation) of
an intelligence at once most powerful, searching, original, discontented,
wounded, thwarted, maimed, unconquerable.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This brings one to the publication of <I>The Apes of God.</I> It does
indeed. A book whose value it will not be easy to judge until the time
comes when it has ceased to be perhaps the most comprehensive libel
&agrave; clef that has ever been written.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Appalling ballet--anti-masque become masque with a vengeance! Actually,
as an attack, its theme is wider considerably than Old Bloomsbury or
New. Almost the whole of what might be called fashionable--in the best
sense--culture. Bloomsbury--Chelsea--Whitechapel--Mayfair--Montparnasse.
Its agonists--protagonists sounds too mild--are not Bloomsbury
at all. (Unless you count the Sitwells.) The dumb beauty-boy who
passes through it all in such a strange state of trance is not even
an Englishman. Yet one opening chapter passes in the penetralia of Old
Bloomsbury; and a great part of the action at a single party, where many
of them appear. And (if you count the Sitwells or not) no one has ever
wasted time pretending that three of the chief victims of that episode
are not identical with them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"This is the most Peter Pannish family ever born." A comparatively
merciful remark. For the rest, he gives to that long summer night's
entertainment, the quality, modernised and put into prose, of something
like a canto in Dante's Hell. The sense of movement in a circle, and
what a <I>ronde</I>--a violent, purposeless, demon-scourged fleeting of
lost souls playing at salvation. And all terrified of nothing. But this
is not a review of <I>The Apes of God.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Clearer and clearer the double alignment of European society begins
to show, where all forces are shaking down into two fronts with the
Waste Land between them. Put in its final, simplest terms: the world
is dividing itself and will be divided into believers in a supernatural
order, of which the natural is a development, a reflection, an aspect,
and on whose relation to which its health depends. Or the believers

<B></B>

in a natural order only, plastic to man, for him to determine,
probably on some variant of the Marxian dialectic, first and foremost
in relation to his physical needs. After which all other things will be
added to him. If he still wants them. And if you protest that this is
to remove all "higher" values from life and from the world, the answer
is a very curious one, and Mr. Julian Huxley is the man to make it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now, one does not know how far Wyndham Lewis subscribes to this. One
cannot imagine him bowing the knee to some Transcendance which is not
the mirror of his suppressed wishes. Still less to the vegetarian phallos
round which Mr. Shaw's petrified lambs skip.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the other hand one cannot see him working out a restatement of the
<I>philosophia perennis</I> with Christopher Dawson, Berdyaev or Jacques
Maritain.<SUP><A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</A></SUP> Here, as a Bloomsbury critic, his questions asked,
his function ends. A great dog, he has hunted them. He has not brought
them to bay, or to the huntsman's knife.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The significant moment, I think, unheralded, unrecognised, its details to
me quite unknown, came when T. S. Eliot parted metaphysical company with
the man who had first sponsored him in our society. One day, it must be
twelve years ago and more, I was walking in Paris with Ezra Pound, and
listening to his lamentation on the fact that Eliot was taking Dante
seriously. Aesthetically, as a poet, yes; but also his beliefs. Still
young enough to feel that he was right--of course Ezra Pound must be
right--but still wondering how it was possible to come to any sort of
terms with Dante and leave his religion out.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For at that moment <I>Ulysses</I> was appearing. <I>Ulysses,</I> a
challenge, the challenge of challenges, to the whole supernatural,
sacramental conception of the world, our societies, our lives. Not only
of sex, but of all the key points in human life and the values we attach
to them; the most stupendous, Calvinist-puritan-materialist manifesto
ever issued: to one's own private mind, the most stupendous aberration
of genius.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But then everyone was reading it, and here was an obvious suspicion in
the heart of Ezra Pound that his friend, Mr. T. S. Eliot's reactions
were not, or would soon not be, aesthetically pure. And as one walked,
one's mind became more and more doubtful. For one knew what Ezra Pound
could never know, the nature of English sacramentalism. So that was what
Eliot was choosing, was it? His dip in the lucky bag that is "forever
England"? And what would Roger say?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Roger would not be pleased, any more than Ezra, Ezra who in no sense ever
belonged to Bloomsbury at all. Roger would say that you could make poetry
out of anything, just as you could make a picture of his old trousers,
hanging on the wall from a nail, their cylinders cut by the disk of an
Omega plate, a composition replete with significant form. So you could,
if you were a Van Gogh, but that was just the point that had sent the
Caliph's Designer off so wickedly.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was from this conversation, as one now sees, that one's mind
began slowly to clear, as though one had caught a glimpse of the
world-picture shaping. The world, the intelligent world, whose beliefs
and opinions filter down now to the mass of the people, to form the
ambience of the social mind, must either abandon their scepticism

<B></B>

or stick to it. Half-beliefs, suspended beliefs, agnosticisms, modernism,
indifferences are becoming sensibly more impossible. For it is another war
for which we are preparing, the Armageddon, perhaps the real Armageddon,
of our societies, our civilisation, that three thousand years' adventure
we date (for convenience) from the siege of Troy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Has it all been one <I>essential</I> fake, a brilliant self-deception,
with one form or another of the Marxian dialectic; that grim
reorientation, transvaluation of all values, first practised in a country
of mysticism run to seed; for its last word?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Or, from another angle, can we incorporate in our Three Thousand Year
Plan our recently acquired scientific power, for what it is worth and
for what it is not worth, what it can give us and what it cannot give? It
tells us how things behave, but nothing at all about what things matter,
servant as much as God to the unjust and to the just. The questions we
all began to ask, night and day, on the publication of "The Waste Land."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What would Roger say? Actually, in those early days, at least, Roger
had not made up his mind--the question yet hardly formulated, with the
U.S.S.R. in its bloody infancy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet to return to the heart of the business.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However much he may deny this religion or that, it is not easy, perhaps it
is hardly possible, for the artist or for the man of any genius to deny
altogether the supernatural. For, as Ellis-Roberts says, "of all men he
needs it most."<SUP><A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</A></SUP> Besides, there was in Roger Fry's blood,
and I have heard him admit it, that protested against that denial, and
he admitted the protest. You are not for nothing the son of centuries
of Quaker contemplation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the other hand, take the whole range of their work, of all
Old Bloomsbury whose names are now so celebrated, try the tone
of it. Scepticism too sceptical even to come down on the materialist
side of the fence. "Dainty jests," as Charles Williams said in one of
his rare flashes of bitterness, "at the Trinity and the death-agony of
Philip of Spain."<SUP><A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</A></SUP> From E. M. Forster, their substitute for
the values of J. M. Barrie, and his occasional flirtations with purely
pagan ghost-to-daimon hauntings. Forster their limit in one direction;
on the other the sentimentalist rationalisings of Julian Huxley against
his brother's remorseless accidia, the will <I>not</I> to believe. Lytton
Strachey's gay version of what he believes Voltaire wanted us to think.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No, the joke is and the point--that for people of their pretensions, they
show as strange a set of intellectual limitations as any of the people
they have held up to scorn. A work that needed doing, it was sometimes
exquisitely done, but once out of their skillful hands, where has it
got us?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To the debunking campaign; which began as art, began as history; became
a game, became a vulgar game. Very quickly this has happened. Already
the original players and spectators are tired of it, tired and a little
ashamed. A decadence moreover, inherent and discernible, from the
very first. Aldous Huxley's analysis of Pascal will add nothing to his
fame.<SUP><A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</A></SUP> Other Christians have been sick men and out of love
with the world--without being Pascals. As to St. Francis, it would take
some doing to find

<B></B>

a man, by temperament as much as by training,
as unable as he to appreciate the Umbrian saint.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet saints, or rather the problem of sanctity, gives a touchstone; and
on saints, Huxley, and here he may stand for his group, is not only
untruthful, he is comic; and when he writes about sanctity becomes,
<I>mirabile dictu,</I> not only one of the least perceptive but also
the most ignorant of men, condemning as "monotonous goodness" as varied
a set of lives as have ever been lived.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet "in Bloomsbury" such variety of experience could hardly be called
the spice of life. A very fine epicureanism, all the advantages of the
cloister with none of its disadvantages, at least in the old exclusive
days, was the note of existence there. An eclecticism which, at least
when I knew it, had almost perfected itself; and which of all systems
imposes the most obvious restraints. For if you are to taste everything,
you have rarely time to sit down to a long meal.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In effect their discipline of life was strict, every aspect of existence,
war, sport, physical adventure, mystery, passion, even the delights of
strictly fashionable life, all liable to interfere, and all implicitly
banned.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By inclination--certainly. Yet, except perhaps for the last, in theory
liberty was allowed. Only, such a return [to what] they, bless their
hearts, believed to be the late eighteenth century, very soon, as the
Caliph's Designer lost no opportunity to point out, presented them to the
public eye as people as much under a glass case as any of their own fruit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Only pretending to be a bee." The fun of it. Or is it finally fun, when
the genuine bee, or perhaps the wasp, sits down on you? As one has tried
to say before, one does not suppose that any simple person who has ever
been in contact, has not at moments longed to hurl them into life--into
the sweat and heartbreak of things, see them at Deauville or the Derby
or the Devil. (Or, equally, give them a taste in action of the revolution
they play with on paper, that some of them were, at least, so elaborately
prepared to welcome here.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However they persuade themselves, [they would be] the very first people
to be "liquidated" is I think the word, if the Commissars from Glasgow
got going, and the bloody wheel one has watched turning down all history,
here in England begins to burn and spin.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Infinitely too intelligent not to know this, amply courageous to die
with elegance and wit. Yet to conclude, surely the demand that the common
intelligence of our time would make on them is to ask: "You who know so
much, can say it so well, is there nothing more you can do for us?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ever more clear, sharp, and deep with an abyss between, shows the double
alignment of western society. It has become a clich&eacute; to say that
our civilisation is on its trial. Who knows enough, who writes well enough
to give life to that commonplace? Who has sufficient belief? And in what?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Threatened, challenged, in deadly danger--as it has not been since the
classic Empire fell before the Barbarians. Who will warm the knowledge of
this to life and

<B></B>

illuminate it by their intellect? Who might have
the courage to scrap all they have hitherto held, for the intelligence's
sake?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No one doubts they would die well enough. Have they not wit enough to
prevent so disagreeable a conclusion, for themselves, as well as for
us all?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One is doubtful. Because to become what they have become they have
lost--what, to win again, T. S. Eliot had to endure, all that went
to the making of "Ash Wednesday." "Ash Wednesday" after "The Waste
Land." The thing that always gets lost when men set themselves to live
as they have lived as Olympians playing, yet uncertain of the validity
or the origin of their power. The quality we call among other things
Simplicity of mind, by which alone values are preserved, by which alone
the intelligence, out of the mixed heap of <I>virt&ugrave;</I> we call
the good life, knows how to pick out the stone of great price.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Civilisation is their business. They have made it so. From them its Enemy,
the Enemy, theirs and the world's, and the Enemy of Wyndham Lewis, the
old Enemy of Intellectual Love, one of whose creatures they are, might
get its quietus. Or it might not.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One wishes to hear their answer.

One wishes they knew it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is difficult today to project oneself from the tenebrous era
of the <I>univers concentrationnaire,</I> with its accompanying
<I>esth&eacute;tique</I> of epigones, to that period of felicity and
effervescence in the nineteen-twenties and thirties, when writers of
the Anglo-American literary colony in Paris competed with their French
contemporaries in imagining new mental landscapes, in an atmosphere
of complete intellectual liberty. We seem now to have been living in a
golden age of the logos. Many of us had taken refuge from the bleakness
of the Volstead regime in the more friendly climate of Montparnasse and
Montmartre, and we were hell-bent on discovering new continents of the
mind as well. Daring experimentation with words, colors and sounds was
the chief preoccupation of an intercontinental avant-garde that extended
across continents and did not pause until that day in 1929 when Wall
Street "laid its historic egg." Most of the British and Americans went
home then, but a few die-hards remained until the Nazis' attempt to
conquer the Occident.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the late fall of 1926, I began preparations to launch the review the
following spring. I needed an editorial assistant, and had the names of
several newspapermen then living in Paris under consideration. Elliot
Paul seemed my best choice and I decided to invite him to join me. He
gave enthusiastic acquiescence to the plan, which included a small
salary that permitted him to quit newspaper work entirely and devote
himself exclusively to the task. He came to our apartment in the rue
Valentin-Huy every day, and we began to discuss details with growing
excitement. After a few weeks, having outgrown our dining-room table,
Paul and I hired a room in a modest hotel on the Place des Invalides,
where we hung out the <I>transition</I> shingle. Our "offices," as Paul
used to call our cluttered-up ex-bedroom (complete with all French
plumbing-fixtures), were eventually to become the mecca of numerous
manuscript-laden "exiled" writers from every state in the Union.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For some months the problem of a name troubled us, and numerous
suggestions were weighed and rejected. For a time "Bridge" and
"Continents" seemed to be the favorites. Then Edwin Muir's collection of
essays appeared in London, and the title struck our fancy. We finally
settled upon this same title, because it seemed best to symbolize
the epoch. I insisted, however, that it be printed with a lower case
"t." As an old newspaperman, I knew that the critics would give it a
howling reception, and anyway it was the fashion among many continental
"little magazines" of the day.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sherwood Anderson came to Paris that winter, and we were happy to see him
again. I met him at the Gare du Nord, and a news story I wrote about him
brought many requests for interviews from the French press. But Sherwood
did not really like Paris.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He knew no French and felt ill at ease in consequence, for he was
essentially the Middle Western type, and it irked him that he should not
be able to talk to the workers

<B></B>

of Paris in their native <I>argot.</I>
I can still see him standing at a little bar where he had invited some
workers for a drink, smiling and trying with gestures to approach their
minds. He was a frequent visitor in our house, and he also saw a good
deal of his old friend Gertrude Stein, concerning whose peculiarities
he entertained us. "Use your head, Sherwood," she would say to him,
whenever he lazily played with some Middle Western "notion" of his. One
day he arranged to bring Gertrude Stein and Alice Toklas to our home. At
his insistence, Maria sang some of the American songs he had liked
to hear in New Orleans. Miss Stein seemed pleased, although I doubt
if her interest in music was more than platonic. With Virgil Thomson,
who was also present, the conversation turned to the Gregorian chant,
Antheil, Milhaud and Honegger. It was not a wholly successful evening. It
constituted, however, an accurate review of our future relationship
with Miss Stein, which was also to be never wholly successful.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Editing the review seemed to entail such an alarming amount of social
activity, that we decided to look for a place outside the capital,
preferably well in the country. When we heard of an old house for
rent in the Haute Marne, near Chaumont, we decided to make a tour of
inspection and invited the Andersons to join us. After a three-hour
train-ride we arrived in an ancient, almost abandoned village called
Colombey-les-deux-Eglises, and put up at the only hotel in the place, the
"Cheval Blanc." The "estate," which consisted of a roomy house and garden,
surrounded by meadows and forests, had great charm. While we visited it
in detail, Sherwood gossiped, or tried to gossip, with the villagers,
especially the village belles, and seemed to derive much pleasure from
the experience, despite linguistic difficulties. He was curious about
their love affairs, their social relations, the harvest, anything they
could tell of their lives, and he kept me busy translating back and
forth. He was amused by the revelations of village customs which were
told him without false modesty, and he enjoyed to the last drop the
excellent near-Champagne wine of the region offered by M. Poulnot, the
hotel proprietor. We liked Colombey-les-deux-Eglises and decided to rent
it--for Fr. 4,000 a year. The move was planned for early spring.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I urged Sherwood to give us a manuscript for the review, but he firmly
refused; perhaps he was a bit jealous of the Paris writers. Or was he
afraid? I never knew. Paul and I were now in communication with writers in
England, France, Germany and the United States. We went through countless
manuscripts in French, English and German, and began to translate pieces
not only from these languages, but, with the aid of experts, from Spanish,
Russian and Yugoslav as well. We went to the Shakespeare Bookshop in the
rue de l'Od&eacute;on and asked Sylvia Beach to speak in our favor to
James Joyce. This she very kindly did and within a few days, overjoyed, we
held in our hands a bulky manuscript bearing the title "Work in Progress."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One Sunday afternoon, at the end of 1926, Joyce invited Miss Beach,
Mlle. Monnier, Paul, Maria and myself to his home in the Square Robiac,
to listen to him read from the opening pages of his manuscript, which was
subsequently to appear in the first issue of <I>transition.</I> He read
in a well-modulated, musical voice, and often a smile went over his face
when he reached a particularly witty passage. We were staggered

<B></B>

by
the revolutionary aspect of this fragment. After he had finished, he asked
each one of us separately: "What do you think of it?" There was little to
be said; it was obvious that we were faced with a unique literary work,
one before which all critical canons would have to be abandoned. For
Joyce had apparently found a solution to his language problem that was
essentially his own, a solution that was also exclusively applicable
to the English language, to which he gave a polysynthetic quality. We
knew that while the technique of the "interior monologue" or "stream of
consciousness,"  used in <I>Ulysses,</I> had found a number of supporters
(and imitators), the new work, which was based rather on the canon
of the "stream of unconsciousness," would in all probability find few
sympathizers. We nevertheless had complete faith in the ultimate value of
the work, and were proud to contribute in a modest way to its unfolding.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Paul was in constant contact with Gertrude Stein, who let him see a
batch of her manuscripts that had been gathering dust in her rue de
Fleurus home. I never shared Paul's enthusiasm for the repetitiveness of
Gertrude Stein's writings, but I did not oppose publishing them, because
she, too, was experimenting with language.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I myself was in touch with the Surrealists and Paul Eluard gave me not
only his own poems for translation, but poems by other Surrealist friends
as well. One of these, Marcel Noll, an old Strasbourg friend who had just
been appointed director of the new "Galerie Surr&eacute;aliste," let me
have reproductions of Tanguy, Miro, Arp, Picasso, Ernst and others. The
writers and artists of the Surrealist group were at that time under
orders from Breton not to collaborate with any French review other
than their own, <I>La R&eacute;volution Surr&eacute;aliste,</I> and it
was something of a triumph, therefore, when in 1927 <I>transition</I>
published the Surrealists--many years before they became the fashion
in New York and London. In fact, a proposed anthology to be composed of
translations of Surrealist prose and poetry, with illustrations by the
painters and sculptor identified with the movement, was turned down by
a number of New York publishers when they were approached by Maria in
1928. "Nobody would be interested," was the invariable reply.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Archibald MacLeish, Raymond Larsson, Kay Boyle, Ernest Hemingway, Malcolm
Cowley, Hart Crane, Matthew Josephson, Ludwig Lewissohn were among the
many American writers who gave us manuscripts without hesitation. Their
work, however, differed from the French orientation, for it contained a
kind of American expressionism, a humanistic quality that was lacking
in the cerebral torridity of the French writing of that epoch. There
were indeed no Surrealist tendencies evident in American writing during
those years. It was all the more interesting, as time went on and
Breton's doctrines became known, to see the results of this excursion
away from literary isolationism on the part of a whole generation of
U.S. writers. Among the German expressionist works which had by then more
or less dropped into oblivion, I chose "Busekow," by Carl Sternheim, and a
short story by Gottfried Benn. I dictated the translation of Sternheim's
psychological study of a Berlin policeman to Paul, who took it down on
the typewriter, while we both laughed hilariously.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It so happened that a few months before our review appeared, Ezra Pound
started his new review, <I>Exile</I>. He wrote us from Rapallo, where he
was then living, that if he

<B></B>

had known that Paul and I were planning a
review, he would never have burdened himself with the ungrateful task. His
review, I believe, lasted only three numbers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, all the translations were made, the original texts were carefully
checked, and the whole manuscript was in the printers' hands. In a state
of nervous excitement we awaited the result of our effort, for we were
planning to bring out the first number in February 1927. But just here
something happened that seemed of almost saturnine origin and which, in
any case, proved to be prophetic of the stormy career that lay ahead of
our revolutionary magazine.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One grey, wind-blustery day, Paul and I went to the Gare des Invalides
to entrain for the town of Mayenne, where we were to supervise the
make-up of the first issue directly in the print-shop. We stopped by our
"offices"--our room in the little Hotel de la Gare des Invalides--to pick
up whatever mail might be there. We found a letter from an American poet
angrily withdrawing his contribution because, in our advance announcement,
we had inadvertently printed his name in what he felt to be an inferior
and therefore unflattering position. Since his poem was to be printed
in the first number, this manifestation of wounded <I>amour propre</I>
upset us considerably. Before taking the train, I hurried to a nearby
telegraph office and wired the irate poet our regret and the pious hope
that he would reconsider his decision. Arrived in Mayenne, we found a wire
from him, liquidating the difficulty. Finally we were ready to go ahead.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mayenne is a quiet old town in Normandy, about ten hours away from
Paris. Immediately upon arrival we installed ourselves in the office of
the print-shop, where we began to read final proof. The excellent cider
of the region soon found two eager amateurs, and the three days we spent
in the town remain among my happiest memories. Finally, everything seemed
to be in order, and we gave the <I>bon &agrave; tirer</I>--the signal for
the printer to go ahead. I returned to Paris, and took the next train
to Colombey-les-deux-Eglises, where we had moved a week earlier. While
waiting for the first number to appear, I welcomed the pastoral quiet
of our new home. It soon became evident, however, that this quiet would
be only relative.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
First there was Gertrude Stein. A few hours after we had received our
advance copy of the review, a special-delivery letter arrived. Maria
and I were already in a rather disappointed state, for we felt we might
have done better; we even criticized the number rather harshly, and
were discussing the elimination of certain defects we had noticed. But
Miss Stein had another complaint: one of the pages of her contribution
entitled, ironically enough, "An Elucidation," which was to have explained
her technique in her own style, had been printed in the wrong place,
thus creating a certain confusion; oh quite a disarray! Her letter
was virulent enough and demanded a rectification. I got hold of Paul by
telephone and we agreed that we would try to print a correction; but this
proved technically difficult and we finally decided to order a special
reprint of her entire contribution, to be inserted in the number as a
supplement. This involved considerable expense. However, Gertrude Stein
was propitiated. The supplement had quite a success later on, and critics
in England and America seized upon the whole incident as an excellent
theme for spoofing both author and editors.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The second number appeared, and the third. We were quite astonished
to realize that the review was being discussed, criticized, vilified,
admired. From England, Ireland, the United States, South Africa, India,
Australia came reactions of every shade of opinion. We were frequently
amused by the violence of the echoes, for we had expected a very small
group of readers, and were suddenly confronted with the necessity of
ourselves taking our mad effort more seriously than we had at first
anticipated. The bookshop demand was growing rapidly.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To me, <I>transition</I> was not only a workshop, but a kind of higher
journalism, a simultaneous attempt to report to the English-speaking world
the main intellectual movements of the continent, and to introduce to
European readers the work of English-language writers. And since I felt
that realism, imagism, the photographic, had become the chief enemies
of the modern creator, I posited as my main objective the dictum of a
"transformation of reality." In my manifesto, "Suggestions for a New
Magic," published in Number 3, 1927, I stated: "We need new words, new
abstractions, new hieroglyphics, new symbols, new myths . . ." This
was my guide-post throughout the <I>transition</I> decade. I wanted to
encourage the creation of a modern romanticism, a pan-romantic movement
in literature and the arts.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For this reason I welcomed individual Surrealist contributions, from the
beginning until the last issue in 1928; and, in fact, <I>transition</I>
was the first review to present Surrealist poems, texts, dreams, etc. in
English; the first non-French review to reproduce photos of Surrealist
and abstract objects and paintings. Not that I was ever a member of
the Surrealist clan, but I sympathized with Andr&eacute; Breton's early
efforts, with his discovery of the "Surrealist text" in the <I>Champs
Magn&eacute;tiques</I> (written collectively by him and Philippe
Soupault), with his discovery of automatic writing as a possible basis
of a new type of literary creation. To be sure, he deviated from his
first idea often enough, and I made it plain by the end of 1927 that I
was violently opposed to the political aberrations of Surrealism--that
I was chiefly interested in its <I>neo-idealistic</I> tendencies. Surrealism as a post-romantic manifestation
has today become a world movement. But when I knew it first, it was
confined to limited circles, even in Paris. It was <I>transition</I>
that made it known to the Anglo-American world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I myself had been under the neo-romanticist influence of Surrealism
since 1924, and had trained myself in the notation of my dreams. I
kept a notebook on my night-table and after a while was able to note
down, even in the dark, the images that I had experienced, each time
I awoke. I filled many of these books with sketches written in various
languages. I saw that in nocturnal life there was a new life, that there
were juxtapositions of which the waking life was apparently unaware. The
most heterogeneous images were tumbled together and became friendly and
coherent. Many of these dream and day-dream sketches were included later
in my book, <I>I Have Seen Monsters and Angels</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At that time the Breton-Soupault experiment was the sensation
of Paris. Many young poets used it and finally developed into a
<I>poncif</I>--a stereotyped system. Aragon, then a member of the
Surrealist group, explained it in his "A Wave of Dreams," published in
the magazine <I>Commerce</I>, in the following manner:

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
What strikes the writer is that he seems to possess a power he did
not know he had, an incomparable ease, a liberation of the spirit,
a production of images without precedent, and his writings assume a
supernatural quality. He recognizes in everything that thus emerges from
him--without feeling in any way responsible for it--all the incomparable
qualities of the few books, the few words that still move him.

Some years later Aragon renounced all this and joined the Communist
party. A strange evolution for an idealist, even for a nominalist mystic!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Being at that time more or less swept up into the Surrealist avalanche,
I witnessed a number of public manifestations organized by Breton. Among
others I was present at the "Vieux Colombier" theater when the Surrealists
forgathered to boo a <I>matin&eacute;e po&eacute;tique</I> featuring
a recital of de Musset and other poets of his type. It should be added
that de Musset was their <I>b&ecirc;te noire,</I> as he had been that of
Rimbaud. In the midst of a grandiloquent reading of the pseudo-romantic
poet's works by an effeminate-looking gentleman, Breton rose and shouted:
"<I>C'est une saloperie!</I>. . ." At this point there began a wild
scramble to the stage. Benjamin Peret shouted imprecations, while Eluard
climbed on a chair and began to harangue the fevered crowd of society
ladies and gentlemen whose mild enjoyment of "poetry" was being so
rudely interrupted. The management called for police protection, and in
the midst of the greatest excitement, Breton, Eluard, Peret and others
were conducted to a nearby police station. There they were booked on the
egregious charge of <I>bagarre entre intellectuels.</I> A few telephone
calls to certain of their friends in the Ministry of the Interior brought
about their liberation several hours later.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As our task grew heavier, we began to look for an editorial assistant,
and I decided to engage Robert Sage, a young American writer also working
with the <I>Chicago Tribune,</I> for the position. Paul, Sage and I used
to meet in one or the other of the left-bank caf&eacute;s we had chosen
as annex, and it was during one of these discussions that we tried out
Breton's technique of automatic writing as it had been explained by
Soupault. We soon began to try our hand at composing collective poems in
prose, stemming directly from the unconscious, and felt exhilarated by
the boldness of the images, and the liberation of the imagination that
resulted. There was no doubt that here was a method worthy of the age
of psychoanalysis; a method which would still need the curbing hand of
critical reason, but which opened up new and unsuspected veins of wealth
to the poet.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The importunities of would-be contributors in Paris, added to the need
to economize, soon drove us completely to Colombey-les-deux-Eglises,
and by the early summer of 1927 practically all the editorial work was
being done from there, leaving only the "office" in Paris.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Colombey house was a large, rambling affair, covered with ivy,
and isolated from the country road by a high wall. Lilac-trees were in
bloom along the wall when we arrived, and we could look from there into
a far land of rye and clover waving in the wind. A beautiful, wild park
surrounded the house, and below it was a hillock covered with furze and
fern. Beyond the fields lay a tangled, mysterious forest called <I>la
For&ecirc;t de la lune,</I> in which big game was abundant. At night the
inn-keeper's wife

<B></B>

watched stout-heartedly for wild boars, of which
she usually managed to shoot one specimen during the season. The peasants,
who called this country <I>la Champagne Pouilleuse</I> (to distinguish
it from the real Champagne country, contiguous to it), still lived in
a machineless age. They cultivated their fields and vineyards with the
same stubborn love of the loam which their ancestors had shown, and their
meager existence was made more difficult through the fact that most of
the younger men and girls had left the village to seek less monotonous
work in the cities. They made a wine from local vineyards which I always
thought was as good as any of the better known white wines. Their rather
hard, Eastern patois reminded me of that spoken in nearby Lorraine.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Tranquil weeks at the "Boisserie," our hermitage! Paul would come
down from the nerve-mad city to meditate and prepare new issues of
<I>transition</I> with me. He liked to stay with us in this pastoral
quiet, but never for very long, for he was restless and led a somewhat
complex personal life that often made it necessary for him to return to
Paris on very short notice. Other friends came for weekends: Philippe
and Marie-Louise Soupault, Stuart and Moune Gilbert, Robert and Maeve
Sage, Whit Burnett and Martha Foley, Carl and Lydia Einstein, Harry and
Caresse Crosby, and others, joined us in our rustic retreat, in order
to forget for a while the dynamo-whirl of the Capital. We were told
that Cl&eacute;menceau used to visit there as the guest of a friend,
before 1914; and a curious quirk of fate was the fact that after our
final departure, in late 1929, the place was sold to a French colonel
named Charles de Gaulle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This old house, which was conceived originally as a hunting-lodge by the
wealthy nineteenth-century merchant who built it, had had a somewhat
lurid existence: in 1917-18 it housed American troops who left
their names and drawings on the attic wall; from 1927 till 1929 it
housed ourselves, our growing family, and <I>transition;</I> in 1940 it
was confiscated by the Vichy government as being the home of France's
first <I>resistant,</I> and during the second war it was occupied by
German troops. Today, it has become the little Versailles of the Gaullist
movement, the goal of all new recruits to the R.P.F. (<I>Rassemblement du
Peuple Fran&ccedil;ais</I>), the center from which their leader launches
most of his political statements.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For the most part we were not interested in social problems, in economics,
or in any particular political complex. We thought of our t as
good, clean aesthetic fun, nothing else. We baited the Babbit with
monstrous paradoxes, we prodded him with topsy-turvy asseverations. We
saw ourselves as modern barbarians who did not hesitate to shout their
nervous prejudices into the faces of well-to-do, streamlined, shallow
minds. We were rebels against everything that did not participate in
flights of wild, burning imagination. We were the romantics of the
twentieth century, launched on voyages of discovery.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
James Joyce was our bellwether. In his "Work in Progress" he was
building a colossal elegy to the night-mind, a creation in which the
ancestral night was wedded to the individual, modern night in grandiose
transformations. We lived in this night-world of his in which he was
transmuting not only the myth of Finn Macool, but all myths.

<B></B>

At
his side we felt no fear in our own pilgrimage through the <I>Nox</I>,
in the walk from dusk to dawn.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Around us were French poets who were also in love with the night,
for Breton was leading his little band toward what he called "magical
Surrealist art," and a revival of interest in the dream and everything
connected with the nocturnal processes of the unconscious was the
result. He even went so far as to dig up certain early "black" romantic
writers, such as Raabe, Borel, and von Arnim, whom he proposed as models
to his disciples. Although all the Surrealists were conscious of this
nocturnal universe, this was particularly true of Antonin Artaud, Paul
Eluard, and Robert Desnos.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I myself tried independently to revive interest in the "white" romantic
poet Novalis, and translated for <I>transition</I> his <I>Hymns to
the Night,</I> with a short preface of my own. I also published a
pamphlet entitled <I>The Language of Night,</I> in which I sought to
analyze Novalis's vision of night and his expression of that vision. My
translation of poems by H&ouml;lderlin, written while the poet was
living in a state of mental alienation, was a further attempt to place
<I>transition</I> at the service of "white" as opposed to "black"
romanticism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Meanwhile I continued to study the writings, not only of Freud, but
of all his group, and in the review <I>Imago,</I> as well as in the
<I>Psychoanalytische Rundschau,</I> I found many possible applications
to the creative processes. Stekel's studies in psychic criminology
interested me particularly, and I asked myself if the curiosity
concerning Sade evinced by some of the younger Frenchmen, as well as
their predilection for crime novels and crimes <I>tout court,</I> did not
indicate that the taste for cruelty went well beyond the limits of the
criminal unconscious. The "diabolical principle" which had undoubtedly
inspired Lautr&eacute;amont's work, for instance, was certainly part
of our own mental heritage. It could be found in many of Baudelaire's
lines, and Edgar Allan Poe's necrophilia offered another example, as
did certain works of Barbey d'Aur&eacute;villy, Villiers de l'Isle
Adam, and others. <I>Les Contes cruels</I> had their prolongation
in most of the early Surrealist writings, as well as in those which
this group recommended for study. The French words <I>supplice, viol,
d&eacute;lire, ivresse, volupt&eacute;,</I> assumed a significance for
us that the English equivalents did not possess. We were living in a
world of <I>sorcellerie.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This preoccupation with the night-mind elicited a violent onslaught
against <I>transition</I> from the British writer, Wyndham Lewis,
father of the vorticist movement. Lewis published two books--<I>Time
and Western Man</I> and <I>The Diabolical Principle</I>--in which he
grew nearly hysterical about <I>transition</I>'s efforts. He denounced
the review as a Surrealist challenge to modern letters, forgetting that
it published, as well, expressionist, dadaist and futurist writers. He
attacked particularly James Joyce, who replied in his "Work in Progress"
with an Aesopian allegory, "The Ondt and the Gracehoper." Meanwhile, Paul,
Sage and I also engaged in a somewhat ironic and acrid debate with "The
Enemy," as Lewis called himself. We pointed out that <I>transition</I>
was not a Surrealist organ, but had published some of these writers
because they were allies in the pan-romantic battle. I had written an
essay in <I>transition,</I>

<B></B>

"Enter the Imagination," in which I
analyzed the <I>Maldoror</I> by Lautr&eacute;amont from my own personal
and somewhat theological standpoint. I pointed out that the "diabolical
principle" inherent in Lautr&eacute;amont's monologues had its genesis
in religious perversion. The Promethean revolt, I wrote, was evident in
this poem. I asserted that there was a spiritual element in his frenzy
of agnostic and bestial imagery. I could have added that he had such
distinguished precursors as Milton and Dante. Lewis pounced on the term
"diabolical principle," which he used as the title of his new book,
making it the point of departure for a virulent denunciation of the
entire <I>transition</I> direction.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mayenne, where the first three issues were printed, was in Normandy,
and we were now living in the heart of the East, at the other end of
France. It became necessary, therefore, to look for a new printer. In
our antique Ford, we decided to scour the villages and towns of Haute
Marne in search of one. We first tried Langres, the attractive medieval
town beyond Chaumont. We next tried Chaumont itself. But the print-shops
in both towns were unsatisfactory. We finally discovered an excellent
printer in the industrial town of St. Dizier, at the other end of the
D&eacute;partement. The print-shop of M. Andr&eacute; Brulliard became
our headquarters until the review was temporarily suspended, in 1930.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many European writers, especially those of the advance-guard, were
published in <I>transition.</I> We had our own team of translators, for
I regarded this as an essential feature of the mediatory action of my
early conception. During the first year, <I>transition</I> published
Franz Kafka, in a translation, made by myself, of his short story
"The Sentence." Unless I am mistaken, this was his introduction to
Anglo-American readers. As the years went on, his grotesque and anguished
narratives continued to appear in the review, the last of them being
"Metamorphosis," which we published in 1938. <I>transition</I> can
probably justly claim, therefore, to have fathered the interest in
Kafka's work which has since swept the Anglo-American world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to numerous writers of continental Europe, chosen from the
expressionist, dada and Surrealist camps, <I>transition</I> gave many
young and older writers of the English-speaking world an opportunity
to present not only their finished work, but also their experimental
efforts. Sylvia Beach was our Paris representative, and Frances Steloff's
"Gotham Book Mart" acted as our American agency. During the first year
I was extremely busy, for I had not yet finished my French anthology of
American poets. I also undertook for Joyce the rather arduous task of
reading proof on the German version of <I>Ulysses.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For several days each month, St. Dizier became our temporary
headquarters. Paul and I installed ourselves in a little room put at our
disposal by the printer, which we did not leave until the <I>bon &agrave;
tirer</I> was given. The Bruillard print-shop had been in the same family
for many generations, and a leisurely, paternalistic system prevailed
there. All the printers were French, which of course complicated matters
considerably, and our special foreman--a wizened little man named Monsieur
No&euml;l whom Paul dubbed "Father Christmas"--was always worrying about
the numerous changes we often had to make at the last minute.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a rule things went smoothly enough until the final proofs of James
Joyce's "Work in Progress" came from Paris. A first proof, in overlarge
type, had already been set up, on which additions were made in Paris
by Joyce. He then sent this back to "St. Dizzier" (as he called it),
in a condition that more resembled an esoteric scroll than typesetter's
copy. At this stage of the work, Joyce's friends were usually enlisted
for the task of deciphering the many notebooks in which, for years,
he had been jotting down his bold inventions. Stuart Gilbert, Giorgio
Joyce, the latter's wife Helen, Elliot Paul, Padraic Colum, Thomas
McGreevy, Samuel Beckett, Paul L&eacute;on, Maria and myself all
shared in this task. The proofs went back and forth, each time with
new inventions, until the pages had often doubled in number. For Joyce
would improvise whenever something particularly interesting occurred to
him during the reading, and occasionally even allow a <I>coquille</I>--a
typographical error--to stand, if it seemed to satisfy his encyclopedic
mind, or appeal to his sense of the grotesque hazard. Often, however,
his last-minute additions really taxed the patience of the excitable
Monsieur No&euml;l. "Joyce, <I>alors</I>!" he would shout, while the
editors kept discreetly silent. Joyce chuckled when I told him that his
name was being used as an objurgation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Once, I remember, I had just finished reading the last page of final proof
and had given orders to go ahead with the printing. Although somewhat
exhausted, I felt happy at the thought that another number was ready
to appear. I dropped in at the nearby "Caf&eacute; du Commerce" to join
Paul, who was already ensconced before a shimmering glass of what he had
baptized an "ironworker's cocktail." (This invention of Paul's consisted,
if I remember rightly, of generous portions of cognac, rum, armagnac,
champagne, and a dash of Alsatian kirsch, and was guaranteed to create at
last a temporary dionysian ecstasy.) As we settled back comfortably, the
telephone rang. An excited voice announced that a heavy special-delivery
letter from Paris had just arrived for us at the print-shop. Joyce wanted
to make further additions, one of them probably the longest he had yet
invented: an onomatopoeia of over fifty letters expressing collective
coughing in a church during a sermon. It was included.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Paris, Joyce, who was then living in the Square Robiac, also on
the Left Bank, would sometimes climb the four flights of stairs to our
office, to talk with "his editors" about "Work in Progress." He was very
anxious to have people like the work, and seemed astonished that the first
reactions were for the most part negative in tone. He would look carefully
over the list of our subscribers in France, England, ireland and the
United States, and sometimes suggest names for circularizing. One visit I
particularly remember was the occasion of Marshal Foch's funeral. Joyce
stood for a long time at the window, field-glasses in hand, profoundly
engrossed by the spectacle of the procession of dignitaries leaving the
Invalides. A mythological version of the funeral of another "great man,"
H.C.E., was incorporated into "Work in Progress" shortly afterwards.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At Joyce's suggestion, Paul wrote an interpretative article about "Work
in Progress" for <I>transition,</I> and I followed with another. We
then decided to ask other sympathizers with the new work to contribute
further essays, and thus published a number of articles on the subject
by writers of several nationalities, among whom

<B></B>

were Samuel Beckett,
Marcel Brion, Frank Budgen, Stuart Gilbert, Victor Llona, Robert McAlmon,
Thomas McGreevy, Elliot Paul, John Rodker, Robert Sage, and William Carlos
Williams. Some time later, Sylvia Beach brought out those essays in book
form, under the title <I>Our Exagmination round his Factification for
Incamination of Work in Progress</I>--a title which, needless to say,
was suggested by Joyce himself. In addition to the <I>transition</I>
essays, this volume contained an unsigned article which was included in
order that, symbolically, the "disciples" or "apostles" might be twelve.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the summer of 1927, Joyce had let me read his entire manuscript. It
was not more than 120 pages long, and had been written, he said, over
a period of five weeks during a stay on the Riviera in 1922. Yet it
was already complete in itself, organically compressed, containing the
outline of the entire saga. Even the title had been chosen, he indicated,
but only he and Mrs. Joyce knew it. It was still a primitive version, to
which he had begun to add numberless paragraphs, phrases and individual
words. In a moment of confidence he told me something about the genesis
of the idea. His friend and admirer, Miss Harriet Weaver who, some
years before, like a Maecenas of other days, had made it possible for
the struggling writer to be freed of financial worry, had asked him one
day with what book he was planning to follow <I>Ulysses.</I> He replied
now that <I>Ulysses</I> was out, he considered himself as a man without a
job: "I am like a tailor who wants to try his hand at making a new-style
suit," he continued. "Will you order one?" Some weeks later Miss Weaver
handed him a pamphlet written by a village priest, that contained a
description of a giant's grave discovered in a parish lot. "Why not try
the story of this giant?" she asked. It was the giant's narrative that
ultimately became the story of Finn Macool, or <I>Finnegans Wake.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first issues of <I>transition</I> containing installments of what
was then known as "Work in Progress" (Joyce told me that his provisional
title was the invention of Ford Madox Ford, who had previously published
a fragment in his <I>transatlantic review</I>) created a fanfare of
sensational outbursts in many continents. For the most part, the confused
critics in France, England and the United States simply snorted their
violent disapproval. Miss Weaver herself was quoted as having expressed
the fear that Joyce was wasting his genius, an incident which disturbed
Joyce profoundly, for, after all, it was for her that the "tailor" was
working. His French friend, Val&eacute;ry Larbaud, said he regarded
the work as a "<I>divertissement philologique,</I>" and of no great
importance in Joyce's creative evolution. H.G. Wells wrote that he still
had a number of books to write and could not spare the time needed to
decipher Joyce's experiment. Ezra Pound, after expressing the opinion that
"Work in Progress" reminded him of a description of some venereal disease,
advised him to put the manuscript into the family album together with his
poems. This Joyce resented, and since Pound had only recently eulogized
the poems of an American poet named Dunning, Joyce bought a copy of the
book in question, to see what it was like. "If that's Pound's idea of
poetry," he said to me, "I'm quite safe." As time went on, the reactions
to "Work in Progress" became more and more vehement, and on the whole,
journalistically stereotyped. Joyce continued working at his vision.

<B></B>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To those who knew him intimately during the late twenties, James Joyce
was a man of great warmth and charm, although at first approach his
personality could seem almost forbidding. As a point of fact, it always
took him some time to accept easy comradeship in social intercourse. At
first he appeared to be on his guard, an attitude that was particularly
noticeable during the explosion of fame that followed the publication of
<I>Ulysses.</I> Later, as his own personal tragedy deepened, a dour and
almost inhuman passion seemed to impinge in all his outside relationships,
and he was able to live in his cavern of despair with what appeared to
be pitiless indifference to events that did not touch him directly or,
through friends, indirectly. Once he had given his friendship, however,
nothing could swerve him from his loyalty, and he was capable of extreme
delicacy towards those he felt were his friends. He was never an ebullient
man, and his moments of silence and introspection frequently weighed even
on his immediate surroundings. Usually, however, there would finally
come a festive pause, when he would begin to sing, or even dance, and
on these occasions he frequently showed flashes of gaiety and wit that
approached a kind of delirium.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I never knew Joyce to be an easy conversationalist. He had a tendency to
rather monosyllabic utterances. Nor did he relish being questioned on
any subject. Nevertheless, when he was in the mood, his conversation,
couched in the mellifluous Dublin speech, was a ripple of illuminating
ideas and words, and once he had left his anarchic, misanthropic isolation
he could enjoy the companionship of his friends with a conviviality that
brought out his essential nature. Above all, he eschewed esotericism. He
was interested in human relations, human behavior, human thought and
customs. His range of interests was a wide one: poetry prodigiously
remembered and faultlessly recited; music and musicians, especially
singing, of which his technical knowledge was astonishing; the theater,
where his preferences went to Ibsen, Hauptmann, Scribe; the various
liturgies; education; anthropology; philology; certain sciences,
particularly physics, geometry and mathematics. He was little interested
in pure politics or economics, although he followed events faithfully
and his occasional barbed comments revealed complete awareness of all
that was happening.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Back in Paris, I found Joyce still working on his <I>magnum opus,</I>
but under great psychic difficulties. His daughter, a lovely, gifted
girl in her early twenties, had begun to show alarming signs of mental
derangement. There had always existed a great affection between the
father and daughter, and her increasingly serious malady soon became
a nightmare from which he could never free himself. Lucia, whose
principal interest was the ballet, but who also had a sensitive talent
for medieval illuminated lettering, had become engaged to a young friend
of the family, and Joyce had arranged an informal celebration of the
event. A few days later, however, after announcing that she would have
to break the engagement, she began to talk irrationally and showed signs
of aberration. At Joyce's request, Padraic and Mary Colum

<B></B>

 invited her
to visit them, but they soon noticed that her case was much more serious
that had at first been believed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The sudden death of his father [in 1931], which had occurred only a
few months previously, had also been a profound shock to Joyce. He had
never made any secret of his deep affection for his father, and the
autobiographical elements of his work reveal this in symbolical and
mythological allusions. <I>Ulysses</I> was man in search of his father,
and <I>Finnegans Wake</I> takes up this theme again in a different
manner. In those days he dreamed much about him, and one evening he
said to me: "I wonder where he is." Sometimes he would tell tales of his
father's waggish wit. I remember one that concerned the old gentleman's
reaction to the sketch made of him by Brancusi, and which consisted merely
of a geometrical spiral study of the ear. "Well, Jim hasn't changed much,"
commented his father drily, when the portrait was shown him in Dublin.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I was preparing a new number of <I>transition</I> and had decided to
pay homage to Joyce on his turning the half-century mark. Among other
features, I had ordered a sketch to be made of him by the Spanish
artist, C&eacute;sar Abin. The result was an impressive study of a
distinguished <I>homme de lettres</I>, with pen in hand and his own
volumes reverentially piled beside him. But Joyce would have none of
it, and insisted in giving the cartoonist precise instructions for
the design and execution of the job. He wanted it, first of all, to
look like a question-mark, because friends had once told him that he
resembled a question-mark, when seen standing meditatively on a street
corner. For more than two weeks he kept making new suggestions, until
he was at last satisfied. He asked to be drawn with a battered old
derby hung with spider's webs and bearing a ticket on which should be
inscribed the fatal number "13." He asked that a star be put on the tip
of his nose, in memory of an English criticaster's description of him as
"a blue-nosed comedian"; that his feet be suspended perilously over a
globe labeled Ireland, on which only Dublin was visible; that he have
patches on the knees of his trousers, that out of his pockets there
should emerge the manuscript of a song entitled "Let me like a soldier
fall." For his "luck," his "fate," had already started down the somber
path it never left again. It was as though already at that time he had
a premonition of the immense trials that lay before him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Joyce's family life had always been a happy one, and his humor was
a natural manifestation of this. Yet even then it was rather what
Andr&eacute; Breton has called somewhere "un humour noir." It had an
Elizabethan tang and robustness. During the economic crisis, when even
mirth-loving Paris began to assume a dreary face, Joyce celebrated, on
the same day, his fiftieth birthday and the tenth anniversary of the
publication of <I>Ulysses.</I> The two events were hardly noticed by
the literary world, which was discovering social realism and considered
Joyce outmoded. To mark this occasion we gave a small dinner at our
home in Paris, attended by Thomas McGreevy, Samuel Beckett, Lucy and
Paul L&eacute;on, Padraic and Mary Colum, Helen and Giorgio Joyce, and
a few others. The birthday cake was decorated with an ingenious candy
replica of a copy of <I>Ulysses,</I> in its blue jacket. Called out
to cut the cake, Joyce looked at it a moment and said: "<I>Accipite
et manducate ex hoc omnes: Hoc est enim corpus</I>

<B></B>

<I>meum.</I>"
At table the talk turned to the subject of popular sayings. Someone
expressed a suspicion of all of them and gave voice to his dislike for
the adage "<I>in vino veritas</I>," which experience had shown him to
be untrue and bromidic. Joyce agreed warmly, adding: "It should really
be <I>in riso veritas</I>, for nothing reveals us as our laughter." He
was always astonished that so few people commented on the comic element
in his writings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was shortly after this event that he suggested we organize a <I>bal de
la pur&eacute;e</I> (which is French for general insolvency), since the
depression was beginning to be felt more and more. The party was held
at our house, and we invited a number of friends, among whom was the
operatic tenor, John Sullivan. For several years, Joyce had been urging
all his friends to go to the opera and listen to what he considered the
world's greatest tenor voice. Sullivan sang that night, and his powerful
voice rang through the house, to the delight of all present. The gayest
of the guests was Joyce himself, who finally inveigled all the ladies
present into giving him first prize for his costume: that of an old
Irish stage character, famous once as "Handy Andy."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The doctor advised Joyce to send Lucia to the mountains, and at his
request we took her with us on a trip we had planned to Feldkirch,
a little medieval town in Austria, near the Swiss border. Her parents
remained in nearby Zurich, because it was the doctor's theory that Joyce's
own tension might be partly responsible for her condition. And in fact,
the mountain air and the isolation and quiet seemed for a while to do
her good. She began to smile and took long walks, always accompanied by
a nurse, however.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I was busy working, and looked forward to a fertile summer. One day there
came a telephone call from Joyce, asking me to come to Zurich. I took
the next train, and found him in great distress. He said that he had
received a disturbing letter from his daughter and he wanted to know my
impression. I told him I felt she was living a quiet life, but that her
condition had not fundamentally changed. It was decided that Mrs. Joyce
would accompany me to the Austrian town, and that he would follow later,
which was done.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now began a tragic period. Lucia's condition was worsening day by day,
and both her parents were deeply grieved at the turn her health was
taking. They were staying at a hotel in the center of town, while we had
taken a little house nearby. Joyce seemed utterly bewildered by the blow
which fate had struck him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He had not been writing for some time, due partly to intense worry over
his daughter's condition, but also to the general mood of inertia caused
by the depression. So we took walks together along the swirling mountain
river Ill, nearby, or we climbed the wooded hills. He had a love for
mountains and rivers, because, he said, "they are the phenomena that will
remain when all the peoples and their governments will have vanished." Yet
he was not at all a nature romantic, but rather a man of the megalopolis.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Towards dusk, after a siesta, he would go walking again. Eight o'clock was
the hour he had set himself many decades before as the time for his first
glass of wine of the day. That summer he evolved a sort of ritual which,
to me, had an almost

<B></B>

grotesque fascination. At half past seven, he
would suddenly race for the railroad station, where the famous Orient
Express was due to stop for ten minutes each day. He would walk quietly
up and down the platform. "Over there, on those tracks," he said one
evening, "the fate of <I>Ulysses</I> was decided in 1915." He referred
to the fact that in this very Austrian border-town he had almost been
prevented by some jinx from crossing into Switzerland during the First
World War. When the train finally came in, he would hurry to the nearest
car in order to examine the French, German and Yugoslav inscriptions,
and he felt for the embossed metal letters with the sensitive fingers of
defective vision. Then he would ask me questions about the persons getting
on or off the train, or he would listen to their conversations. In those
moments his fine ear for dialectical nuances in German often astonished
me. As the train continued on its way into the usually foggy night, he
stood on the platform waving his hat, as if he had just bid godspeed to
a dear friend. With eight o'clock approaching, he almost skipped back to
the hotel, for his first draught of <I>Tischwein</I>--or, as Mrs. Joyce,
who thought the drink of rather inferior quality, used to say, "dishwine."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We thus spent a month of idling and worry. Joyce talked about his
Austrian days before the First World War, and Mrs. Joyce especially liked
to reminisce about Trieste. She laughingly said she had loved Emperor
Francis Joseph like a father, and Joyce expressed his conviction that the
Austro-Hungarian federation had been one of the most efficacious political
regimes of modern times. Lucia and her parents always spoke Italian
among themselves, which gave our little party a multilingual ambience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One day I told Joyce that I was preparing a new issue of
<I>transition,</I> after having let almost a year go by without publishing
anything. This acted as a fillip to him, and he began to write again, for
he said he wanted to appear in the new issue. He attacked his work with
almost savage energy. "How difficult it is to put pen to paper again,"
he said one evening. "Those first sentences have cost me much pain." But
gradually he got the task in hand. This fragment was to be known later as
"The Mime of Mick, Nick and the Maggies." During the remaining months
he wrote steadily on this fragment, in spite of his anxiety about the
health of his daughter, and his own increasing nervousness. We worked in
the afternoon at his hotel, and one day as I arrived there he handed me a
closely-written foolscap sheet beginning with the words: "Every evening
at lighting up o'clock sharp and until further notice. . . " which I
typed for him. After a few pages had thus been transcribed, we began to
look through the notebooks, and the additions, set down years ago for
a still unwritten text, became more and more numerous. The manuscript
grew to some thirty pages and was not yet finished.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Joyce never changed a word. There was in fact always a certain
inevitability, an almost volcanic affirmativeness about his primal
choice of words. He only added ceaselessly, like a worker in mosaic,
enriching the original pattern with ever new inventions. His black
notebooks had esoteric titles and signs which he used to indicate the
various characters of his story. He had a special love for Earwicker,
the hero of the book, and to my astonishment I noticed one day that the
ancient arms of the

<B></B>

town of Feldkirch had precisely the same sign
as Earwicker. He smiled, when I called his attention to it; but he never
seemed to be over-astonished at fantastic coincidences in his life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"There really is no coincidence in this book," he said during one of our
walks. "I might easily have written this story in the traditional manner
. . . Every novelist knows the recipe . . . It is not very difficult to
follow a simple, chronological scheme . . . But I am, after all, trying
to tell the story of the Chapelizod family in a new way . . . Time and
the river and the mountain are the real heroes of this book. . . Yet
the elements are exactly what every novelist might use: man and woman,
birth, childhood, night, sleep, marriage, prayer, death . . . There is
nothing paradoxical about this . . . Only I am trying to tell my story
on many planes . . . Did you ever read Laurence Sterne?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We read together Goethe's account of his experiments with color, but he
finally said he could use nothing from it. He was interested in a comic
version of Leibniz's essay on theodicy, and he asked me to obtain from
the local Jesuits, in charge of the famous Catholic preparatory school,
"Stella Mautina," a certain Augustinian text. We discussed Vico's theory
of the origin of language and the Viconian conception of the cyclical
evolution of civilizations, born from each other like the phoenix from
the ashes, haunted him. He began to speculate on the new physics, and
the theory of an expanding universe. Sometimes while walking with him I
was obsessed with the notion that he was not really in an Austrian town
but in his native Dublin.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The children's game called "Devils and Angels" which is one of the themes
of "Mime" riveted his attention for a long while. He read a number of
gnostic books, and was interested in the Manichean idea of light and
darkness. The news of the discovery in Egypt of an ancient Manichean
text interested him. Besides the purely theological construction of the
Irish game--which he remembered vividly having played in the streets of
Dublin--he was bent on incorporating into the text children's games from
many languages. In a kind of abstracted way, he sometimes watched our two
little girls as they played in the garden of our house, and he did not
fail to use one of their games and their Joycified names in his fragment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "Mime" was completed in Zurich, after our return there. In the late
afternoon Joyce and I often took a motorboat for a ride on the lake. Or
else we would go walking up hill to the zoo, where one evening he quoted
to me the magnificent nocturne of Phoenix Park with the verbal magic of
animal sounds dying off in the gathering night. He had just finished
it, and he seemed to be pleased with the result. Joyce had a love for
Zurich, its rivers and mountains, its lake, its well-ordered life. In
the forenoon he liked to walk along the busy Bahnhofstra&szlig;e, which
runs from the railroad station to the lake. In those moments he was
always very quiet and introspective and I remember that sometimes we
would walk for an hour without either one of us saying a word.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He usually lunched at a vegetarian restaurant where vegetables were
served camouflaged as meat dishes, which always amused him. He knew all
the Swiss-German dishes and some of them he recommended heartily. But
in the evening nothing could

<B></B>

keep him from the "Kronenhalle,"
which he preferred to the more colorful "Zum Pfauen" that had been his
<I>Stammlokal</I> during the First World War, and where he used to meet
his friends. The "Kronenhalle" was near the lake, and its cuisine and
cellar were excellent. He was very fond of the Swiss Fondant wine from
the Valais, and rarely drank any other. He did not like to drink red
wine, which he found "unpalatable." He used to say that white wine had an
electric quality which all wine should have. In that we were thoroughly in
agreement; all my life I have preferred white to red wine. His preferences
were: Swiss Fondant, Alsatian Riesling or Traminer, Niersteiner or some
acrid Moselle wine, French Chablis or <I>Champagne nature.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Among Joyce's Swiss friends were, beside the Giedions, Professor Bernhard
Fehr from Zurich University, Dr. Borach, one of his World War I English
pupils. and Edmund Brauchbar, who had apparently served as model for the
re of Bloom in <I>Ulysses.</I> With these friends Joyce never entirely
lost a certain reserve which was so characteristic of him. I remember that
during another of my visits with him in Zurich, the <I>Neue Z&uuml;richer
Zeitung</I> was publishing excerpts from Dr. Borach's diary, notations
Borach had made of his conversations with his teacher during the World
War, with verbatim quotations. Joyce was somewhat upset about this, since
he did not like to be quoted for publication. He never gave an interview,
and it used to be a source for amusement in Paris literary circles that
even Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Lef&egrave;vre, the demon interviewer of
the <I>Nouvelles Litt&eacute;raires,</I> was never able to batter down
Joyce's resistance on this point. Joyce forgave Borach, however, for he
had great loyalty to old friendships.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One day a British critic wrote that Joyce was trying to revive Swift's
little language to Stella. "Not at all," was Joyce's comment, "I am
using a Big Language." And he added: "I have discovered that I can do
anything I want with language." His linguistic memory was extraordinary
and he seemed to be constantly on the look-out, listening rather than
talking. "Really, it is not I who am writing this crazy book," he said
in a whimsical way. "It is you and you and you and that girl over there
and that man in the corner." One day I found him in a Zurich tea-shop
laughing quietly to himself. "Have you won the <I>gros lot</I>?" I
asked. He explained that he had asked the waitress for a glass of lemon
squash. The somewhat obtuse Swiss girl looked puzzled. Then she had an
inspiration: "Oh, you mean <I>Lebensquatsch</I>?" she stammered. (Her
German neologism might be translated by 'life's piffle'.) Joyce remembered
all the scraps of conversations, the lopped-off syllables, pronounced
in moments of inertia or fatigue, <I>jeux de mots,</I> alcoholically
deformed words, slips of the tongue--all the verbal grotesques and
fantasies which he heard said around him in unconscious moments.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Often he would give his friends strange, out-of-the-way books on science,
philology, philosophy, theology, or psychology to read and ask them to
extract such words--or ideas--from them as he could use in his work. Or
else he would ask one of us to read the books aloud to him. I remember
reading Mauthner's German volume on language to him, and he was much
interested in certain of the conclusions which seemed to harmonize with
his own. On these occasions he lay on a sofa, his thin legs tangled
almost inextricably in the air, listening intently, making constant
notes, jesting.

<B></B>

He would thus extract numerous words which found
their place somewhere in the vast pattern of his story.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Joyce had great dislike for ready-made phrases and particularly for
much of the modern medical vocabulary. Whenever anyone in his presence
used words from the psychological dictionary, he would become almost
impatient, and with a certain insistence he usually succeeded in obtaining
the same thing in other words. This was in line with his intellectual
indifference to the psychoanalytical school of thinking. While in Zurich
I read to him an article on <I>Ulysses</I> by Dr. Jung, but he felt it
was unimportant. "The Rev. Dr. Jung," as he called the distinguished
psychologist, seemed to him less a re to be reckoned with than
Dr. Freud, whom he did not readily accept either, but whose pioneering
genius he nevertheless admired.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Man's history, with its dreams, legends, myths, was the aim of the
Joycean vision. Thus his language left the rules of logic to one side,
although he always followed the conscious recorder. The usual meaning of
words was destroyed by this revolutionary procedure. He was interested
in a vast verbal metamorphosis, for his own construction of the history
of mankind, with its repetitive cyclical return to eternal events, was
being created in the panorama of the unconscious life. All linguistic
borders had to be crossed in this progress towards a new universe. His
new language must express night and sleep. Compared with this colossal
attempt, the experiment of the Surrealists, who were also interested
in digging into the nocturnal life, remains, to my mind, abortive. In
this connection, Joyce was never interested in automatic writing. He was
the rediscoverer of the great myths, and it was in a state of intense
consciousness that he welded them "in the smithy of his soul."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During walks in Paris, we often talked about dreams. Sometimes I related
to him my own dreams which, during the pre-war years, began to take on
a strangely macabre and apocalyptic silhouette. He was always eager to
discuss them, because they interested him as images of the nocturnal
universe, though he was reluctant to attribute any transcendental or
mystic function to them. He himself, he said, dreamed relatively little,
but when he did his dreams were usually related to ideas, personal or
mythical, with which he was occupied in his waking hours. He was very much
attracted by Dunne's theory of serialism, and I read to him the author's
brilliant <I>An Experiment with Time</I> which Joyce regarded highly. He
told me one of his own dreams, in connection with which subsequent events
seemed to confirm Dunne's serialistic conceptions. Joyce said he was
walking through a big city and met three men who called themselves Minos,
Eaque and Rhadamante. They suddenly stopped their conversation with him
and became threatening. He had to run to escape from their screams of
obloquy. Three weeks later I noticed a feature story in <I>Paris-Soir</I>
to the effect that the police were looking for a crank who was sending
explosives through the mail. This fanatic signed himself: Minos, Eaque,
Rhadamante, the judges of Hell. One of Joyce's less complicated dreams,
however, caused considerable chuckling each time he thought of it. This
was a dream the climax of which was a vision of the titanic re of
Molly Bloom, seated on the side of a high hill. "As for you, James Joyce,
I've had enough of you," she shouted. His reply he never remembered.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
His excellent knowledge of French, German, Greek and Italian stood him
in good stead, and he was constantly adding to his stock of linguistic
information by studying Hebrew, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Finnish and
other tongues. At the basis of his vocabulary was also an immense command
of Anglo-Irish words that only seem like neologisms to us today, because
they have for the most part become obsolete. His revival of these words
will one day interest philologists.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Language to him was a social as well as a subjective process. He was
interested in the experiments of the French Jesuit, Jousse, and the
English philologist, Sir Paget, and <I>Finnegans Wake</I> is full of
applications of their gesture theory. He spoke however with a certain
derision of such auxiliary languages as Esperanto and Ido, which seemed
to him to be without possibilities of any kind.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During those Zurich days I lived in the Pfauenstra&szlig;e, and Joyce
often walked up the hill to bring new additions to the "Mime," as he
called it now. Despite his intense anxieties, he remained absorbed in
his book.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
His daughter was now under observation in a hospital near Zurich and
he went frequently to visit her. He hoped against hope that it would be
possible to heal his child. He even went so far as to consult Dr. Jung,
although he had little confidence in the result.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During this period he became increasingly absorbed by the problem of
imaginative creation. He read Coleridge again, and discussed with me
the romantic poet's distinction between imagination and fancy. His
approach was quite humble and he even asked himself if he really
possessed imagination. He read <I>Wuthering Heights.</I> "That woman had
imagination," he said. "Kipling had it too, and certainly Yeats." In fact
his admiration for the Irish poet was boundless. A recent commentator,
asserting that Joyce lacked reverence for the logos in poetry, inferred
that he had little regard for Yeats. I can testify that this was not
true. Joyce often recited Yeats's poems to us from memory. "No Surrealist
poet can ever equal this for imagination," he said. Once when Yeats spoke
over the radio, he telephoned us hastily to come and listen with him. I
read "The Vision" out loud to him, and he was deeply absorbed by the
colossal conception, only regretting that "Yeats did not pull all this
into purely creative work." He was thrilled to discover that the hero of
<I>Finnegans Wake</I> was described, both physically and psychically, as
one of the human types Yeats presents in the "Vision." When Yeats died
he sent a wreath to his grave at Antibes, and his emotion, on learning of
his death, was very genuine. He always denied, almost vehemently, that he
had said to Yeats in Dublin that he was too old to be influenced by him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A favorite diversion during this time was at the afternoon movie. He
preferred English and French films to American, and was a keen judge
of their aesthetic merit. He seemed to have very little sympathy with
the problems of either North or South America, and judged the two
continents entirely on the basis of their alleged dearth of aesthetic
vision. He disliked all manifestations of American humor in the film,
his particular <I>b&ecirc;tes noires</I> being Charlie Chaplin and a
comedian named Schnozzle.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We always depended on his remarkable judgment whenever we wanted to see
a play in Paris, nor were we ever disappointed. The many plays we saw
together and which he usually chose from a plethora of other, better
"ballyhooed" ones, were nearly always striking and entertaining. I
remember my great aesthetic pleasure when he and I went to see the Habima
players in a play done in the Hebrew language, "Rachel." He had a fine
flair for little, out-of-the-way theaters, or for dusty, old plays,
especially at the Od&eacute;on Theater, where we saw plays by Scribe,
whom he liked. Naturally, too, he never missed an Ibsen revival.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There was always an atmosphere of <I>f&ecirc;te</I> when Joyce went to
the theater. Afterwards--since he was in the habit of dining late--we
usually forgathered at Fouquet's, in the Champs-Elys&eacute;es, or Chez
Francis, and he quaffed his first glass of <I>Champagne nature</I> with a
gesture that was most diverting to watch. He usually ate little, but the
carafe was never allowed to remain empty on the table until Mrs. Joyce
interposed the final veto. He and I developed a trick we used in order to
outwit the watchful eye of the spouses, and which I still use when that
last drink seems desirable, and for this reason I shall not reveal it now.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Joyce's love of opera, especially Italian opera, and occasionally
Wagner, has been noted by all who have ever written about him. Among
opera singers he preferred the voice of his great friend John Sullivan,
whom he considered to be the greatest tenor since Caruso. He also admired
Lawrence Tibbett, the American baritone, and one or two Russian bassos
whose voices he described as "coal-mines." He had a hearty dislike for
the music of Stravinsky and of most of his contemporaries, in fact. He
liked to listen to piano music, especially Chopin.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I remember reading to him a German translation from a speech by
Radek in which the Russian attacked <I>Ulysses</I> at the Congress
of Kharkov as being the work of a bourgeois writer who lacked social
consciousness. "They may say what they want," said Joyce, "but the
fact is that all the characters in my books belong to the lower middle
classes, and even the working class; and they are all quite poor." I
know he was a convinced antifascist. He never returned to Italy under
Mussolini, and only passed through Nazi German on his way to Hamburg,
when he wanted to realize his life-long dream of seeing Copenhagen.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are many human, all too human anecdotes about Joyce during those
last years before the war that will bear recalling.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One sultry evening in July, Sylvia Beach organized a reading by Ernest
Hemingway and Stephen Spender at the Shakespeare Bookshop, in the rue de
l'Od&eacute;on. Joyce, who liked Hemingway, decided to attend and asked
me to accompany him. A good many American, English and French writers
were already present when we arrived, rather late, in the midst of
Hemingway's reading. Hemingway was seated at a small table with beside
him a large mug of beer, from which he took an occasional sip. He was
reading a fragment from the manuscript of his latest book, on Spain. He
interrupted his reading for a moment while we were being seated, then
took up again where he had left off.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the reading progressed, Joyce began to yawn. In fact, he did it
so frankly that everyone noticed it. However, Hemingway soon came
to a pause and Stephen Spender read one of his poems of the Spanish
revolution. Once more Hemingway took the floor. After a few sentences,
Joyce pulled my sleeve: "Let's go . . . " I tried to persuade him to stay
a little longer, but he would have none of it. To my great embarrassment
he rose, and after stumbling over our neighbors' feet we left.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Joyce was undoubtedly allergic to any suggestion of politics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Joyce had a keen sense of liturgy and was interested in the doctrine
and rituals of all religions and confessions, both Roman and Orthodox
Catholicism, Protestantism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism--all were
grist to his writer's mill.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
His relation to the Roman Catholic Church of his Dublin youth, although
combative, was also one of analytical curiosity. He went to Notre Dame to
hear the Lenten sermons of the famous Jesuit priest, the Rev. P&egrave;re
de la Boullaye de Pinard, and came back with numerous witty commentaries
on the orator's name. He also followed the liturgy of the high feast
days with almost ecclesiastical precision.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He resented intensely the personal attacks by certain Catholic circles
in the United States who assailed him on the ground that his work
represented an apparently heretic attitude. He often pointed out to
me the enormous role of the concept of evil in Catholic theology. The
pascal acolyte does not hesitate to eulogize "the sin of Adam" in a famous
liturgical passage, and St. Augustine himself declared: "<I>Felix culpa! O
fortunatissimum Adamae peccatum.</I>" The obscene distortions of gargoyles
on Gothic cathedrals show the luxuriant imagination of the conformist
architects. The satanic chimeras of the painting of such believers as
Matthias Gr&uuml;newald and Hieronymus Bosch lead us into the abyss of the
grotesque. Joyce, who knew his Fathers of the Church, assumed the right
which the Catholic Church has always given to the artist: to present the
carnal side of man's consciousness with all the mystery of his verbal art.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"And what of the Book of Kells?" he asked. Once he gave me a volume
of reproductions from that rare book of illuminated manuscripts. One
picture in it showed a particularly hideous depiction of the
Christ-child. "Doesn't he look as if he had just robbed the
hen-house?" Joyce asked.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the winter of 1938 someone sent him an issue of the <I>Osservatore
Romano</I>, world-organ of the Vatican, dated October 22, 1937. It
contained a reference to Joyce which delighted him, and he often quoted
it as we sat at Fouquet's one evening. In an essay on modern Irish
literature the pious Vatican essayist had written about Joyce:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And finally James Joyce, of European fame, iconoclast and rebel, who after
having sought to renovate the old naturalism, attempted in <I>Ulysses</I>
to translate plastically the inner reality, and, in <I>Work in</I>
<I>Progress</I>, in an oneiric and linguistic experiment, is seeking to
open up new paths for the expression of human sentiments.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"We roaming Catholics," he used to say to me, whenever he wanted to
introduce a reference to Jesuit theology.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Once an internationally known literary climber telephoned Joyce to ask
for some biographical data to be used on the occasion of an evening
which a group of Paris poets, "Les Amis de 1914," were planning in his
honor. Joyce agreed to receive the lady in question, since she was to make
the introductory speech at the meeting and he felt it was only courteous
to have a brief talk with her beforehand. She arrived, elegantly dressed,
and accompanied by a large dog, which did not make matters easier, since
Joyce had a real aversion to dogs. Remembering vaguely that there was
a certain city in which Joyce was particularly interested, the lady
started out boldly: "When were you last in Edinburgh, Mr. Joyce?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"I never saw Edinburgh in my life," was Joyce's reply, after which he
fell back into his usual silence. A little confused, but undaunted,
the lady then asked permission to photograph him for an article she was
writing for the morning newspaper <I>Le Jour.</I> The photographer was
waiting downstairs, she said, and he could do the job in a trice. In
order to give point to her story, she indicated that she would like to
have her picture taken in conversation with Joyce. She had not reckoned,
however, with the inventiveness or our friend Joyce. Excusing himself
for a moment, he telephoned to Paul L&eacute;on and myself and urged us
to come immediately so that he should not be photographed alone with her.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fortunately, we were both at home and very shortly afterwards, we arrived
at his apartment, almost simultaneously. Joyce introduced us to the lady,
but she was not very cordial and evidently resented the miscarriage
of her carefully-laid plans. The photograph was made, however, with
L&eacute;on on Joyce's side and I on hers. The picture appeared the
following morning in the <I>Jour,</I> spread over four columns, but lo
and behold--both L&eacute;on and I had our heads chopped off by some
artist in the newspaper studio. The lady, whose first name was Daisy,
had won. L&eacute;on and I were highly amused, but Joyce was not pleased.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The following evening he recited a parody he had composed to the tune of
"Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do. . . " I forget the middle lines
but I remember it ended: "And won't we look sweet / Upon the seat / Of
a photograph faked for two. . . "

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The night of the event, the lady read from the French translation of
<I>Ulysses.</I> Joyce, who was seated on the platform, managed somehow
to turn his back on her during the reading. I have often wondered if
the experience gave much real satisfaction to her lion-hunter's heart.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the political clouds gathered on the European horizon, Joyce grew
saddened and lived in increasing isolation. We continued to meet regularly
either at his or our house, or else for dinner at Fouquet's. The years
brought great change in him, however: his hair became quite grey, and
his old self-assurance seemed shaken. I felt he was more deeply human
than formerly, more gentle, too. He even showed a certain curiosity about
America, although he still adhered to his dogma that the great creative



myths of humanity stemmed from Europe. I told him that I intended
to bring out one more number of <I>transition</I> before relinquishing
it, and he approved. "I'll have something for you," he said.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The terrible malady that had befallen his daughter was an ever-present
heartbreak and even his iron will was unable to discover the remedy that
might cure her. Paul L&eacute;on, his old and trusted friend, was still
helping him, but most of the friends of former, happier days had left
France and there was a deepening silence about him. Malevolent critics
wrote sneeringly of the "clique around Joyce," which he ironically
transformed into the "joyous click." There was little that was joyous
about it, however, and we were hardly a "click." I myself was passionately
interested in "Work in Progress" and I was proud of the fact that Joyce
had confidence in me for the publication of his last great work. Yet
I almost dreaded the moment when he said in his casual, yet awfully
deliberate manner: "I'll have something for you. When will you publish
again?" For I knew it meant working with him night and day, it meant
being at his beck and call for several months, until the number finally
appeared.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Joyce did not explain. He wanted you to guess, to show aptitude at
approximations, to have sudden intuitions. The "click" around him carried
on arduously, and in fact we were like so many schoolboys working under
the ever so slightly despotic whip of our Jesuitical <I>magister</I>. For
that he was, indeed. It was not <I>ad majorem Dei gloriam</I>, but <I>ad
majorem Jacobi gloriam</I>, and his cerebral intensity was over us like
a rattan cane. His occasional impatience with the obtuseness of certain
of the "students" was such that I almost anticipated chastisement for
the offender. Yet we all felt affection for him, a kind of brotherly
sense of protection which increased with his isolation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I should like to say here a few words for those friendly followers of
Joyce's work who did not fall by the wayside, as the years went on and
the proletarian <I>litt&eacute;rateurs</I> with left-wing megalomania
plodded through their inchoate program. I have in mind the men who wrote
for the new Joyce at a time when few were interested in his neologistic
innovations, when the majority of American and British writers felt
they would have nothing to do with such novelties. They, after all,
were only interested in the norm. They were interested in traditional
values, in dramatic chronology, in fiction and poetry as handed down by
their predecessors. They could not understand that a man who had written
<I>Ulysses</I> and the <I>Portrait</I> might have continued in that vein,
yet had decided heroically to forego sure success in order to engage in
a long calvary of creation. Nor did the professional critics distinguish
themselves by great foresight in the years between 1927 and 1938. With
a few exceptions, they waited for a signal from above. They waited for
the moment when the literary stage was set and ready, before taking the
bold step.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The men who set this stage were Joyce's friends, and some of them were
my friends. We all felt that we were badly equipped for the task of
interpreting a work which was not yet complete, and which we had seen
only in disparate sections. We certainly had no conception of the whole
as yet, only anticipatory presentiments of

<B></B>

what it was to be. Elliot
Paul was the first to take the step of explaining what we then considered
to be the "plot" of "Work in Progress," and his essay on that subject in
<I>transition</I> was a milestone. There was also Stuart Gilbert who was
ceaselessly at work deciphering the hermetic book. There were others,
too, brilliant analysts all: Harry Levin, William Troy, Edmund Wilson,
Alfred Kazin, Padraic Colum, Samuel Beckett.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Then there was Frank Budgen, the British writer and painter, who had
been Joyce's friend in Zurich during World War I, and had written an
engaging book on that period, <I>The Making of Ulysses.</I> An essay by
him, which was published in <I>transition</I>, dealt with Joyce's use
of Nordic mythology in "Work in Progress." When Budgen visited Paris we
used to meet at Joyce's flat and then go on caf&eacute;-squatting "Chez
Francis." He talked wittily about the Zurich days--and, incidentally,
was one of the few Anglo-Saxons I ever met who could speak faultless
Zurich dialect.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Once in Zurich, when Joyce and I were walking in comparative silence
through the Bahnhofstra&szlig;e, I heard Joyce mumble Budgen's name. I
remember that he and Budgen had been accustomed to meet at the "Pfauen"
restaurant for nightly dinners and copious quaffs of "Waliser" wine
during World War I when Budgen was employed at the British Consulate in
Zurich. However, I said nothing more and we continued on our way. Suddenly
Joyce turned down a side street called the Uraniastra&szlig;e. It was
dusk and there was a gossamer haze over the town. He stopped in front of
a building, turned to me and said: "There he is." "Who?" "Budgen." I
looked up and saw a number of nude sculptured res gazing down
at us. Joyce explained that Budgen had posed for the Swiss sculptor,
Suter, who had been commissioned by the city for the work. "Where is
he?" I asked. "Labor," said Joyce laconically. Indeed, there stood
the nude re of Budgen on top of the world in all his paradisiacal
glory. "Labor," mused Joyce, "the laziest man I ever knew. . . "

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another friend of Joyce was Samuel Beckett, the Irish poet who came
to Paris to teach as exchange professor at the "Ecole Normale." Joyce
took a great liking to Beckett and through him we became friends. He
was Anglo-Irish and in gesture and spirit resembled Joyce sometimes
to such an extent that we were astonished. He was young man of genuine
talent, very original and creatively alive. Both as a poet and as a prose
writer his personality imposed itself in all of us, and I enjoyed his
brilliant albeit dour mind. He had an extraordinary verbal facility and
inventiveness, and in that respect was like his great countryman, <I>un
beau t&eacute;n&eacute;breux</I>, a celtic visionary who was in love with
France. Unlike Joyce, however, he wanted to simplify the English language
rather than enrich it. For this reason he began to write in French
exclusively shortly before World War II in order to retain simplicity by
writing deliberately [in] a language he did not know as well as his native
tongue. His French writings strike one as <I>d&eacute;pouill&eacute;s</I>
and yet richly suggestive of his island background.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Six months before "Work in Progress" was scheduled to appear in book
form, there was an amusing incident in connection with the title, which
till then was known only to the author and Mrs. Joyce. Joyce had often
challenged his friends to guess it, and he had even made a permanent
offer to pay 1,000 francs in cash to the person



who succeeded. We all
tried, Stuart Gilbert, Herbert Gorman, Samuel Beckett, Paul L&eacute;on,
myself, but we failed miserably. One summer night while dining on the
<I>terrasse</I> of Fouquet's, Joyce repeated his offer. The Riesling was
especially good that night, and we were in fine spirits. Mrs. Joyce began
to sing softly an Irish song about Mr. Flannagan and Mrs. Shannigan. Joyce
looked up startled, urged her to stop. This she did, but when he saw
no harm had been done, he very distinctly, as a singer does it, made
the lip motions which seemed to indicate F and W. Maria's guess was
"Fairy's Wake." Joyce looked astonished and said: "Brava! But something
is missing."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At home we mulled over it for a few days. One morning I knew it was
"Finnegans Wake," although it was only an intuition. That evening I
suddenly threw the words in the air. Joyce blanched. Slowly he set
down his wine-glass: "Ah, Jolas," he said, "you've taken something
from me." When we parted that night he gave me the accolade, danced a
few of his intricate steps, and asked: "How would you like to have the
money?" I replied: "In sous." The following morning, during my absence
from home, Joyce arrived with a bag filled with ten-franc pieces. He
gave them to my daughters with instructions to serve them to me at
lunch with the <I>hors d'oeuvres</I>. So it was "Finnegans Wake." We
were sternly enjoined by Joyce not to reveal the title until he himself
made the official announcement at a birthday dinner given by his son
and daughter-in-law on the following February 2.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the last few years of his life, Joyce circumscribed more and more
his social activities. He was invited out very little--people had
probably grown discouraged--and he rarely accepted the invitations he
received. Thus he came to depend more and more on a few friends. Among
others, I used to take frequent walks with him in the Bois de Boulogne,
or go to a movie with him. On these occasions he was often silent, and
seemed absorbed in his own world of meditations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He was just the opposite, in fact, of the gregarious Gertrude Stein, whom
he had never met in all the many years that they lived simultaneously
in Paris. Shortly before the war, however, the American sculptor Jo
Davidson, who was a good friend of both writers, decided to break the ice
and invite them together to his studio. They were introduced, and shook
hands. But that was all. Nor did Joyce ever meet Picasso, although I once
saw them in the same restaurant. We were having a drink "Chez Francis"
after a concert. Picasso was seated at a nearby table, in conversation
with Andr&eacute; Breton, Jacques Pr&eacute;vert and other Surrealist
writers and artists. Informed of their presence, Joyce did not look up,
although I noticed that the Picasso group seemed curious about him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Joyce's devotion to his sick daughter knew no bounds. She was by now
interned in a <I>maison de sant&eacute;</I> near Paris, and he used to
spend hours trying to amuse her, talking to her about the past, singing
for her, or listening to her verbal fantasies with absolute patience. But
sometimes his own nerves seemed to crack under the strain, and once I
saw him weep bitterly.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Why should this thing have happened to us?" he said. "We were
so happy." Then, wanly: "And I am supposed to be writing a funny
book. . . "

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although often despairing, he continued to read proof on <I>Finnegans
Wake</I>. In addition to Mrs. Joyce, who literally never left him, Giorgio
and Helen Joyce, Lucie and Paul L&eacute;on, Sam Beckett, Moune and
Stuart Gilbert, Maria and I were his most constant companions. Usually
one or the other of us went out with him each evening, and when he
started brooding we tried to cheer him up.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One evening I received a telephone call from an unknown man who, it
developed, was the proprietor of a little <I>bistro</I> in the rue
de Grenelle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Monsieur Jouasse," he said, "wants you to come down as soon as you
can. The address is. . . "

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I found Joyce standing in front of a bar, with a glass of pernod
before him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Bon soir," I said, and ordered a pernod.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Oh, there you are," he said, and fell into silence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After a while he asked in a low whisper:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Do you know the poet Mangan?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And he began to recite "Dark Rosaleen" in his musical Dublin speech. One
verse in particular struck me:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
I could scale the blue air,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I could plough the high hills,
<BR>
O, I could kneel all night in prayer,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To heal your many ills!
<BR>
And one beamy smile from you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would float like light between

My toils and me, my own, my true,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My Dark Rosaleen!
<BR>

Would give me life and soul anew,
<BR>
A second life, a soul anew,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My Dark Rosaleen!
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The months passed in great anxiety and Joyce became desirous of seeing
his complex book appear before, as he said, "the storm broke." All his
notes were carefully gone over by L&eacute;on and together they adhered
to a rigid working schedule. Even through its fragmentary publication
in <I>transition,</I> we knew that the work constituted a challenge
to contemporary speculation, as no other work had done for decades. To
be sure, its partial appearance might have militated against immediate
acceptance. On the other hand, public appetite had been whetted through
the exegetical efforts of <I>transition</I> writers, and through the
comments of connoisseurs, particularly in the United States.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We knew that it had been Joyce's ambition to write a book dealing with
the night-mind of man. We had already followed most of the purgatorial,
multiple characters blundering through their larval and anthropological
transmigrations. We had glimpsed the titanic city-mountain synthesis of
the wanderer Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker, and watched his countless human
and pre-human metamorphoses. We had followed the pan-symbolic pattern in
the creation of Anna Livia Plurabelle, the

<B></B>

river-woman, the <I>magna
mater.</I> Shem and Shaun, the antithetical brothers, sometimes called
Jerry and Kevin; the daughter Isabelle, the washer-woman, the household
slut, the topers and gossips of Chapelizod: all these contemporary and
primitively barbaric evocations were familiar to <I>transition</I>
readers. There were other characters too, most of them minor, but
yet intricately interwoven in the narrative, with whom we were
now acquainted. We knew the contour of the incessant conflict that
takes place on the nocturnal stage; we saw the continuous mutation of
locality, objects, events, languages, characters. Examining with new eyes
Joyce's revolutionary idea of the paragraph, we tried to keep in mind
that the dramatic dynamism of the book was based on Bruno's theory of
knowledge through antinomies, as also on the Vico philosophy of cyclic
recurrence. History, for Joyce, was a nightmare, and he undoubtedly
considered the present epoch to be the last phase of the Vico cycle:
man's fall, followed by chaos and resurrection. Like Goethe's, his was
an Olympian eye. He looked on at the political scene with amusement
and detachment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the war approached, Joyce manifested apparently little political
awareness. I talked with him before and after Munich, but he
remained non-committal. This was, in fact, a bewildering feature of my
relation to him. For I was being gradually drawn into the anti-fascist,
anti-totalitarian struggle, while Joyce, on the contrary, seemed almost
to resent any reference to it. One day he said to me: "What can an
individual do in times like these? I think he can only help personally
those who are threatened." He was assiduous in his efforts to help Jewish
friends escape from the Nazi clutches, and it is a fact that the Austrian
novelist, Hermann Broch, and a number of other Central European friends
were able to escape as a result of his intercessions on their behalf.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Paris was a rapidly changing city. There was constantly increasing
social disturbance, and the resultant political fever all but paralyzed
the functions of the state. The clash between the <I>Croix de Feu,</I>
<I>Action Fran&ccedil;aise</I> and other right-wing fascist groups on
the one hand, and the left-wingers, led by the Communists, on the other,
foreshadowed a cataclysm. One had the sensation that the time had come
for the bursting of the dikes, for all-engulfing floods, for apocalyptic
dementia. Hitler's persecution of racial minorities brought thousands
of refugees to Paris and all the languages of Central Europe could now
be heard on the boulevards. French friends often said: "<I>Pourvu que
&ccedil;a finisse</I>! If only this false peace would end! We would
rather t than wait helplessly."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Joyce gave me the last fragment of "Work in Progress" for inclusion in
the new number of <I>transition</I> I was then preparing. This was the
fragment relating the radio yarn of Butt and Taff, or how Buckley killed
the Russian General. As usual, there were to be many changes before
the final <I>bon &agrave; tirer</I> could be given. Joyce seemed to be
living in the mythical inn of Chapelizod where the twelve uproariously
drunken customers were engaged in recreating the world and ting its
battles--the brother--battles of Shem and Shaun, become Butt and Taff,
and the protean transformations of sin-haunted HCE.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first bound copy of <I>Finnegans Wake</I> reached Paris just in time
for Joyce's birthday, on February 2nd, 1939. It naturally constituted
an added attraction to the anniversary dinner which took place at his
son's home, and to which French, Irish, British and American friends
were invited. Joyce let each guest examine the precious volume, which
T.S. Eliot, on behalf of the London publishing house, had just forwarded.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Viconian cycle was coming to its inevitable climax. Two years later
James Joyce died in Zurich.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature," a brief work
written and published by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in May of 1912,
has acquired extraordinary status among critics of recent years,
increasingly considered one of the pivotal documents in the history
of twentieth-century aesthetics. Issued three years after Marinetti
first launched the movement of Futurism in 1909, it announces, by any
standards, a radical departure from previously accepted norms of literary
discourse. While proclaiming eleven rules that are to govern the new mode
of Futurist writing, the manifesto enjoins the elimination of adjectives,
the abolition of adverbs, and the suppression of all punctuation. It
stipulates that verbs be used only in the infinitive form, a practice that
would effectively sever logical connections between subject and predicate
(e.g., "he to fly"). It insists that the new writing consist primarily of
"images or analogies"; that the "analogies or comparisons be composed
of terms as divergent as possible"; that all connecting conjunctions
such as <I>like</I>, <I>similar to</I>, and so on be abolished; and
even that the first term of any comparison be suppressed in favor of a
continuous image-flow, a language composed of pure metaphors. Finally,
it urges that onomatopoeia acquire an unprecedented prominence, and
it advocates a dynamic typography modeled on the most recent graphic
practices. The writer, Marinetti summarizes, should "destroy syntax
and scatter one's nouns at random as they are born."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The
result will be "words-in-freedom" (<I>le parole in libert&agrave;</I>),
a new expressive language that will finally be commensurate with what
Marinetti terms the "wireless" or "radio imagination" of advancing

<B></B>

modernity, an idiom synchronized to the cutting-edge technologies
of the day--the telephones, radios, phonographs, airplanes, cinemas,
and mass-circulation newspapers which are inundating the new century.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Daring and deliberately provocative, the program of the "Technical
Manifesto," for one critic, "stands behind or anticipates virtually ever
<I>ism</I>" of the first half of the twentieth century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
It outlines, one art historian has stated, nothing less than "a new
concept of the . . . work of art as an ideal synthesis . . . in which
the practice of collage play[s] a dominant role."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 More
simply, another scholar writes, it announces, "although Marinetti
never uses the word, <I>collage</I>" (<I>FM</I>, 58). Here, in short,
is the birth-scene of aesthetic modernism, the initial formulation of
principles widely held to stand at the foundation of twentieth-century
experimentalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Moreover, the "Technical Manifesto"
happens to be published at exactly the moment when Picasso is creating
the famous <I>Still Life with Chair-Caning</I> (May 1912), and several
months prior to the making of Braque's first <I>papier coll&eacute;</I>
that September, <I>Fruitdish and Glass</I>, the two works traditionally
thought to point ahead to the great achievements of collage in the later
cubism to follow.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 As prescient as it is provocative, the
"Technical Manifesto" is a path-breaking work that suggests voyages of
artistic discovery whose endpoints have not yet been reached.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although critics have rarely agreed upon a precise definition of collage,
a rough consensus has nevertheless emerged about some of its essential
traits in both literature and the visual arts. In textual collage, David
Antin tells us, the "logical relations between word groups" give way to
relations of equivalence, similarity, and identity, just as in visual
collage a single coherent picture gives way to relations of juxtaposition
and difference.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 In both, writes Marjorie Perloff, "hierarchy
gives way to parataxis" and "there is no longer a central ordering
system" (<I>FM</I>, 75). Collage, Rosalind Krauss urges, enjoins "a
systematic exploration of the conditions of representability entailed
by the sign," a procedure in which presence is replaced by discourse,
a "discourse founded on a buried origin."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Such remarks
implicitly commend collage as an oppositional practice, a process
of "systematic exploration" and "radical questioning" (<I>FM</I>,
75) which undermines received assumptions about the foundations of
representation and thereby works "to break down existing economic and
political structures and to transcend nationalist barriers" (<I>FM</I>,
xviii). Yet these increasingly common observations may obscure as
much as they reveal, slighting other dimensions of collage--or at least
Marinetti's version of it in the "words-in-freedom" endeavor--that cannot
be easily assimilated to a straightforwardly emancipatory project, but
that harbor something more conflicted and compulsive, something more
disturbed and disturbing. That haunted something, I shall argue, has
much to do with the way that Marinetti's project concerns the formation
of new subjectivities at the intersection of technology, language, and
the body--at once textual, corporal, and social--in which the writing of
modernity might be transcribed. Mapping that intersection more clearly,
I shall also suggest, can help us take a different look at the much
discussed question of Futurism and Fascism, a politicized aesthetics
and an aestheticized politics.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A cursory glance at Marinetti's prescriptions for the new
"words-in-freedom" suffices to suggest how much his project is indebted
to the practice of automatic writing, writing which, to adopt for
the moment the synoptic description of Richard Ellmann, "has many of
the characteristics of dreams, being full of images, fragmentary, run
together, by turns coherent and incoherent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The affiliation
of Marinetti's project with automatic writing is thematized in the
manifesto's opening vignette, the short narrative that precedes the more
famous rules and prescriptions. The vignette, we recall, depicts the
narrator/speaker as he sits astride the fuel tank of a biplane which
is soaring over the city of Milan. As he glances at the urban panorama
below, he declares his ambition to destroy "the Latin period," a type of
sentence he then characterizes with metaphors of the body: the classical
period has "a head, a stomach, two legs and two flat feet, but," he
adds proleptically, "it will never have two wings" (<I>LMM</I>, 92;
<I>TIF2</I>, 46).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Quite suddenly, however, the narrative
changes direction. The speaker abruptly disclaims his own authority and
ascribes his statements to another source. "This is what the swirling
propeller told me as I was speeding along at two hundred meters above the
smokestacks of Milan. And the propeller added . . ." (<I>LMM</I>, 92;
<I>TIF2</I>, 46). Then follows the manifesto proper, with its familiar
list of instructions and interdictions. Yet the narrative vignette merits
further attention: for while it plainly alludes to the familiar trope of
the poet taking dictation from the muses, a trope which has been updated
to portray the poet/aviator receiving his text from the airplane, it just
as plainly rehearses what might be termed the primal scene of automatic
writing, the scenario of taking dictation at a spiritualist seance, a
scenario which has also been updated to give the role of "dead spirit" to
the "swirling propeller" of modern technology and the role of "medium"
to the speaker who vanishes in a machinic trance. Albeit briefly, the
narrative vignette sketches a complex of critical metaphors that inform
"The Technical Manifesto" and recur throughout Marinetti's early writings,
a complex that involves mediums and automatic writing, analogies between
the body and language, and, as we shall see, a metaphorics of shock,
trauma, and pathology--a complex that Marinetti mobilizes in the service
of an anxious engagement with questions about identity and authority,
the self and technology, and the possibilities of representation under
the regime of modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti, of course, was not the only author to be intrigued with
automatic writing at the beginning of the twentieth century. Automatic
writing was studied or practiced by authors as different as Yeats,
Gertrude Stein, and the Surrealists, and its appeal to writers seemingly
so diverse from one another may owe much to its hybrid origins and early
evolution. In early 1848 Margaret and Kate Fox of Rochester, New York,
announced that they were conversing with spirits from the afterlife by
a system of signs that consisted of rapping noises. To answer "no" or
"yes" to their questions, a spirit would respectively rap once or twice;
to respond to more complex enquiries, the spirit would allegedly rap
at the appropriate moment as the sisters called out the letters of the
alphabet. A few months later the Fox sisters acquired two accessories to
their supernatural talents: one was a press agent and business manager
named Eliab W. Capron; the other, a capacity to turn specters into
public spectacles through

<B></B>

their discovery that spirits could also
relocate furniture, levitating tables and similar objects with ease. Their
first series of public exhibitions (admission, 25 cents) was staged in
Rochester in November, 1849. Capron, whose introductory lecture preceded
the demonstrations, situated the "manifestations" at the conjuncture
of two discursive traditions. One was scientific: the communications
were like "'telegraphic dispatches' from the spirit land," while the new
mode of communication was comparable to "the substantial discoveries and
inventions" of "Galileo, Newton and Fulton." The other was the heritage
of the marvelous: the new communications were "wonders," a term that
evoked Biblical accounts of miraculous events and a broader tradition of
interest in the marvelous.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 His account of the exhibitions
was printed two weeks later in the <I>New York Daily Tribune</I>, then
reprinted a week later in its national edition, <I>The New York Weekly
Tribune</I>, both edited by the famous Horace Greeley. Six weeks after
that, in January 1850, Capron published a small book on the Fox sisters,
and it too was favorably and prominently reviewed in both editions of
the <I>Tribune</I>. Spiritualism's rise to national prominence and rapid
diffusion were inseparable from modern communications media, so much so
that the term itself, "medium," which was ultimately assigned to the role
played by the Fox sisters, was typically used at the time to characterize
the modern newspaper.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Four months later the Fox sisters set
out on their first tour, stopping in Albany, Troy, and then New York City,
where they became an object of ceaseless coverage by the contemporary
press.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 To our own age of copy-cat murders, the result may
seem to have been predictable: "The phenomenon," one contemporary noted,
"began, as it were, to propagate itself, and to be witnessed in other
families."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Two years later witnessed the first American
spiritualists, Mrs. Hayden and Mrs. Roberts, who went to England, and
soon there were manifestations of the new movement reported in Germany and
France, with seances held in Strasbourg, Bourges, and Paris.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Historians have typically viewed the rise of spiritualism as a response
to the increasing secularization of Euro-American culture, while American
historians, in particular, have accounted for the Fox sisters and their
success by citing the earlier religious history of upstate New York,
grouping it with the Mormon revelations of Joseph Smith, the region's
strong strain of Shakerism, or its recent experience of Millerism. But
closer focus on the city of Rochester may be more revealing. For during
the period 1846 to 1848, the city's leading citizens, galvanized by the
visionary dreams of their former postmaster and newspaper editor, Henry
O'Reilly, were pouring their capital into a risky venture that planned
to capture the westward corridors deemed vital to the fate of a novel
communications technology to which they had also purchased the rights,
the telegraph. In 1855, after crushing or buying out all their rivals,
they would reorganize under the name of Western Union.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
(Their counterparts on the Atlantic seabord were centered in New York
and created the firm that became AT&amp;T. "In New York. . . all the
takers were newspaper proprietors. The most substantial sum apparently
came from Horacy Greeley, a warm supporter of the invention from its
infancy.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Automatic writing, from its inception, was a mimetic counter-language,
a way in which people restaged new forms of subjctivity increasingly
shaped by contemporary changes in communications and transcription
technologies. Appropriately, the first spiritualist newspaper would be
titled <I>The Spiritual Telegraph</I>. The link between telegraphy and
spiritualism survived even the long journey to Europe; as Allan Kardec,
the major theorist of French <I>spiritisme</I> would write in 1857:

The technology of automatic writing underwent a rapid evolution already
in the early decades of spiritualism. At first the primitive rapping
procedures were supplanted by others associated with table-moving or
levitation, as seance participants would attach a pencil or crayon to
a table's leg, then place a sheet of paper beneath it and wait for the
desired message to appear. Still a rather clumsy procedure, it too was
rapidly supplanted by other practices. On the one hand, there appeared a
series of machines, as if to embody in material terms the linkage between
automatic writing and contemporary technology, machines which ranged from
relatively simple devices (<A HREF="5.2rainey_1.html"> 1</A>)
that translated table movements into
the letters of the alphabet to more elaborate contrivances (<A
HREF="5.2rainey_2.html"> 2</A>)  that performed the same
task but whose design more fully bespoke
the contemporary fascination with the marvels of engineering. Some bore
a suspicious resemblance to contemporary telegraphs, such as this one

<B></B>

(<A HREF="5.2rainey_3.html"> 3</A>) used by Western Union from
1848 through 1855. On the other
hand, practical issues of transportability led to the creation of devices
much simpler and more amenable to mass production, such as the planchette
(<A HREF="5.2rainey_4.html"> 4</A>), which first appeared in
France around 1853. It consisted of a
small, triangular piece of wood (in short, a miniaturized table) that was
supported by two rolling casters and a pencil, a structure that let it
move under the slightest impulse from seance participants.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
(Much later, in 1898, an ambitious businessman named William Fuld in the
U.S. would design a variant of it called "OUIJA, the MYSTIFYING ORACLE,"
a product which was soon launched to great success and still turns up at
adolescent slumber parties, where it is consulted to predict romantic
and marital destinies and similarly important affairs.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
Most mediums, however, dispensed with the use of machines and wrote
directly on paper; after all, as Kardec had said, they themselves were
machines, and it was also more practical and swifter. Historians have
no doubt been right in noting that spiritualism offered its followers
the promise of consolation and revelation from another world, a promise
that had much to do with its diffusion among a substantial public; but
it may be equally true that its success had much to do not with the
content of spiritualist messages, but with the tacit allure of their
form, their mode of transmission, the way in which they were rendered
in idioms that were derived not

<B></B>

from an other world, but from this
one--idioms that were uttered in the silent syntax of advancing capital,
murmured in the rhythms of its relentless machines.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Automatic writing might have remained only a footnote in the history of
spiritualism had it not been integrated into contemporary discussions
about the mind and human identity, discussions that were laying
the foundations for the so-called modern "dynamic" psychologies
taking shape between 1875 and 1900. The medical history behind these
debates presents a rich and complicated interaction between an array of
competing practices and overlapping theories. While much is inevitably
lost in the cursory summary that follows, four related developments
were crucial. A useful starting point might be the famous case, first
publicized in 1876, of F&eacute;lida X, a woman who would spontaneously
lapse into a cataleptic state in which she exhibited a curious array
of symptoms, chiefly anesthesia or hyperesthesia and enigmatic pains
that had no discernible cause. F&eacute;lida was found to have two
distinct and alternating personalities, a condition that was soon
characterized with the term <I>d&eacute;doublement</I>, doubling of the
personality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 (In more modern parlance, she is the first
example of multiple personality.) As it happened, F&eacute;lida was
"discovered" just when there was a revival of scientific interest in
a second issue, hypnosis and the nature of hypnotic states, and it was
not long before it was urged that "magnetic" or "induced somnambulism"
(the state of hypnosis) presented important analogies with the "natural"
or "spontaneous somnambulism" into which F&eacute;lida lapsed, posing
similar questions about the nature of identity, memory, amnesia, and
will.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Contemporaneous with these was a third development,
the enormous wave of scientific and public fascination elicited by
Charcot's famous studies of hysteria; F&eacute;lida, in fact, would have
been classed by her contemporaries as having hysteria, a term that was
expanding to encompass ever more symptoms throughout the period 1850 to
1910.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 And fourth,

<B></B>

there was the notion of trauma, a
term acquiring its characteristically modern sense during exactly this
period. Prior to roughly 1860, trauma had always designated a strictly
physical lesion, an identifiable wound; it was in the later 1860s that
trauma began to take on its modern sense in connection with injury claims
that stemmed from railroad accidents.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 It soon became the term
of choice to designate a cluster of symptoms that evidently indicated
genuine illness yet failed to correspond with discernible injuries or
physical lesions, symptoms that included amnesia and mysterious pains
like those experienced by F&eacute;lida. Trauma, in other words, seemed
to offer suggestive analogies with multiple personality, hypnosis, and
hysteria, whose puzzling etiology remained an open question. Thus,
the same period also witnessed a new taxonomy of hysteria that now
included the category of "traumatic hysteria," a hybrid term suggesting
the multiple analogies that late-nineteenth century psychologists
discerned in an array of disturbing phenomena.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 The outcome
of this vast discussion was the gradual formation of what Ian Hacking
has called "a free-floating sequence of associations"--an overlapping
set of descriptive habits that coalesced in a metaphorics of hysteria,
shock, and trauma.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 The thread that would link these diverse
pathologies to one another would be automatism, a concept elaborated in
conjunction with automatic writing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of all the early psychologists who worked on these questions, none was
more influential than Pierre Janet. Just when researchers were seeking
a paradigm in the sense made famous by Thomas Kuhn, a matrix that could
gather together the multiple debates surrounding hysteria, trauma,
amnesia, and doubling of the personality, Janet provided one with the
notion of automatism, a descriptive concept that he developed through his
clinical experience with automatic writing. In a celebrated essay that he
published in 1886 ("Unconscious Actions and the Doubling of Personality
During Hypnosis") Janet reported his experiments with Lucie.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
His starting point had been an observation already noted in previous
studies of hypnotism: when in a posthypnotic state, Lucie would execute
commands that he had given her while hypnotized. But Janet pushed his
enquiries further. He began to give Lucie tasks that required her to
execute complex mathematical calculations, actions that demanded not just
rote or passive obedience, but forms of intelligent reflection. When
these proved successful, he instructed Lucie to write letters, a task
that she also performed with ease, still without knowing that she had
done so. Finally, he began to ask Lucie to answer in writing, while in
her waking state, questions that had been posed to her under hypnosis,
questions that concerned the traumatic events whose repressed memory
was the source of her hysterical fits. When he showed a sample of her
script to a colleague, he was surprised to learn that it resembled that
of spiritualist mediums. Janet, in short, had discovered an experimental
counterpart to the automatic writing of the spiritualists, writing
governed by a mysterious and hidden self that existed independently
of normal consciousness, a "second state" as Jane would term it, that
was produced "by a certain doubling [<I>d&eacute;doublement</I>] of
consciousness." The effect of this discovery was to turn automatic
writing into the thread connecting multiple personality,

<B></B>

hysteria,
dissociation, somnambulism and hypnosis, shock and trauma. Three years
later Janet published <I>L'Automatisme psychologique</I> , a work
that elaborated the concept of automatism and endowed the practice
of automatic writing with new importance for discussion about the
nature of consciousness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Devoting an entire chapter to
spiritualism, Janet concluded that mediums were "simply hysterics," and
"almost always" what he termed "<I>n&eacute;vropathes</I>" (suffering
from a neuropathological condition) (<I>Ap</I>, 404). The moment when
the medium was possessed represented an hysterical convulsion, and at
the core of the seance was "a violent nervous crisis" ("<I>une violent
crise de nerfs,</I>" <I>Ap</I>, 405). The medium's ability derived from
"a morbid state analogous to one that generated hysteria or insanity"
(<I>Ap</I>, 406); and at great length he detailed "more precise analogies
between the states of mediumism and hypnotism" (<I>Ap</I>, 406). Janet,
in short, had established a resonant chain of analogies that centered
on the notion of automatism, strands of repressed memory and identity
formed in response to traumatic experience and functioning like machines,
independent of consciousness, the self, or the ego.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is not the time or place to detail Janet's enormous influence on his
contemporaries, among others William James and Morton Prince in Boston,
W. F. H. Meyer and the Society for Psychical Research in Cambridge
and London, or the early Freud in Vienna, who respectfully cites Janet
seven times in his <I>Studies on Hysteria</I> . Janet's prestige
remained undiminished until well into the mid-1920s in France and Italy,
where Freudian psychoanalysis was initially greeted with significant
skepticism, some of it sparked by Janet himself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Likewise,
one can only allude to Marinetti's extensive engagement with French
culture--his education at a French <I>coll&egrave;ge</I> in Alexandria,
his baccalaur&eacute;at in Paris, his residence in the city (alternating
with spells in Milan) from 1895 to 1909--and the likelihood that he had
read Janet's most important and widely publicized work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Yet
the particulars of Marinetti's engagement with Janet's work may matter
less than a broader phenomenon, his sharing the implicit notions formed
by a cultural metaphorics that articulated urgent themes of scientific
and educated public culture. Marinetti's ambivalent achievement was
to take that cultural metaphorics and turn it into the foundation of
an aesthetics of shock and trauma, an achievement that he transmitted
to the entire historical avant-garde.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Doing so, Marinetti
constructs an imaginary and discursive space in which Futurism restages
the critical themes of automatic writing and the problematics of modern
subjectivity. It is not an accident, in other words, that the famous
"Foundation and Manifesto of Futurism" begins with a gripping narrative
vignette that recounts the domestic version of technological mishap,
an accident, the overturning of a car which proves to be the traumatic
birth-scene of the Futurist aesthetic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Nor is it an accident
that the sequel to that incident, in the long run, turns out to be the
repetitive publication of manifesto after manifesto which announces yet
another form of Futurist novelty, a mode of production that might almost
have been designed to exemplify Freud's famous thesis in <I>Beyond the
Pleasure Principle</I>, his attempt to reconsider the notion of trauma in
the wake of World War I, that the chief

<B></B>

characteristic of traumatic
neurosis is a type of repetition compulsion, one which indexes a failure
of symbolization--an incapacity to render unbearable experience into the
symbolic language of dreams or mentation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Over and over, with
hypnotic uniformity, the Futurists issue manifesto after manifesto, each
charged with recreating for reader and writer the traumatic experience of
shock. By a strategy of mimetic assimilation, Futurism becomes a trauma
machine. Which brings us back to the "Technical Manifesto," a work in
which the reproduction of shock is now codified in the minute workings
of syntax.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti's intention, as he candidly avers, is to "destroy the 'I'
or 'ego'" of bourgeois subjectivity (<I>LMM</I>, 95; <I>Tif2</I>,
50), and consequently much of his attention goes to the noun, the
syntactical unit that occupies the position of grammatical (and
logical) subject. So much so that the manifesto offers three different
precepts for the noun, each displacing the previous one and further
dissolving the subject. Initially the manifesto enjoins a syntactic
<I>d&eacute;doublement</I>: "every noun must have its double, that is to
say, must be followed immediately by another noun to which it is related
by analogy" (<I>LMM</I>, 92; <I>Tif2</I>, 47), a codification of the
steps whereby traumatic experience was thought to initiate a process of
psychological <I>d&eacute;doublement</I>, the creation of a "second self"
that exists independently of the subject or his will. Yet this initial
formulation proves inadequate, insofar as it hints at a survival of the
original self (the first term or noun) and still adumbrates a principle
of relatedness (analogy) that gainsays the notion of dissociation. Whence
it is supplanted by a second injunction to "deliberately confound the
object with the image that it evokes" (<I>LMM</I>, 92; <I>Tif2</I>,
47), a precept that more effectively dissolves the boundary between the
primary noun/self and the secondary one. Still, this injunction also
hints at a residual survival of the original term, however attenuated,
and therefore it too is supplanted by a more astringent imperative, "to
suppress all the first terms of our analogies and render no more than an
uninterrupted sequence of second terms" (<I>LMM</I>, 97; <I>Tif2</I>,
53). Now the original noun/self is wholly effaced by the creation of a
second self, a haunting specter that uniformly signifies the absence of
its original referent, its self.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though much briefer, the propeller's treatment of the verb turns around
the same thematics of self and syntax. "The verb should be used in the
infinitive form, because the infinitive adapts itself elastically to
the noun and doesn't subject it to the ego of the writer who observes
or imagines" (<I>LMM</I>, 92; <I>Tif2</I>, 47). Here again the object
of suspicion is reflective consciousness and the distance it marks
between the subject and reality, whether external (observed) or internal
(imagined). The infinitive, in this account, is transformed into a variant
of speed and velocity, that quintessential Futurist re for whatever
most swiftly traverses the gap between reality and the self--or more
accurately, that new and dissociated self which has been engendered by
traumatic experience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Perhaps the most notorious injunctions of the "Manifesto" concern the use
of onomatopoeia, a practice more fully defended in a contemporary work by
Marinetti, "Geometric and Mechanical Splendor and Numerical Sensibility,"
where he thematizes the link between onomatopoeia and violence:

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Our growing love for matter, our will to penetrate it and know its
vibrations, the physical sympathy that links us to motors, push us to the
<I>use of onomatopoeia</I>. Noise, after all, is the result of solids,
liquids, or gases that are in rapid motion and are either in friction with
one another or crashing against each other. Onomatopoeia, which reproduces
noise, is necessarily one of the most dynamic elements of poetry. As
such it can substitute for the verb in the infinitive form, especially
when one onomatopoeia is opposed to two or more others. [<I>LMM</I>,
109; <I>Tif2</I>, 105]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Onomatopoeia, in this view, recapitulates the primal syntax of shock,
epitomizing and restaging the violent conflicts held to underlie
all of matter, a universe of atoms whose continuous collisions are
enlisted to lend "natural" sanction to the mechanical jolts of modern
technology. Onomatopoeia, it turns out, can also substitute for the
verb in the infinitive, for both are the syntactic counterparts of
technological violence that is now projected as an attribute of nature,
because both epitomize a common refusal of the human and a regression
to the state of inorganic matter itself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nowhere is the premise that underlies the program of Marinetti more
clearly delineated than in a passage from the manifesto "Destruction
of Syntax--Wireless Imagination--Words in Freedom," in which Marinetti
illustrates how the "words-in-freedom" are meant to function:

All of which brings us back to the narrative vignette at the beginning of
the "Technical Manifesto," with its metaphorical circuits connecting the
"members" of

<B></B>

the sentence with the limbs of the body. In another
essay from this period, "Multiplied Man and the Reign of the Machine"
, Marinetti sketches his vision of the new body to be engendered
by modernity. Man, he urges, will soon "externalize his will and make
it into a huge invisible arm . . . he will be endowed with surprising
organs" such as "a prow" that will emerge directly from the breastbone
and be "the more marked the better an aviator the man of the future
becomes." Indeed, Marinetti declares, "We believe in the possibility of
an incalculable number of human transformations, and without a smile
we declare that wings are asleep in the flesh of man." To explicate
these images, Marinetti turns to the world of automatic writing and
spiritualism: "You can easily understand these seemingly paradoxical
hypotheses by studying the phenomena of externalized will that continually
reveal themselves at spiritualist seances" (<I>LMM</I>, 99; <I>Tif2</I>,
299-300). Marinetti here is referring to a phenomenon that is largely
forgotten today, but was then receiving significant media attention. From
the bodies of some mediums, a strange foamy or filmy substance dubbed
ectoplasm (<A HREF="5.2rainey_5.html"> 5</A>) would seem to
condense and form mysterious limbs:
oddly shaped arms, twisted hands, or distorted heads. The most commonly
reported and widely discussed phenomena were two: hands that would emerge
from the medium's chest or bosom (.
<A HREF="5.2rainey_6.html">6</A>, 
<A HREF="5.2rainey_7.html">7</A>), and a "second head" that
would appear just above or behind the medium's own (<A
HREF="5.2rainey_8.html"> 8</A>). Produced by
the same hysterical mediums

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 136]</B>

once studied by Janet, they are the
somatic counterpart of automatic writing, a histrionic language of the
body and a prototype for the new limbs of "multiplied man," the Futurist
who will at last possess "organs adapted to a world of ceaseless shocks"
(<I>LMM</I>, 99; <I>Tif2</I>, 299); and in turn they are the model for
the members of the new syntactic corpus that Marinetti proposes at the
outset of the "Technical Manifesto," new limbs that will finally be
expressive of "all the brutal sounds, all the expressive screams of the
violent life that surrounds us" (<I>LMM,</I> 97; <I>Tif2,</I> 53). It
is this hysterical and putatively female body-language that serves as
paradigm and metaphor for the program of "words-in-freedom"--an automatic
writing of shock in which the normalized, expressive subject of liberal
humanism is replaced with a collective writing of dissociated selves.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This image of textual production, to be sure, is not without elements of
paradox. When Marinetti praises the medium who generates automatic writing
and ectoplasmic limbs, he does so by urging that the new organs exhibit
the force of her "externalized will"--a paradox, of course, because the
one trait that supposedly distinguished automatic writing was the lack
of volition involved in its production, the absence of will. Elsewhere,
too, Marinetti vacillates on the question of will and its

<B></B>

relation
to the new writing of Futurism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 In a subsequent defense of
the "Technical Manifesto" he describes his own experience when writing
"words-in-freedom," a passage in which the motifs of the dissevered hand
and floating head are mingled with the question of volition:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

It is impossible to identify exactly the moment in which unconscious
inspiration comes to an end and lucid will begins . . . The hand that

frightening lucidity, the unforeseen sentences that issue from the pen.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such a passage holds at bay a set of insoluble tensions which
recur throughout Marinetti's writings, tensions between a state that
simultaneously entails passive enthrallment and a sense of narcisstic
omnipotence. Narcissism, of course, is an especially troubled concept in
the heritage of psychoanalysis, beginning already with Freud's classic
essay "On Narcissism" , which postulates a first and primary
stage in human existence, within the womb and immediately following
birth, a stage in which the psychological distinction between subject
and object has not yet crystallized, in which all needs are gratified
(and hence there are no desires, which are generated by a lack of
gratification)--in short, a condition of pure pleasure, free of all
conflict.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Postulating such a state, however, poses immense
difficulties for the basic foundations of classical drive or instinct
theory as previously constructed by Freud, grounded in the irreducibly
conflictual dynamics of sexual and ego instincts, pleasure principle and
reality principle. Freud's response to that difficulty was to postulate
the existence of narcissistic libido, which would somehow take the
narcissistic ego itself as its object. But this solution may have
been no solution at all: it failed to specify how desire could arise
in a state without want, or how it could become attached to an object
(narcissistic ego) during a stage ostensibly characterized by a lack of
subject/object differentiation, or how the individual would ever evolve
from this monistic state of unity to the instinctual dualism otherwise
presupposed by Freud. "Narcisstic libido," in other words, displaced
but did not resolve the questions posed by the postulate of primary
narcissism. Those questions reappear several years later in Freud's
<I>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</I>. There, as Daniel Greenberg has
argued, they are once again displaced by transforming narcissistic libido
into an instance of a new and mysterious drive which Freud postulates for
the first time, the death instinct, an innate impulse seeking to restore
an earlier state of the unity of all things, specifically, "the unity of
the inorganic" prior to the creation of life, or the organic. Freud, in
effect, "projects the 'unity' of primary narcissism backwards in time, to
the beginning of 'the organic,'" and in doing so he transforms it into
a biological problem, the manifestation of a cosmic force inherent in
every living

<B></B>

thing, rather than a psychological one, and hence he
effectively makes "the question of the specifically human implications
of this 'unity' disappear from view."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 More important, from
my viewpoint, Freud does so in what is ostensibly an attempt to account
for repetition, and in particular the kind of repetition compulsion
that arose in response to shell shock, or traumatic neurosis, the
encounter with technological violence. We need not, in other words,
endorse Freud's untenable hypothesis of a death instinct, nor attempt
to resolve the many dilemmas encapsulated in his notions of primary
narcissism and narcissistic libido, so much as to recognize how those
overlap with the kinds of mental states articulated in Marinetti's
meditations on writing, technology, and the self, states in which
a regressive urge to reestablish an earlier state of unity manifests
itself by a dual impulse to merge and unite with the world of objects
(the life instinct, or sexuality, in Freudian terms) and a concommitant
desire to eliminate the self altogether, to vanish amid the dissevered
ego nuclei that are themselves the outcome of technological violence. On
the one hand, that impulse may owe much to our abiding ambivalence about
modern communications and transcription technologies, which simultaneously
promise narcissistic enhancements of the self and yet achieve them by
processes that seem to efface individual agency. On the other hand, it
also suggests a dynamics of identification and misidentification with
the object world of technology, dynamics which have been probingly
explored, admittedly in less social and more strictly psychological
terms, in Lacan's account of the mirror stage, itself an outgrowth of
his meditations on Freud's essay "On Narcissism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 But how
might those dynamics be restaged, or reenacted, on a wider social scale?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Great War produced a revival of public interest in spiritualism in
every major country of Europe. The appalling quantity of dead combatants
left behind a vast population of mourners seeking consolation and
comfort, the assurance of continuity in the face of irremediable loss. The
situation was no different in Italy, where the number of casualties had
been especially high and certain features of Catholic tradition, with its
cult of saints as intercessors and divine patrons, easily converged with
the basic practices and motifs of spiritualism. Public disappointment
with the meager gains achieved after such sacrifice crystallized in the
myth of the "vittoria mutilata" which won such wide credence (i.e., the
belief that Britain, France, and the U.S. had betrayed the territorial
promises made in 1915 to Italy in order to secure its entrance into
the war) and exacerbated an understandable need to find meaning and
significance in the otherwise senseless slaughter.

Mussolini was already a celebrity by the time of the Great War's end, a
re whose journalism was remarkably popular, and whose public identity
had been solidified by his highly publicized break with the Socialist
Party over the issue of interventionism and the serial publication of
his <I>Diary</I> during the war years. With the meteoric rise of the
Fascist Party in the course of 1920 and 1921, he acquired a status that
can only be defined as stardom--he was often described at this time as
the

<B></B>

<I>stellone</I>, the great star--, status which is distinguished
by the visual representation of personality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Some of the
earliest representations of Mussolini appear in postcards, a genre that is
especially revealing, insofar as they were neither authorized nor produced
by the Party (or later, the government), but were typically produced by
smaller and more local entrepreneurs who appealed to genuinely popular
markets. To that extent they offer a rare and important glimpse into
popular representations and understandings of Mussolini.

Already in 1921, Mussolini's head, dissevered from his body and floating
like a nocturnal apparition, appears in two postcards
(. <A HREF="5.2rainey_9.html">9</A>, 
<A HREF="5.2rainey_0.html">10</A>)
that enjoyed enormous popularity, harbingers of much to come. In 1922,
shortly after Mussolini's seizure of power, another postcard designed
to commemorate the "March on Rome" further elaborates these motifs
(<A HREF="5.2rainey_1.html"> 11</A>). Mussolini's head is now
a celestial apparition and serves
as the composition's focal point. The long lines of marching citizens,
which all converge toward the ghostly head, are ostensibly composed
of party members, but their military helmets also transform them into
reincarnations of the soldiers killed in the war. Mussolini is a tutelary
deity who has redeemed their sacrifice, the spirit of those who have died,
and, simultaneously,

<B></B>

an ectoplasmic projection of whose who are
alive. Balancing the head is a solitary hand raised in Fascist salute,
which, while plainly connected to a young re in the foreground,
might almost be a projection from the body politic of the anonymous files
marching below. Images depicting Mussolini as a spirit who redeems the
sacrifice of the trenches will recur throughout the life of the regime.

The regime itself also made use of such imagery, especially in the
1930s, images which forcefully connect the private body of trauma with
the traumatized subject of the body politic. Consider, for example,
Xanti Schawinsky's vintage poster entitled, <I>1934--XII</I>, a collage
designed for the 1934 referendum 
(<A HREF="5.2rainey_2.html"> 12</A>). A mass of individuals has
been rendered into an abstract grid, on top of which <I>il Duce</I>'s
head is superimposed. "The undifferentiated masses function as the symbol
of the breakdown in traditional markers of identity, such as class,"
Jeffrey Schnapp has astutely noted, while the superimposed head of state
symbolizes the establishment of "a distinctively modern form of identity"
and individuality established in the politics of illusory immediacy. "The
communion of revolutionary masses and the head of state is wholly mediated
by new image and print technologies," mediation that is emphasized by
the prominence granted to the white screening dots that

<B></B>

make up
Mussolini's head, which in turn are mirrored--and in a Lacanian sense--by
the white faces of the heads that make up his body.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The head
of state becomes a spectral and specular projection of collective desire,
one which is, literally and ratively, mass produced. Schawinsky's
constructivist montage, however stylized, furnishes a depiction of a
scene that was symbolically and literally reenacted at party rallies
throughout the nation, as seen, for example, in this photo (<A
HREF="5.2rainey_3.html"> 13</A>)
of a mass rally in a town piazza, where a photo banner of Mussolini's
head drapes the wall of a building and floats above the masses. The vast
rally has been transformed into a collective seance in which the body
politic is haunted by its "hidden self," its ghostly double.

Another contemporary photograph (<A
HREF="5.2rainey_4.html"> 14</A>) records a party induction
ritual in the famous "Casa del Fascio" in Como, transforming it into
a species of living collage as the image triangulates three distinct
elements: first, there is the line that is formed by the heads of the
Party's new recruits, which leads upwards and right to culminate in the
second element, a stylized head of Mussolini depicted on transparent glass

<B></B>

above them, a head that now serves as their spectral emanation and
looks down toward the third element, the marble monolith which symbolizes
the regime. Its transparent text, written by piercing the stone, echoes
the transparent glass depicting Mussolini's head, and it consists of
three nouns, "Order Justice Authority," each a double of the other, with
the whole creating what Marinetti might have called "an uninterrupted
sequence of second terms." As urged in the "Technical Manifesto," the
nouns are not connected by syntax or punctuation. Any identifiable
grammatical subject has now vanished: now the only subject that speaks
these disconnected terms is the state, which has become, in the words
of one Fascist theorist, "a mystical subject that transcends all."

In another contemporary work, a bas-relief (<A
HREF="5.2rainey_5.html"> 15</A>), we see a dissevered
hand that is poised in Fascist salute, one attached to no body, an
ectoplasmic projection of the totalitarian state, which in turn is
counterbalanced by the geometricized fasces that serve as its spectral
double. To the left is a list of three verbs in the infinitive which are
otherwise unconnected by syntax or punctuation, a perfect embodiment of
the precepts outlined in the "Technical Manifesto": TO BELIEVE TO OBEY TO
T. Yet as speakers of Italian will know, the verb in the infinitive
can also be used, as it is here, with the value of an imperative that is
directed to everyone in general

<B></B>

(i.e., BELIEVE OBEY T). It serves
as a "mass imperative," so to speak, a grammatical construction which is
conspicuous because it doesn't specify the subject whom it addresses. In
effect, the individual subject has disappeared within the amorphous mass
body of what was called "the corporative state." This construction, it
should be added, is a specifically modern usage, one without precedent
before the late nineteenth century, and one that comes into prominence
under the Fascist regime.

The new syntax of the regime could also be transformed into new forms
of writing, a somatic script written directly onto the body politic, as
seen here (<A HREF="5.2rainey_6.html"> 16</A>) in a postcard
from 1931 designed by Giulio Parisio to
commemorate Mussolini's visit to Naples that year. Just as the ectoplasmic
head that floats behind the above the medium can be converted into
automatic writing, so here the head of state--and Mussolini's official
title was "capo," or "head" in Italian--is transformed through the medium
of technology into a rewriting of the corporative masses.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The ubiquitous head of the head of state floats everywhere above the
masses in thousands of contemporary postcards and

<B></B>

photographs,
and it is not an anachronistic imposition or a fanciful collocation
to connect these images with spiritualist mysticism. In early 1930, as
part of its attempt to create a new elite that would restore and refresh
the party, the regime established the "School of Fascist Mysticism,"
an entity located in Milan which operated under the direct patronage
of Mussolini's brother, Arnoldo. Intended as a training ground for
future publicists and propagandists, the School sponsored classes and
lectures, a monthly magazine, biweekly radio programs, and occasional
conferences (among the latter, one by Marinetti, 13 April 1939, on "The
Revolutionary Function of Art"). Its most distinguished student, Fernando
Mezzasomma, would become Minister of Popular Culture in the late Republic
of Sal&ograve;. Its task was to articulate the metaphysics of "reality"
defined as "infinitely multiplex, flowing, imponderable . . . in which
we feel . . . vague suggestions of mysterious forces that transcend us,
obscure powers that remain inexplicable to our self or ego."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
For the individual, as another Institute member explained, "has never
existed as an historical reality: the individual is merely a conventional
fiction never found in the real life of man . . . the subject is exalted
to the degree that stringent hierarchical and disciplinary connections
annihilate in him that freedom of action, that independence so dear to
individualists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The state, as another theorist put it, had
become "a mystical subject, a worldly archangel."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Or in the
words of yet another member of the School, "The nation is

<B></B>

always
a mystical body . . . and because it is a mystical body, it possesses
us."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Nor were these merely idle statements. Notoriously, the
regime's most sustained and successful attempt to commemorate itself was
the "Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution" held in 1932, a massive and
collective work dominated by Futurist designers which proved so popular
that it became a permanent museum. Arranged as a historical narrative of
Fascism's triumphs, it culminated in the so-called "sacrarium of martyrs,"
a circular crypt that culminated in a great cupola. Above a blood-red
pedestal hung a metallic cross which was "bathed in a mysterious light
in the close atmosphere." As the catalogue explained:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[Here], in response to the tacit evocation of the living--in the
bluish gloom of the Sacrarium, behold the Martyrs who respond with,
"I am here." There are thousands and thousands of voices that echo
in the glimmers that infinitely repeat the speech of those who have
sacrificed their lives and who now guide implacable legions on their
path.

Perhaps the most forceful example of Fascism's capacity to reinscribe
the members of the body politic within new languages are found in a
series of photographic postcards (. <A
HREF="5.2rainey_7.html">17</A>, <A
HREF="5.2rainey_8.html">18</A>), which depict hundreds
of school children whose bodies have been arranged to form a somatic
script that bespeaks the new syntax of fascism. That somatic language,
of course, cannot be deciphered by the citizens who have been, quite
literally, conscripted into its making; it is legible only to the eyes
of the great cameraman (<A HREF="5.2rainey_9.html"> 19</A>) who
has directed and photographed the
scene; discernible only by "the Duce, pilot of Italy," as he is termed
in this postcard of 1942 (<A HREF="5.2rainey_0.html"> 20</A>),
who now flies--well, over head. Here
the <I>corps morcel&eacute;</I> of the body politic achieves its specular
identity with the airplane that flies above, identity now written in a
script that can be deciphered only by the master aviator, the one who
has dictated it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Inevitably we ask ourselves: what is the "hidden self" that speaks in
the mysterious dictations received by spiritualist mediums, that murmurs
through the propeller of Marinetti's airplane, or that inscribes the
new language of automatic writing? Or again: what are we to make of
the mysterious head that floats behind the "hysterical" medium, or
that hovers above the "hysterical" masses of Fascist modernism? Some
critics have urged us to see the "doubled" heads and ectoplasmic limbs of
spiritualist mediums as part of a protofeminist language of the body, a
somatic expression of all that has been repressed by patriarchal culture,
a mirror image of libidinal desire. Yet most of us viewing the ubiquitous
multiplication of Mussolini's head will doubtless think of the head's
traditional association with reason and control, and especially here,
with notions of seeing and surveillance, notions most typically linked
with patriarchal ego or superego. Perhaps we err in supposing that we must
choose one view over the other. Fascism was a form of politics that called
into question the basic polarities of liberal thought--it was a politics
of the marvelous, modernizing and yet archaizing, revolutionary and
yet conservative, merging together the public and the private, blurring
the traditional opposition between desire and authority.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
Fascism promised to unleash the individual and the masses, to restore the
primacy and authority of desire; just as it also promised to instill a
culture of mass discipline, a desire for authority. In doing so, it may
have only articulated, in a characteristically extreme form, a paradox
central to modernity itself: the way in which it promises to enhance
(in part through technology) individual autonomy and to enrich human
agency, versus the way in which that promise has inexorably given
way to a disturbing practice of collective conformity and increasing
enthrallment. That same contradiction, after all, is the central paradox
informing the rhetorical structure of Marinetti's "Manifesto." It is a
work that offers the reader the promise of "words-in-freedom." But that
promise can be realized only if the reader submits to the discipline of
its rules--only if he agrees to keep taking dictation.

in R. W. Flint (ed.), <I>Let's Murder the Moonshine: Selected Writings

(Los Angeles: Sun and Moon Press, 1991; 1st edition under the title

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The early publication history of the manifesto has been a subject of some
confusion. The "Technical Manifesto" is conserved as a leaflet dated
11 May 1912 which is housed among the papers of F. T. Marinetti at the
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University. Whether or
not the work was actually published on that date is unclear; notoriously,
the Futurists often gave their manifestos dates that had symbolic rather
than strictly chronological value. The earliest published reports of the
"Technical Manifesto" appeared on 7 July 1912 in two Parisian newspapers,
both of which describe the manifesto as an independent leaflet; see
Novella Novella, "Contributo ad una bibliografia della fortuna del
Futurismo in Francia (1909-1920)," in P. A. Jannini (ed.), <I>La
fortuna del futurismo in Francia</I> (Rome: Bulzoni, 1979), 242, entries
157-58. It is presumed that the version sent to French newspapers
was a French one. However, it should not be assumed that this French
version was a translation made only after composition and publication of
the original in Italian, for it is well known that Marinetti frequently
composed his works first in French and only thereafter translated them
into Italian. Lacking more precise information from Marinetti's extant
correspondence, little of which has been collected or published, one can
only assume that the date of 11 May is generally an accurate indication
of the Manifesto's composition, surmise that it was first written in
French and then translated into Italian, and trust that publication of
the manifesto as an independent manifesto took place in May or June 1912,
with copies of the French leaflet being received by Parisian newspapers
in the first week of July.

The exhibitions took place on four evenings, 14 through 17 November
(Wednesday through Saturday), 1849, at Corinthian Hall, a public
assembly hall in Rochester which had opened a few months earlier
and could hold 400 people. Advertisements for the exhibition were
headlined: "WONDERFUL PHENOMENA, AT CORINTHIAN HALL" (<I>Rochester
Daily Advertiser</I>, 14 November 1849, 2, col. 5; <I>Rochester
Daily Democrat</I>, 2, col. 7). All quotations are from Anonymous, "A
Ghost!" <I>Rochester Daily Democrat</I>, 16 November 1849, 2 col. 3,
which summarizes Capron's lecture and places "telegraphic dispatches" in
quotation marks as if to indicate that they are a direct quotation. The
<I>Daily Democrat</I>'s is the most extensive contemporary account of the
exhibitions not written by a participant. It would appear that attendance
at the exhibitions was slack: after those of 14 and 15 November were
advertised at 25 cents per person, the price was cut in half (to 12
and 1/2 cents) for those of 16 and 17 November, a strategy that was
evidently successful, since "four or five hundred persons" attended the
final exhibition of 17 November. (See advertisement, <I>Rochester Daily

The beginnings of spiritualism have been recounted in many works,
but most are unreliable because they wish either to attack or defend
the Fox sisters. More scholarly treatments have set their activities
solely against the background of contemporary religious history in
upstate New York, slighting the relations between early spritiualism
and the telegraph or the extent to which its rapid diffusion depended
on contemporary media and spectacle. For an early account of the Fox
sisters see [Epes Sargent], <I>Planchette; or, the Despair of Science</I>

Nineteenth-Century America</I> (Botson: Beacon Press, 1989), whose study
of the links between spiritualism and early feminism is exemplary,

Breton would write that Surrealism was defined by its ability to
find images "endowed with a persuasive strength rigorously proportional
to the violence of the initial shock they produced." See his <I>Mad
Love</I>, trans. Mary Ann Caws (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press,

that too may be seen as contiguous with the genesis of Futurism by an
"accident." Likewise, I suspect that much of Dada's interest in shock
derives from Marinetti and, of course, from the broader interest in
shock that resulted after the outbreak of World War I.

generally considered an effect of the development of the mass media. It
is no accident that Mussolini, the editor of a newspaper and later the

In 1936, Gertrude Stein was invited to England to lecture at Oxford
and Cambridge. She prepared two talks for the occasion, one of
which was called "What Are Master-Pieces and Why Are There So Few
of Them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Like all of her theoretical pronouncements,
this text is a bravura combination of speculative audacity, adroit
playfulness, and flagrant self-promotion. It is, in other words, a
miniature attempt to produce her own version of precisely that class
of object whose extreme rarity the lecture's title asserts. However few
the number of genuine masterpieces, Stein is not only certain that they
exist and are worth striving to create, but, more interestingly, she is
equally sure that her audience shares the same convictions for reasons
wholly independent of any particular works she might invoke. Indeed, her
lecture scarcely bothers to mention, let alone analyze, any specific
examples at all--apart, of course, from her own writings, along with
passing glances at <I>Hamlet</I> and <I>Robinson Crusoe</I>. To Stein,
the features of individual masterpieces are almost incidental compared
to the overwhelming significance of the category as such.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Paradoxically, though, in spite of Stein's near hypostatization of the
masterpiece, she deliberately avoids drawing on the rhetoric of the
sublime when defining it, relying instead on the unemphatic, homespun
verb "to make." No word occurs more frequently in Stein's writings, or
resonates with more obvious



authorial self-identification. Even in
the charged context of defining of the masterpiece, she depends wholly
on the notions of deliberate intention and repeated labor suggested
by the workmanlike concept of making. For all their self-evident and
timeless authority, masterpieces are not the result of some transcendent
revelation or supra-rational inspiration; masterpieces are <I>made</I>,
rarely and against extraordinary odds, but, like other, more ordinary
works of human days and hands, they must nonetheless be made. Through
this insistence, Stein enables us to hear, behind its post-Enlightenment,
idealist sublimation, something of the term's more prosaic history.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Unlike most of our critical vocabulary that emerged from a subtly nuanced
Graeco-Latin philosophical and aesthetic discourse, the word "masterpiece"
is entirely medieval in origin and first appeared in the context of
regulatory legislation governing artisanal activity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 The
exercise of a profession during the Middle Ages necessitated admission
to a guild or corporation, confirmed by the candidate's recognition as
a master, usually through the production of a <I>chef d'oeuvre</I> or
<I>Meisterst&uuml;ck</I> that had to conform to strictly defined criteria
and was subject to an official examination by the senior members of a
guild. Such a requirement is mentioned for the first time in Etienne
Boileau's <I>Livre de m&eacute;tier</I>, which is datable between 1261
and 1271 and contains the statutes governing the corporations in the city
of Paris. As the record amply demonstrates, "the most striking feature of
the Medieval institution of Masterpiece-making was its wholly artisanal
purpose. Masterpieces were executed not just by goldsmiths and tapestry
weavers, where a certain 'artistic' quality might be assumed, but also
apothecaries, carpenters, rope-makers, barbers, locksmiths, tailors, and
cooks" (<I>M</I>, 5).
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 My favorite example of such officially
mandated masterpiece making, one that a dedicated connoisseur of the
dinner table like Gertrude Stein surely would have applauded, is the
following list of dishes required of a candidate for master chef in 1576
in Calais:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
a turkey in rum and vanilla sauce, three partridges in a
p&acirc;t&eacute;, a milk-fed kid roasted on a spit, a boar with lard,
a tart with jellied filling decorated with fleurs-de-lys of different
colors, a basket made with candied sticks interlaced and variously
colored, a lion carved in jellied cream, an imitation bunch of grapes
made of jelly and an almond tart [<I>M</I>, 5-6].

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein, of course, is not the only modernist who would have found such
a list imaginatively compelling. To a remarkable extent, the modernists
were fascinated by catalogues and lists of every description, and when
they incorporated lengthy inventories into their own texts, it was not
just because doing so was the easiest way to signal an affinity between
their work and classical epics. Such catalogues also functioned as
affectionately parodic microcosms of the project of producing encyclopedic
masterpieces. A list may be the most primitive of all transcriptions,
but it also has the potential to be the most peremptory and willful
affirmation of a text's power to incorporate anything at all into its
own unfolding.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The scarcely veiled proprietary relationship
of the list maker to the objects itemized makes the creation of lists
like

<B></B>

an ever-expanding appropriation of the world's physical
and imaginative commodities. Insofar as we are all both story tellers
and story dwellers, we rely on syntax and plot to impose some order
on the heterogeneity of experience. Lists, however, often flourish by
flamboyantly demonstrating their arbitrariness, and they can suggest
entirely new patterns of meaning without any discernible story line or
grammar. Similar to a connoisseur's collection of cherished objects or
texts, a catalogue need not be based on any prior consonance among its
components, nor need it be organized according to fixed hierarchic
principles established before the items on the list were invented
or found; it is sufficient that at one time each element pleased the
cataloguer. Precisely because the rules governing the placement and
sequence of a list's elements seem so strict, although never explicitly
stated, lists compel their reader to work at divining the intention of the
listmaker. Indeed, seen in this light, Stephen Dedalus's famous account
of the quasidivine nature of the artist resembles nothing so much as a
description of a particularly adroit maker of lists: "the personality
. . . finally refines itself out of existence, impersonalizes itself,
so to speak . . . The artist, like the God of creation, remains within
or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined out of
existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although the most minimal of structuring devices, the list's apparent
conceptual poverty is compensated for by its capacity to marshal the
potentially infinite richness of montage, where, as Richard Sieburth
has pointed out, any term "may enter into sudden adjacency with another"
and generate new meanings out of the juxtaposition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Whether
the catalogues are sovereignly comic like James Joyce's, or deeply
melancholic like Walter Benjamin's, it is striking how thoroughly the
logic of list making crystallizes the modernist masterpiece's ultimate
ambition. In all such lists, the randomness and contingency of history and
the memorializing impulse of the library intersect, bringing everything,
from the culture's canonical <I>topoi</I> to arcane, almost forgotten
citations, and from contemporary, public controversies to the writer's
most personal, private concerns, into a meaningful, new narrative order.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Early in his <I>Cantos</I>, almost as a manifesto of the poem to come,
Ezra Pound offers a terse catalogue of what he thinks the modernist
masterpiece must incorporate and make new:

Beneath their lapidary assurance, there is an extraordinary amount of
aggression in these lines, a preemptive dismissal of all those skeptical
of such princely modes of cultural transmission. The record of heroism
and luminous intelligence kept vivid by a small band of "intelligent
men"--and in Pound, the gender of the speakers is

<B></B>

axiomatic--will
always remain a source of suspicion and fear to the "they" who must ask
from outside what "we talked about." The aggression itself, however,
is cunningly balanced by a flattering seduction of the reader. "Learn
to cherish the same values and cultural highpoints as we do," so the
implicit promise runs, "and you too will become worthy of being included
in the conversation." The threat of exclusion from, and the prospect of
admission to the charmed circle work together to try to captivate the
reader and make him into the poem's studious acolyte.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>The Cantos</I>' defiantly hierarchic vision, although enormously
influential, is far from the only or even the most widely imitated model
of what a twentieth-century masterpiece might encompass. Against Pound's
story of a small, permanently endangered, permanently renewed community
quickened into thought and action by the inspiration of the finest
moments of its past, it is tempting to invoke such counterexamples as
Joyce's <I>Ulysses</I> and <I>Finnegans Wake</I>. The domestic heroism of
Joyce's ad-canvasser and sleeping publican are undoubtedly admirable, but
we are unlikely to confuse them with Sigismundo Malatesta's ferocity, and
their conversation, if endearing and alert, scarcely seems comparable to
the <I>quattrocenteschi</I> civilities Pound celebrates. Most of Joyce's
characters, that is, would never be able to identify what Pound called
his poem's foundational "list of beautiful objects," and they surely do
not possess the kind of <I>virt&ugrave;</I> required to be included in
<I>The Cantos</I>' catalogue of world-transforming artists, thinkers,
and builders of cities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such a ready-to-hand antithesis is largely spurious, however. As most
readers know only too well by now, the speech of even Joyce's least
educated characters is as resonant with literary echoes as anything in
<I>The Cantos</I>, and almost every paragraph of Joyce's novels contains
multiple references to "books, arms, / And men of unusual genius, /
Both of ancient times and our own." The more basic distinction, it seems
to me, is that all of the major res in <I>The Cantos</I> are alert
to their historical and literary antecedents; their self-consciousness
consists precisely in first acquiring and then striving to make new the
instigation of their cultural heritage. Although its readers require
enormous assistance in tracking down the poem's many references, these
are usually fully present to the characters who either articulate or
incarnate the indispensable cultural wisdom. We have trouble understanding
the sense of numerous passages, but no one within <I>The Cantos</I>
faces a similar plight. In <I>Ulysses</I>, on the contrary, none of the
characters, whether highly cultured or semiliterate, is fully aware of
the extensive provenance of his words and actions. Such knowledge belongs
to the consciousness shaping the work as a whole, and, to a significantly
lesser extent, to the novel's painstakingly instructed readers. Even for
those who enjoy rendering such judgments, it cannot be an easy matter to
determine whether Joyce's network of disguised allusions, shared between
author and reader over the heads of the fictional characters, is more
complicitous with a hierarchic and totalizing system of culture than are,
if the oxymoron be permitted, <I>The Cantos</I>' openly arcane references.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
More pivotal than these distinctions between Pound's and Joyce's
references is how their texts require <I>students</I>, a trait common
to a whole constellation of modernist masterpieces, but quite different
from the scrupulously attentive <I>readers</I>

<B></B>

demanded by even
their most intricate predecessors. An explosion of citations and a
deliberate effort to thwart an unworked-for comprehension on the part
of their audience characterize many of the most significant modernist
works and are direct consequences of their makers' drive to create a new
kind of encyclopedic masterpiece. Both formally and biographically, this
urge predates the realization of any specific works and constitutes the
horizon of expectation for each fresh attempt. The pressure to produce
such a masterpiece has a complex history of its own, and I now want to
focus on the relationship between that history, the nature of the need
it answered, and its consequences for ensuing generations of artists.

Perhaps the most succinct way to begin mapping the complex trajectory

What I want to emphasize here is the carefully chosen range of Balzac's

It is a critical commonplace that no two writers could be further
apart in method, craftsmanship, or intended audience than Balzac
and Mallarm&eacute;. Yet when one reads their various programmatic
declarations, what stands out is the unprecedented insistence with
which they both claimed for their art the power to create a separate
world that is as comprehensive as the realm of quotidian reality. Or,
as Mallarm&eacute; put it with characteristic absolutism, "everything
in the world exists to culminate in <I>one</I> book" ("<I>tout, au
monde, existe pour aboutir &agrave; un livre</I>").
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Not in
"<I>a</I> book," as the words are invariably translated, but rather in
<I>one</I> unique, all-encompassing text that would absorb not just all
prosaic objects and events, but also all prior artistic creation. I have
argued elsewhere that, unlike for Pound or Joyce, for Mallarm&eacute;
the poetic text is neither the discoverer nor even the celebrant of
previously extant values. Instead, it is their sole originator, at
once the source and locus of meaning. The words of such a poem must be
the noumenal meaning absent from the concrete realm of human activity,
and the relationship between text and values is not one of embodiment
but of absolute identity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 In rethinking Mallarm&eacute;'s
project from the perspective of Joyce's or Pound's texts, however, what
now strikes me as crucial is how the sheer multiplicity of poems and
languages is an implicit rebuke to Mallarm&eacute;'s aspirations. In
principle, there can only be one ultimate text, "<I>Le Livre</I>,"
and hence only one language in which the entire, anarchic raw material
of separate human discourses would be incorporated, transformed, and
made whole again, an ultimate poem purer even than Homer's work, of
whose epics Mallarm&eacute; was to complain that they represented a
"fall" (<I>d&eacute;ch&eacute;ance</I>) from the magical plenitude of
Orpheus's verses. If the decline into separate texts is a permanent
reminder of how far we are from divinity, it also issues what amounts to
a cosmic challenge to undo the Fall by inventing a new tongue in which
the lost totality of separate discourses could be synthesized anew. It
also contains the rather startlingly antinomian implication that such
inventiveness would be quite literally a God-like act.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
     For all their intransigent absolutism, Mallarm&eacute;'s formulations
     undoubtedly owe a great deal to the discourse by and about Wagner
     that marked French aesthetic theorizing for over four decades,
     beginning in the spring of 1861 with Baudelaire's epochal essay
     on the composer.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Mallarm&eacute;, much like Joyce
     a generation later, was both spurred on and left profoundly
     apprehensive by Wagner's attempt to create a <I>Gesamtkunstwerk</I>
     or "total work of art" in which music, verse, and spectacle
     were united into a single aesthetic creation. Mallarm&eacute;
     saw in such forms the most potent,

<B></B>

and hence dangerous,
     competitors for the poet's prerogative to be the alchemist of the
     new totality, and any full treatment of this topic would necessitate
     an extended evaluation of both Beethoven's and Wagner's roles in
     a theory of the modernist masterpiece.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Even if we
     restrict ourselves to pondering Mallarm&eacute;'s statement from
     "Crise de vers"--"Languages are imperfect precisely because there
     are several of them; the one supreme language is lacking"--it is
     impossible not to be reminded of the linguistic inventiveness of
     <I>Finnegans Wake</I> or <I>The Cantos</I>' mixture of different
     languages, hieroglyphs, musical notations, and Chinese ideograms. In
     "Canto 86," Pound tells us "It can't be all in one language," but if
     this modestly suggests that different cultures each have something
     of value to contribute to humankind's self-understanding, then it
     also implies, with more truculence, that the new masterpiece itself
     ought not to be written in a single language (<I>C</I>, 563). In
     order to be a masterpiece at all, it had better strive to become the
     one, central book containing the essential wisdom, the talismanic
     "piths and gists," of all cultures.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I am far from introducing the absurd claim that earlier artists had
not been concerned, programmatically and self-consciously, with the
creation of enduring works. From Horace's certainty that his lines would
outlast the ruler and city they ostensibly celebrate to the innumerable
Renaissance variations on the <I>topos</I> of the poet's bestowing
immortality on an all-too transitory lover, it would be fatuous to
recite the list of earlier texts that carry clear evidence of their
makers' hopes for a measure of permanent cultural centrality. There
<I>is</I>, however, something essentially different about the terms in
which modernist writers conceived of the project of masterpiece making. In
defense of the criticism aimed at the apparently haphazard ordering of
<I>The Cantos</I>, Pound retorted that, unlike Dante, he had no "Aquinas
map," no culturally shared, philosophical-theological system by which
to plot the progression of his tale of the tribe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 He kept
up a steady stream of prose essays, letters, and public pronouncements
designed both to justify his procedure and to help his readers make
sense of the work in progress. For similar reasons, although in a
characteristically more hidden but also more systematic way, Joyce helped
create a critical framework for <I>Ulysses</I> by providing carefully
chosen admirers with the various schema for the novel from which we all,
no matter what the ambiguities and questions, continue to benefit. The
very need, however, for such efforts underlines the severity of the
dilemma both Pound and Joyce confronted.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Their task was
not really commensurate with the efforts of even their most ambitious
predecessors, in part because the category of the whole had become
essentially arbitrary. One could accept, in other words, the abstract
principle of a <I>Gesamtkunstwerk</I>, but since there was no longer
cultural agreement on what constituted a coherent totality in the first
place, each artist was compelled to work out his own, particular, and
thus necessarily idiosyncratic selection. The logic of a representative
masterpiece makes any acknowledgment of its arbitrariness inadmissible,
however, so the text must not only select its <I>materia poetica</I>
from a range of possibilities and with an absence of generic guidelines
hitherto unthinkable, but it must also do so in such a way as to make that
selection

<B></B>

appear simultaneously inevitable and complete. In the hope
of making the stakes--and the strains--of such a project more explicit,
I want to conclude by offering a series of imperatives, illicitly
modeled on Wallace Stevens's categories in his <I>Notes toward a Supreme
Fiction</I>, the most lucid example in American writing of a modernist
masterpiece composed as an interrogation of the very possibility of its
existence. My argument, to express the matter as concisely as possible,
is that it was essential for the modernist masterpiece to <I>claim</I>
to fulfill these imperatives--that they are, in fact, its necessary
categories--but that for powerful logical and historical reasons they
remain, in actuality, impossible to satisfy. What emerges out of the
tension between the fulfillment and the frustration of these demands is
precisely what we have come to recognize as the characteristic triumphs
and particular problems of the modernist masterpiece.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

It Must be Universal

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In resonance, implication, and significance, the modernist masterpiece
must make clear that no matter how gritty with the texture of local
details its narrative, and no matter how autobiographically determined
the selection of its specific settings and themes, its true reach is
global and transhistorical. Thus, for example, Joyce has to insist that
"Ulysses/Bloom is the only complete all-round character presented by
any writer,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 and Pound needs to assure us that "with one
day's reading a man may have the key [presumably to a just society and
a wiser life] in his hands" (<I>C</I>, 427). In this regard, one can
regard Sigmund Freud's project as the creation of a special sort of
modernist masterpiece. Freud's theorizing increasingly laid claim to an
all-inclusive understanding of human nature and civilization, not just
of his patients' individual psyches. Freud's <I>Standard Edition</I> is
thus not only his encyclopedic masterpiece, but it is also a remarkably
Balzacian one. Throughout the Freudian <I>corpus</I>, a few specific
res, the "Case Histories", function both as exemplary instances and
pedagogic models for a theory of humanity as a whole so that Dora, the
Wolf Man, Little Hans, and the Rat Man have a very similar function
in Freud's <I>Standard Edition</I> to the one occupied by Rastignac,
Vautrin, C&eacute;sar Birotteau, Louis Lambert, and the other central
characters in the <I>The Human Comedy</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One way to enact this balancing act between the local and the universal
is to establish an apostolic succession in which the new work is seen
as the rightful successor of the masterpieces that preceded it. The
early years of this century showed an unprecedented use of classical
myth for just this purpose. The modernists' widespread reliance on
mythological materials is ultimately less important for its specific
thematic or even structuring function than as a means of asserting two
indispensable, general claims, namely that the new masterpiece is the
legitimate, present-day incarnation of the culture's foundational texts
and <I>topoi</I>, and that its alertness to the contingencies of the
present is congruent with its status as an incipient classic. Baudelaire
defined the secret ambition of modern art in exactly these terms,
"it longs

<B></B>

to be worthy of itself becoming antiquity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

Linked to this strategy, but logically independent of it, is the decision
to make the text's universality palpable by creating a new kind of
language for it that will embody in its very articulation the universal
claims of the narrative. Ultimately, not just the work's characters and
events, but even its language will be drawn, in the wonderful formula of
<I>Finnegans Wake</I>, from "all marryvoising moodmoulded cyclewheeling
history."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However, no matter how widely an author casts the net of his thematic
concerns, nor how polyglot his textual inclusions, the ambition to
show and tell the epoch's fundamental truths is a desperately hopeless
gamble. The felt obligation of providing his readers with the "key" to
unlocking these truths places an intolerable pressure on the masterpiece
maker. The increasing shrillness of texts like the <I>Cantos</I>, or
the accelerating fragmentation into incompatible plot outlines of
Robert Musil's <I>The Man without Qualities</I>, is due in part to
the writer's recognition of his task's impossibility. In the case of
Pound or Louis-Ferdinand C&eacute;line, one solution to the crisis of
an unattainable universality is a retreat into a paranoid style and
vision. When the author's truth finds no echo in the larger community,
the sole accessible model of totalization is the resentment-riddled
sense of being an unrecognized sage whose indispensable but unheeded
wisdom is blocked by the age's stupidity and malevolence. In brief: the
encyclopedic dream of "showing and telling all" requires an omniscience
that can decline quickly into the eccentricity of the crank or the
political complicity of the demagogue.

Perhaps the most peculiar and historically unprecedented corollary of
my first category is that the modernist masterpiece must desire the
annihilation of any possible rival. C&eacute;line was only the most
brutally honest modernist masterpiece maker when he replied to an
interviewer's question by declaring, "Why do I write? I'll tell you:
to make the others unreadable."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Moreover, this need has
very little to do with merely wishing for the success of one's own
texts, and still less with anything resembling so thin a concept as
"the anxiety of influence." As the example of Joyce makes clear, the
requirement for sole supremacy is not even genre specific, but rather
follows from the imperative of universality. In this <I>agon</I>,
there are no parallel universes, and so there can only be one ultimate
winner. <I>Ulysses</I>, for instance, was intended not merely to
render every earlier novel obsolete, but to obliterate music as well by
absorbing all of its affective power. This is clearly what Joyce meant
when he told Georges Borach, "I've finished the Sirens chapter during
the last few days. A big job. I wrote this chapter with the technical
resources of music . . . Since exploring the resources and artifices of
music, and employing them in this chapter, I haven't cared for music
anymore. I, the great friend of music, can no longer listen to it"
(<I>JJ</I>, 459). The unrealizability of Joyce's claims is, I suspect,
why he reacted with such anger when those claims <I>were</I> resisted, as
though the whole status of his text were thrown

<B></B>

into doubt if other
works could exert a comparable power. After reading "Sirens" to Ottocaro
Weiss, for example, Joyce and Weiss went together to a performance of
<I>Die Walk&uuml;re</I>. Joyce listened to Weiss praise Wagner during
the intermission and then broke out with, "Don't you find the musical
effects of my Sirens better than Wagner's?" When Weiss replied, "No,"
Joyce at once turned on his heel and did not show up for the rest of
the opera (<I>JJ</I>, 460).

Everything in the text must be presented so as to remove any sense
that an individual author's temperament, interests, and background are
responsible for the inclusion of just these details, for the selection
of just these puns, ideograms, or mythic parallels. The belated critical
catch phrase, "death of the author" is best understood not as a global
pronouncement about writing or subjectivity as such, but as a specific
technical device intended to safeguard the authority of the work from
any trace of a "mere individuality" that must always, in this context,
carry the mark of an unacceptable arbitrariness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

instructive, as well as amusing, to watch Pound and Joyce after the early

 More fascinating still is the breakdown

If the imperative of impersonality might still be seen as a self-conscious
attempt to recreate the "objective" tone of traditional epic narratives,
there is another, strictly modernist conception of the relationship
between the artistic ration of a consciousness and any actually
lived, biographical identity. When Claude Lantier, a painter in Zola's
novel, <I>L'Oeuvre</I> (wonderfully translated, for my purposes here, as
<I>The Masterpiece</I>) cries out, "It will kill me and it will kill my
wife, my child and everything around me, but it will be a masterpiece,

<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 or when Yeats declares, "The intellect of man is
forced to choose / perfection of the life, or of the work,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

they are both insisting on an opposition whose absolutism would have
seemed absurd only a century before. Leo Bersani has coined the phrase
"the culture of redemption" to describe the idea that art exists to give
value to, and thus to salvage, an otherwise meaningless existence. Only
art, in the form of a timeless masterpiece, can restore and make whole
all the suffering, triviality, and wastefulness of life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

From Mallarm&eacute;'s longing to absorb the world into a single Book,
to Stephen Dedalus's explicitly theological formulation: "time's ruins
build eternity's mansions . . . in woman's womb word is made flesh but
in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that

 Literary critics are continuing
to pile up hecatombs of explanatory volumes that demonstrate the rightness
of Joyce's words. But his comment must once have rung far odder than we
can easily recognize today. The changing role of the university and the
very success of the modernist masterpiece have tended to "naturalize"
Joyce's longing to be argued over by academics and obscured just how
far-fetched Joyce's hope was when he first uttered it in 1921. At that
time, contemporary novels--whether under accusations of incoherence
and obscenity or not--were not part of any university curriculum and
not likely to become such either. At Oxford, for example, it was not
until 1970 that any works published after 1900 could appear on the
English Honors Syllabus. Nor were matters all that different in the
United States, where William Lyon Phelps, a distinguished Yale English
professor, found that his 1910 study <I>On Modern Novelists</I> elicited
"astonishment" from reviewers "that a book of essays on contemporary
writers should come from a university professor."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 When Joyce
"put in his enigmas and puzzles," he, like Pound and Eliot, was not so
much anticipating, but to a significant degree actively <I>creating</I>
the situation his phrase seems only to describe. All of these texts were
composed from the outset with the intention of being studied, not just
read, and their way of advancing such seemingly preposterous expectations
required what one might call "a strategy of presumptive immortality"
(<I>M</I>, 122).
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Modernist masterpiece making entails making
an entirely new scholarly and critical context in which the works will
be received, and this requirement is a constituent part of the whole
project, directly affecting the composition of the piece itself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a paradoxical return of the repressed, the values of bourgeois probity
and industriousness against which artists had proclaimed themselves in
rebellion throughout the nineteenth century were transferred largely
intact to the aesthetic sphere. Instead of the <I>sprezzatura</I>
valued by earlier periods, modernist masterpieces were expected to
exhibit the scars of an intense and agonizing labor. The only realm in
which Marx's labor theory of value seems entirely convincing is in the
domain of the modernist masterpiece, where the artist's labor earns the
right to exact a reciprocal effort from the reader. Ultimately, the
reader's willingness to undertake that labor depends on his already
having accepted the principle that a masterpiece is entitled to make
such extraordinary demands. Whether any particular work merits the
designation of a masterpiece is open to debate, but the existence of
the category itself is not. Joyce's motif of the artist-as-God works
precisely because in the

<B></B>

unprecedented breadth, depth, and extent
of his representation of his characters' existence, he can make them
totally legible, and, correspondingly, leave his readers subservient to
the fullness of his knowledge.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 What makes this situation
particularly strange, however, is that although the necessary fiction
of texts like <I>The Cantos</I> and <I>Finnegans Wake</I> is that we
are being taught to read a new kind of universal idiom, what we are
actually acquiring is a discrete and nontransferable fluency in a series
of heterogeneous, radically incommensurable works. Indeed, learning how to
make sense of one modernist masterpiece is of remarkably little help in
being able to understand a different one. It is as though the effort to
acquire even a preliminary interpretative competence with any particular
work encourages a self-protective, mutually confirming consumer loyalty
to a product in which both artist and audience have already heavily
invested. The Absolute Artist now requires something like an Abject Reader
whose devotion to the modernist masterpiece is both self-abnegating and
all-consuming.

The oxymoron here is deliberate. The modernist masterpiece simultaneously
seeks to escape and to incorporate both the historical-social world
from which it springs and the literary tradition whose <I>summa</I> it
intends to be. It must, that is, stand in an explicitly dialectical
relationship to all previous texts, resolving their antitheses and
partialities into the final synthesis of its absolute form. The initial
thrust of the much contested and increasingly threadbare catch phrase
"postmodernism" arises from the systematic subversion of all of the
imperatives I have just listed. Such a critique dismisses the idea that
art can redeem lost time or damaged lives, and counters assertions of the
masterpiece's universality with an insistence that every work explicitly
acknowledge its own historicity and partiality. At its most radical,
postmodernism throws into doubt the category of the genius, which from
Immanuel Kant to Marcel Duchamp, and especially in Marcel Proust, Pound,
Stein, and Joyce, grounded and justified the artist's <I>exempla</I>
whose universality was guaranteed precisely and tautologically because
they were discovered by a genius.

If Hegel's <I>Phenomenology of Mind</I> crystallized the ideology of the
universal in the formula, "Truth is the whole," (<I>das Wahre ist das
Ganze</I>) the skepticism of the countermovement is admirably captured
in Adorno's negative reformulation, "The whole is truth" (<I>Das ganze
ist das Unwahre</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Often our contemporary rereadings
of the modernist masterpieces are grounded in critical perspectives
that see only the emancipatory, joyful implications of Adorno's aphorism
without recognizing that he is also defining the tragic loss of a utopian
dimension once embodied in the categories of aesthetic wholeness and
intelligibility. We proceed, that is, as though the gaps and fissures
in the modernist masterpieces were simply invitations to a celebratory
playfulness

<B></B>

 rather than scars of an impossible struggle to hold
dissolution at bay. Near the end of his poem, when Pound cries out, "And
I am not a demigod, / I cannot make it cohere," it is the possibility of
a comprehensive modernist masterpiece whose collapse he is confessing
(<I>C</I>, 796). We are right to be grateful for that collapse, to
prefer the fragments and radiant moments that survive amidst the
"errors and wrecks" of Pound's failed attempt at a new, totalitarian
synthesis (<I>C</I>, 796). Pound's admission of defeat, however, like
Musil's inability to finish his great novel, can move us only if we take
seriously the stakes for which both writers were contending.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the end, perhaps the most riveting feature of the modernist masterpiece
is how its imaginative energy is distributed so uncannily between the
antithetical movements of integration and dispersal, between a rage for
order and a search for what can survive the death of the dream to impose
that order. The modernist masterpiece shuttles continuously between a
totalizing project it intermittently recognizes as inaccessible, if not
outright paranoid, and a contradictory attentiveness to the particular
moment and the purely local, contingent realization. If the first impulse
is encyclopedic and epic, then the second can be thought of as essayistic,
flourishing precisely by refusing to subordinate its curiosity to any
larger systems. Essayism's complete absorption in the immediate and
local resists subordination to the lure of the whole, and the strain of
shuttling between the epic and the essayistic fractures the modernist
masterpiece as it is producing it. So, to complete my catalogue, the last
imperative ought to encompass the impossibility of accomplishing all the
earlier ones, and might read something like: "It Must Resist and Yield To
Its Own Essayism Almost Successfully." The realization that, in Musil's
wonderful phrase, "even God probably preferred to speak of His world
in the subjunctive of possibility . . . for God creates the world and
thinks while doing so that it could just as well be done differently,"
is one that the modernist masterpiece, whose creator's aspirations are
more absolutist than those of Musil's imagined Deity, cannot afford to
admit until its own splintering compels it to do so, thereby abandoning
its claims to an unconditional universalism.

I am uncomfortably aware of how much my discussion slights both music
and the visual arts since these omissions undoubtedly qualify the reach
of my argument. I can only hope that scholars with greater knowledge
in these domains will add their own rectifications and insights to the
perspective I am advocating here. At least since Diderot's <I>salons</I>,
the nature of the modernist masterpiece has been a central theme in
art history, and Baudelaire's numerous essays on the question still
define many of the most important ways of addressing the topic. Although
relatively few musicologists seem to have been concerned with the problem,
composers, like painters and sculptors, have produced a steady stream of
self-reflective texts from precisely this vantage point. Recently, though,
Mark Evans Bonds, <I>Wordless Rhetoric: Musical Form and the Metaphor
of the Oration</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991),
and more pertinently still, idem, <I>After Beethoven: Imperatives of
Originality in the Symphony</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University

masterpiece making was for nineteenth-century composers. Consider these
fascinating references in Bonds's examination of the nineteenth-century
symphony:

"Since Beethoven's nine masterpieces," the aesthetician Ignaz Jeitteles
observed in 1837, "it has become a colossal undertaking to write
a symphony." As the highest, most ambitious genre of instrumental
music, the symphony was perceived to carry the special responsibility of
addressing the metaphysical in music. A symphony was no longer considered
merely a matter of entertainment, but of embodying the highest ideals of
instrumental music and thus of all art. A symphony, according to Mahler
at the end of the century, "must have something cosmic within itself,
must be inexhaustible like the world and life, if it is not to make a
mockery of its name." [Mark Bonds, <I>After Beethoven</I>, 16]

A crucial assumption in the culture of redemption is that a certain
type of repetition of experience in art repairs inherently damaged
or valueless experience. Experience may be overwhelming, practically
impossible to absorb, but it is assumed--and this is especially evident
in much encyclopedic fiction--that the work of art has the authority to
master the presumed raw material of experience in a manner that uniquely
gives value to, perhaps even redeems, that material. (Leo Bersani, <I>The

When the horrors of history have become so cataclysmic that any
idea of their being somehow "redeemed" through art seems obscene, then
the foundation of the modernist masterpiece is cast into doubt. In
a strong sense, the Shoah has fundamentally undermined our sense of
art's all-absorptive, all-transring power. The death factories and
killing fields of Nazi Europe have become boundary lines marking the
limits of art's imaginative authority. Auschwitz, to paraphrase Adorno,
can never be the subject of a modernist masterpiece. In the face of
total annihilation, a radical transformation of the basic relationship
between speech and silence becomes the minimum condition for any ethically
coherent response. Beyond Paul Celan's concern about the use to which his
poem "<I>Todesfuge</I>" ("Death Fugue") was put in postwar Germany, the
work's stunning and seemingly effortless technical mastery is, surely,
the deeper reason for his ambivalence and his harsh judgments about what
he came to think of as the gaudiness of much of his early verse.

I much prefer Adorno's wording to Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard's
now frequently invoked description of our supposed "postmodern
tradition." (See Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard, <I>The Postmodern
Condition: A Report on Knowledge</I>, trans. Geoff Bennington and Brian
Massumi [Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1984].) Lyotard
emphasizes the discrediting of the master narratives (<I>les grands
r&eacute;cits</I>) which he claims dominated the West from the
Enlightenment until after World War II. Our postmodernism, Lyotard
asserts, is evident in the ways we strive to do without these obsolete,
global--and hence necessarily totalitarian--tropes. Apart from the curious
fact that Lyotard's explanation is, by his own definition, an obviously
modernist account of postmodernism--i.e., he offers precisely a global,
and rather monolithically reductive account of the modernist/postmodernist
distinction--there is something decidedly parochial in his certainty that
"we" no longer believe in any of the nineteenth century's totalizing
systems. If his claims are restricted to the domains of philosophy and
literary theory, and if the privileged examples of discredited master
narratives are the theories of Marx, Freud, and their various successors,
then Lyotard is undoubtedly correct. If one believes, as I do, however,
that Darwin's theory of evolution is the nineteenth century's most
powerful totalizing theory, then it becomes clear that the sway of
that theory, and its explanatory power, has only continued to increase
throughout this century.

A geography text should aim at literary form. It should present a
standard of knowledge, a method, and a perspective. Supplementary ideas
ought to be built round the map, not the printed page, for only so can
we cultivate the visualizing habit of mind.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The prototypically modernist linguistic play of "the green wothe botheth"
establishes a problem of imagining to which the young Stephen will
return, although the problem cannot be resolved: "you could not have a
green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could" (<I>PA,</I>
12-13). In its encoded contestation of national and poetic imagery
(the Irish green, the poetic rose), Stephen's "green wothe" is an
exemplary geopolitical image. It posits a form of cultural and political
identification whose difficulty Stephen later finds inscribed in and
around the "picture of the earth on the first page of his geography"
textbook (<I>PA,</I> 15).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The meaning of "geopolitics" as a term used to describe global political
problems is by no means easy to pinpoint. Its increasing use as a keyword
in critical theory and cultural studies signals a need to theorize
what Homi Bhabha has recently called "the geopolitics of the historical
present."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 As part of that critical effort a number of studies
of geopolitics have appeared, including Gear&oacute;id O Tuathail's
recent <I>Critical Geopolitics</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The genealogy I offer
here emphasizes two features of the formation of what O Tuathail calls
"classical geopolitics" (<I>CG,</I> 22): the suppressed importance of
anarchism in the formation of imperialist geopolitical paradigms, and
the fate of nineteenth-century ideas of "culture" in the formation of
twentieth-century geopolitics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The history of geopolitics may be summarized as the failure to constitute
the discipline of geography as a scientific field of study, a failure
on which the very success and persistence of reactionary geopolitical
paradigms are premised. Most of my examples are drawn from the work
of geographers, anthropologists, and social scientists, and something I
emphasize is the way geopolitical paradigms took shape around disciplinary
boundary crossings within the academy not unlike the interdisciplinarity
that characterizes cultural studies today.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 At issue is not
only the fate of an academic field of study, but also the ensemble of
residual problems and questions that come to mark the wider sense of
"geopolitics." Stephen's problem of imagining a "green rose" is exemplary
of this ensemble of questions because it offers not a definition, but
a problem: "It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant
and that he did not know where the universe ended" (<I>PA,</I> 17).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Joyce's novel, a geography textbook precipitates Stephen's problem
of identification, and it is to geography books that I turn to examine
the emergence of the geopolitical image. In particular, I am interested
in the work of three geographers: Elis&eacute;e Reclus (1830-1905),
the French anarchist geographer; Friedrich Ratzel (1844-1904), the
German geographer whose theory of "living space" <I>(Lebensraum)</I> and
political geography generally set the terms for the later development
of <I>Geopolitik;</I> and Halford J. Mackinder (1861-1947), the
British geographer who championed the "new geography" in schools and
universities in Britain.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mackinder is given special prominence, not only for the central place he
occupies in genealogies of geopolitics, but also because his geography
illustrates a formalist logic at work in the formation of geopolitics
reminiscent of both the strategies of literary modernism and of the
Freudian dreamwork of condensation and displacement.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<B></B>

The
significance of Mackinder's geography lies in its ability to synthesize
the radically different political implications of Ratzel and Reclus into
a single geopolitical image, that of Britain in his <I>Britain and the
British Seas</I> . In that image are constellated not only the
contradictions of European geography over the turn of the century, but
also the distinctive features of the breakdown of nineteenth-century
European ideas of culture.

Halford Mackinder is remembered as an important re in the development
of geopolitical thinking chiefly for his heartland thesis. First
formulated in "The Geographical Pivot of History," a paper delivered
in January 1904 to the Royal Geographical Society, Mackinder's thesis
projects global political power as naturally pivoting around Central
Asia, the "heartland" of land-based power in what Mackinder sees as
the fundamental strategic and historical interplay of land and sea. The
thesis is abbreviated first in the form of the map of "The Natural Seats
of Power" that accompanied the 1904 paper (<A
HREF="5.3gogwilt_1.html"> 1</A>), and then in the set
of maxims in <I>Democratic Ideals and Reality</I> :

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The key features of this rhetoric and iconography of geopolitics may be
seen as early as 1887 in Mackinder's influential address to the Royal
Geographic Society, "On the Scope and Methods of Geography." Assuming
leadership of the "new geography" movement, Mackinder took up the
"educational battle" over the place of geography in British schools and
universities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Mackinder argued not only for the unity of
geography as a discipline, but also for its central place in general
education. The "continuous argument"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 of geography, which
ranges from physical geography to political geography, makes it the
discipline able to bridge the gap between the natural and the human
sciences: "One of the greatest of all gaps lies between the natural
sciences and the study of humanity. It is the duty of the geographer
to build one bridge over an abyss which in the opinion of many is
upsetting the equilibrium of our culture." (<I>SM,</I> 16) In all of these
claims, and perhaps most particularly in the gesture toward resolving a
general crisis of "culture," Mackinder condenses and displaces a range
of debates giving shape to the formation of geopolitics, most notably
the theoretical debates in Germany, including those raised in Ratzel's
two-volume <I>Anthropogeographie</I> (1882-91).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The opening sections of the first volume of <I>Anthropogeographie</I>
offer a comprehensive classification of the different branches
of the science of geography as a whole, which Ratzel divides
into "physical geography" <I>(physikalische Geographie)</I> and

<B></B>

<I>Anthropogeographie,</I> Ratzel's coinage for "human geography." As
his title indicates, Ratzel is most concerned with the second of these
branches of geography, whose systematization as a science was the project
of <I>Anthropogeographie</I>. His definition of "anthropogeography"
asserts that priority should be given to human geography since the
human being <I>(der Mensch)</I> is the main object of study for
every science.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 He then goes on to insist, however, that
anthropogeography is intimately connected to the natural sciences. The
connection between the natural and the human sciences gives geography
its distinctive object of study, namely "the geographical diffusion of
humankind across the earth's surface" (<I>A,</I> 22).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This core claim of Ratzel's--what Woodruff Smith has dubbed the
"diffusionist revolt" against dominant liberal patterns of academic
thinking in nineteenth-century Germany--has many implications
for the disciplines of geography and anthropology. Its innovative
construction of what each discipline takes for its object of study
belongs, moreover, to the late nineteenth-century attempt to unify the
so-called cultural sciences <I>(Kulturwissenschaften).</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
The significance of "culture" as the shared object of study is
suggested by Ratzel's classification of the branches of geography that
renders cultural geography <I>(Kulturgeographie)</I> as a synonym for
<I>Anthropogeographie.</I> Neither "culture" nor "humanity," however,
survives as the principle of coherence around which Ratzel is able to
construct geography as a science. By the late 1890s, "biogeography"
displaces anthropogeography--eclipsing both "culture" and "humankind"
as the proper object of geographic study--to produce a geography in the
service of an expansionist, imperialist politics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The logic of the formation of geopolitics may be traced largely in
the changing focus of Ratzel's works from <I>Anthropogeographie</I>
to <I>Politische Geographie</I>  and <I>Der Lebensraum</I>
. The same logic, at once disciplinary and political, simultaneously

<B></B>

informs Mackinder's "new geography," a formulation aptly reminiscent
of "new imperialism." It is hardly a surprise that the formation of
geopolitics coincides with the rise of "new imperialism" in Europe in
the late nineteenth century, although its full scope and importance for
the foundations and legitimation of the modern discipline of geography
have only recently been addressed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Mackinder's work helps
illustrate the wider cultural crisis within which geopolitics take

shape and the logic by which the formation of geopolitics reconres
nineteenth-century notions of culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his <I>Democratic Ideals and Reality</I> Mackinder looked back with
revealing ambivalence on the success of German geography, "Judged from
the standpoint of Berlin, it was a wonderful thing to have impressed
<I>Kultur,</I> or <I>Strategical mentality,</I> on the educated class of
a whole people, but from the standpoint of civilisation at large it was
a fatal momentum to have given to a nation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In abbreviated
form, Mackinder's phrase <I>"Kultur,</I> or <I>Strategical mentality"</I>
encapsulates the conceptual knot linking the definitional confusion
of "culture"--in translation across a variety of languages--to the
formation of geopolitics. Among the many things condensed in Mackinder's
use of the German term <I>"Kultur"</I> is the logical culmination of
Ratzel's attempt, and failure, to unify a science of cultural studies
<I>(Kulturwissenschaft)</I> around geography.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mackinder's diagnosis of the "fatal momentum" of <I>Kultur</I> is
attended by a barely concealed admiration for the "wonderful thing"
that made geography into the teaching of "strategical mentality." Part
of Mackinder's ambivalence clearly comes from the fact that he had been
advocating this kind of teaching since the 1880s. If the difference for
Mackinder lies in the distinction between <I>Kultur</I> and "civilisation
at large," this only makes the key role of "culture" in the formation of
geopolitics all the more visible. It also conceals the extent to which
Mackinder's own "educational battle" in the 1880s to bring geography
into schools and universities formed part of a complex collaboration and
competition amongst geographers from different European countries who
together were shaping their disciplines to legitimate, and be legitimized
by, official nationalism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One immediate source for Mackinder's arguments was J. Scott Keltie's
influential 1885 report on geographical education throughout
Europe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 In an appendix, Keltie's report translates the
curriculum statement for the military academy of the University of
Berlin. This "'Instruction' as to the Scope and Method of Studies to
be Observed at the <I>Kriegs-Akademie,</I> Berlin"--a title echoed
in Mackinder's "On the Scope and Methods of Geography"--has strong
affinities with Mackinder's claim for the "continuous argument" of
geography: "The circle of sciences, comprehended generally under the
name of geography, forms the transition and concatenating link between
the natural and historical sciences" (<I>GE,</I> 111). The imperialist
"scope and methods" of each educational program is suggested in the
final section, with its significant emphasis on the term "culture":

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A systematic scientific conception of geography will take the whole
earth's surface as the subject of its comparative studies, and all
the more when at the present time European culture is pressing forward
on every hand with rapid progress. In consideration, however, of the
historical task devolving on Europe, to become the representative
and

<B></B>

leader of this world-wide culture, the student in his
historico-geographical studies will specially apply his mind to
the appreciation of the physical conration of Europe, and how it
exercised such influence on its inhabitants as to qualify them for such
a mission. [<I>GE,</I> 111]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here, perhaps, is registered the birth of geopolitics. If so, it is more
than an embryonic version of the U.S. fascination for Haushofer's program
to make the man in the street "think geopolitically" and to train the
nation's leaders to "act geopolitically."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Translated for
an English evaluation of the place of geography in education throughout
Europe, which in turn served an international readership, Keltie's
report is a document that registers the moment in which a discourse
of geopolitics takes shape. In its formulation of "European culture,"
it registers the roots of geopolitics in an entanglement of geography
and culture, anticipating the terms of Mackinder's equation between
<I>Kultur</I> and "strategical mentality."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mackinder's "political geography" draws its rhetorical strength not
only from the new imperialist and militarist discourse of post-1870
Europe, however. The generalist vision of his 1887 address also looks
back to the mainstream of nineteenth-century European geography and its
encyclopedic ambition to provide an inclusive description of the earth
and its inhabitants. This had been Alexander Humboldt's ambition, in his
travel writings and his <I>Kosmos;</I> it had been Carl Ritter's, too,
in his <I>Erdkunde.</I> Perhaps the fullest, most ambitious attempt to
realize the grand narrative claims of nineteenth-century geography was
the nineteen-volume <I>La Nouvelle g&eacute;ographie universelle</I> by
Elis&eacute;e Reclus. Reclus's work provided a monumental precedent for
Mackinder's vision of a geography that sought to follow the "continuous
argument" from "physical geography" to "political geography."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
From his first major work on physical geography, <I>La Terre</I>
(1868-69), through the <I>Nouvelle g&eacute;ographie universelle</I>
(1876-94), up to his final, six-volume work of "social geography,"
<I>L'Homme et la terre</I> (1905-08), Reclus had followed just such
an argument.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Reclus, however, the argument of geography was a matter of human
emancipation. Writing in the second volume of <I>La Terre</I> ,
Reclus articulated the connection between the work of geography and the
work of political emancipation:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Human beings, these "reasonable beings" who love so much to boast about
their free will, nonetheless cannot make themselves independent of the
climates and of the physical conditions of the country they inhabit. Our
liberty, in our relations to the Earth, consists in understanding the laws
of these relations to confirm the liberty of our existence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Liberty was a theme Reclus would never abandon. The experience of
imprisonment as a Communard a few years later only helped confirm
that theme more clearly with the simultaneous formulation of
his anarchist position and his project to write the <I>Universal
Geography.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Liberty, of course, was also the great theme of nineteenth-century
liberalism. In the <I>Universal Geography</I>'s effort to realize the
full emancipatory impulse of the nineteenth century's grand narrative
ambitions, it underscores the role of geography in helping shape the
principles of both freedom and science in what Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois
Lyotard calls "the narrative of legitimation" of knowledge in the
nineteenth century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The central place of emancipatory
principles in nineteenth-century geography shows through even in the "new
imperialist" rhetoric with which the Berlin "Instruction" characterizes
Europe's "mission" as "representative and leader of this world-wide
culture" (<I>GE,</I> 111). The same terms--with a different inflection
from that given in Keltie's translation--belong to the emancipatory
claims with which Reclus conditions the narrative of his <I>Universal
Geography.</I> Reclus, in his introduction of 1876, writes that Europe's
"inhabitants, whatever their failings and vices, or their state of
barbarism in some respects, still impel the rest of mankind as regards
material and mental progress."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Progress" for Reclus, of course, has a different political
significance than for the curricular "Instruction" (or its likely English
readers). That very difference, however, draws attention to the importance
for geography of the definitional confusion over the term "culture" in
the formulations "European culture" and "world-wide culture." For Reclus,
"first place" (<I>UG,</I> 3) is accorded to Europe, the historical and
geographical formation of whose "material and mental progress" is made
the narrative condition for a "universal" geography. This eurocentric
imperative also informs the Berlin "Instruction," both in its explanation
for why special curricular emphasis is to be placed on the physical
geography of Europe, and in the implied synonymy of "European culture"
and "this world-wide culture" (<I>GE,</I> 111).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What gets blurred in the Berlin "Instruction"'s use of the term
"culture," however, is a hypothesis on which Reclus's "universal"
descriptive geography depends: that the "progress," or "laws of liberty,"
of Europe's historical development may be linked to the universal history
of humankind. This hypothesis of culture in the broadest sense might be
said to be the founding ideal of European historical geography. Johann
Gottfried Herder's <I>Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der
Menschheit</I> (1784-91) is a crucial antecedent. While attacking
the presumptive superiority of European culture, it made European
geography the condition for imagining what principle of development
or culture <I>(Bildung)</I> connects European culture with the history
of all humankind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The connection between the two remains
a hypothesis for a whole range of nineteenth-century formulations
of culture. The multiplicity of senses that Raymond Williams has
shown to accrue around this keyword depends, moreover, on a complex
translation effect, by which, for example, Matthew Arnold translates the
German idealist notion of <I>Bildung</I> as culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 The
specifically geographical formulation of eurocentrism in this hypothesis
of culture conditions many of the most ambitious nineteenth-century
narratives; G. W. F. Hegel's <I>Philosophy of History</I>, Henry Thomas
Buckle's <I>History of Civilization</I>, and Karl Marx's <I>Capital</I>
are some of the more influential.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The rhetoric of Mackinder's call for a "new geography" is shaped around
the ambiguous legacy of this older geography, hence the "duty" of the
geographer to make a "bridge" over the "abyss" that is "upsetting the
equilibrium of our culture." What

<B></B>

makes Mackinder such a revealing
re in the crisis of legitimation at the turn of the century is how
he attempts to remodel the old into the new imperialist vision. If his
crucial talent as a synthesizer of knowledge enabled him to reproduce the
theoretical arguments of Ratzel while masking their real consequences
for the discipline of geography, it also enabled him to abbreviate the
emancipatory narrative claims of that earlier "universal" geography
embodied in the work of Reclus.

Outlining his "geographical philosophy" in 1908, Mackinder wrote:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When you have got your myriad facts, registered by the labour of all

but the blue sky, and the blue sea, and the brilliant sun. . . . You

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Confirming the rhetorical power of synthesis in Mackinder's "new
geography," this characteristic statement underscores the central place
of visualization in that rhetoric. Visualization, as Derek Gregory
argues, is at the foundation of the modern discipline of geography; its
"Cartesian perspectivalism" defines what O Tuathail, following Gregory,
argues is the key feature of Mackinder's "geopolitical gaze."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
In his series of geography textbooks, which reflect an ambitious attempt
to reshape all aspects of education from kindergarten to the university,
Mackinder sought to provide a solution for the problem Joyce formulates in
Stephen's encounter with his geography textbook.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 For Stephen
the geography textbook reveals a contestation of political perspectives
through the colors green and maroon, which his school-mate Fleming has
used to illustrate the picture of the world, and which Stephen associates
with the colors of Davitt and Parnell: "He turned over the flyleaf and
looked wearily at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon
clouds. He wondered which was right, to be for the green or for the
maroon, because Dante had ripped the green velvet back off the brush that
was for Parnell one day with her scissors and had told him that Parnell
was a bad man" (<I>PA,</I> 16). If for Mackinder the geography textbook
ought to resolve such contradictions, simultaneously instructing the
pupil "what politics meant" and "where the universe ended," Mackinder's
emphasis on the formative imaginative experience of the child's "varying
at will the pattern seen" nonetheless draws attention to a process of
"play" in visualization reminscent of the auditory, verbal, and visual
play inaugurated by Stephen's "green wothe."

Some of the founding ambiguities of Mackinder's "geographical philosophy"
emerge in his most important geography textbook, <I>Britain and the
British Seas</I> . The influential first chapter, "The Position of
Britain," provides a revealing illustration

<B></B>

of how he uses the visual
aid of the map. In the process, he abbreviates, almost subliminally, a
whole history of geographic representation from classical antiquity to
the present, in which the position of Britain shifts from the periphery
to the center of the world:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Before the great geographical discoveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, the known lands lay almost wholly in the Northern Hemisphere
and spread in a single continent from the shores of Spain to those of
Cathay. Britain was then at the end of the world--almost out of the
world. . . . During two thousand years Britain was at the margin, not in
the centre, of the theatre of politics, and for most practical purposes
her position was accurately shown in the maps of the Greek geographers

maps abbreviates, diagrams, and illustrates a history of geographical
exploration as a history of the world. The text sustains the argument
about the position of Britain, although it has modulated into an argument
about how the "globe-wide" world may best be viewed, geographically and
historically, from the point of view of Britain (<I>BS,</I> 13). This
modulation becomes complete when the text completes the sequence of
res by reference to a "photograph of a globe showing the true form
of the North Atlantic" (<I>BS,</I> 5):

Europe, Asia, Africa, and the two Americas are thus included within the
visible hemisphere; but the chief feature even of the land-half of the
globe is a great arm of mediterranean ocean, Atlantic and Arctic, winding
north-ward . . . . No flat chart can give a correct impression of the
form of the North Atlantic. Only a globe can suggest its vast bulging
centre, and the relative insignificance of its Arctic, Mediterranean,
and Caribbean recesses [<A HREF="5.3gogwilt_7.html"> 7</A>]. . . . For most purposes, therefore,
the North Atlantic is a rounded basin, with eastward, northward, and
westward gulfs, and a southern exit. But the five historic parts of
the world are accessible from its waters, and for the generations that
followed Columbus history centred increasingly round its shores. Thus
Britain gradually became the central, rather than the terminal land of
the world. [<I>BS,</I> 1-4]

The effect of this series of images is to produce an argument seemingly

 If, as Tuathail argues,
Mackinder's "conscious reaction" to "new technological developments like

results is founded on a thoroughgoing ambiguity, displacing geography's
"Cartesian perspectivalism" within a discursive frame of reference
that includes the simultaneous emergence of high modernism and mass

Mackinder's use of maps stands in revealing contrast to that of Ratzel,
whose idea of the <I>"Oecumene"</I> Mackinder cites to formulate
the expression "globe-wide world."

<B></B>

At the end of volume 2 of
<I>Anthropogeographie</I>, Ratzel presents a "classificatory map of
humankind in the framework of the <I>Oecumene"</I> (<A HREF="5.3gogwilt_8.html"> 8</A>) to indicate
what he has called "the anthropogeographical picture <I>(Bild)</I> of
humankind" depicting the spread of different peoples throughout history
over the surface of the earth (<I>A,</I> 470-71). Emphasizing the
difficulty of representing, without distortion, the true geographical
"picture" or "image" <I>(Bild)</I> of humankind, Ratzel invokes the
model of realist pictoral perspective:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
To the geographical image/picture of humankind belong, besides the
horizontal distribution that we determine through the depiction of the
boundaries of the <I>Oecumene,</I>

<B></B>

and the shadings of distribution

humankind are ordered one behind the other according to historical age,
and the heights to which better-positioned or culturally better-equipped
peoples have risen.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ratzel's imaginary picture illustrates the problem of human perspective
that must vanish in the production of the geopolitical image. As Mackinder
turns Ratzel's anthropogeographical picture of the world into his
"globe-wide" world, the question of anthropology disappears. Mackinder's
geopolitical image thus constitutes the riddling afterimage of all
those attempts to systematize and explain human history as the cultural
development of all humankind.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Much of Mackinder's political geography, and geopolitics generally, may be
derived from the striking juxtaposition of the ancient map of the world,
with the Mediterranean in the center, and the world map organized with an
"eye" on Britain. The formalist logic of this play on the visual image
is most evident in the middle two maps of the four-part sequence. Here,
without the distraction of the details on the medieval map or the claim
to realism in the photograph of the globe, there is a stark contrast
of black against white. The black and white spaces of the ancient map
effect, indeed, a momentary confusion

<B></B>

 while the eye sorts out the
relation of black, corresponding to land, and white corresponding to
water; a correspondence that is confirmed as one turns to the continents
and oceans of the global vision. This perceptual play of re against
ground is reminiscent of the perceptual experiments in literary and
artistic modernism discussed by Fredric Jameson in <I>The Political
Unconscious</I> and Rosalind Krauss in <I>The Optical Unconscious.</I>
If the formalist play of re and ground results in what Jameson calls
the modernist "declaration of independence of the image as such," the
modernist logic of this "optical unconscious," in Krauss's terms, is as
applicable to Mackinder's political geography as it is to what Jameson
traces in the "perceptual vocation" of Joseph Conrad's "sensorium" and
to what Krauss traces to the origins of abstract art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 It
is according to such a logic that Mackinder establishes a central aspect
of his political geography, the interplay of sea-power and land-power.

The reversal of re against ground is by no means incidental to
the overall argument. In  4 the <I>land</I> is white, and the sea
black, something that surely contributes to the initial confusion of
looking across to the blank spaces of the sea and the blackened land
masses of <A HREF="5.3gogwilt_2.html"> 2</A>. Similarly, the
curious effect of the photograph of a
globe is, in part, produced by the visual contrast of white continents
and black seas, juxtaposed with the white seas and black continents
of the preceding image. This alternating pattern produces a formalist

ambiguity, not only in the sense that what stands out as re 

<B></B>

 in
the one map--the shape of continents--becomes ground in another map, but
also in the sense that on any one map re and ground might be reversed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The visual trick of what might be called an unconscious optics of
geopolitics serves to place the image of Britain in particular relation
to that educational and formalist imperative of the child's "varying at
will the pattern seen." Concluding the argument of his first chapter,
Mackinder writes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Seen thus in relation to earlier and to later history, Britain
is possessed of two geographical qualities, complementary rather
than antagonistic: insularity and universality. Before Columbus, the
insularity was more evident than the universality. . . . After Columbus,
value began to attach to the ocean-highway, which is in its nature
universal. [<I>BS,</I> 11]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is good reason to recognize here, if not the central paradigm
of geopolitics, at least one of its most characteristic abbreviations
of world history. It constitutes the rhetorical power of the opening
to Mackinder's 1904 address to the Royal Geographical Society, "The
Geographical Pivot of History," in the argument that, "from the present
time forth, in the post-Columbian age, we shall again have to deal with
a closed political system, and none the less that it will be one of
world-wide scope" (<I>SM,</I> 30).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Virtually the same abbreviation of world history accompanies what
is probably the first use of the word "geopolitics" in the English
language. In the same year that <I>Britain and the British Seas</I>
was published, Emil Reich, the Hungarian-born historian who settled in
England in the 1890s, gave special emphasis to the term in his review
of the monumental <I>Cambridge Modern History.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Nor
is Reich's "geo-political" an isolated formulation, since it recurs in
his noted <I>Foundations of Modern Europe</I> , and again in the
two-volume <I>Handbook of Geography</I> , whose opening chapter
closely follows the shape of Mackinder's argument.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Reich
reiterates Mackinder in arguing that "English history falls, from the
geo-political point of view, naturally into two divisions, prae-Columbian
history and post-Columbian history."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Reproducing this
paradigmatic abbreviation of world history, Reich codifies Mackinder's
"position of Britain" as a specifically geopolitical image.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

Reclus's Social Geography, the Image of the State, and the Hegemony
of Europe
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even as Emil Reich was codifying Mackinder's "position of Britain" as a
specifically geopolitical image, a very different reading of Britain's
unique position was being advanced by Elis&eacute;e Reclus in his last
monumental work, <I>L'Homme et la terre</I>. As Reclus argued in the
final volume's analysis of contemporary history, Britain occupies a
unique position because "Each movement of the British Isles, which
little England symbolises, has its repercussions throughout the entire
world."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Entitled "England and its Cort&egrave;ge," Reclus's
analysis of British imperialism emphasizes the

<B></B>

contradiction around
which Mackinder's geopolitical image of Britain is shaped: "The life of
the nation finds itself thus split and determined, in certain respects,
by a contradictory politics, since it must act all at once to safeguard
the ferocious insularity of the homeland, and ever more actively to
maintain its relation to its colonies in order to assure the means of
conquest and domination over tributaries spread in all parts of the earth"
(<I>Ht,</I> 6:1-2). Reclus's alternative reading of the "position
of Britain"--based, indeed, on a rereading of the opening chapter of
<I>Britain and the British Seas</I>--calls attention to the fundamental
ambiguity of Mackinder's geopolitical image. (<I>Ht,</I> 4:460)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If that image seems singularly fixed on the British nation-state,
the fascination with its fixed position on the world map is not a
result of the Britishness of the image, but rather the potential
global rearrangement of the world and of world history that it makes
imaginable. To be sure, Mackinder's <I>Britain and the British Seas</I>
is fairly explicitly premised on projecting the political unity of the
British state and its Empire--thus the "geographical qualities" of
"insularity" and "universality" are said to be "complementary." The
very terms, however, in which Mackinder attempts to resolve the split
imperatives of national sovereignty and imperial power call attention all
the more clearly both to that contradiction and its attendant political
instability. Mackinder's imperialist geopolitical image is not only
haunted by Reclus's anarchist geopolitics; its very power depends on
the anarchist thesis that the nation-state is a merely transitory form,
a thesis that geopolitics articulates in the ambiguous imperialism and
anarchism of its own image.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mackinder's heartland thesis, while appearing to make the "pivot" of
history something objectively given by global, physical conditions--the
dichotomy of land and sea, and the distribution of the continents--is
an extended argument for welding the British nation to its imperial
system.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 What gives the "geographical pivot of history"
strategic interest, after all, is not the fixed position of the state
within a set global order, but rather the very instability of political
forms in a changing international "balance of powers."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The principles of "social geography" that enable Reclus to redirect
Mackinder's geopolitical image toward a critical analysis of conquest
and domination have a striking resemblance to later marxist theories,
particularly from Lenin onward, of imperialism, uneven development, and
the global reach of capital. In this radical socialist sense, as Yves
Lacoste argues, <I>L'Homme et la terre</I> anticipates twentieth-century
critiques of imperialism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Reclus outlines these principles
in his introduction to <I>L'Homme et la terre,</I> "'Class struggle,'
the quest for equilibrium, and the sovereignty of the individual's
self-determination <I>(la d&eacute;cision souveraine de l'individu)</I>,
these are three types of phenomena that are revealed to us in the study
of <I>social geography</I> and which, in the chaos of things, prove
sufficiently constant for us to be able to give them the name of 'laws'"
(<I>Ht,</I> 1:iv). Among the many striking points to emerge from these
"laws" is the way "class struggle" and "the search for equilibrium" both
follow from the splitting of all human collectivities as the result of
"an unequal development" (<I>Ht,</I> 1:iv).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The anarchist politics informing these laws explains not only the
"repression" of Reclus in the formation of academic geography, but also
his rejection by marxists, for whom "the sovereignty of the individual,"
for example, would have been suspect in its utopian refusal to engage in
a politics of wresting control of the state.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Consigned to
the utopian nowhere of nineteenth-century anarchism, Reclus's geography
nonetheless illuminates the persistence with which the ambiguities of
nineteenth-century ideas of progress, evolution, and culture shape the
formation of twentieth-century geopolitical paradigms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most revealing is the insistence with which Reclus sustains the
eurocentric imperative for hypothesizing the connection between European
culture and the cultural development of human history as a whole. The
narrative condition of the <I>Universal Geography</I>'s emphasis on the
"moral ascendancy and industrial preponderance" of Europe had depended on
the ambiguous, utopian future condition that "equality will obtain in the
end" and "what we call civilisation will have 'its centre everywhere, its
periphery nowhere'" (<I>UG,</I> 3-4). Between the completion of the
<I>Universal Geography</I> and work on <I>L'Homme et la terre,</I> Reclus
reformulated the terms of this future "equilibrium" to argue, in an essay
entitled "The Hegemony of Europe" , that Europe had become "the
centre of equilibrium between the forces of the human race."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reclus's notion of "hegemony" is premised on a eurocentric articulation
of the accelerated unification of the world under the forces of global
capital. Such forces involve a process of "Europeanisation"; all parts
of the world, he writes in <I>L'Homme et la terre,</I> are being drawn
into "the atmosphere of a general culture, of a predominantly European
type" (<I>Ht,</I> 2:139). The ambiguities with which Reclus formulates
the connection between European culture and the global strategies of
domination and conquest come close to the leverage Antonio Gramsci gives
his key concept of "hegemony"--in the outline, for instance, of his
"Hegemony of Western Culture over the Whole World Culture."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
The affinities are interesting to note since Gramsci's concept of
"hegemony" has played a particularly important role in current cultural
studies, opening nineteenth-century formulations of "culture" to
anticolonial contestations of eurocentric assumptions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reclus's perspective is necessarily eurocentric, but its relevance
for his analysis of the means of imperial conquest and domination
sheds light on the conceptual riddle of culture that haunts
the imperialist formation of geopolitics. Mackinder's ambiguous
evaluation of the success and "fatal momentum" of "<I>Kultur,</I> or
<I>Strategical mentality</I>"--anticipating later repudiations of Nazi
<I>Geopolitik</I>--now suggests that Mackinder's political geography
is constructed to condense and displace the connection between European
culture and military strategy. This is necessary for Mackinder's imperial
geography because what for Reclus is only implicit in the formulation of
"Europe's hegemony"--anticolonial contestation of European culture--is
what imperialism seeks to make unconscious. In this sense the geopolitical
image might be considered the shared dreamwork--"Europe's hegemony"--of
both anarchism and imperialism.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Something of the spirit of Reclus's conception of Europe's hegemony
shows through in his remarks on the effects of "Europeanisation" on the
"citizen of the world:"

<BLOCKQUOTE>

drinks coffee which is harvested by the Negroes or the Malaysians, dresses
himself in material made from American fibre, uses devices which are the
product of the combined work of a thousand inventors of every time and
race, experiences the sentiments and the thoughts which millions of men
experience with him from one end of the world to the other.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In what sense the "sentiments" and "thoughts" of this cosmopolitan "he"
might be "experienced" by millions of other men and women remains, of
course, open. This is precisely the sort of question that Mackinder's
geopolitical image of Britain seeks to foreclose through formalist
abstraction. The place of Reclus in the formation of geopolitics provides
a reminder that this foreclosure is, in fact, an open question that not
only haunts, but that also determines any reading of the geopolitical
image.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mackinder's "new geography" is clearly premised on the politics of the
"new imperialism." Nonetheless, <I>Britain and the British Seas,</I>
whose "idea," Mackinder notes, "was first suggested to me by the needs
of some foreign students visiting Britain" (<I>BS,</I> vi), can only
ever reiterate the "play" of the pupil's imaginative "varying at will
the pattern seen." For all the ocularcentrism of Mackinder's geography,
and geopolitics generally, the geopolitical image is always open to the
fullest kind of contested cultural play. The "green wothe" of Joyce's
infant artist is one example, but there are many more. Another touchstone
of literary modernism, Gertrude Stein's <I>Geography and Plays</I>
, is full of such examples--both in its title, and in its most
celebrated line from the poem "Sacred Emily": "Rose is a rose is a rose
is a rose."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Like Stephen's "green wothe," this "signature
phrase" for Stein's experimental literary modernism might also be read as
an exemplary geopolitical image, particularly in the extended use to which
Stein put it in her children's book about the nine-year-old girl Rose in
<I>The World in Round</I> .
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Used as an epigraph to
that book, the formalist play of the phrase and its circular ambiguity
("rose is . . ." or "a rose is . . .") both illustrates and contests
the elementary geographical fact that "the world is round."

Imaginary Institutions of Geography
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The formation of "geopolitics" over the turn of the century is not
a history of geographical institutions. It is, rather, the story of
imaginary institutions of geography. Indeed, the foundation in 1923
of Karl Haushofer's famous <I>Institut f&uuml;r Geopolitik</I> turns
out, as O Tuathail so well describes, to be a myth, an "imaginary"
embellishment on German geopolitical theories that reveals perhaps more
about the "unconscious fears and fantasies" of U.S. political discourse
than it does about the role of

<B></B>

<I>Geopolitik</I> in shaping Nazi
policy. (<I>CG,</I> 114) Far from suggesting that geopolitical theories
have no effect on the real world, what this imaginary geopolitical
institute underscores is the fact that the influence of geopolitics
persists long after its failed institution as a "science."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The history of geopolitics traced here is a genealogy of an imaginary
institution whose contours are defined not only by the reactionary
politics of European imperialism, but also by the emancipatory politics
of European socialism and anarchism. Perhaps no image captures the
spirit of the moment in which geopolitics took shape better than the
Great Globe proposed by Elis&eacute;e Reclus for the World Exhibition of
1900. Exceeding both the scale and spectacle of previous globes, such
as the one built for the Great Exhibition in 1851, Reclus's "dream
monument" sought to achieve a scientific precision in geographic
measurement, description, and representation after the pattern of
Enlightenment ideals, rationalism, and scientific inquiry.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
In the elaborate scaffolding of galleries, ladders, and elevators
necessary for its exhibition, it offers a striking illustration of
Timothy Mitchell's thesis that the apparatus of nineteenth-century
representation and its "metaphysic of modernity" constructs "the
world-as-exhibition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 It is, indeed, a perfect example
of those ambiguous "dream images" of the nineteenth century discussed
in Walter Benjamin's "Paris, Capital of the Nineteenth Century," from
which Mitchell draws to reformulate Martin Heidegger's "age of the
world picture."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This image encapsulates the ambiguity with which geopolitics is formed
by the rejection and incorporation of nineteenth-century forms of
representation. In presenting his project at the Sixth International
Geographical Congress in London in 1895, Reclus suggested the accuracy
of relief might make the Globe a model for the photographic reproduction
of maps, possibly creating "a complete revolution in the cartographic
industry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Mackinder's photograph of a globe, the last
in the sequence of images demonstrating the position of Britain,
is an interesting modification of Reclus's ideal. Anticipating
late twentieth-century satellite images of the earth from space, its
characteristically nineteenth-century fascination with the photographic
image illustrates the turn-of-the-century optics around which the
geopolitical image constitutes its modernist perspective.

Mackinder's respect for Reclus's work is indicated, albeit
ambiguously, by the inclusion of Reclus in a series he was editing. The
title of the series, <I>The Regions of the World,</I> already suggests
Mackinder's own abbreviation of the encyclopedic reach of an earlier
geography. In the prospectus Reclus is listed as a contributor entrusted
with the region <I>Western Europe and the Mediterranean.</I> In the end,
Reclus's work and that of his fellow anarchist geographer Kropotkin never
appeared. It is nonetheless revealing that, when Mackinder published his
own contribution, <I>Britain and the British Seas</I> in 1902, Reclus, at
that time both well-known as a geographer and notorious as an anarchist,
red so prominently in Mackinder's editorial vision. It points to the
shaping presence, albeit edited, of an anarchist geography and politics
in the reactive formation of geopolitics.

31. Lyotard's argument traces two major versions of this narrative. The
first, "more political" one whose subject is "humanity as the hero of
liberty"  is associated with the politics of French primary education;
Lyotard traces the second "more philosophical"  version back to the
ideals of German education/culture <I>(Bildung)</I> as instituted with
Wilhelm von Humboldt's foundation of the University of Berlin. What
Lyotard suggestively calls the <I>"Bildung</I>-effect<I>"</I> of the
second higher educational ideal of "the disinterested pursuit of learning"
 has a particular bearing on what I call here the hypothesis of
culture in the most general sense. A <I>"Bildung</I>-effect,<I>"</I>
for example, shapes Matthew Arnold's notion of culture in <I>Culture
and Anarchy.</I> Already evident in Arnold's translation of the ideal
of German <I>Bildung</I> is the attempted combination of the politics of
primary education and the political contradictions of higher educational
ideals. If Reclus's unwavering insistence on the quest for liberty
suggests Lyotard's first "narrative of freedom," Reclus, a student of
Carl Ritter's at Berlin, also held to the ideals of that second, "more
philosophical" narrative associated with the model of German higher
education. The hero, for Reclus, was <I>both</I> science <I>and</I>
liberty.

Buckle's <I>History of Civilization in England</I>, noted for its
emphasis on the influence of geography on human history, provides a useful
point of reference for the geographical formulation of eurocentrism:
"looking at the history of the world, as a whole, the tendency
has been, in Europe, to subordinate nature to man; out of Europe to
subordinate man to nature. . . . The great division, therefore, between
European civilization and non-European civilization, is the basis of the
philosophy of history" (Henry Thomas Buckle, <I>History of Civilization
in England</I> [1857; London: Oxford University Press, 1911], 1;115). The
formulation is a particularly useful point of reference for a great many
liberal versions of the hypothesis of culture, perhaps especially in that
it suggests the highly unstable, imaginary anchor of eurocentrism for
nineteenth-century narratives. I shall pursue this point in a further
stage of the current project, turning to the form of narrative not yet

Mitchell's reformulation of Heidegger reads as follows:
"Non-Europeans encountered in Europe what one might call, echoing a
phrase from Heidegger, the age of the world exhibition, or rather, the
world-as-exhibition. World exhibition here refers not to an exhibition
of the world but to the world conceived and grasped as though it were
an exhibition" (<I>Colonising Egypt,</I> 13). This final phrase, in
particular, applies well to Reclus's account of the scaffolding needed to
exhibit the Globe. In his project for the Great Globe, presented at the
Sixth International Geographical Congress of 1895 held in London, Reclus
conceived of a <I>second</I> globe, framing the scientific globe, in
order to protect it from the weather (Reclus, "Project," 629-30). We
might thus note that Gregory's reproduction of the 1897 illustration for
the Paris World Exhibition of 1900 in fact represents only one part of
the extraordinary utopian project, and, notably, the form imagined for
exhibition. This form <I>leaves out</I> the actual globe, not only in its
display of the outer model, but also in conceiving the inner vault as the
screen for the projection of a vast panorama. See Gregory's description
and illustration in <I>Geographical Imaginations</I>, 38.

An intense new scholarly interest in the culture of modernist cities
has captured the imagination of our fin de si&egrave;cle--the Paris
of Baudelaire and Manet; the Vienna of Freud and the secession; the
Berlin of dada, Brecht, and D&ouml;blin; the New York of the Harlem
Renaissance. No doubt such interest arose almost naturally out of
imaginatively cross-disciplinary endeavors within the academy, but at
least subliminally it gained its momentum from the widespread contemporary
obsessions with issues of cultural memory. In the case of Vienna, which
caught the American imagination in the new gilded age of the 1980s
both as a plethora of cultural riches and as a secret warning about
the end of liberal culture, there was the added fascination of what was
best embodied in the title of the big French Vienna show, "The Joyous
Apocalypse."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 At the same time, much of this newer work
on metropolitan culture seems energized by a pervasive sense of loss
at a time when such major Western cities are caught in a maelstrom of
transformations that make it desirable to hold on to an afterimage of
these prototypically modernist cities and to fix that image in memory
before the owl of Minerva completes its flight.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My larger claim in this essay is that issues of vision and visuality
should be central concerns for literary scholars working as cultural
historians. I hope to show through a set of examples that vision is a
key aspect of the literary project of Vienna modernism.

<B></B>

 The dark
underside of Vienna's celebrated visual culture, manifest in painting,
design, and architecture, becomes visible in literary works rarely
studied in terms of their deployment of visual metaphors or of the role
that the visual plays in their narratives.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fin-de-si&egrave;cle Vienna literature is famous first and foremost for
intense explorations of the problematics of language, its shortcomings and
failures, and its role in the constitution of individual subjectivity and
social identities. The focus on language as a medium as it characterizes
the work of writers and intellectuals as diverse as Hugo von Hofmannsthal
and Arthur Schnitzler; Ernst Mach and Karl Kraus; Fritz Mauthner and
Sigmund Freud; Ludwig Wittgenstein and Robert Musil has always been
recognized as Vienna's major contribution to modernism in an international
field. In German literary criticism, Hofmannsthal's "The Letter of Lord
Chandos"  has become canonical as an articulation of the modernist
crisis of poetic language that underlies so much of twentieth-century
literature all the way to Jorge Luis Borges and Samuel Beckett, Paul
Celan, and Ingeborg Bachmann.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 The crisis of language was also
intimately linked to the dissolution and transformation of traditional
modes of narration. Austrian literature gave significant shape to several
of the most far-reaching narrative innovations of modernism: firstly,
variants of the narrated monologue <I>(erlebte Rede)</I>, most famously
in Franz Kafka, but also in Hofmannsthal's early stories from the 1890s;
and, secondly, the stream of consciousness in Schnitzler, who developed
the technique before Virginia Woolf, Marcel Proust, or James Joyce.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In research on classical modernism, this crisis of language was read
as questioning the very feasibility of poetic speech. It was usually
treated in isolation as an emblem for the aporias of literary modernism in
general: the inability to carry on a literary tradition, the difficulty
of securing a place for poetic language in a disenchanted world, and the
failure to communicate in a way that gives lasting form to the chaos of
life. These aporias in turn triggered the fervent desire for transcendence
in some hermetic "other" language (Hofmannsthal, Rainer Maria Rilke,
Kafka) and it led eventually to notions of a literature of silence,
or more recently, of unrepresentability. Just as high modernism in the
visual arts pursued the impossible dream of a pure visuality, modernist
literature harbored a desire for a pure language of poetic form. While
the crisis of language has also often been understood as a trigger for, or
part of, a crisis of identity and its overcoming (Hofmannsthal's Chandos,
Rilke's Malte, or, in a different way, Musil's Ulrich), the contemporary
discourse about subjectivity, language, and visuality has opened up a
new space for more precise theoretical readings of that link between the
crisis of language and identity crisis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Notions of the split
or decentered subject permit us to go beyond the traditional codings of
the modernist identity crisis as a binary opposition between a stable
ego or self versus ego loss or deindividualization (<I>Ich-Verlust</I>
or <I>Ent-ichung</I>). This older discourse of depersonalization and
ego disintegration, often cast in existentialist terms, was implicitly
built on assumptions of loss and nostalgia on the one hand and hopes for
reconstitution and redemption of self and identity on the other. Such
hopes have

<B></B>

been subjected to withering critiques from various
quarters, and today are difficult, at best, to sustain.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such earlier literary criticism also failed to see how issues of visuality
are central to the crisis of subjectivity articulated in literary texts
as the crisis of language. What I will call the disturbance of vision
flows from the experiences of urban life, and it is central to the issues
of class, gender, race, and sexuality that deeply troubled all of the
writers of the declining Habsburg Empire. Indeed, it seems plausible
to claim that the identity crises at the center of so much Viennese
literature are rooted in disturbances of vision that are anything but
merely optical phenomena.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this essay, I will offer three examples of the crisis of vision as
related to the problematic relation of language and narrative in Vienna
modernism--Hofmannsthal, Schnitzler, and Musil. Each is significantly
different from the others, but together they point to the centrality of
disturbances of the visual field in a rapidly modernizing urban culture
at and after the turn of the century.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When one hears about disturbed vision, one thinks not necessarily
about the city, but about dreams, projections, and hallucinations,
doppelg&auml;nger, spectres, phantasms, and the like. This discourse
inevitably leads to the Freudian uncanny (<I>das Unheimliche</I>)
and Freud's reading of the threat to eyesight in Hoffmann's <I>Der
Sandmann</I> as fear of castration. Not surprisingly, Freud's analysis
focuses on the space of the home and of family life as the originary space
for disturbed vision. In that focus, Freud is significantly different
from the literary examples I have in mind, where the disturbances of
vision emerge primarily from encounters with the public, social world
and in city streets. In Freud's text, public space as a threat to visual
mastery does, however, appear at one point where he recounts a personal
experience of the uncanny as repetition compulsion:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Once, as I was walking through the deserted streets of a provincial
town in Italy which was strange to me, on a hot summer afternoon, I
found myself in a quarter the character of which could not long remain
in doubt. Nothing but painted women were to be seen at the windows
of the small houses, and I hastened to leave the narrow street at
the next turning. But after having wandered about for a while without
being directed, I suddenly found myself back in the same street, where
my presence was now beginning to excite attention. I hurried away once
more, but only to arrive yet a third time by devious paths in the same
place. Now, however, a feeling overcame me which I can only describe as
uncanny, and I was glad enough to abandon my exploratory walk and get
straight back to the piazza I had left a short while ago.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This passage contains key elements of that which interests me. The
experience of the uncanny, which always threatens identity, emerges
from a foreign urban scene that is coded as "other." The loss of spatial
orientation is linked to the phenomenon

<B></B>

of being seen, of being in
the eye of the other. Urban space is coded as sexual, and the threat of
female sexuality emanates from the invisible interior of these little
houses. The disturbed <I>fl&acirc;neur</I> departs precipitously in the
scene described as well as in the text itself where Freud quickly turns
to the more innocuous example of losing one's orientation in the forest
fog; nature is refuge from an urban experience, which evidently had been
too close for comfort.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Hofmannsthal, a strikingly similar scene ends quite differently. But
before I get to this, let me first turn to two of Hofmannsthal's
fictions, "The Tale of the 672nd Night," a short text from 1895, and
"The Letter of Lord Chandos," the letter of a lord to his mentor and
patron Francis Bacon, which is one of the founding texts of literary
high modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Both texts appear in then-traditional forms
of short prose, the fairy tale and the letter. With their subject matter
displaced to the most unrealistic of literary genres, the fairy tale, and
to another time and geographic space (Renaissance England), respectively,
both texts begin with a description of an aesthetic existence typical
of the fin de si&egrave;cle. Lord Chandos is presented as a productive
artist and writer, whereas the aesthetic sensibility of the merchant's
son, the protagonist of the earlier tale, is entirely passive. Both
res, however, share the total immersion in what Hofmannsthal called
"preexistence," a kind of secularized, mystical, and cosmic union with
all creatures and things.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Chandos describes this blissful
state of mind before his breakdown: "In those days I, in a state of
continuous intoxication, conceived the whole of existence as one great
unit: the spiritual and physical worlds seemed to form no contrast, as
little as did courtly and bestial conduct, art and barbarism, solitude
and society; in everything I felt the presence of Nature; and in all
expressions of Nature I felt myself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 The merchant's son, on
the other hand, gains access to this state only after he has withdrawn
entirely from society, thus making preexistence a secondary rather than
primary phenomenon and marking it as aesthetic decadence in the vein of
J. K. Huysmans' <I>A Rebours</I>, but with a historicist twist:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Gradually his eyes were opened to the fact that all the shapes and
colors of the world were embodied in the things of his household. In
the intertwining of [ornaments] he came to recognize an enchanted image
of the interlocking wonders of the world. . . . For a long time he was
intoxicated by [t]his great profound beauty that belonged to him, and
all his days moved more beautifully and less emptily in the company of
these household things, which were no longer anything dead or commonplace
but a great heritage, the divine work of all the generations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This passage, of course, represents the withdrawal of the aesthete into
the ivory tower. One is reminded of what Freud much later described as
the "oceanic feeling", and the specific dimension of aesthetic narcissism
is obvious.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 It is equally clear that Hofmannsthal's state of
preexistence, with its blurring of boundaries between inside and outside,
past and present, <I>Ich</I> and <I>Nicht-Ich</I>, already departs
radically from the traditional mode of seeing as coded in Renaissance
perpectivalism and in the Cartesian separation of body and mind. There
is no longer a stable seeing subject

<B></B>

that looks at an object. Where
the seeing I/eye is dissolved in such secularized, mystical experience,
death is never very far away; the psychic breakdown is predetermined. In
the case of the merchant's son, "Yet he felt the emptiness of all these
things as well as their beauty. Never did the thought of death leave
him for long." ("672," 283)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Chandos's life after his breakdown, which deprives him of the ability
to speak or to write, is also characterized by feelings of vacuity and
inner stagnation, despondency and feebleness--the inevitable death-like
depression that follows the manic upsurge of an aestheticized <I>unio
mystica</I>. ("LLC," 138, 133) Once one reads beyond the initial
description of Chandos's loss of the ability to speak and to think
coherently and referentially (words "crumbled in my mouth like mouldy
fungi" ["LLC," 134]), the issue of visuality emerges at the center of what
has been described as his crisis of language and of depersonalization:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
My mind compelled me to view all things . . . from an uncanny
closeness. As once, through a magnifying glass, I had seen a piece of
skin on my little finger look like a field full of holes and furrows, so
I now perceived human beings and their actions. I no longer succeeded in
comprehending them with the simplifying eye of habit. For me everything
disintegrated into parts, those parts again into parts; no longer would
anything let itself be encompassed by one idea. Single words floated
around me; they congealed into eyes which stared at me and into which I
was forced to stare back--whirlpools which gave me vertigo and, reeling
incessantly, led into the void. ["LLC," 134f.]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the state of preexistence was already characterized by a dissolution
of a controlled Renaissance visuality, then we have here another kind of
disruption of visuality that Lacan has described as the split between the
eye and the gaze. Similar to Lacan's sardine can floating on the water
and returning his look with a ray of reflected sunlight, words stare back
at Chandos, who is forced, as if by some magical power, to return the
gaze, thus being reduced to an image or object and losing his subjecthood
in a whirlpool. If seeing is mastery, then being seen denies precisely
such mastery since the seen body is objectified in the other's field of
vision. The Lacanian paranoia of the gaze appears here in the relation
between Chandos and language. Key to the crisis of language is thus not
just the linguistic falling apart of sign and referent, which now appears
more as a side effect. Rather, Chandos's subjection to the gaze denies
not only a stable subjectivity (as it does in Lacan), but also destroys
for good the possibility of an aesthetic immersion in preexistence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At this point, we can see more clearly just how the "Tale" complements
the later "Letter" in crucial ways. Only if we read the "Tale" together
with the "Letter" do we get full access to the social and urban dimension
of this disturbance of vision. As with Chandos, the merchant's son's
loss of preexistence and his descent into mental collapse is triggered
by a dark and sinister force that cuts across his field of vision. As
with Chandos, the gaze represents an absolute and opaque alterity
threatening aesthetic subjectivity. Contrary to Chandos, being seen has
definite social parameters in

<B></B>

the "Tale." The awareness of being
seen by his servants first makes the merchant's son reflect upon their
fate as separate from his (no mystical union here between master and
slave). Increasingly, however, these eyes of the other become aggressive
and force upon him an acknowledgment of his own "deepest being, his secret
human inadequacy" ("672," 287). Then, on a trip from his country house in
the mountains back to the heat-stricken city where he has some unsettling
business, we find him in a situation reminiscent of the Freud passage:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Curiously, like a stranger, he walked through the familiar streets and
came at last to the banks of a little river, which at this time of year
was virtually dry. From here, lost in thought, he followed a shabby
street inhabited by a large number of prostitutes. Without paying much
attention where he was going, he then turned to the right and entered
a completely deserted, deathly still cul-de-sac, which ended in a steep
stairway almost as tall as a tower. ["672," 289]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Climbing up this staircase he enters into a surreal urban
space, threatening and unknown: "He climbed higher and at the top
entered a quarter of the city that he could not recall having seen
before. Nonetheless, an intersection of low-lying streets suddenly struck
him with dreamlike familiarity" ("672," 289). In this space the merchant's
son now has a series of hallucinatory experiences, all of them uncanny and
distorted repetitions of events and encounters from his earlier life. A
mutation of one of his female servants, sexually alluring and carrying
two statues of oriental, Medusan goddesses, mysteriously appears to
him in a doubled mirror reflection in a pawn shop. Another servant, in
the shape of a four-year-old child who resembles the fifteen-year-old
girl servant in his home, stares at him aggressively through the panes
of an abandoned greenhouse before locking him in that greenhouse after
a hostile and wordless encounter. He tries to escape the horror of the
child's gaze and finds a secret door in the back of the greenhouse that
opens up into an even more surreal urban maze of walls and short pathways
leading nowhere. His only escape is a wooden plank perilously bridging
an abyss many stories deep. Close to physical and mental collapse,
he barely makes it across and eventually finds his way back down into
the city's netherworld. These unforgettably haunting pages encapsulate
the idea of an invisible and uncanny city space in which categories of
time and space become blurred and distorted, endangering the identity
of the body in space and of consciousness in time. It is a thoroughly
corporealized vision. The alien city space that threatens him with its
gaze and turns him into a helpless object becomes a space of memory
filled with nightmarish resemblances and revenants, too threatening to
read as mere dreams. When he finally does escape from this part of the
city in which both time and space have become totally destabilized, he
finds himself in another quarter alien to him, that of the lowly houses
where the soldiers live. In the final part of the story, he observes the
soldiers washing the hooves of their horses and is struck by the ugliness
of the horses and their "angry, rolling eyes" ("672," 295). Just when
he feels compassion and wants to give some money to one of the soldiers,
however, the force of the paralyzing gaze returns with a vengeance: "At
that moment the horse turned

<B></B>

its head and looked at him with ears
treacherously laid back and rolling eyes that looked even more angry and
wild because of a scar running straight across its ugly head just at the
level of the eyes. At this ugly sight he was struck with a lightning-like
memory of a long forgotten human face." ("672," 296) It is the Proustian
<I>m&eacute;moire involontaire</I> turned into a vision of horror: "And he
knew that it was the contorted face of an ugly poor man whom he had seen
a single time in his father's store. And that his face was contorted with
fear, because people were threatening him because he had a large gold
piece and would not say where he had gotten it." ("672," 296) At that
point, the horse gives the merchant's son a violent kick that results in
a humiliating death. "Finally he vomited bile, then blood, and died with
his features contorted, his lips so torn that his teeth and gums were
laid bare, giving him an alien, threatening expression." ("672," 297) In
death his face assumes the horse's expression, just as the sight of the
horse had triggered the memory of the poor man in his father's store. His
vision is not only temporally disrupted by the return of a repressed,
but there is also a literal merging of the seer with the seen, a kind of
grotesque mimesis in death that points to the ultimate humiliation of the
protagonist. Throughout this text, then, the experience of being looked at
undermines and threatens identity, and by the end of the story it emerges
clearly as a social experience, an individual encounter with a member
of the underclass in childhood and its lingering power in the merchant
son's imagination. This is the political unconscious that struggles to
the surface in the "Tale." It is thoroughly repressed in the "Letter,"
where the threat of being seen no longer emanates from the city and its
social realities, but rather from language, from the gaze of the words,
thus blocking the real, social source of the disturbance. It is hardly
a coincidence that Chandos's crisis does not end in death, but rather
in an attempt to reconstitute the aesthetic project, as it were, in a
minor key. The concluding passages articulate Lord Chandos's dream of
finding that radically "other" language, a dream which for too long has
been celebrated as the core of modernist literature.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So far, I have tried to restore the crisis of vision to the fabled
crisis of language held to be at the origin of modernist literature. I
would now like to link my textual analysis with some comments on Vienna
as a metropolitan space. What is striking in Hofmannsthal's text is
that the experience of being looked at has not just a social, but a
spatial dimension. Not only does the look of his servants undermine
the protagonist's sense of self, the urban experience itself becomes
increasingly threatening as he enters poorer and mysteriously unknowable
quarters that disrupt his spatial orientation. I would suggest that
the city as gaze brings him down, the city as an abyss, an unknown and,
to him, unknowable space. Here we enter into the specifics of Vienna's
urban plan and its spatial distribution of classes. Carl Schorske has
shown how the newly wealthy middle class of Vienna came to occupy the
urban development called the Ringstra&szlig;e that had been built in
the liberal era of the 1860s and 1870s and that is often compared to
Baron Haussmann's Parisian boulevards.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The Ring was a wide,
circular swath of land that had formerly served as a fortification of
the old city and its political center, the Imperial Palace. In its new
incarnation, the

<B></B>

Ring project included on the one hand official
buildings such as a new city hall, a parliament building, a theater,
and the university. They all were built in a variety of historicist
styles, facing a broad, circular corso in perpetual horizontal motion,
but lacking a clear spatial relation. On the other hand, behind this
spatially fuzzy and visually destabilizing medley of public buildings,
there were streets upon streets of representative apartment housing, the
so-called rent-palaces (<I>Mietpal&auml;ste</I>) of the bourgeoisie. The
circular layout of the Ringstra&szlig;e was visually directed inwards,
toward the old city center, and thus it still served as a kind of
fortification, now in a social rather than a military sense. The
Ringstra&szlig;e enclosed the upper-class areas of the city, separating
them from the rapidly expanding lower-middle-class, proletarian, and
subproletarian <I>(Vorst&auml;dte)</I>. While such divisions existed
in other nineteenth-century cities as well, the situation in Vienna is
unique since the sociological separation was given direct architectural
expression in the layout of the Ringstra&szlig;e. If all the structures
of the Ring were visually oriented toward the center, i.e., toward the
Imperial Palace, then Vienna's bourgeoisie had its back to the popular
classes of the <I>Vorst&auml;dte</I> while directing its social and
cultural look toward the old imperial aristocracy and the emperor. The
Viennese bourgeoisie, the political carrier of Austrian liberalism,
was literally located in the ocular crossfire of an aristocracy that
it tried to imitate but that mostly despised it, and a working class
that it experienced as a threat. Inside the circular and constricted
space of the Ring, seeing and being seen exhibited an inevitable social
pathology. Displaying its taste and wealth, the bourgeoisie sought the
eye of the aristocracy, but repressed or foreclosed the look of the
popular classes, which thereby became that opaque and ubiquitous threat
encountered in Hofmannsthal's "Tale."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The habits of young Vienna's artists and writers reflected this
reality. Rarely did they venture out into the <I>Vorst&auml;dte</I>, which
remained closed territories, spaces of imagined threats, "dark landscapes
near the tramway" characterized by their "heavy breath" and their
"obtuse and apathetic joylessness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 At the same time, these
authors were fully aware of how the <I>Vorst&auml;dte</I> represented
the ultimate threat to Vienna's literary culture, which was increasingly
visual and was represented by the movies. Early cinema in Vienna arose
exclusively in the <I>Vorst&auml;dte</I>, together with other new forms
of mass leisure activities (cabaret, soccer fields, popular gastronomic
sites, entertainment parks, etc.). As the <I>Vorst&auml;dte</I> expanded
quickly into formerly rural areas, rural modes of an oral culture with its
illiteracy blended with technologically new forms of urban culture such
as the cinema. In a short essay on film from 1921 entitled "Substitute
for Dreams," Hofmannsthal explains the success of the cinema in Vienna's
<I>Vorst&auml;dte</I> by citing the masses' fear of language, particularly
in its written form. He describes the <I>Vorst&auml;dte</I> as those "dark
nether regions into which no written word ever penetrates."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

The oral and the visual thus stood against the scriptural, and if one
considers further that much of the population influx into Vienna came
from the outlying and non-German speaking areas of the empire, one
gets a good sense of why the German-language writers felt increasingly
embattled, and why language became such a central concern in Vienna and
not in Berlin or in Munich.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Schnitzler's <I>Fr&auml;ulein Else</I>, a masterpiece of Vienna modernism
published in 1924, deals with the disturbances of vision and the gaze in
fundamentally different ways. Contrary to Hofmannsthal, the political
unconscious in <I>Fr&auml;ulein Else</I> is not deeply repressed,
but present on the surface in Else's stream of consciousness, to be
deciphered easily by the patient reader, though clearly not fully
accessible to the character herself. Contrary to what one often hears
about the stream-of-consciousness technique, it is usually much less
unconscious and less private, less transgressive and less liberatory
than literary critics make it out to be. Thus it is not surprising that
Else's inner monologue--garbled, chaotic, associationist, and riddled with
clich&eacute;s and hackneyed phrasings as it is--reveals her common sense,
and insight into her own situation: the social and moral strictures of
Vienna society that envelop young, unmarried women from good families;
her sexual desires that find only imaginary outlets; the dual morality
of Vienna society for men and for women; the ambiguous gift of her
extraordinary beauty; being spectacle as woman and self-conscious object
of the male gaze; the back-and-forth between an enforced exhibitionism
and an equally stringent command to withdraw from male advances; the
financial machinations and gambling of her lawyer-father, which she
understands only too well in terms of the risks they pose to her future;
the dilemma of loving her father but being able to help him only at
the price of self-abandonment; the precarious situation of her family's
Jewish background, which must be masked by strategies of assimilation. The
crisis of language exists here too, but in a very different mode. With
Else's incessant inner monologue, Schnitzler gives the reader access to
the enforced silence of a complex female re, not in order to help
her into self-articulation, but in order to lay bare the complex social
reasons for this silence. As Elisabeth Bronfen has pointed out, Else is
"in complicity with the fantasies and desires of her culture," and it
is precisely this complicity that splits her into appearance and being,
public silence and private verbosity, "actress and commentator, medium
and author."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Else's identity troubles are fundamentally
more modernist than those of the merchant's son, who never quite knows
what hit him, but hers is a modernism of complicity with society rather
than a modernism of resistance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Vision is the central problematic of Else's inability to speak
to her friends and family and to find an appropriate mode of
self-representation. On vacation in a mountain hotel, she receives a
desperate express letter from home pleading to save her father from
bankruptcy and jail by securing a sizeable loan from a Mr. Dorsday who
is vacationing at the same spot. Dorsday, a rich Viennese art dealer and
an old friend of the family, agrees under one condition: "And this time I
wish nothing more, Else, than--to see you."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Dorsday proposes,
that is, to see Else alone and naked. The gendered gaze, the gaze of
male desire and power, coupled with the financial transaction intended
to save her father, precipitates the crisis for Else as she attempts
to postpone the inevitable. This gaze, however, is firmly embedded
in the specific social conditions of male and female relationships in
fin-de-si&egrave;cle Vienna. All of Else's fantasies about amorous and
sexual encounters are predicated on her body's availability

<B></B>

as an
image to male sight. Much more could be said about this story, especially
about how this gaze is linked to Else's dreams and fantasies about death,
but the crisis of language here too is rooted in a disturbance in the
field of vision as it emerges from metropolitan life. Schnitzler's point
is not to present Else's haunted inner ramblings as the clinical case of a
hysteric. Rather, he links her inability to think and to express herself
coherently to the conflicting and insoluble demands placed on her as a
result of a young, middle-class woman's positioning in a gendered and
sexualized economy of vision and social status. Else's lack of control of
the visual field generates her increasingly frantic and desperate attempts
to regain control by verbally rehearsing her anticipated encounters with
Dorsday in her mind. She imagines how she might stage her naked body,
seeking a way to make it a public event rather than satisfying Dorsday's
private voyeurism, thus both fulfilling and negating the contract. When
she finally displays her naked body during a piano performance in the
hotel's music salon to the eyes of the assembled listeners (including
Dorsday), she has found that public articulation, but pays the price of
falling into a catatonic state in which she is finally deprived both of
the language of words and of her body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In <I>Fr&auml;ulein Else</I>, the loss of the eye's self-confidence in the
field of vision leads to the dispersed and chaotic use of language. By
using the stream-of-consciousness technique in which Else repeatedly
splits herself into first and third person, Schnitzler has found the
perfect literary form to express this dual crisis of language and
of visuality. He does it in such a way, however, that in the end the
reader is fully enlightened about Else's traumatic experience. While
she remains unable to construct a coherent and transparent narrative
of meaning, the reader is able to put all the pieces of Else's inner
monologue together. What at first sight appears to be an impenetrable
puzzle becomes by the end of the story fully lucid and transparent to the
reader. Else's complicity with her culture and society is successfully
transformed by Schnitzler into a radical critique of that society,
without, however, offering any strong sense of an alternative. The final
tableau of the story hovers between catatonia and death, with Else's
stream of consciousness fading to a trickle of half words and syllables
followed by ellipses of silence: "I'm flying . . . I'm dreaming . . . I'm
sleeping . . . I'm drea . . . drea--I'm fly . . . "

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Robert Musil's <I>Posthumous Papers of a Living Author</I>, a collection
of short prose pieces of varying lengths, treats the visual in yet
different ways. Like Schnitzler, who had pursued a medical career, Musil
was a man of Viennese enlightenment, rationalism, and science, but he
pushed beyond Schnitzler's rather pessimistic analysis of urban life
and of the disintegrating empire toward some sense of transcendence
and renewal, the famous "mysticism bright as daylight" of "the other
condition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 With Musil, we have yet another type of linkage
between language and vision. We get neither the paranoid vision of
Hofmannsthal's male subject, nor the gendered and sexualized

<B></B>

vision
of Schnitzler. Persistently reflecting on the enabling and disabling
functions of language and vision in the urban environment (one might
think here as well of the famous street scene in the first chapter of
Musil's <I>The Man Without Qualities</I>), Musil does not represent the
crisis of language as a breakdown or urban psychosis. Neither he nor
his man without qualities panic when faced with shifting identities,
the instability of language, or the permanent flux of the ego. Instead,
Musil rather rationally explores how language and visuality reveal their
hidden underside if they are tested and observed from an unfamiliar
and estranging perspective. Nevertheless, Musil's search for "the
other condition" (<I>der andere Zustand</I>), a union of mathematical
reasoning and mystical knowledge, of science and morality, of verbal
and nonverbal communication, points to the fact that underlying his
permanent experimentalism of representing the flux of the visual world,
with its play of surfaces, physiognomies, and gestures, was the explicit
longing for some redeeming arrest in a controlled field of vision. At
the same time, the self-identical eye/I would not be the subject of
control here and Musil himself was aware of the ultimate unattainability
of either control or redemption. His other condition, as it is developed
in <I>The Man Without Qualities</I>, and differently in his <I>Posthumous
Papers</I>, could be read as a partly scientific, partly mystical version
of Hofmannsthal's preexistence. With its strong scientific component,
however, which Hofmannsthal's rather romantic mysticism lacks, it belongs
with that cold stream of modernism that would become so prevalent in
the interwar years in Germany in writers such as Ernst J&uuml;nger and
Gottfried Benn, and in Berlin's <I>Neue Sachlichkeit</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rather than wonder about the elusive status of the visual in Musil's
version of rational mysticism, I want to focus on his representation of
visuality as pragmatically and experimentally estranged in the urban
context of Vienna. Here Musil operates with notions of estrangement,
defamiliarization, and de-automatization of perception, familiar to
us from the avant-garde aesthetics of the 1920s. "Binoculars," a key
text of the <I>Posthumous Papers</I>, codes vision in terms of modern
media right from the beginning: "Slow motion pictures dive beneath the
agitated surface, and it is their magic that permits the spectator to
see himself with open eyes, as it were, swimming among the objects of
life. Movies have popularized this phenomenon."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Film enables
a temporally different kind of seeing that delves, as Musil's imagery
suggests, underneath the surfaces of visual normalcy. The spectator's
eyes remain open and conscious in this aquatic realm of slowed down
motion. Its effect, however, is not only a new perception of depth,
which brings a formerly hidden visuality to the surface of consciousness,
but a kind of self-conscious vision in which the spectator sees himself
seeing. In other words, optical phenomena are experienced as historically
contingent and dependent on new media technologies. Musil is convinced
that new technologies of the visual enlarge and expand the realm of what
can be seen. He shares the Enlightenment's confidence in processes of
demystification and denaturalization that make visible the previously
invisible. In that spirit, we find the male observer in "Binoculars"
sitting at the window of a street-corner building looking

<B></B>

through
his binoculars at a variety of objects and people in the urban setting
before him. The tone is by-and-large light and satirical, objective and
distanced, as for instance when the observer pokes fun at the foolishness
of fashions or the strangeness of body motions when they are isolated and
observed through the binoculars. Bodies are cut apart, legs are severed
from each other. It is as if the observer were a surgeon operating on the
human res that get "trapped in the little circle of his instrument"
("B," 82).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition, the denaturalization and estrangement of vision also has
its disturbing underside for the observer. Musil's visual uncanny is
located not just a psychic phantasm in the private eye of the observer,
but is located out there in the world. For example, by directing the
binoculars at a trolley, spatial reality is radically destabilized:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The trolley made an S-shaped double curve in front of the
palace. Countless times from his second story window, the observer had
witnessed it approaching, seen it make this very S-shaped double curve and
drive away again: at every stage of this development the same elongated
red train. But when he watches it through the binoculars, he noticed
something completely different: an inexplicable force suddenly pressed
this contraption together like a cardboard box, its walls squeezed ever
more obliquely together (any minute it would be completely flat); then
the force let up, the car grew wide to the rear, a movement swept once
again over all its surfaces, and while the flabbergasted eyewitness
released the breath he had held in his breast, the trusty old red box
was back to its normal shape again. ["B," 82f.]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This comforting return to visual normalcy is lacking in another
instance. Significantly, an inanimate object returns the observer's gaze
in the typically threatening way that Lacan's evil-eye theory claims as
constitutive for all vision. As the observer points his binoculars at
a building, he is

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
struck by how clearly this support structure, these windows and cornices
had positioned themselves in the circle of his looking-glass; now that
he had taken it all in with a single glance, he was almost startled at
the stony perspectival exactitude with which it all returned his gaze. He
suddenly realized that these horizontal lines that conjoined at some point
toward the back of the building, these contracting windows that became all
the more trapezoid the farther to the side they were situated--indeed,
this entire avalanche of reasonable, familiar limitations into a funnel
of foreshortening located somewhere to the side and to the rear--that
all this had until now struck him as a Renaissance nightmare; an awful
painter's legend, actually, of disappearing lines, reputedly exaggerated,
though there may also be some truth to it. But now he saw it before his
very eyes, magnified to more than life-size, and looking far worse than
the most unlikely rumor. ["B," 82]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The scopic regime of Renaissance perspectivalism is not only disturbed
from the outside by the gaze of the other, whether this other is inanimate
or animate, but perspectival visuality is itself also implicitly
decentered. The viewpoint of the spectator

<B></B>

inevitably comes
face-to-face with its negative counterpart, the vanishing point at or
beyond the horizon where the viewing subject is not present. The vanishing
point becomes a black hole of otherness (or outthereness) that threatens
or even destroys the subject's self-possession in viewing. Musil's text
locates this visual experience in urban space, and it is easy to see
how he focuses here on one of the primary visual experiences in the
post-Haussmannian metropolis, with its endless avenues and boulevards
whose parallel lines appear to meet in infinity. The annihilation of the
subject is actually one of the conditions of the perspectival look that is
usually thought to represent visual mastery. What frightens the observer
most in this passage is that the rules of painterly representation as
developed by the Renaissance and with the model of the camera obscura are
not just a convention, but are confirmed by the realities of the world
as seen through a technical apparatus. Rather than taking comfort in the
compatibility of representation and reality, however, it is precisely
this compatibility that threatens the observing subject. Musil's irony
vis-&agrave;-vis his observer is unmistakable.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Missing in Musil is the social paranoia that pervades Hofmannsthal's
texts and that Schnitzler's writings critically dissect. This variation
has to do with differing backgrounds and socialization patterns, along
with generational factors, and with the fact that Musil spent many of
his student years in Berlin and was thus much less influenced by the
literary culture of the Ringstra&szlig;e and the famous Caf&eacute;
Griensteidl. Most importantly, however, Musil had a scientific
understanding of vision and perception. In Berlin he studied philosophy
and psychology with Carl Stumpf, a successor to Hermann von Helmholtz,
whose <I>Physiological Optics</I>  had established a modern
understanding of key aspects of vision such as light (brightness), depth
(stereoscopic vision), distance, space, and color. Helmholtz understood
vision as subjective, and a physiological model of vision slowly replaced
(or superseded) the camera obscura model that had been the basis for
traditional accounts of vision and its representation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 By
the mid-nineteenth century, popular gadgets such as the stereoscope
or the thaumatrope, based on bifocal or split rather than monofocal
vision, had challenged the older model. Musil's text is interesting
because his use of this nineteenth-century apparatus for the avant-garde
purpose of estranging vision pries it away from the alleged normalcy of
perspectivalism. The question, of course, is why his story privileges
binoculars rather than film. I would suggest that the shift from the
moving image to the still image points to Musil's scientism. The story's
setup conforms to the inherent demand of the stereoscope that the observer
be in a fixed position, which corresponds to the view from the window
above the street. This fixed position is also that of the "objective"
scientific observer who in the end never quite abandons his sense of
control of the disorienting visual phenomena he experiences. There is
no possibility for paranoia here. Consider how the text ends:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In this way, the binoculars contribute both to our understanding of
the individual, as well as to an ever deepening lack of comprehension
of the nature of humanity. By dissolving the commonplace connections
and discovering new ones, it in fact replaces the

<B></B>

practice of
genius, or is at least a preliminary exercise. And yet perhaps for
this very reason we recommend the instrument in vain. Do not people,
after all, employ it even at the theater to heighten the illusion, or
during intermission, to see who else is there, thereby seeking not the
unfamiliar, but rather, the comforting aspect of familiar faces? ["B," 86]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Estranged vision is privileged as representing an avant-garde rupture
of "natural" vision, but that rupture cannot be sustained when the new
media that made it possible are socialized back into normalcy. There is a
second limitation as well. The purpose of estranged vision in this text
is cognitive gain, which, however, remains entirely within the orbit of
a scientific mode of vision that Musil both shares and criticizes. In
"Binoculars," Musil does not move toward the notion of vision that is
implied in his "other condition," one in which the scientific/avant-garde
habits of looking would be dissolved and opened up toward a reciprocal
structuring of visuality, a momentary break both in objective and
subjective vision where all hierarchical subject/object distinctions
would fall by the wayside. Whether Musil's "other condition" is able to
move significantly beyond the limitations of the avant-garde paradigm
or simply rearticulates notions of modernist epiphany is a question I
cannot begin to broach here. Ultimately, it may be a question of limited
interest because the urban context tends to disappear from the texts
that approach this other condition. It will be more interesting to read
these Viennese texts against city texts from Berlin or Paris from the
same periods. That comparative project, however, is work still to be done.
