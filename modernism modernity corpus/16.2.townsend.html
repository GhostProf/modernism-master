<p>In the fall of 1933, the avant-garde scene in São Paulo was abuzz with talk of the new Teatro da Experiência, trumpeted as the most radical theater experiment the country had yet seen. On the program for the inaugural event was <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> (Man and the Horse), a "Spectacle in Nine Tableaux" by the notorious poet, novelist, and provocateur Oswald de Andrade. It was an ambitious undertaking for a group of amateurs: the dramatic action ranged from St. Peter's pearly gates to a Soviet tribunal, while its huge cast of characters included Cleopatra, talking horses, Madame Jesus, the Voice of Stalin, Fu-Man-Chu, and a Poet-Soldier who casually announces Hitler's imminent genocide of the Jews. As fate would have it, the author failed to finish the script in time, and the theater opened instead with <span style="font-style:italic;">O Bailado do Deus Morto</span> (Dance of the Dead God), a ritualistic performance piece composed by director Flávio de Carvalho and performed by a cast that included black actors and musicians. On 17 November 1933, the day after an entire battalion of police officers showed up uninvited for the third performance, the premises were shut down and placed under armed guard. The Teatro da Experiência became a mere anecdote in avant-garde lore, <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> never made its debut, and the might-have-been revolutionary masses never got their chance to witness the grand spectacle of world history on a small São Paulo stage.</p>
<p>What exactly did they miss? The eminent theater critic Sábato Magaldi echoed a sentiment shared by many latter-day critics and theater practitioners in Brazil when he wrote that <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> represented Oswald de Andrade's most ambitious attempt <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to create a kind of "total theater"—a visionary project that, "by virtue of being at the forefront of its era, doesn't even seem to belong to the reality of Brazilian theater."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> From the vantage point of the present, Oswald's drama appears to be the harbinger of a theatrical revolution that never happened, the missing piece of an avant-garde movement that shook the foundations of literature, music, art, and architecture but left the nineteenth-century stage intact. Magaldi and others insist that Oswald's unrealized plan for a "stadium theater" that would bridge the gap between art and action betrays many of the same aesthetic and political preoccupations as Max Reinhardt's expressionist experiments, Erwin Piscator's TotalTheater, and the constructivist montages of Vladimir Mayakovsky and Vsevolod Meyerhold. Invoking a discourse that remains endemic to critical accounts of the European and Euro-American avant-garde, they celebrate <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> as a valiant effort to mobilize the masses by blending popular performance traditions with the erudite genres of the elite and opening up the hallowed halls of bourgeois theater to new artistic media such as film to create a performance that would be nothing less than "total."</p>
<p>In what follows, I reverse the terms of this interpretation by examining the elusive ideal of total theater through the optic of Oswald de Andrade's ill-fated spectacle and the events that led up to its non-performance. My reading situates <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> in the local and global political landscape of the 1930s, placing it at the juncture of a triangular relationship formed by the new media of mass culture, the expansion of the modern state, and the appearance of ideological rifts within a group of intellectuals who were identified as the artistic avant-garde. At the outset, it is important to clarify a point that discussions of total theater all too often obscure: not all totalities are alike. Indeed, I argue that in bringing the aesthetic paradigm of total theater head-to-head with a historical narrative of imperialism, <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> redeploys many of the formal processes associated with the avant-garde—the reconration of scenic space, abstraction, technological mediation—in order to posit a very different model of art and its relationship to political agency. One of my aims in this essay is to show how the representational dilemmas that anti-imperialist artists faced at this crucial historical juncture can illuminate the possibilities and potential pitfalls of current attempts to theorize the avant-garde as a "transnational" or "global" phenomenon; another is to demonstrate why the theater of the Brazilian avant-garde is a good place to begin such an endeavor, precisely because there is so little of it.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Total Theater, Mass Culture, and the Modern State</h1>
<p>Few ideas are so closely tied to the vagaries and contradictions of European modernism as total theater and its more comprehensive cousin, the total work of art. In his insightful overview of the latter, Matthew Wilson Smith identifies the total work of art as a re for "un-reconciled dialectical struggles performed under the sign of aesthetic totality": struggles that involve art's relation to the emergence of mass culture, new technologies, and the expansive designs of the modern nation-state.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Smith takes a long (and perhaps <span style="font-style:italic;">too</span> totalizing) view of his subject, painting cyberspace as its new <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  frontier while tracing its roots all the way back to Schiller's ideal of the aesthetic state, a utopian realm of beauty and culture in which social divisions can be imaginatively overcome by art. Like every other genealogy of the tradition, however, his revolves around Wagner's concept of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gesamtkunstwerk</span>, a performative synthesis of music, poetry, and dance in which each achieves its ultimate expression through the formation of an organic unity. Wagner's "theater of the future" evoked the public festivals that had propelled the movement for German unification in 1871 and reflected the convergence of nationalism and popular politics that George Mosse has referred to as the "nationalization of the masses."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Man's mind, like the bourgeois public sphere, had been "fragmented" by the mechanization and commodification of modern life; Wagner's own art (liberated from the demands of the market by royal patronage) proposed to heal these rifts by crafting absorptive illusions through the use of elaborate stage mechanics, all carefully concealed so that "the public, that representation of daily life, forgets the confines of the auditorium, and lives and breathes now only in the artwork, which seems to it as Life itself, and on the stage, which seems the wide expanse of the whole World."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Wagner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Gesamtkunstwerk</span> cast a long shadow over the avant-gardes of the early twentieth century, and critics as well as later generations of artists who have claimed the vanguard legacy often use "total theater" as a rubric for a wide array of theatrical endeavors from this time: projects such as Antonin Artaud's metaphysical "theater of cruelty" and the Soviet Meyerhold's attempt to create an "October in the theater," both of which sought to break through the fourth wall by taking a page from <span style="font-style:italic;">commedia dell'arte</span> and the circus, though each envisioned totality in different terms. The most explicit elaboration of a total theater ideal was the TotalTheater project developed during the late twenties in Weimar by the director Erwin Piscator and members of the Bauhaus school. The Bauhaus's emphasis on craft and design was a socialist-inspired attempt to wed functionalism and beauty, but it also gave the school a pipeline to industry and thus a degree of autonomy from unreliable state funding. Piscator's "proletarian theater" drew on elements of popular musical revues, the mass pageantry of early Soviet theater, and technological innovations including mobile footways and stages, loudspeakers, and film projections. A key component was the reconration of theatrical space: architect Walter Gropius drew up plans for a monumental hall for nearly two thousand spectators seated on movable blocks of chairs, an arrangement intended to facilitate performances that would spread throughout the entire auditorium and incorporate the spectators. Like its predecessor, this radicalized version of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gesamtkunstwerk</span> was conceived as an organic whole, though its constitutive elements were manifestly mechanical and the object of its impact was the intellect; according to Piscator, his goal was to "dematerialise the stage by means of a total technique, to make it a light and flexible instrument destined to serve mind and not sentimentality."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Jeffrey T. Schnapp explains that for Piscator, "the revolution was embedded somewhere in the real itself. The theater's task was simply to strip away all externals and to place that rough and ready reality directly onstage." Totality, in other words, meant an immediately perceptible "totality of effect."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The 1929 stock market crash put a halt to construction plans, and as the 1930s wore on TotalTheater became a fraught strategy for the Left. Even before Hitler became chancellor in 1933, the Nazis laid claim to the legacy of Wagner and the infrastructure of civic performance to develop their own mass rituals, open-air theaters, and choreographed parades—aspects of the "aestheticization of the political" that Walter Benjamin identified as the <span style="font-style:italic;">modus operandi</span> of fascism. In his essay "Border Crossings: Italian/German Peregrinations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Theater of Totality</span>," Schnapp follows the TotalTheater model's migration to Fascist Italy, where it was embraced as kindred in spirit to Mussolini's proposed "theater of masses" and as theoretical confirmation of Futurist experiments as well as state-sponsored traveling pageants involving hundreds of performers and up to 15,000 spectators. His narrative ends in Rome in October 1934 at a conference held by the Italian Academy and attended by such diverse res as Edward Gordon Craig, Jacques Copeau, Alexander Tairov, Filippo Marinetti, W.B. Yeats, and the special guest, Walter Gropius himself, all speaking a shared language of total theatricality. Noting the "ideological drift and blurring" that facilitated surprising "cultural convergences" across national boundaries (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 83), Schnapp argues that artists on opposite sides of the political divide responded to a perceived crisis of bourgeois theater by creating new forms of mass spectacle that fueled what he calls a "modernist politics of immediacy" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 89).</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Absence of a Brazilian Theatrical Avant-Garde</h1>
<p>Schnapp attributes the search for "total" aesthetic solutions among revolutionaries of all stripes to a postwar milieu in which religion was on the wane and the new technologies of war and peace were calling humanist assumptions into question. And yet these phenomena were themselves bound up with a profound shift in the modes and mechanisms of global imperialism. Across the Atlantic and south of the equator in Brazil, debates over how to overturn the cultural legacy of colonialism drove the development of the avant-garde movement known as <span style="font-style:italic;">modernismo</span>, which took shape during the Semana de Arte Moderna, a festival of art exhibitions, poetry readings, music recitals, and lectures held in São Paulo in February 1922. Although most modernistas came from the elite, they cultivated an interest in the cultures of their darker-skinned compatriots while giving an occasional nod to the vast numbers of Italian, German, and Japanese immigrants who were flocking to São Paulo during this period. It was Oswald de Andrade who invented modernismo's most enduring motif, the tonguein cheek inversion of European primitivism that has become the hallmark of a paradoxical Brazilian nationalism: cannibalism. In his 1928 "Anthropophagist Manifesto," he invoked the culinary rituals of the region's original inhabitants as a model of how Brazilians could critically digest their enemies' culture and escape the trap of cultural dependency and heralded the practice of eating the Other as both the sign of Brazilian difference and "the world's single law": "We want the Carib Revolution. Greater than the French Revolution. The unification of all productive revolts for the progress of humanity."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Oswald played up the fact that Montaigne's "noble savage" was inspired <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  by the egalitarian customs of Brazil's Tupinamba tribe and shrugged his shoulders at the more recent advances of European civilization, declaring, "we already had Com-munism. We already had surrealist language. The Golden Age."<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>But Oswald was not the only <span style="font-style:italic;">modernista</span> putting a new spin on the old ethnic standbys of nationalist iconography; his manifesto was a response to a rival group of modernistas known as the <span style="font-style:italic;">verde-amarelistas</span> (an homage to the green and gold colors of the Brazilian flag) that openly advocated fascism. Because the majority of the masses and the historical origins of the nation were clearly not "white," the connections between race and fascist representation were rather different in Brazil than in Europe and relied on a strategy of symbolic inclusion coupled with social exclusion. Members immersed themselves in indigenous mythology and sought to declare Tupi the national language, even as they argued that the destiny of the indigenous race was to disappear and leave nothing but "spirit"—i.e., culture—behind.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> These fractures in the avant-garde front turned into open rifts following the crisis provoked by the 1929 stock market crash and the subsequent Revolution of 1930, which overthrew the weak central regime and set the stage for the rise of Getúlio Vargas, a re whose legacy continues to loom large over the country's political scene. Brazil's "Father of the Poor" was a populist of sorts: his government granted women's suffrage, instituted retirement pensions for workers, and consolidated federal control over the regional oligarchies that had run the show during the Old Republic (1889–1930); he also beefed up the military, subordinated unions to the authority of the state, and endorsed the torture of political opponents by the secret police. In 1932, the São Paulo elite led a three-month "Constitutionalist Revolution" in an attempt to regain the privileges they had enjoyed under the liberal oligarchic regime; in military terms they failed, but the upshot was a détente and eventual alliance between Vargas and the old elite, leading to a new constitution in 1934 that consecrated him as the legitimate executive. Legal order, however, would prove to be short-lived: in 1935, following a failed "communist conspiracy," the State suspended civil liberties and ordered thousands of arrests that dealt a crippling blow to the Left; in 1937, Vargas abandoned democratic pretenses and declared the Estado Novo, a corporatist dictatorship that lasted until shortly after World War II.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>More than five decades after his second stint in power ended with his suicide in the face of a military coup, Vargas continues to be an object of collective ambivalence and even affection, in no small part because his regime is closely linked to the genesis of cultural icons and repertoires that still set the parameters of national identity today. It was during the 1930s that the notion of Brazil as a "racial democracy" began to take shape; it was also the era when soccer, once the preserve of the elite, became a popular obsession while racially coded genres such as samba shed their stigma to become transnational commodities and emblems of national identity. As the historian Daryle Williams has underlined, the state did not initiate these complex processes, nor did it attain the degree of control that some of its ideological cousins in Europe enjoyed; instead, the administration's strategy was to "ma(k)e cultural management its official business" by creating an extensive network of patronage in order to bring artists and intellectuals under the purview of the state.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 1933, the federal government became <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the official sponsor of Rio's annual Carnival parade. In the increasingly important arena of radio—in which the state's ability to intervene was constrained by limited resources and the interests of foreign capital—it crafted corporate-friendly legislation while requiring stations to broadcast official propaganda and devote a large percentage of programming to "national" themes. But it was <span style="font-style:italic;">modernismo</span> whose fortunes underwent the most drastic shift under the "revolutionary" state. The <span style="font-style:italic;">verdeamarelista</span> Plínio Salgado, who founded the fascist Integralist party in 1932, was not the only one to benefit from the new political conration; <span style="font-style:italic;">modernistas</span> of all political stripes were given positions in the new Ministry of Education, while government agencies generated outwardly apolitical, "cultural" journals that succeeded in drawing in writers who had long lamented the dearth of forums for their work. In a speech delivered in 1951, Vargas aptly summed up the avant-garde myth his own government had helped create, claiming that "the collective forces that provoked the revolutionary modernist movement in Brazilian literature . . . were the same ones that precipitated the victorious Revolution of 1930 in the social and political field."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> The state recast <span style="font-style:italic;">modernismo</span>'s experimental ethic as an authentic expression of the popular and prescient precursor to political change, even as it circumscribed it to the realm of "literature" in order to harness its iconoclastic edge.</p>
<p>When the <span style="font-style:italic;">modernistas</span> parted ways, Oswald de Andrade veered to the left and, in 1931, began a fraught relationship with the Brazilian Communist Party, which had been founded in 1922—the same year as the Week of Modern Art. The erstwhile dandy bid a public adieu to his former cohorts in the preface to his experimental novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Serafim Ponte Grande</span>, completed in 1928 but left unpublished until 1933. In the brief text, he lambastes <span style="font-style:italic;">modernista</span> bohemians for masquerading as agents of social revolution, recalling that in the heady environment of the 1920s, "the modernist movement, culminating in the anthropophagic plague, seemed to indicate an advanced phenomenon . . . It even looked like the coffee boom might set the semicolony's <span style="font-style:italic;">nouveau riche</span> literature on a level with costly imperialistic surrealisms."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Those illusions crumbled in the face of the economic crisis, "just as almost all Brazilian 'vanguardist' literature crumbled, being provincial and suspect if not extremely impoverished and reactionary" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SGP</span>, 5). It was a harsh judgment, one that the writer would later qualify. Yet it was not a rejection of stylistic experimentation as such. Rather, Oswald's critique takes aim at what Frankfurt philosopher Herbert Marcuse would refer to only a few years later as the "affirmative" nature of bourgeois culture, which may entertain the possibility of an alternative to the existing order but ultimately legitimates the status quo by offering "spiritual" progress and "ethical" freedom as consolation for oppression and material lack.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> The author derides his own novel for proposing the facile solution of "transnational nudism" to the structural inequalities produced by economic imperialism and announces that, having tired of being an "upper-class clown," he will henceforth aspire to be, "if nothing else, a circus roustabout in the Proletarian Revolution"<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a>—a kind of stagehand, in other words, who would rearrange the set and fashion props to facilitate the working class in performing its own creative feats in the political ring. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>As was true of other Latin American avant-gardists during the 1930s, Oswald's political radicalization did in fact prompt a turn to theater. In an article published in 1935 and subsequently adopted as the preface to a second edition, the author explains that <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span>, his first full-length play in Portuguese, "is a piece of high fantasy in which I place man in the transition—between the war horse and the turf horse (bourgeois society) and horsepower (socialist society)." As such, it "is a book that is of interest to the masses," though the limited print run effectively circumscribed its audience to a small group of intellectuals.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">O Rei da Vela</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">A Morta</span>  met a similar fate. It was not until 1967, under another "modernizing dictatorship," that a landmark staging of <span style="font-style:italic;">O Rei da Vela</span> would help give birth to the counterculture movement known as Tropicália.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Teatro Oficina's controversial production pioneered an Artaud-inspired "theater of aggression" while establishing Oswald's reputation as a visionary playwright who, as one of the actors wrote, "opens a path toward a national theater, a total theater, which is only now properly understood."<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> More recently, the director José Celso has sought to build a stadium theater that would provide a proper stage for <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem—</span>a play he describes as the "total surmounting" of Russian constructivism "blended with the Great Rituals that shape the Brazilian Mixed Races culture."<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> In 2003, after years ting a local developer, Celso announced a deal: the developers would build their mall, but alongside it they would construct a 1,000-seat theater inspired by Walter Gropius's design for the TotalTheater in Weimar, complete with a ceiling made of retractable movie screens that opened up to the tropical sky. Like its forebear, this project has since fallen through.</p>
<p>But on what grounds is Oswald's theater identified as the missing piece of a national avant-garde? The justification for such claims does not lie in detailed analyses of the texts or the events surrounding their non-performance, of which there are surprisingly few—or perhaps not so surprising, given that total theater aims to render both text and stage obsolete. Instead, most artists and critics who advocate this interpretation do so on the basis of Oswald's "Do Teatro, Que É Bom," a humorous dialogue published in a daily newspaper in 1943. The dialogue begins with an unnamed speaker's defense of an amateur group engaged in what his partner derisively refers to as "chamber theater." Speaker number one insists that such efforts should be applauded, if for no other reason than that "they give us a break from the cinema, that growing stupidification by means of the screen with which the United States flooded the world in order to take it over without resistance." Voicing an Adorno-esque critique of the culture industry, he scoffs that "when they spoke against the opium of the people, they should have made it plural and added cinema and soccer."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> His interlocutor, however, takes issue with this extrapolation from Marx and contends that what is needed is a "theater of shock," a "stadium theater" that, along with the radio, the sports arena, and the silver screen, will educate and entertain the growing masses. Tracing the history of theater from its inception in ancient Greece, he claims that in the nineteenth century, with the rise of bourgeois individualism, what was lost was "the religious character of the theater, the collective festival, festival of the masses, festival of the people" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DT</span>, 90). His list of exemplary res includes Ibsen, Jarry, Cocteau, and in particular Meyerhold, whose <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  "ethic of spectacle" is lauded as the pinnacle of modern theater. This leads into a discussion of "the war-like image of fascism" cultivated by the acolytes of Stalin and "the petty-bourgeoisie of Mussolini, nursed by bureaucracy and the confessional, wanting to live dangerously in a sensational release of inhibitions" (91–92). His proposed antidote to this attack on the "Hegelian progression of the spirit" is not primarily a playwright (though Oswald may have in mind his famous Pageant of the Paterson Strike): it is the journalist and globetrotting radical John Reed. The text concludes with the first speaker, who has long since tempered his enthusiastic embrace of chamber theater, declaring that "John Reed's soldier fulfilled his mission on the living stage of contemporary history" . Art and history merge, on-stage and off-stage become one, and thesis and antithesis are resolved in the total transformation of reality.</p>
<p>Or are they? The dialogue's self-mocking tone calls into question the ease with which the final synthesis is achieved, while the references to contemporary political realities hint at a more serious subtext: Oswald, always unorthodox, had distanced himself from the Communist Party by this time and would break away two years later, in 1945; Stalin, denounced in the dialogue as a "villain," had executed Meyerhold three years earlier for his refusal to tow the social realist line; in Brazil, meanwhile, Getúlio Vargas was paying popular musicians to sing his praises. The use of the dialogue form is significant, then, because it enacts an unresolved debate in leftist circles and indicates that the outcome is not a done deal. At one point, for instance, the speaker who sings the praises of "chamber theater" points to advances in stage design and cites the work of the French director Louis Jouvet, who spent the early forties in exile in Brazil; calling it an "admirable reaction against the corruption brought about by the cinema," he explains that "sensing itself under attack, the theater improved," producing intimate theaters that provided a refuge for "the spirit of that fabulous Paris, which that forest ranger Hitler's filthy boot is unsuccessfully trying to crush." Rather than refuting this implicit equation of mass culture with fascism, his partner brings up Meyerhold and a long list of earlier playwrights-of-the-people, ending with the comment that "one day, perhaps soon, we may be able to add, in an honest sense, Wagner and Oberammergau . . ." (<span style="font-style:italic;">DT</span>, 87). The argument for the revolutionary nature of mass theater thus leads to two disturbing counter-examples that signal its potential as a vehicle for reaction: a composer celebrated by the Nazis as an icon of German nationalism, and a Bavarian village famous for its centuries-long tradition of a massive, day-long Passion Play—famous, too, for the anti-Semitic nature of the pageant and Hitler's ringing endorsement of it.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Only by turning a blind eye to these apparent impasses that trail off into ellipses is it possible to read this pseudo-Platonic dialogue as a programmatic manifesto for total theater; its relation to O Homem e o Cavalo becomes even more complex when one realizes that "O Teatro" was written nearly a decade later, at a time when, after several frustrated attempts to stage his own plays, Oswald was no longer writing theater at all. Even if we take the advocate of stadium theater to be the unequivocal mouthpiece for the author, his pedagogical injunction to "educate the world" is light years away from the contumacious circus laborer of the Serafim preface. The two speakers define <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  their framework as international, but the specter of the nation is impossible to escape because a stumbling block stands in the way of the dialectic's progression: not just the historic wax and wane of fascism, but the concurrent rise and reification of Brazil's own corporatist state.</p>
<p>Historians and sociologists have been drawing attention to the political and institutional shifts that fostered the flowering of the Brazilian avant-garde for several decades now. But this knowledge in itself is not a sufficient solution to the methodological problem of how to <span style="font-style:italic;">interpret</span> modernismo's formal innovations, nor is the recent turn toward "transnationalism" a quick fix to the nation-state's hold over culture, as evidenced by Fernando J. Rosenberg's recent study <span style="font-style:italic;">Geopolitics and the Latin American Avant-Garde</span>. The book makes the claim that whereas the European avant-gardes simply rered imperialist assumptions, their Latin American counterparts "explored the limits of a national, culturalist response to crisis of the universality of civilization" by creating "narratives of space" that undermined the linear narrative of progress.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> The author explicitly endorses this practice of "embodied universality" as a model for dealing with the cultural politics of our own age—a disturbing suggestion given that he avoids any discussion of Latin American avant-gardists who espoused fascism, dismisses any overtly polemical work as a "repression of critical consciousness," and devotes two chapters to the Brazilian <span style="font-style:italic;">modernista</span> Mário de Andrade without noting that some of the writer's most exemplary work was facilitated by his position as a cultural administrator under Vargas.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> This kind of affirmative criticism replicates the very dynamic at work in the institutionalization of Brazilian <span style="font-style:italic;">modernismo</span>: it redefines "politics" as an ethico-aesthetic category and delegitimizes political engagement, privileging a specifically <span style="font-style:italic;">literary</span> form of "cosmopolitanism" that was canonized by a politically repressive, nationalist regime. Such analyses might broaden their geographical scope, but their critique is a red herring because they define cultural nationalism as a particular style that can be (un)written on the page.</p>
<p>Rosenberg's recognition of space as a critical category in the study of the avant-gardes is on point. Yet if he, like most critics of the Latin American <span style="font-style:italic;">vanguardias</span>, bypasses a discussion of theater, perhaps it is because solutions crafted within the closed confines of poetic or narrative space don't always hold up when space becomes something more than metaphorical and actual bodies are involved. Although no genre or medium is immune from the sort of disciplinary operation that abstracts an artistic object from the process of its production in order to craft the illusion of absolute autonomy, theater tends to present greater obstacles to redemptive modes of interpretation that attribute a progressive function to works of art on the sole basis of their symbolic <span style="font-style:italic;">representation</span> of social relations. Because it requires the presence of a collective audience, as well as a <span style="font-style:italic;">social</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">material</span> space in which to perform, theater's autonomy from the existing socio-political order is always, in the words of Loren Kruger, manifestly "impure." It is for this reason, Kruger argues, that theater is often a key site of struggle among competing attempts to define the proper articulation of art and society. She concludes: "At once more and less than art, theater straddles the disputed border country between the aesthetic state and the political and provides the stage on which the contradiction between them can be enacted."<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The tenuous nature of theatrical representation may be one reason why the Vargas government chose not to subsidize the dramatic arts for most of the 1930s, while it was still battling open opposition from the oligarchic elites and consolidating control over the fractious urban labor sector. As in Germany and Italy, regional divisions ran deep and there was little historical precedent for a strong central government; Brazil, however, was on the receiving end of the mass exodus of immigrants that allowed many European nations to externalize evidence of capitalism's growing contradictions. The origin myths that underpinned the aesthetic politics of Europe's fascist regimes also had a more precarious foundation in a country whose historical roots lay in colonialism. In 1888, Brazil had become the last country in the world to abolish African slavery; less than fifty years later, the country's new ruling forces were attempting to redefine race as an axis of national unity. The notion of a shared "Brazilian" culture, in other words, was a fragile fiction that threatened to collapse in the theater, where the gap between the real and the ideal was marked by the presence of the stage.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why the police felt it necessary to make such an extravagant display of force in shutting down a small theater like the Teatro da Experiência. The space in which Man and the Horse was to have had its debut was a far cry from the grandiose, stadium-like structures that Gropius planned for the TotalTheater project; it had a relatively modest number of seats (around 275) and was housed in the basement of the Clube de Artistas Modernos (CAM), a social club founded in November 1932 by Antônio Gomide, Carlos Prado, Emiliano di Cavalcanti, and Flávio de Carvalho, a group of "modern artists" dedicated to defending what they called "the interests of the class."<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Teatro da Experiência was the brainchild of Carvalho, a wayward scion of the local aristocracy who was an architect, visual artist, and early performance artist of sorts.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Much like Piscator, Carvalho conceived of his Teatro as a "laboratory" that would "function with the impartial spirit of laboratory research"; as he explained it in his application for a permit, the purpose was to explore "the world of ideas" by experimenting with "settings, modes of diction, mimesis, the dramatization of new elements of expression, problems of lighting and sound, conjugated to the movement of abstract forms," all in order "to form a practical base for the psychology of entertainment."<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Such a proposal might have aroused little suspicion at some other time or in some other place. But as it happened, the Teatro opened its doors toward the end of a pivotal year in the course of modern history. In Brazil, 1933 was dominated by the lengthy lead-up to the inauguration of a Constituent National Assembly that would draft a constitution and return the country to legal rule even as it paved the way for the authoritarian Estado Novo by legitimating Vargas's power. The Assembly's inauguration fell on 15 November—the very same day that Carvalho's <span style="font-style:italic;">O Bailado do Deus Morto</span> made its debut.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Meanwhile in Germany, Hitler became chancellor on 30 January 1933, the Reichstag burned on 27 February and by the end of March the legislature had granted the federal government dictatorial powers; in July, Trotsky pointed to the German Communist Party's rapid disintegration as an indication that Stalin's "bureaucratic centrism" had reached a point at which the Left opposition had no choice but to break from the Comintern. Japan unleashed its imperial ambitions in Manchuria <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  while Franklin Roosevelt spelled out the New Deal and Good Neighbor policy in his 4 March radio address, signalling a shift (in theory) away from armed intervention into Latin American affairs toward economic penetration and an intense campaign of cultural propaganda.</p>
<p>These distant events all resonated loudly within the small artists' club out of which Carvalho's theatrical "experience" emerged. One of the most frequent performers at the Clube dos Artistas Modernos was Elsie Houston, a classically trained "mulatta" soprano who would later gain fame in the nightclubs of New York City for a repertoire featuring what the press referred to as Afro-Brazilian "voodoo songs"; she was also the wife of the French surrealist Benjamin Péret, who had recently been expelled from Brazil for his Trotskyist activities. In June of 1933, CAM held an exhibition of paintings and lithographs by the German Käthe Kollwitz, which opened with a lecture by the prominent Trotskyist and art critic Mário Pedrosa, who had studied in Berlin and fought in early street battles against the Nazis (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>). In July, the club unveiled an exhibition of Soviet poster art brought back from Russia by the modernista painter Tarsila do Amaral, drawing considerable attention from the press. And yet nothing could top the talk by Caio Prado Junior, a rising star in the Brazilian Communist Party whose landmark <span style="font-style:italic;">Evolução Política do Brasil</span> appeared this same year. Prado Junior's presentation on his recent trip to Russia drew six hundred people to CAM one evening in September; loudspeakers were placed outside so that the long line of people who were unable to squeeze into the hall could hear his favorable account of the new Soviet society as well as the debate that ensued. Other events included lectures on subjects ranging from modern China to "Brazilian folklore" and the Ingay Amazonians; a demonstration of Japanese dances; and a talk by David Alfaro Siqueiros, the Mexican muralist who would attempt to assassinate Trotsky in 1940.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>What the countless newspaper articles that document the development of the Clube dos Artistas Modernos and the Teatro da Experiência's debut do not always reveal is who attended these events. For this, one has to turn to the archive of the Delegacia Estadual de Ordem Política e Social (DEOPS), Brazil's notorious political police. The DEOPS opened a file on the club in July of 1933 and assigned the task of surveillance to an informant identified by the code name "Guarany." The agent's reports offer intriguing glimpses into a unique and ultimately ephemeral milieu where left-leaning artists, anarchists, Trotskyists, Communist Party faithfuls, and those who refused to be pigeonholed into any one of the left's proliferating factions formed contingent alliances and often engaged in tense disputes. One such re was Oreste Ristori, an old timer from the heyday of anarco-syndicalism who had acquired quasi-mythic stature after being kicked out of his native Italy and Argentina before arriving in Brazil (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>). In a defiantly detailed declaration Ristori gave to the police a few years later before being deported to Italy, where he would be shot by the German army during World War II for his role in the antifascist resistance, he stated that he had begun frequenting the Clube dos Artistas Modernos because he "had the desire to meet various [<span style="font-style:italic;">diversos</span>] intellectuals."<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> He was not the only one. Throughout the file on CAM, the club's unknown mole voices concern about the intermingling of intellectuals and "foreign <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">workers," as in a document dated 29 November in which he notes that the evening's meeting was attended by large numbers of people from Belém and Bom Retiro—two of São Paulo's largest working-class neighborhoods, where Italian immigrants had recently been joined by an influx of Eastern European Jews.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> A report on Tarsila do Amaral's discussion of proletarian art ominously warns that the audience "was almost entirely composed of individuals wearing collar-less shirts and red ties, with the air of terrorists and undesirables, the majority of them made up of foreigners." And what had they come to hear? Guarany denounces Tarsila's "disguised agitation of praise for militant communism," but he declines to go into detail. Rather, he sums up her speech with a phrase that is repeated like a litany throughout all his reports: "It has nothing to do with art."<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>)</p>
<p>In his account of the club's activities (written after the declaration of the Estado Novo), Carvalho echoed his unidentified observer's remarks, taking pains to state his disapproval of the "extreme leftist elements, some having nothing to do with art" that "infiltrated" the club and allowed political passions to overwhelm the pursuit of rational beauty.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> And yet it was his theater that led to the club's downfall—perhaps because its "entertainment" appeal threatened to bring yet another element into this already suspect mix. Carvalho's main collaborator on <span style="font-style:italic;">O Bailado do Deus Morto</span> was Henrique Costa (Henricão), a black chauffeur who would become a successful samba composer; Costa composed the music and performed in the piece, which drew a "diverse" crowd with twice as many spectators as there were seats. Its success helps explain the authorities' insistence that not just <span style="font-style:italic;">O Bailado</span> but the theater itself constituted a "Communist" threat—indeed, the script contains a few risqué references to the anatomy of a primitive god, but it remains resolutely abstract and it is impossible to discern any direct allusions to contemporary events. Race was never explicitly mentioned as a cause, of course, because the state's ideological project depended on disavowing the political dimension of skin color even as it celebrated blackness as an integral element of national culture. In such a context, the likely mix of people in the audience and the presence of black actors on an experimental stage where generic conventions were less fixed would have raised a red flag.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> (<a name="4-text" href="#4">. 4</a> and <a name="5-text" href="#5">5</a>)</p>
<p>A few days after the long arm of the law put an end to the fun, as the police perused scripts of the Teatro's forthcoming works (including his own) and deliberated on its ultimate fate, Oswald gave a reading of scenes from <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> upstairs in the club. In an article announcing the event he expressed confidence that the theater would prevail and spoke of plans to stage his own play. His optimism turned out to be misplaced: the case went to court, where a judge affiliated with the Integralists decided in favor of the police, provoking an outcry from prominent intellectuals as far away as Buenos Aires and a fiery speech in the national constituent assembly by an opposition delegate who decried the suppression of a valiant attempt to form a "completely independent theater."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> The club quickly lost members and closed soon after, leaving a would-be audience to speculate as to what <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> might have looked like onstage. "The Teatro da Experiência's task is going to be enormous," Oswald had said, because it would be "attempting to reduce, for a stage four meters in size (doubled in <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the auditorium, it's true), a play for a stadium or the cinema, with forty-five characters, a dog, and a horse."<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Men, Horses, and Missing Pieces</h1>
<p>"A play for a stadium or the cinema." Critics who link <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> to the total theater trend, then, are not entirely without reason. The play does indeed share many formal features with projects that aspired to this ideal: it incorporates elements of popular genres such as <span style="font-style:italic;">teatro de revista</span>, or musical revues; the theatrical action occasionally spills off the stage and into the audience; and although the text does not indicate that film projectors were to be used, the principle of mediation is foregrounded through the use of loudspeakers, which transmit the voices of offstage characters. The title—<span style="font-style:italic;">Man and the Horse—</span>calls to mind the "abstract man" who is the quintessential hero of all total theater projects, while the narrative, derived from the medieval mystery, evokes a messianic sense of time that will presumably culminate in the fusion of the spiritual and the material on Judgment Day.</p>
<p>The moment of sublimation never occurs, however, because <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> insists on placing itself in the uncomfortable crux between the nationalization of mass politics and the emergence of a global mass culture.

<p class="continued">quote makes clear, the play's work is to <span style="font-style:italic;">reduce</span> the all-encompassing spectacle of mass society, to cut it down to human size in order to magnify the political, cultural, and material processes that are at stake in representing "the whole." The play attempts to redraw the connections between art, mass culture, and anti-imperialism by harking back to a moment when the left and the artistic vanguards appeared to be in step: its structure of nine, loosely-connected tableaux featuring an international cast of characters who t vile capitalists all across the globe seems to be modeled on Mayakovsky's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mystery-Bouffe</span>, a reinvention of the medieval mystery genre first produced by Meyer-hold shortly after the triumph of the Russian Revolution. The Russian play, however, is an unambiguous celebration of an unprecedented revolution, and it employs the conventions of medieval mysteries as a way of inserting itself into a tradition familiar to its popular audiences. <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> presents a more troubling picture, one that is structured by the historical and ideological contradictions that had emerged in the fifteen years since the Mayakovsky play was written. By 1933, these kinds of cultural appropriations had become more questionable in light of the newly forged links between "popular" or "folk" cultures and repressive states, and in Brazil they were doubly vexed due not only to the Church's close ties to Vargas and the Integralists but also the historic role of religious drama in the process of colonization. The extent to which these two plays diverge is evident in their treatment of the holy hero himself: whereas <span style="font-style:italic;">Mystery-Bouffe</span> turns Christ into a secular Redeemer who champions the cause of the proletarians, Oswald's play exposes the troubling role of popular culture in mass society by portraying Hitler as a perverse, modern-day incarnation of the Son of God.</p>
<p>But <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> does not simply discard market-driven forms of art and entertainment. In fact, many of the innovations that can be interpreted as adaptations of the medieval mystery also coincide with the conventions of teatro de revista, a genre that was quintessentially "Brazilian" in its depictions of topical events and social customs but also, as a local variant of revue theater, heir to a geographically expansive genealogy of urban mass culture. Introduced to Brazil in the 1870s, the <span style="font-style:italic;">revista</span> had long been derided by the elite as a symptom of the country's inability to produce a "legitimate" national theater, and in the first few decades of the twentieth century many <span style="font-style:italic;">revista</span> musicians and actors also worked in radio and film. <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista</span> shows aimed to attract spectators of all classes, and while the plots often reinforced social hierarchies, the industry was more open than most to employing light-skinned mulatos (less often blacks) and was an important vehicle for the popularization of genres such as samba.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Getúlio Vargas's ties to <span style="font-style:italic;">revista</span>, radio, and film went back to 1926 when, as a federal congressman, he sponsored a bill establishing the first legal oversight of commercial entertainment that was widely perceived as favoring the interests of authors and performers.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> As president, he not only frequented the theater but was also known to steal the show. A Brazilian director, writing in 1945, recalled that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>. . . Never was a head of government so prominent on theater stages as the victor of the Revolution of 1930. The re of Getúlio Vargas was always the main attraction in all the revues, and he was depicted in the most sympathetic manner, incarnated in the most <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  popular types of the masses, once dressed as a <span style="font-style:italic;">gaúcho</span>, another time as a worker, a hunter, a revolutionary, a farmworker, a teacher, a macho, and even a tramcar driver! His re, cause for the heartiest laughter, lingered in every spectator's heart after the laughter, touching and conquering all in the most intelligent campaign a governor could merit.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>The very multiplicity of these onstage incarnations contributed to Vargas's construction as the ideal populist subject; his serialized image (farmworker, teacher, revolutionary) confirms what Michael Warner has said of public res in mass-mediated societies, which "take on the function of concretizing that phantasmatic body image, or, in other words, of actualizing the otherwise indeterminate image of the people."<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> In its opening tableau, <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> plugs in to this "popular" tradition by adopting its stylistic conventions while turning its representational logic on its head in order to foreground the affinities between fascism and capitalist mass culture. The scene takes place in the "universal" sphere of heaven, where the far-from-angelic denizens include St. Peter, who claims that his celestial domain is Einstein's fourth dimension; the Four "Graças" (Graces), who are transposed into singing "Garças" (Hussies) and are immediately recognizable as the obligatory chorus line of scantily-clad girls from a revue; and the Divo, a flamboyant opera singer accused by the others of having lost his "moral sense" onstage. St. Peter warns his squabbling followers, "If we destroy this stronghold of eternal change, the world will plunge into historical materialism!"<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> . The venerable patriarch's very words, of course, run counter to his intention. The play reverses the usual terms of reference by placing the "ideal" directly onstage. What we see is a distinctly bourgeois afterlife in which the Garças practice phrases in English, titter over off-color jokes, and embroider handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>Into this mind-numbingly insipid bliss marches the Poet-Soldier, proclaiming the need to "regenerate humanity" and chastising the Garças for being "damned pacifists! Society of Nations!" . Although the text gives no cues as to costuming, the Poet Soldier quotes Marinetti's mantra ("War is the world's only hygiene!"), and his strident, exclamatory style is a dead give-away. This is not Italy, however, but the no-man's-land of nationalist ideology. The Poet-Soldier is surely a stand-in for the Italian Futurist, but he is just as surely Plínio Salgado, leader of the Brazilian Integralist Party, whose slogan "God-Country-Family," is parodied in the legend that adorns the set of this tableau: "God-Country-Brothel-Hymen." Here, as throughout the play, Oswald exploits the capacity of a single theatrical image to signify multiple referents in order to draw connections between belief systems and national imaginaries that have been safely ensconced from one another by political and epistemological borders. Rather than multiple manifestations of a single president/people, we see a puppet-like Poet-Soldier raging about the need to "resolve the unemployment crisis of the furies and lightning bolts," a re who could easily be Brazilian, Italian, German, Portuguese, or Argentine . The parallels are not just formal, and the scene is not just about fascism as style. Marinetti, after all, had visited Brazil in 1926; Nazi organizations funded by the German embassy flourished in the south of Brazil; and while Mussolini invoked the sacred homeland, Italian immigrants were struggling to build new lives in São Paulo. By staging the rise of fascism in the realm of the "spiritual," the scene undercuts the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  territorialization of nationalist representation, revealing it to be a phenomenon shaped by historical and material forces whose scope is in fact global.</p>
<p>The ribaldry is cut short by the tableau's surprise ending, the arrival of a giant "aluminum balloon" bearing a black man who proclaims "What a lovely little people!" . What we have here, it seems, is a futuristic reversal of the conquest scenario. But colonial domination is predicated upon the impossibility of its own reversal—a black man cannot step in to the conqueror's role and remain unscathed. In the following tableau, which takes place inside the spaceship, we learn that its inventor Professor Icar has been "disembodied" by the Poet-Soldier. When the Garças protest that Icar was just a harmless "chocolate Aryan" who got burned by flying too close to the sun (a wink to his Greek predecessor Icarus), the Poet accuses them of having illicit desires that could "damage the race"; he goes on to explain that "if you'd talked to him before about the need for white people to subdue, exploit, and humiliate people of color, maybe he wouldn't have understood. Now he understands. Now we can converse about Civilization, Culture, Imperialism, Capital, Race, and other white subjects" .</p>
<p>Both mass culture and fascist idealism purport to offer this brilliant black bourgeois the "rhetorics of disincorporation" that Michael Warner identifies as necessary to gain access to mass subjecthood.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> But for the black man, rhetoric is <span style="font-style:italic;">either</span> purely false <span style="font-style:italic;">or</span> all too real, and so the learned Professor is now nothing but speech: he is the invisible pilot guiding the vessel through the ether, present only as the Voice of Icar which interrupts the action on occasion to alert the passengers to planets, stars (Greta Garbo is the name of one) and other landmarks along their route. Icar hasn't been disembodied so much as turned inside out: the tableau is titled "The Interior of the Ícaro," and even the Poet-Soldier grudgingly acknowledges that without the black man's novel invention and navigational skills they would all disperse into the nothingness of the stratosphere. Although Ícar(o) is both the protective vessel and the labor that keeps the operation afloat, he cannot take his place as an individual subject onstage because, having been deprived of flesh, he can only play the role of the anonymous mass or the purely symbolic. His Voice is an aural signifier of race around which the others members of this mini-society converge, not unlike the voices of samba stars that were transported over the Brazilian airwaves, where they were redefined as the expression of an "authentic" popular identity available to all.</p>
<p>If, as I argue, radio (and mass media more generally) is the invisible "outside" of the first part of this tableau, it becomes the explicit focal point of the final scene. When the device around which they have gathered begins to emit inchoate noises, the Poet Soldier and the Garças are alarmed—it seems that something is afoot "down there," in South America: "THE RADIO: Oooooooooo! The people are invading, they respect nothing!" The Radio goes on to speak of "police," "disorder," and the firing of "shots." Could it be Revolution? the characters wonder. As it turns out, it is just a Brazilian soccer game. "We can rest easy," the Poet-Soldier announces. "The deluded masses are still amusing themselves with that business." But when he turns on the radio again, he picks up a "Bolshevik station" whose announcer is rousing listeners to take up arms in the struggle against capital. Radio, like the mass public it hails, is not reified as a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  transparent medium of identity but is instead represented as an apparatus that is both the means <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> the object of a struggle whose outcome is not yet certain.</p>
<p>In the following tableau, the spaceship descends to earth and we are presented with a "fascist incarnation": a rapturous apocalypse at the Epsom Derby that involves every power-driven leader and his equestrian sidekick of the past several millennia, both real and fictional. Among the multitudes are Dom Sebastião and Alfonsito V, who expanded Portugal's territories in Africa; Incitatus and Bucephalus (the steeds of Caligula and Alexander the Great); the fourteenth-century Tartar conqueror Tamerlane (known for his love of the arts); Nietzsche and the Wagnerian hero Parsifal, who have decided to mend fences ("Nietzsche converted in the struggle!"); and even Rocinante and Sancho Panza's burro. The Divo has attempted to penetrate the body of one of the jockeys but missed his mark and ended up as a horse talking out of its ass; the real power behind the operation is the Poet-Soldier, the "hero of all homelands" and self-proclaimed embodiment of "Spirit" who rouses the global masses to a feverish passion with bellicose demagoguery, conjuring up a host of mythic symbols that culminates in the car of Juggernaut—"the steamroller of capital"—and a nude Valkyrie wearing a gas mask who runs across the stage and through the audience to the music of Wagner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Lohengrin</span>.</p>
<p>This is a nightmarish version of total theater—described as a "thrilling spectacle," it is the moment when art and reality become one. Or rather, it would be, if the mayhem were seen onstage. Instead, the audience is not allowed to see the horrific sight; the desire for immediacy is denied because all of the action, up until the Valkyrie's mad dash, is said to be taking place behind a wall at the back of the stage. The audience hears the shouts and stampedes, the roar of thunder and cannons and cacophonous speech, including an anonymous voice of resistance crying out that the idealization of war leads the young to "mutilation and death" . Meanwhile, the action is described to us by St. Peter and Icar, who are peering over the wall. As a black bourgeois and a saint who was born a Jew, these two res have no place in the paradigm of identity underlying this fascist, imperialist fantasy; unable to perform the feat of self-abstraction, they possess an inassimilable "positivity" (in Warner's terms) represented in this scene through the use of scenic space. The Voice of the Divo proclaims, "I am the pathos of destruction! For the white race! For the rich class! For cretinous morality! . . . Heil! Duce! Heil! Duce!" and Icar ironically notes, "Luckily I'm no longer black" . The ontological status of St. Peter's body is also in doubt, given that in the previous tableau the Poet-Soldier explained to the Garças that he was secretly leading the saint to his death on earth, where "two days ago in Hitler's Germany the death campaign against the Jews began" .</p>
<p>But how does one <span style="font-style:italic;">perform</span> disembodiment? The text provides no clues, and there is no indication that high-tech resources would have been used to conjure up a convincing illusion. What is clear is that the actor is onstage, because the character is no longer described as a Voice. Icar's dematerialization is not a demonstration of technological power, nor does it show the ability of thought to sublimate the material; the point of the performance is that it fails. The quest for the missing black body becomes <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  a recurring theme that functions as a counterpoint to the overarching narrative of revolutionary triumph—Icar's "widow" eventually shows up with a femur that has been identified as her husband's, though by the end it is no longer certain whether it belongs to Icar or to St. Peter, the converted Jew. As the only characters that reappear throughout the play, Icar, his wife, and St. Peter fulfill the role of onstage spectators through whose lens the audience's view of the epic struggle between fascism and Red revolution is refracted. The audience's attempts to identify with them, however, can only be incomplete and discontinuous, because they are not coherent characters but rather multiplex prisms whose changing nature is defined more by its liminal status in relation to the dominant discourse of the moment than by any inherent qualities. Although they are sympathetic res and are given some of the play's wittiest lines, they are hardly exemplary. Icar, for example, is often subject to the nostalgia of the petit bourgeoisie, but at other times he is the voice of lucidity. His name is the Portuguese acronym for the Roman Catholic Church (<span style="font-style:italic;">Igreja Católica Apostólica Romana</span>), yet during the fascist incarnation, he objects to the injunctions delivered by the Voice of Job and points out, "But it's propaganda for temerity and servility" . During the Revolution, when an international crowd of insurrectionary sailors takes over St. Peter's Ship (a metaphor for the church represented as the Vatican on a raft, which serves as a dance floor presided over by Cleopatra), St. Peter the Jew tries to reassert his role as benevolent patriarch of the Christian faith and convince the masses that they are not prepared to take power. The Red Soldier replies, "all men are prepared to eat and <span style="font-style:italic;">trepar</span> ("to climb," but also a colloquial term for sex) . Icar and St. Peter always seem to be on the cusp of this recognition, but none of the play's contending discourses are capable of incorporating them.</p>
<p>This poses interpretive difficulties, particularly when it comes to the play's treatment of the Soviet Union. Even sympathetic critics have felt it necessary to concede that <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> is marred by a naïvely optimistic view of Communist society and several seemingly propagandistic tableaux, including one called "Industrialization," which features the Voices of Stalin and Eisenstein proclaiming the glories of the utopic society they have created. Sábato Magaldi, for instance, finds it "almost unbelievable" that a humorist of Oswald's nature "let himself be led by political passion" to commit such a lamentable "literary slide."<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> In response, he simply omits any analysis of these tableaux. This refusal to consider that the scenes might indeed have something to do with "art" has its political corollary in the myth of a monolithic left, a distortion of history that is belied by the debates that were taking place at the Clube dos Artistas Modernos when <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> was written. Magaldi's judgment is hardly equivalent to the repressive power that shut down the stage where these tableaux were to have been performed, but it does rely on and reinforce distinctions that this earlier police action helped create. It reinscribes a mirror-like opposition between politics and aesthetics that leaves the limits of literary-critical discourse safely intact—by erasing the mediating factor of theatrical representation.</p>
<p>In fact, what is most notable about "Industrialization" is that the "ideal" world the Soviet leader and the filmmaker claim to have created can only exist outside the space of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  scenic representation; their disembodied voices boom out across a stage that represents "the monumental entrance to the biggest factory in the socialist world" . Standing at the door, watching the happy workers entering and exiting, are representatives of the past ("we are the end of a world"): Icar, St. Peter, now playing a <span style="font-style:italic;">sanfona</span> (a type of accordion from the rural northwest of Brazil) and Madame Icar, who wears her husband's femur around her neck (looking, perhaps, like the stereotype of an indigenous savage). Once again, they are slapstick res whose rhetorical inversions draw attention to the bodies we continue to see, though they no longer exist:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>ST. PETER: I was the eyes of the blind…now I'm a blind man with no eyes.</p>
<p>ICAR: I was the legs of the legless…now I have no legs.</p>
<p>MADAME ICAR: I used to have a husband and a home.</p>
<p>ICAR AND ST. PETER: Now you have two husbands and no home!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they listen to the invisible Voice of Stalin speak of the new world that is emerging out of the "pathos of construction" , the three characters scoff at his hubris. "Can man, even when he possesses a consummate science, possibly compare himself to God?" asks the pious Madame Icar. The fact that they invoke a religious creed that is also an object of critique does not mean that the audience is intended to discount their words. St. Peter once again takes on the role of prophet: "They'll be forced to condemn their own madness. Their confidence is like a spider web in the hands of the Lord! They'll rest upon their work and it won't have consistency. They'll want to maintain it and it won't hold up!"  One has to wonder: if the purpose of the scene is nothing more than propaganda, what are these naysayers doing here?</p>
<p>Standing in stark contrast to their humorous dialogue is the Voice of Eisenstein, which comes at the end of the tableau and is followed by nothing but "Silence." His lengthy speech is a laundry list of the gains won by the agricultural revolution, phrases that could have been pulled straight from the Soviet posters that adorned CAM's walls: (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>)</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Fertilizing manure, herds, agricultural machines, all raising the statistics. Neither the fire of revolt nor the great revolutionary struggle. But, after the struggle, the daily life of those who work and build a better life . . . the herds that are organized, the seed selection maps, the diagrams of progress . . . Model farms. Laboratories, schools. The worker-student, the peasant-student. The conscious, selected reproduction of animal species. The end of magic. The tractor . . .</p>
<div class="attrib"></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">What we hear is a representation, not of the style of Eisenstein's avant-garde films but of their social function. This is art that has been thoroughly instrumentalized and placed in the service of the state, art that is no longer distinguishable from political power. Without <span style="font-style:italic;">necessarily</span> undermining the theoretical validity of the ideal to which Eisenstein gives voice (such a judgment must remain contingent on the play's performance), the tableau very conspicuously refuses to realize it onstage. The happy, productive workers go through the door and out of sight; the people they leave behind are those who, as <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Oswald said of himself, stand "outside the revolutionary axis of the world."<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> But imperialism is the axis on which this play's world turns, and it is fitting that this tableau is at its center given that Stalin's declaration of the need to build "socialism in one state" formalized a historic split between the struggle for socialism and the struggle against imperialism. Over the loudspeakers and through the giant factory door we get a glimpse of what lies on the outside of the play—the move to enforce a social realist aesthetic and what Boris Groys has called the "total art of Stalinism."<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> In contrast, what takes place within this scene is not a reflection but, in Trotsky's words, a "deflection, a changing and a transformation of reality in accordance with the peculiar laws of art."<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> gives us neither politics as a total work of art, nor total theatricality, but a theatrical vision of totality—rather than "dematerializing" the stage, as was Piscator's <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  aim, Oswald materializes it, juxtaposing and superimposing historical and cultural references from around the world and across two thousand years. What we get is not Wagner, despite his characters' frequent appearances; rather, <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> takes Benjamin's analysis of the Trauerspiel, the Baroque "mourning play" composed of dialectical images, fragments, and ruins, and returns it to the stage. <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> makes a mock-heroic effort to gather together Christianity, Capitalism, Imperialism, Art, Mass Culture, and Fascism, to overcome the contradictions of history by embodying them onstage and in the colloquial language of 1930s Brazil. The Marxist theory that several of the characters cite serves a didactic function, and the teleological impulse is by no means abandoned. But the play's raucous humor, as well as its critical insight, is a result of the tension between its own aspirations and what is actually achieved onstage.</p>
<p>This becomes evident in the second instance of "total theater," which occurs after the socialist revolution, on Judgment Day, when Christ himself is brought to trial for a series of heinous crimes that include colluding with Roman Imperialism, serving as an agent of the reformist Second International, and, in the guise of the Emperor Constantine, coining the favored motto of all "historic fascisms"—"Let's make the revolution before the people do it" (a quote whose real author was a Brazilian ally of Vargas).<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> The tribunal is held in the former hall of the Nobel Prize, though the backdrop depicts two crosses at Golgotha. Here, at the moment when history itself is to be transcended, the stage and the audience are joined together and numerous characters are seated in the audience, among them biblical res, artists, fictional characters and anonymous spectators who weigh in on the trial while shouting the slogans of political parties in Brazil. For the theatrical audience, the effect would surely be one of immediacy and excitement; what is immediately experienced, however, is how capitalism divides the world in the very process of making it whole.</p>
<p>What drives this sprawling tableau is the attempt to capture the process through which what was once revolutionary comes to serve the cause of reaction. In the first scene, we see the biblical character Veronica (the "true image"), now a photographer and proponent of state cinema, who holds up a large ID photo of Christ that shows Hitler crucified on a Swastika—"the final incarnation of anti-Semitism" . <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> thus takes the core of the medieval mystery, its most troubling aspect and the one that led Hitler to celebrate the production at Oberammergau as an expression of the Aryan spirit, and turns it on its head. Instead of the Jews killing Jesus, Jesus is the killer of Jews. Yet there is also Barabbas, the sidekick of Mary Magdalene (now a cubist) and leader of the Jewish "nationalist" resistance against the Roman Empire, whom the people chose over Jesus when given the chance to save one prisoner from death; once a revolutionary, he is now "Baron Barabbas Rothschild," a reference to the French capitalist who sponsored Jewish settlement in Palestine in order to establish large plantations that relied on cheap Arab labor.</p>
<p>Of particular concern throughout is the way in which both high art and popular culture are used to serve the interests of the state. In one encounter Fu-Man-Chu, the pulp fiction and film character known as the Yellow Peril, rises up out of a hole in the floor from among the spectators and shouts that he had started life as a Taoist, wanting <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to transform the world without bloodshed; instead, Imperialism has transformed him into a "cagey beast." He gets into a scuffle with D'Artagnan, whom he calls a "Lackey! Product of the domestication of the masses!" and in response, D'Artagnan hurls racist epithets at him while bragging, "today I'm a mass phenomenon! Hitler! Mussolini! Gustavo Garapa!" (This last name is a derisive allusion to Gustavo Barroso, president of the Academia Brasileira de Letras and one of the most fiercely anti-Semitic Integralists.) D'Artagnan pursues the Chinese man backstage, though the English Novelist assures the audience, "Oh! They'll end up reconciling offstage" . Rather than a move to transcend politics theatrically, we get a reminder of what is <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> seen or transformed onstage and in the presence of the audience. The aim is not to create a "totality of effect" within the theater's four walls; on the contrary, it is to uncover the totality of social relations that defines the spectators' position in a global system that cannot be revolutionized by "art" alone, precisely because of the integral role that art plays within it.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> does not end with the grand apotheosis that typically capped off revistas, or with the merging of actors and audience that comes at the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mystery-Bouffe</span>. Instead, the final tableau brings us back to the strange ménage-àtrois of St. Peter, Icar, and his wife, who are in a waiting room of the Interplanetary Railway, which connects the Socialist Earth (now the Red Planet) to Mars (home of reactionaries and boyscouts) by means of the spaceship invented by Icar. These marginal res have been reduced to begging for coins under the watchful eyes of the GPU, the secret police of the Soviet state. "We are Marx's impoverished proletariat," Icar sighs . In one of the play's oddly prophetic moments, they mention that a radio announcer has just broken the news of Hitler's suicide—a path that Getúlio Vargas, too, would take in August 1954 when faced with a military coup. Icar plunges into space, shouting that in death he can be the "hero of Wagner, of Jules Verne." St. Peter offers, "I'll play our funeral. The funeral of a world" and cranks out Siegfried's funeral march on his accordion. His last words, arms raised toward the heavens, are: "We have been judged!" </p>
<p>The critic Sábato Magaldi was correct when he stated that this sprawling spectacle "doesn't even seem to belong to the reality of Brazilian theater." To this I would only add that Brazilian theater is itself an idea whose reality would not come to seem self-evident until sometime after 1937, the year Vargas declared the Estado Novo dictatorship and, a month later, created the Serviço do Teatro Nacional. The wanderings of St. Peter, Icar, and the Missus confirm the necessity of considering the avant-garde as part of a global totality; indeed, the play insists that from the very beginning the avant-garde was a "transnational" phenomenon. Yet the play also reveals that it was in the act of being integrated into a single system that the deepest divisions within the vanguard were sown. If <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> is difficult to understand within the contours of Brazilian theater, and if it leaves the few critics who discuss the play struggling to contain it within the limits of literary discourse, it is because it lies in the middle of a critical split—a "transition" between "the war horse and the turf horse (bourgeois society) and horsepower (socialist society)"—that was never realized on the world stage. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
