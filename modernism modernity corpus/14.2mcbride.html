<p id="lead">When the Anglo-American artists known as "neo-dada" rediscovered the work of Kurt Schwitters in the late 1950s, they thought they had found a model for robust artistic intervention that promised a way out of the strictures of Abstract Expressionism. Artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Allan Kaprow saw in Schwitters's collages of recycled refuse a model for critiquing the self-perpetuating cycle of consumerism and waste in capitalist societies. However, their interpretation of Schwitters's practices was based on a misreading of sorts, since Schwitters's use of trash in his collages had never been intended as an anti-capitalist critique of social relations in its day. Quite to the contrary. It had originally served to sustain a formalist aesthetics predicated on the autonomy of art from politics. Indeed, Schwitters's flaunted disinterest for politics with regard to Germany's aborted revolution and the turmoil of the early Weimar period had earned him the contempt of militant Dadaists like George Grosz and Richard Huelsenbeck, who curtly denied his request for admission to the Berlin Club Dada.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  </p>

<p>While critics have fully acknowledged Schwitters's path-breaking exploration of collage and assemblage, his productive blending of visual and verbal art forms, and his contributions to typography and advertising, they have also often concluded that his formalist understanding of art, revolving around the distinctive theory of montage he labeled <i>Merz</i>, was indebted to a nostalgic quest for order and harmony. According to this assessment, Schwitters conceived of art as a site of transcendence that promised the harmony and structure sorely missing in Weimar Germany. Yet Schwitters's putative desire for order and 

<b></b>

transcendence is difficult to reconcile with the exuberant transgression of boundaries—of the canvas, of the text, of different media and codes—that his montage practices relentlessly stage. Indeed, his art vigorously engages the messiness and incoherence of everyday experience rather than enacting its sublimation.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  This apparent contradiction raises the question of what kind of intervention is made possible by an artistic practice informed by abstraction, understood as a denial of ral representation or traditional narrative, and the combinatory principle of montage. In reconstructing the discourse on art and literature that unfolds in Schwitters's fictional and theoretical writings, I will show that his concept of montage embodies an understanding of reality as a universe of manipulable signs.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  By severing the link to representation, Schwitters fashioned art into an emancipatory realm for playing with the practices that make up ordinary signification, in a way that exposes their changeable and malleable nature.  </p>

<p>It is notable that the very aspects that made Schwitters appear marginal within prevalent accounts of Dadaism, namely, his emphasis on the specificity of artistic practice, his concern with reconceptualizing the art object, and his lack of iconoclastic rage even in his most radical experiments, have become central themes in recent endeavors to reevaluate Dada as a substantive, complex moment in the trajectory of the historical avant-garde.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  This article contributes to this reassessment by outlining the constructive intervention made by Schwitters's theory and practice of abstract montage. While it is true that Schwitters's hermetic practices refrained from commenting on the volatile mix of political retrenchments and socio-economic changes in Weimar Germany, they nevertheless modeled a type of emancipatory engagement with contemporary experience, albeit one that is qualitatively different from the political activism advocated by Grosz and Huelsenbeck in the early 1920s. This lies in conceptualizing art as a distinctive, cognitive medium that optimistically embraces the situatedness of ordinary practices of meaning-production, which it presents as open to subversive manipulation. </p>

<p>Schwitters's aesthetic practice and reflection turn on his program of <i>Merz</i>, a theory of abstract montage that supplied him with both an analytic framework and a brand label for his diverse artistic pursuits.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  His first comprehensive articulation of the concept is found in an essay from 1920 that sketches his position with regard to the politicization of the German avant-garde following the establishment of the Berlin Club Dada in 1918.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Schwitters's unstated aim in this text is to preempt the charge that his championing of abstraction is at bottom an escapist position, one that, as his sworn enemy Richard Huelsenbeck would argue, refused to take a robust political stance vis-à-vis the conservative retrenchments of post-war Germany while indulging the discredited idealism of Expressionism. The dispute with Huelsenbeck forced Schwitters to articulate the paradox at the heart of his project. That is, that art's non-representational, non-referential quality grounds its distinctiveness from other practices. At the same time, this very non-communicative quality, what Schwitters calls abstraction, also engenders art's transformative impact on experience. </p>

<p>Schwitters opens his essay on <i>Merz</i> by discussing the reasons for his turn against naturalistic representation in painting. In echoing Kandinsky's influential appeal on behalf of abstract painting in "On the Spiritual in Art," Schwitters maintains that the only 

<b></b>

aim art pursues is expression, "Ausdruck." Notably, the invocation of this quintessential Expressionist category marks Schwitters' departure from the discourse of Expressionism, for "Ausdruck" is not a path to disclosing some spiritual reality obfuscated by the materialistic world, as in Kandinsky's momentous essay. In Schwitters's paradoxical use of the term, expression is not a means to an end, but is strictly pursued for its own sake. Its utter intransitivity is the very hallmark of art and grounds Schwitters's turn to abstraction in his collages.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Such emphasis on art's intransitivity may at first seem to echo the ascetic modernism championed by Clement Greenberg. According to Greenberg, the modernist disavowal of mimesis arises from the artist's polemical refusal to enter a relation with a contemporary experience defiled by materialism, greed, and corrupt power.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  This refusal engenders a self-reflexive inquiry into the expressive qualities of a given medium in a quest for truth that pushes beyond the appearance of the material world. Yet for Schwitters the emphasis lies not in exploring the possibilities of a medium in an ascetic quest for purity, but rather in the operation of establishing connections among discrete elements. Objects such as a baby carriage wheel, a segment of barbed wire, a piece of twine can be yanked out of their customary environment, divested of their purpose or meaning, and treated at a par with color and line on the canvas: "These objects [ . . . ] lose through their mutual juxtaposition their individual character, their distinctive quality, they are dematerialized and become materials for the painting" (<i>LW</i> 5, 134).<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In other words, materials are chosen not for their inherent expressive qualities, but rather for their ability to enter into relationships with each other. Their intrinsic properties are of secondary relevance, while what truly counts are the connections that are established. The term <i>Merz</i> represents a direct illustration of this practice. As a syllable culled from the word "Commerzbank" ("Commerce Bank"), it did not have any recognizable meaning before Schwitters appropriated it. Once inserted in his discourse, it enters relationships with other terms and is charged with sense by the way it is used (<i>LW</i> 5, 77).<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  </p>

<p>For Schwitters, the difference between artistic and non-artistic organization of materials lies in the distinctive relational pattern of aesthetic objects, what he calls their "rhythm," again appropriating a key term from the language of Expressionism. Rhythm denotes relationships that are not random or coincidental, but rather express a properly aesthetic logic.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Because art lacks the communicative logic that links objects in everyday experience, the pattern created by artistic relations is self-referential. The self-referential artwork is not an utterly intransitive monad, however, for it presupposes recipients who are able to relate to it meaningfully. In other words, for Schwitters contemporary art communicates with its recipients not by offering a recognizable, though jarring and defamiliarizing, semblance of the extra-artistic world, one that could be charged with polemical ideological content, as in Huelsenbeck's politicized model. In Schwitters's discourse, abstraction grounds an artistic practice that reassembles elements culled from experience by means of a logic that disregards the mutual relations of objects in everyday life. Its underlying montage principle allows for a dramatic extension of the possibilities of any given art form, since the range of materials that can be used is virtually limitless [<a href="#1">re 1</a>].<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> <b></b></p>

<p>By emphasizing the transformative power of abstract montage, the <i>Merz</i> essay defuses Huelsenbeck's charge of escapism. In fact, Schwitters's integration of sundry elements from everyday experience fulfills Huelsenbeck's central demand that Dada embrace the cacophony of modern life. Along these lines, Schwitters's principle of <i>Merz</i> is portrayed as both more radical and tolerant in its encompassing contemporary experience, provided one quits demanding that art be something it is not, namely, politics. In other words, Schwitters's dispute with Huelsenbeck boils down to the question of why enjoin art to do the job of politics if one already has politics. This question inevitably raises a number of additional issues: what is the job of art, exactly? What is the point of establishing new relations among available objects? And what do recipients get out of the abstract artworks Schwitters champions? These issues involve a reflection on the distinctive nature of artistic intervention that is crucial for the avant-garde. </p>

<p>To address these questions one must first examine the reach of the montage practices envisioned by Schwitters. Schwitters's discourse is part of the prodigious reflection on montage and collage that traverses modernism and the avant-garde at the beginning of the twentieth century. Paraphrasing a 1925 remark by German art historian Franz Roh, Christopher Phillips describes the impact of visual montage as the confluence of two crucial tendencies in modern visual culture, namely, modernist abstraction and the realism of the photographic fragment.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Along similar lines, Peter Bürger discusses Picasso's and Braque's <i>papiers collés</i> in terms of a clash between the non-representational 

<b></b>

thrust of cubist painting and the illusionism of the collated elements—one may think in this context of Picasso's iconic "Still Life with Chair Caning"  [<a href="#2">re 2</a>], which juxtaposes painted objects made unrecognizable by cubist stylization to a hyper-realist, faux-chair caning glued directly onto the canvas.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The possibility for playing abstraction off against realism relies on the double signification engendered by montage techniques, which operate via a transfer of materials from one context to another. In this transfer, materials become functional parts of the new context while maintaining allusions to the previous one(s). Hence, Picasso's fragment of fake chair-caning, while being one of several still life objects on the canvas, exceeds the painting's frame of reference by metonymically evoking the image of a chair. This metonymic reference to the 'real object,' obtained through the unsublimated insertion of a fragment from the object, playfully mocks the conventions of illusionistic representation, which are brought into sharper relief through contrast with the Cubist rendering of objects that make up the rest of the composition.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The point I want to emphasize here concerns the productive double-coding engendered by montage, which lies in the ability of the assembled fragments to point back to the contexts out of which they were extracted as though they were affected by an incurable semantic cross-eyedness. This ability for productive semantic collisions accounts for the lack of closure and jarring quality of montage practices and grounds their potential for a critical expansion of perception.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  However, this subversive moment is conspicuously absent in Schwitters's theoretical discourse on <i>Merz</i>. In his emphasis on stripping the materials of their former contextual valences, Schwitters apparently strives to suppress the realist orientation of the collated elements, i.e., their ability to point to a context extrinsic to the artwork. In other words, he seems to discount the fruitful double talk that defines collage, but it appears doubtful that the cross-eyedness of collage practices could ever be fully suppressed. How is one to expect that the fragment of the cigarette ad used in the collage "Miss Blanche" completely lose its ties to the world of advertisement and function as a blank signifier whose meaning derives solely from the relationships it enters into with other collaged elements?<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The simplemindedness of this belief in a full dematerialization of materials has stymied many scholars, lending credence to the image of Schwitters as an artist whose collage practices are boldly experimental, but whose concept of art as a self-contained realm of order and harmony is at bottom escapist and nostalgic. And yet, the essay on <i>Merz</i> offers a far more nuanced understanding of montage than the contention that one can fully divest materials of their references to previous contexts. Specifically, the discussion of <i>Merz</i> poetry, that is, the unfolding of <i>Merz</i> in language, displays Schwitters's awareness about the insuppressible semantic ambivalence of montage:  </p>

<p>Poetry arises from the playing off of these elements against each other. Meaning is only essential if it is to be used as one such factor. I play off sense against nonsense. I prefer nonsense, but that is a purely personal matter. I pity nonsense, because until now it has been so neglected in the making of art, and that's why I love it.</p>

<p class="continued">

Much like <i>Merz</i> painting, <i>Merz</i> poetry is abstract in the sense that it aims at establishing unconventional relationships among the broadest range of materials. This is obtained by playing off words against each other, as well as any available, preformed linguistic units, which represent the equivalent of the sundry materials Schwitters used for his visual collages. Schwitters implicitly acknowledges that such materials—phrases, slogans, clichés—come with attached, contextual meaning. After all, it is their very formulaic character that makes them into discrete units to be treated as ready-made objects. While it is not possible to fully desemanticize words and phrases, that is, to completely suppress the meanings that adhere to them, one can treat such meanings as just one factor among others when it comes to the process of reassembling linguistic units. The priority here lies in expanding the range of artistic expression. Hence, non-sense is as good a material for <i>Merz</i> poetry as is sense. Indeed, it constitutes the linguistic counterpart of the refuse Schwitters fervently collected for use in his collages. </p>

<p>While Schwitters's visual work can readily be subsumed under the related categories of collage and assemblage, it is more difficult to glimpse in montage the overarching principle that informs his rich literary output, which encompasses plays, collage poems, essays, and fictional prose texts.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In the visual arts, abstraction is easily understood as connoting a rejection of ration, illusionism, or mimetic representation, but it is far more difficult to say what it may entail for media that draw on verbal language. Schwitters's consistent emphasis on practices informed by a principle of juxtaposition clearly indicates that abstract montage remains the broad frame of reference for his 

<b></b>

oeuvre over three decades, even where it does not overtly shape his textual practice. Indeed, an examination of what <i>Merz</i> means for literature shows that montage for Schwitters does not merely connote a set of combinatory practices, but more fundamentally discloses crucial processes of meaning production. In other words, the unfolding of montage in literature sheds light on the function of art in general and thus deserves closer scrutiny. </p>

<p>Based on Schwitters's own characterization of <i>Merz</i> literature in the passage quoted above, abstraction lies in disregarding the conventional ties among linguistic materials by establishing new connections in which the common meanings attaching to linguistic units of various kinds are played off against the non-sense produced by unconventional combinations. An enlightening example of this practice is found in the caustic, concise essays Schwitters wrote in response to negative reviews of his works.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  These early prose texts, whose bold linguistic and textual experimentation points to the influence of both Expressionism and Dada, weave humorous patchworks collaging Schwitters's attacks on critics, quotations from the critics' own reviews, and seemingly unrelated linguistic material, ranging from simple phrases to complete sentences, which are usually set off by parentheses. The following passage, drawn from an essay published in the Berlin avant-garde journal <i>Der Sturm</i> in 1920, provides a good example for the sardonic tone of these short essays and exemplifies their primary textual strategy:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>For a moment today, let us 'take up' Mr. Felix Neumann. "Nothing kills faster than ridiculousness," he writes. But dear Sir, you are committing suicide! Didn't you read your article of January 6, 1920 in the Post? Sheer suicide! (Nothing kills faster than ridiculousness.) [ . . . ] You say I'm gnawing with a thousand like-minded comrades at the roots of our strength. (A pretty picture.) Don't you mean: your strength? No, a million times, no, I'm not gnawing, put your mind at ease. I am no rat and you are no tree. I wouldn't have the first clue where to find the roots of your strength. Besides, I would prefer to gnaw my way alone, if you please, without thousands of co-gnawers. But I am no rodent. On the contrary; I am the one being gnawed on. Undoubtedly you will cease gnawing on me any moment now, otherwise I will make you ridiculous, rest assured! Otherwise I will make you ridiculous. Don't you know, that kills. [ . . . ] All I need to do is copy what you yourself have written, that is enough.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(<i>LW</i> 5, 49)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This passage seizes on two offhand remarks in the critic's review, the proverb-like motto "Nothing kills faster than ridiculousness," used to disparage Schwitters's poetry in the volume <i>Anna Blume Dichtungen</i> ("Anna Blume Poems," 1919), and the charge regarding Schwitters's presumed detrimental influence on contemporary audiences: "he gnaws at the roots of our strength with a thousand like-minded souls." The critic's hyperbolic style is mocked by Schwitters, who seizes on the metaphorical, "pretty image," of the harmful rodent gnawing away at the roots of a tree, and humorously unfolds it as though it had been meant literally. This allows him to debunk the chauvinistic insinuation entailed in the critic's image of a hoard of rats chipping away at the healthy roots of "our" strength, by suggesting that at issue must rather be the critic's own strength: "You mean your strength?" Secondly, Schwitters turns the degrading image of the gnawing rodent against the critic himself, claiming that, if anything, he 

<b></b>

is the one being attacked in a parasitic and insidious way ("gnawed on"), while also protesting the suggestion that he is just one of an entire hoard of artists who are doing exactly the same things he does. Finally, the text makes its own strategies manifest in the last comic death threat launched against the critic. If, as the critic had pompously stipulated in reviewing Schwitters's collages, "nothing kills faster than ridiculousness," then Schwitters threatens to simply re-use a few sentences from the critic's own review, whose preposterousness renders them a lethal weapon. The whole review, Schwitters establishes at the beginning, is tantamount to suicide by the critic's own standard that "nothing kills faster than ridiculousness." </p>

<p>This excerpt well illustrates Schwitters's strategy of seizing on words and phrases from the critic's review and recycling them by "merz-ing" them, that is, adapting them for a new context. One strategy exemplified above includes removing a term, "gnawing," from its syntagmatic context and exploring its paradigmatic relations to other terms. This forms an equivalent to exploiting the cross-eyedness of collaged fragments in Picasso's "Still Life," for the semantic valence of the verb "gnawing" is not allowed to exhaust itself in the actualization of the meaning suggested by the critic's sentence. Rather, the word is made to look outside the sentence in search for other meanings that could be actualized within the linguistic context of the citation. This leads to a slippage from metaphorical to literal meaning, so that "gnawing" is interpreted as concretely pointing to the activity of rodents. A whole new context is constructed around the sentence to support this new, actualized meaning, giving way to a humorous juxtaposition between the new literal image (this painter is a rodent who is eating away at the roots of our tree) and the charge entailed in the critic's puffed-up metaphor (this painter is a persistent, though not immediately visible threat to the health of our national art and culture). Arguably, the non-sense that is produced in this way makes a lot of sense as a weapon of ridicule turned against the critic. The humor is compounded by the fact that it is the critic's own claims, in their recycled form, which help to expose his pompousness and smugness.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Schwitters's montage principle entails an assault on the linear unfolding of discourse, which is constantly interrupted by parenthetical inserts that either provide a commentary or contain seemingly unrelated, disparate linguistic material. This practice corresponds to Schwitters's characterization of abstract montage as a process aimed at establishing novel, unconventional relations among existing elements. The nonsense produced in this way does not make the impression of chaos, however, but instead unfolds in a highly methodical way, engendering a coherent, parallel universe to sense.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  This is very different from the assault on poetic coherence that marks the Expressionist <i>Wortkunst</i> ("Word Art") tradition (endorsed by the avant-garde circle around <i>Der Sturm</i>), which Schwitters had initially followed. This poetic model revolved around stripping language to its bones, allowing for an ecstatic feeling to replace grammatical structure. The result are texts dominated by paratactic constructions and word chains, as exemplified by the poetry of August Stramm, its most celebrated representative. By contrast, Schwitters's language is set in motion not by releasing the unstructured intensity of feeling, but rather by exploring alternatives to its ordinary use, which is 

<b></b>

thus exposed as conventional. In this context non-sense does not represent a negation of sense through the polemical display of gibberish. Rather non-sense appears contiguous to sense, as a manipulation of available material that is close enough to sense to be deciphered as the other of conventional meaning, but outlandish enough to be recognized as lying outside of the established automatism of signification.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Schwitters's description of how <i>Merz</i> functions in the domain of literature is especially enlightening as an illustration of the cultural shift described by Helmut Lethen for Weimar Germany, away from a conception of meaning as essentially given and toward understanding communication as based on models of conduct designed to protect individuals in a potentially hostile social arena. Lethen argues that the collapse of the ideology of inwardness and metaphysical essences that had buttressed German culture up to Expressionism produces, in the post-war world of Weimar, a culture of appearances, in which the inner guide of conscience has given way to the exterior pressure of shame.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  In a culture based on exteriority, communication is not about expression of some inward substance. Rather, as suggested by Schwitters's juxtaposition of sense and non-sense, it is an outward practice that functions through the manipulation of existing materials and signs. In this context, one should also note the dispassionate, cool terminology, to use another of Lethen's categories, that structures Schwitters's discourse on art, and that decisively sets it off from the "incandescent," late-idealistic pathos of Expressionism. "Evaluate," "play off," "given parts," "materials," "factors" are the central concepts denoting artistic practice. This language conveys an understanding of experience not as an organic totality, but rather as a relational network defined by contingent, shifting practices. Art represents an intervention on these practices that playfully manipulates existing elements to obtain different relational conrations. In so doing, it prides itself with recycling even those elements that have lost their original purpose, such as refuse, or those linguistic segments that do not make sense in the conventional system of communication, and are thus designated as non-sense. </p>

<p>Lethen's discussion also accounts for the intense agonistic quality of Schwitters's replies to his critics, which can easily cross into the vituperative. Their abrasive tone well fits into the shift to a culture of shame that forms a crucial building block in Lethen's argument. As Lethen maintains, in a setting that valorizes preserving one's self-esteem in the eyes of others and avoiding the shame that arises from being caught at fault, shaming rituals take the place of the pangs of conscience in sanctioning undesirable behavior. Schwitters's texts stage just such rituals by drawing on the tool of parody. That is, their main shaming strategy lies in debunking the critics' credibility and authority by repeating their statements with some key modification so as to cast ridicule on them, a strategy that is explicitly thematized in the passage quoted above. In the least successful texts this strategy comes across as perfunctory and cheap. Its basic rhetorical gesture, which can be summed up as "You said this of me, but I turn this charge against you so as to make you appear ludicrous," quickly grows old, begging the question why Schwitters did not occasionally come up with more substantial arguments in response to his critics than the trick of parody. Lethen's discussion of Weimar's shaming rituals provides an answer to this question, as one can argue that Schwitters's aim in these 

<b></b>

texts is not to engage his critics in a meaningful debate, but rather to discredit them by exposing them to public ridicule. There is, however, another, more significant reason that accounts for the predominance of parody in these texts. It lies in the key role that parody plays in Schwitters's understanding of montage. Specifically, in Schwitters's work parody is not limited to a traditional strategy of mocking criticism, but rather discloses the fundamental way in which communication functions. </p>

<p>Bernd Scheffer has emphasized Schwitters's extensive use of parodic practices of (self)quotation, which is especially conspicuous in his early literary work and finds a paradigmatic example in "An Anna Blume" ("For Anna Blossom"), one of the most successful poems of the Weimar Republic.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Indeed, Anna Blume functions as a protean trope that gains a life of its own in Schwitters's texts, returning in a variety of incarnations that traverse his early oeuvre. The strategy of recycling his own work involves elements of various kinds, ranging from single characters to titles of prose texts and entire textual fragments varying in size from a few lines from the first Anna Blume poem to several paragraph-length segments.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  What makes this practice notable is the extent to which the recycled materials remain fully recognizable as inserts, never completely losing their tie to the context from which they were extracted. </p>

<p>This characterization helps foreground the common ground shared by parody and montage in Schwitters's work. Parody must be understood in this context as endowed with the broad meaning described by Linda Hutcheon, who defines it as a "repetition with critical distance, which marks difference rather than similarity." For Hutcheon, the parodic goes well beyond the traditional practice of imitating a text or an object while injecting the imitation with some humorous difference aimed at casting ridicule on the model. To be sure, Hutcheon echoes the traditional definition of parody in seeing the relation between the model and the parodied text as one of "ironic inversion." However, she stresses that the irony is "not always at the expense of the parodied text," but rather serves to mark the moment of difference, i.e., to make clear that the imitation is at variance with the original.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  When considered within the context of Schwitters's montage practices, parody is a strategy for recycling materials where the moment of recycling or imitation is made explicit by the ironic variation on the original. Reusing materials derived both from his own work and that of others, Schwitters weaves a complex patchwork of relations in which texts are never fully contained in themselves, but always point outside their contingent boundaries to allude to other texts. In its manifest double-coding, parody functions as an overt intertextual strategy that foregrounds the signifying mechanism proper to montage. This practice challenges conventional notions of authorship and the bounded text while at the same time establishing a high degree of coherence in Schwitters's oeuvre. It is a type of coherence that is not so much predicated on the repetition of specific content or materials as on the formal relations that repetition establishes. </p>

<p>The role and scope of parody, understood as a formal web sustained by an ironic principle of repetition, is paradigmatically illustrated in "Schacko," a story from 1926, which also probes the meaning of abstraction in literature.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The story's title is borrowed from the name of its central re, a parrot whose illness and untimely death 

<b></b>

constitute the narrative's primary focus. Most of the story is told in the first person by the parrot's owner, a woman mourning the recent death of her husband. "Such a naked tiny animal" she repeats tirelessly. As she explains, the bird pulled out all its feathers during the time spent with the bed-ridden man, whose pains compelled him to keep the lights on at night. Unable to sleep, the parrot compulsively picked at its plumage (<i>LW</i> 2, 289). The vet has now been summoned to save the bird, who becomes afflicted in tight sequence by constipation due to a hernia, a sudden, disastrous attack of diarrhea, and, finally, by fluid in its lungs, which causes its ultimate demise. The story ends, quite humorously, with the fearless woman performing an improvised autopsy to ascertain the bird's cause of death. She then lovingly buries its corpse at the feet of her husband's grave, thus fulfilling his last wish. </p>

<p>In a preface to the 1933 reprint of the story Schwitters explicitly thematizes the role of abstraction in literature: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>It is very difficult to realize abstraction in literature [ . . . ] I would like to point to the structure of "<b>Schacko</b>," to its abstract law of <b>composition</b>. I have heard Schacko's story myself told from a woman, <b>word for word, the whole tale</b> [ . . . ] this brought the material closer to me from a human standpoint; but <b>as such</b> it was not yet an artwork. <b>The matter became an artwork only through form</b>: how the woman's statements are juxtaposed to each other, how they are repeated, complement each other, how they anticipate or confirm each other, how they hang together as a whole so as to make ever more manifest the woman's love for her husband, <b>an abstract concept</b>, and her desperation, <b>yet again an abstract concept</b>, and this is <b>the content of this story</b>. You can analyze all my texts in this way and you will have to admit that their form is always abstract in this way: statements are juxtaposed to each other.</p>

<p class="continued">According to this passage, the narrative is based on a true story which its protagonist related to the writer of the preface. While the story is not made up, it is also not a faithful recording of the tale told by the woman. Rather the narrative recycles materials provided by the model by rearranging them within the medium of literature. Its artistic attributes, that which distinguishes it from the woman's narration, lie in its distinctive form, what Schwitters calls its abstract law of composition. Form in this context concerns the way in which the woman's statements, which are made more poignant by their disarming ordinariness, are merzed/collaged, that is, repeated and juxtaposed so as to bring to the fore what are essentially abstract constructs, namely, her feelings of love and desperation. This abstract content calls for the deployment of formal abstraction, which in this case denotes the refusal to render the woman's state of mind through a mimetic narrative that would draw on conventional psychological observation. Hence, the terms love and desperation are never used in reference to her. Yet the narrative enacts these abstract concepts through its structure and linguistic form, which thus bear further scrutiny. </p>

<p>The story is composed of thirteen sections typographically set off by horizontal lines. The first nine sections contain the woman's first-person account; the tenth segment bears the title "<b>POSTSCRIPT</b> (For the Reader's Orientation)" and introduces segments told from the perspective of an omniscient narrator, who claims to have heard the story

 from the woman herself (<i>LW</i> 2, 291). [<a href="#3">res 3</a>–5] The narrative is patterned after the rapid back and forth of vernacular dialogue, which at times contains short descriptive inserts providing a bare minimum of background information. Each section reintroduces and juxtaposes phrases and idioms from the previous sections in an almost compulsive manner, which at once foregrounds the formulaic character of the linguistic material and the intensity of feeling that underlies its use. The repetition of and variation on utterly banal, yet affectionate phrases such as "such a naked tiny animal," "turn around now," "shame on you, Schacko!" (referring to the parrot's nakedness and wretched looks) drive the story on toward its poignant, grotesquely comic ending.

<p>What makes the parrot especially fascinating is the semblance of meaningful exchange that arises when people address it. The wife tells the doctor that the bird does not just mimic the sounds it hears, but rather uses the words it repeats in a deliberate manner (<i>LW </i>2, 290). The woman's apparent delusion adds a humorous and poignant touch to the narration. At the same time, it draws attention to the pattern of repetition that structures the communication between the actors of the dialogue. Indeed, the speakers feed off each other's verbal input in ways that recall the communication modeled by the parrot. In their repetitions these speakers do not just 'parrot' each other, that is, mindlessly reproduce fragments of sonoric sequences, but rather they modulate them, adding new touches.  </p>

<p>The principle of repetition also extends to the larger segments that make up the narrative. For instance, sections seven, eight, and nine each appear to be an expansion of the previous. In barely two lines, section seven describes the woman's discovery that the parrot's intestines bulge out as a result of the hernia. Section eight picks up on this description, while identifying constipation as the cause of the parrot's bulging parts and recounting the disastrous resolution of the parrot's problem when the bird relieves itself on the train taking the woman to the vet. In section nine, the scene is relived and amplified in the woman's dramatic retelling to the doctor. When considered within the story's overall structure, the sections appear to parrot each other, repeating and modulating elements from the previous ones while also adding new detail. While suggesting a clear sequence of events, the overlapping repetitions disrupt the sense of closure and sequential unfolding of traditional narrative. The exuberance and vividness of this seemingly incontrollable repetition harness the text's impact on the recipient. Though the expectation of logically unfolding communication is frustrated at every turn, there is another type of communication taking place, which presupposes a different kind of intelligibility. This type of intelligibility understands communication as a parodic montage of materials. Communication, in other words, is about recycling materials that 

<b></b>

are already out there by inserting them into different contexts and establishing new connections among them. As an enactment of abstract literature, the text parrots the way meaning is transmitted through communication, that is, it imitates it in an ironic mode. In so doing, it shows that the building blocks of communication are never new, original, untainted, but always encumbered with resonances from other contexts. </p>

<p>Understanding communication as an assemblage of found materials suggests a parallel to Marcel Duchamp's experimentation with the ready-made and the found object in the 1910s and '20s, with which Schwitters was well familiar.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  While there is much ground shared by the two artists, for the purpose of this essay it will be instructive to briefly review the different assumptions that undergird their deployment of preformed materials. Whereas Duchamp's recycling of found objects was guided by the question "Under which conditions can this object be presented as an art object?",<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  i.e., aimed to test the conventions of art by probing the boundary between art and non-art, Schwitters was never interested in placing the status of art in question. In fact, while ransacking all possible media and idioms for his work, Schwitters never wavered in his belief in the autonomy of the artistic medium, defined as the possibility of establishing non-conventional relations among everyday objects, which recipients would readily identify as art. If Duchamp sought to challenge the self-adjudicated, exceptionalist ontology of art by exposing its dependence on contextual, that is, institutional factors, Schwitters was more interested in the claim to ordinariness of everyday life. In other words, one could describe Schwitters's practice by inverting Duchamp's questions, "What makes art into art? What grounds art's claim to an extraordinary status?" so as to ask "How ordinary is the non-artistic? What lies behind the ordinariness of everyday objects?" </p>

<p>This focus on the ordinary quality of everyday experience recalls Marjorie Perloff's discussion of two competing modernist paradigms for engaging poetic language. The dominant model, Perloff maintains, is defined by belief in a fundamental "distinction between the 'practical' language of 'ordinary' communication and the 'autonomous' language of poetry."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  This distinction is sustained by a centuries-old reflection on language, art, and philosophy that has been encoded through a variety of oppositions: scientific vs. artistic, cognitive vs. emotive, denotative vs. connotative, literal vs. ral, ordinary vs. defamiliarizing. Perloff draws on Wittgenstein's reflection on linguistic practice in the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> to describe a second strain of modernist poetics. This latter model rejects the distinction between literary and ordinary language and rather views the aesthetic as a realm for scrutinizing ordinary language use, that is, the everyday practices by which we communicate and produce meaning. This examination helps expose the fundamental strangeness of these practices, that is, their situatedness and conventional nature, the fact that they could be organized differently and be just as meaningful. From this vantage point art appears as a medium for grasping ordinary signifying practices by means of a performance that makes them appear unfamiliar. This is the modernist strain that grounds Schwitters's interrogation of the 'ordinariness of the ordinary' via a manipulation of its materials.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Wittgenstein's exploration of language as a rule-guided practice, a set of games whose conventions are rooted in the shared way of life of speakers offers an enlightening 

<b></b>

perspective for assessing Schwitters's manipulation of nonsense in the response to the critic's review discussed above. If, according to Wittgenstein, meaning is produced by arranging signifying elements according to the rules of a game, then Schwitters's strategies in this excerpt consist in engaging the critic's language game while tweaking with its rules.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Specifically, Schwitters refuses to interpret the image of the "gnawing critter" in the metaphorical sense in which it was intended and instead unfolds its literal meaning, so as to debunk its chauvinistic and debasing implications. This operation indirectly questions just how ordinary the metaphorical deployment of this image is in reference to the impact of experimental, avant-garde art. Should the disparaging allusion to pest-bringing rodents be treated as a common-place way of critiquing artistic experiments one finds objectionable? How innocuous is this mode of critique? And how much does one learn about the object at stake from this kind of insinuation? Schwitters's attack on what he perceives as a dishonest, because uninformed and uninformative, critique does not marshal reasoned arguments to make its point, but rather unfolds via a linguistic performance that debunks the claim to ordinariness of a slandering metaphor.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In <i>Schacko</i>, the ordinariness of phrases like "Such a naked tiny animal" mutates into its opposite by way of exuberant repetition, which is made to express the intense feeling that propels the utterance. The banal vernacular phrase thus becomes a touching cipher for the tender, inarticulate love that binds the woman to an unpleasant pet she cherishes as a remnant of life with her husband. Furthermore, the linguistic behavior of the characters in <i>Schacko</i> presents close affinities to Wittgenstein's understanding of language games. Their communication unfolds as a chain of overlapping repetitions based on mimicking each others' utterances while also infusing them with difference so as to adapt them to their needs. The impression one gains is that of a disorderly patchwork of exchanges that lack a discernible pattern or recognizable rules, but are nonetheless effective in negotiating meaning. This is because the speakers are willing to take their cues from their interlocutors, that is, they appropriate each others' phrases while modifying them as needed. Drawing on a central Wittgensteinian trope, one could say that they play a game whose rules they do not just follow, but also adapt and expand in response to contingent conrations.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The point I want to stress here regards the distinctive understanding of language and communication Schwitters shares with Wittgenstein's later philosophy. Communication in this context is not about choosing one option over another from some deep structure of language which would function as a blueprint for possible games. As Stanley Cavell has noted, the novelty and profundity of Wittgenstein's inquiry reside in the realization "that everyday language does not, in fact or in essence, depend upon such a structure and conception of rules, and yet that the absence of such a structure in no way impairs its functioning."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  This well describes Schwitters's anti-psychological understanding of communication as an aggregate of contingent modes of behavior that bind individuals via a parodic mechanism of repetition. That these individuals are conspicuously bereft of an inward space by no means curtails their agency, i.e., their ability to engage in meaningful practices.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>What good is the realization that making and trading sense is not about actualizing some systematic properties of language? What kind of artistic intervention does this realization make possible and call for? In other words, what is the relationship between art and the practices of meaning-production that harness everyday experience in a productively disorderly, unpredictable, open-ended network? To answer these questions in closing, I would like to examine a short story, a parable of sorts, which Schwitters wrote in an ironic attempt to educate art critics, and that was published in 1920. The story is titled after its unlikely heroine, Augusta Bolte, an eager young woman whose life becomes unhinged one day when she decides to follow ten people she sees walking on the street. Though they at first seem to be mere strangers, the fact that they walk in the same direction and the sheer roundness of the number ten convince Augusta that the ten are involved in a mysterious operation that promises the disclosure of life's wisdom. Certain that her life now depends on solving this riddle, Augusta embarks on a series of adventures that prove to be every bit as absurd as the reasoning that triggered her initial pursuit. </p>

<p>The narrative unfolds along a multilayered pattern of repetitions that are enacted at various levels. One such layer consists of the methodic repetitiveness of Augusta's thought processes, which the narration meticulously renders. Yet the more the narrator praises the young woman for her intelligence, talent, and methodical thinking, the clearer it becomes that Augusta's systematic approach is of absolutely no help in dealing with the events that confront her. For instance, Augusta gets comically hung up on the recurring rhyme patterns of her own interior monolog and feels compelled to discern in them some mysterious sense: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>And now? How now? A scandalous rhyme! How rhymed with now. Beyond that it seemed especially peculiar to Miss Augusta that not only did how rhyme with now, but now also rhymed with how [ . . . ] The rhyme came up her throat like cod-liver oil<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  [ . . . ] For when something's happening then the most unrhymed things happen to happen. Then all of a sudden what never rhymed before, rhymes. Let's sum up! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 people were walking in one and the same direction, now rhymed with how. Something obviously had to be going on. How should Augusta find out?</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(<i>pppppp,</i> 141)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Augusta's reasoning in this passage is based on a pun involving the German word for rhyme: "sich reimen" also has the metaphorical meaning of "making sense," "hanging together in a meaningful way;" by the same token, "unrhymed" ("ungereimt") means inconsistent. So when Augusta detects unexpected rhymes in her self-monologue, she concludes that they must be cues for some deeper meaning. However, the literal rhymes that are involved here are really only a sound pattern.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  They exhibit recognizable formal relationships, but have no inherent meaning.  </p>

<p>Augusta ultimately fails to learn the secret of life, but her experiences have not been in vain. Every turn of her oddball story is a step forward in an educational trajectory that earns her ever higher academic degrees. In the end she realizes that experience is structured by relationships that have no inherent meaning. One has to invest them with meaning by deciding what to care about, and what to interpret (<i>pppppp,</i> 162).

<b></b>

This is not at all a nihilistic insight, but rather has a liberating effect, because it relieves Augusta from the anxious quest for the hidden meaning she believes to glimpse in the random patterns that structure experience. This realization prompts her to make a clean break with her previous life and concentrate on pursuing a young man, who she is convinced makes a worthy husband. This pursuit however comes to an abrupt end when the driver of the cab she has enrolled in the chase abandons her in a remote location because she cannot pay the fare. In this way the narrative averts not only a happy ending, but any kind of ending. The only measure of closure is offered by the narrator, who polemically takes center stage in the last paragraph and addresses the readers so as to preempt their anticipated criticism: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The reader might have thought that something would be happening here; [ . . . ] Certainly the reader will think that Miss Dr. Lif<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  would find out who or what is going on, but she finds out nothing. The reader believes that he has the right to find out, but the reader has no right, and certainly not the right to find out anything in a work of art. [ . . . ] It's just that the story is over, simply over, no matter how sorry I am no matter how brutal it must sound, there's nothing else I can do.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(<i>pppppp, </i>163–64)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This declaration by the narrator effectively turns the tables on the reader. It becomes apparent that the reader has been tricked into having fun at Augusta's expense only to find out that he or she has been performing operations similar to Augusta's in reading the story. Like Augusta, the reader has tried to make sense of the narrated events by deciphering narrative cues, by ruling out possible readings, and by making predictions on how the story would continue or end. In foreclosing any conclusion that could tie the narrative together in a meaningful way, the narrator admonishes the reader that one does not have the right to expect to learn anything from an artwork. There is nothing to understand or learn from this story, because there is nothing to learn or understand from art. In this way, the story establishes a parallel between the contingent structure of experience and art. Everyday experience comprises an array of events one navigates without subjecting them to a systematic logic. Many of them exhibit contingent connections, but do not necessarily make sense. Art is just this kind of event or object. Its connections have no intrinsic sense, and yet are not without structure. </p>

<p>In spite of the narrator's refusal to supply a meaningful conclusion for the story, the reader does have something to take away at the end. In a way, the story provides a lesson in conduct as described by Helmut Lethen. Specifically, it presents meaning as negotiated through Augusta's practice. Augusta's conduct is however a negative example, a model of how not to negotiate meaning in everyday experience. As it becomes clear, the flipside of Augusta's obsession with random structures is her inability to interact meaningfully with the individuals who cross her path. Her solipsistic determination to decode structures that supposedly hold the meaning of life is precisely the opposite of the cooperative behavior of speakers who negotiate communication based on games whose rules are constantly remade through playing. Rather than actively play by ear in the ever-shifting game of signification, Augusta is played by the structure and therefore loses. In the end she may well understand that the structures one encounters in 

<b></b>

experience have no inherent meaning, but she never learns to interact effectively with others, including the cab driver who abandons her in the middle of nowhere. With Augusta, the reader comes to see that the practice of ascribing meaning to patterns solely based on their structural regularity is misguided. Meaning is based on patterns, but does not automatically flow from them. In a similar way, art's formal relations do not produce meaning in any ordinary sense of the word, but unfold contiguously to ordinary processes of meaning-production, which they present in a defamiliarizing form that questions their ordinariness and thus makes them conspicuous. Schwitters, who has been accused of reducing art to formalist play, delivers a paradoxical indictment of formalism with this narrative, while providing a wonderful enactment of his concept of abstract, autonomous art. </p>

<p>Schwitters's montage principle envisions art as a realm for playing with the contingent practices of meaning-production. The abstraction of artistic practice places non-sense along side sense, not to deny the possibility of meaning but to make signifying structures apparent. This is crucial for assessing the value of Schwitters's belief in abstraction and his distinctive brand of formalism. When seen from this perspective, Schwitters's abstraction turns out to be the opposite of the refusal of narrativity, which for Rosalind Krauss informs the modernist tendency to abstraction. For Krauss, the quest for formal purity and compulsion of repetition, which sustains the avant-garde obsession with the grid, foregrounds the structure of permanent deferral that characterizes signification. Put in terms of the Saussurian distinction between <i>langue</i> and <i>parole</i>, Krauss focuses on <i>langue</i> as a systematic network of relations that stages an ultimate absence.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Schwitters's formalism, by contrast, is about the <i>parole</i> aspect of language, about its being a playground for the contingent games of signification. Hence, Schwitters's hybrid verbal and visual collages veer toward the messiness of everyday communication rather than toward the purity of a system. By the same token, Schwitters holds on to an emphatic understanding of artistic agency. The artist is not played by structure or beholden to the unfolding of chance, but rather is actively engaged in the game of meaning. </p>

<p>This engagement does not translate into a critical practice that aims to redress perceived injustices by challenging established hierarchies of power. Richard Huelsenbeck was right to find Schwitters wanting in this respect and to point to the affirmative impulse sustaining his work. What Schwitters's work affirms, however, is not the bourgeois order which it fails to condemn, but rather the possibility of an experience whose meaning is constructed and ever-shifting, yet can nonetheless be perceived as whole and consequential. This affirmative moment helps place into perspective Schwitters's emphatic insistence on the autonomy of artistic practice, which is held to stand in an intransitive relation to everyday signifying practices while paradoxically feeding off them. While shunning overt political engagement, Schwitters's avant-garde impulse does nonetheless actualize one strong meaning of critique, conceived as the task of probing the presuppositions and boundaries that delimit a given practice. In this sense, art is held to be a distinct cognitive medium for testing ordinary signifying practices via an investigation that makes them appear unfamiliar. This investigation 

<b></b>

exposes their lack of a supratemporal structure and being driven by parodic repetition instead, which highlights their contingency and manipulability. Such insights are optimistically framed as an opportunity for expanding the range of signification, an agenda Schwitters relentlessly pursued in a range of practices that pushed the bounds of established genres and media. <i>Merz</i>, the principle of abstract montage that undergirds his work, rests on the realization that the intersubjective practice we call meaning is but a restricted set of possible games. Its playful challenge to the 'ordinariness of the ordinary' exemplarily fulfills the avant-garde imperative of an engagement with lived experience, as it fearlessly hurls artistic practice into the midst of the disorderly games of meaning and exhorts the players to expand the range of possible moves that will allow them to stay in the game. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT1" href="#REF1">1</a>. Schwitters was born in Hanover in 1887. In the 1920s and 1930s he collaborated with some of the most innovative artists of Dada, De Stijl, and Constructivism. In 1937 he was forced to flee Nazi Germany and emigrate to Norway and later to Britain, where he died in 1948. In the 1950s, avant-garde artists in Europe and the United States discovered in his work a formidable model for blending visual and verbal art forms that opened the way for pop and conceptual art.

<p><a name="FOOT2" href="#REF2">2</a>. Leah Dickerman points to the incongruous relation between Schwitters's occasional recourse to a "rhetoric of purity" in reference to his collages and "the radicalism of [his] formal procedures—its wholesale openness to stuff of the modern world, its assault on traditional concepts of medium, and its reconration of the terms of distribution." Dickerman notes that Schwitters's scholarship has in various degrees subscribed to Huelsenbeck's assessment of Schwitters as "someone insufficiently political and overly bourgeois," thereby lending credence to the image of Schwitters as an artist whose practices were revolutionary, but whose naïve, child-like attitude fueled a propensity for escapist, uncommitted play.

A case in point is Kurt Schmalenbach's monograph, the first comprehensive study of the post-World-War II period, which portrays Schwitters as an innocent, child-like genius. Werner Schmalenbach, <i>Kurt Schwitters</i> (Köln: DuMont, 1967). This image has become especially ingrained in the Anglophone reception of Schwitters's oeuvre. For instance, Huelsenbeck's emphasis on Schwitters's apolitical attitude reemerges in Benjamin Buchloh's assessment of his collage practices as marked by "a meditative contemplation of reification," which Buchloh contrasts with the activist model of "mass agitation" exemplified by John Heartfield's photo-montages. Benjamin H.D. Buchloh, "Allegorical Procedures: Appropriation and Montage in Contemporary Art," <i>Artforum</i> 21 (September 1982): 43–56, here 43. John Elderfield also endorses the evaluation of Schwitters as indebted to a nostalgic late Romanticism, an assessment which he however embeds in a complex, wide-ranging analysis of both his visual and literary oeuvre that remains an unsurpassed resource for Schwitters's scholarship to date. John Elderfield, <i>Kurt Schwitters</i> (London: Thames and Hudson, 1985).On the whole, Schwitters's literary oeuvre has received far less attention than his visual work. Interest flourished in Germany in the 1970s, when Schwitters was seen as a forerunner of experimental literature. See the 1972 issue of <i>Text + Kritik</i> dedicated to Schwitters's literary work, as well as the monograph by Bernd Scheffer, <i>Anfänge experimenteller Literatur. Das literarische Werk von Kurt Schwitters</i> (Bonn: Bouvier, 1978). For Anglophone scholarship dealing with Schwitters's literary output, see E.S.

<p><a name="FOOT3" href="#REF3">3</a>. There is no established distinction between the terms montage and collage, which are often used interchangeably. Marjorie Perloff notes that collage generally connotes static visual practices, while montage refers to practices that develop in time, most notably film. Perloff, "Collage and Poetry," <i>Encyclopedia of Aesthetics</i>, vol. 1, ed. Michael Kelly (New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press), 384–87, here 385. Historically, the term montage gained currency in conjunction with film theory. The Berlin Dadaists prized the term also for its affinity to the world of the factory and machine production, as witnessed by John Heartfield's nickname as "Monteur," which in German means mechanic or engineer. This is a very different semantic field from that of the French 'collage,' whose metaphorical reference to an illicit, extramarital relation situates its transgression squarely within the field of bourgeois morality. In this article, the term montage will be used as denoting a broad aesthetic principle of combination and juxtaposition. This principle encompasses a variety of practices ranging from verbal and visual collage, sculptural assemblage, and photomontage. For a discussion of collage in the context of the historical avant-garde see Perloff's "The Invention of Collage," <i>The Futurist Moment: Avant-Garde, Avant Guerre, and the Language of Rupture</i>, second edition (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2003), 42–79; and Christine Poggi, <i>In Defiance of Painting: Cubism, Futurism, and the Invention of Collage</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992); for an historical overview of the development of collage and montage practices in Western art see Brandon Taylor, <i>Collage: TheMaking of Modern Art</i> (New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2004). </p>

<p><a name="FOOT5" href="#REF5">5</a>. Schwitters used <i>Merz</i> as a modifier connoting the common principle underlying the wide range of artistic practices in which he engaged: <i>Merz</i> poetry, <i>Merz</i> sculpture, <i>Merz</i> stage, <i>Merz</i> architecture. The term first appears as a word fragment in a collage from 1919 that is known today from photographic reproductions of the original, which counts as lost. Schwitters's use of the term grew increasingly infrequent in the 1930s, in part because it had been forged as part of his contentious engagement with Dada, which made it a relic of past battles. Because the relative eclipse of the term does not reflect a change in direction in Schwitters's discourse on art, I deploy it as a general concept for discussing Schwitters's practice of abstract montage. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT18" href="#REF18">18</a>. Over the years, Schwitters's literary output moves away from the radical linguistic experimentation tied to Expressionism and Dadaism and towards more conventional stylistic and rhetorical strategies. As Friedhelm Lach notes, the early prose texts, so distinctively shaped by montage inserts, puns, and sound games, give way to more conventional narratives tailored after the genres of the parable and the fairy tale (<i>LW</i> 2, 7–11). It is however significant that Schwitters never completely gave up collage poetry, as evidenced by the late poems he composed in England. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT20" href="#REF20">20</a>. This is a strategy Schwitters adopts very deliberately, as he makes clear in a polemical essay from 1920, "Berliner BörsenKukukunst," where he claims the right to recycle just any material for his <i>Merz</i> compositions, including the critic himself. In the text's final section he humorously juxtaposes his own abstract "use" of the critic Kurt Glaser, which qualifies as 'real' art, to a more conventional, mimetic portrayal of the critic. <i>LW</i> 5, 51. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT24" href="#REF24">24</a>. The text unfolds as a multivalent parody of a love poem, mocking but also embracing the Western lyric tradition that celebrates erotic experience as an ecstatic moment of subversive unboundedness while also domesticating it through sentimental discourse so as to render it morally palatable. Scheffer notes that materials from the poem return under different guises in more than forty texts (<i>Anfänge experimenteller Literatur,</i> 45). Indeed, Schwitters recycled Anna Blume as a conceptual image, a linguistic pun, an emblem of poetic practice, and an ideogram in visual compositions.

Drawing on the readings of Wittgenstein's later philosophy developed by Jacques Bouveresse and Stanley Cavell, Perloff highlights the social and cultural basis of the modes of communication connoted by the concept of the language game, what Wittgenstein elliptically alludes to as "forms of life." As Perloff notes in discussing an excerpt from a 1932 Cambridge lecture, "the language game [ . . . ] is neither a genre nor even a particular form of discourse; rather, it is a paradigm, a set of sentences, let us say, selected from the language we actually use so as to describe how communication of meaning works in specific circumstances" (<i>Wittgenstein's Ladder,</i> 60). For Wittgenstein's discussion of the ways meaning is engendered and traded through the varied modes of behavior he terms language games, see especially #23–#54 in the <i>Philosophical Investigations,</i> trans.

In this context, see Henry Staten's discussion of the status of the rules that govern the language games in <i>Wittgenstein and Derrida</i> (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1984). Staten analyzes the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> as a deconstructive inquiry into philosophical method that questions the assumption of presence and essentially given meaning presumably guaranteed by self–identical forms. This leads him to emphasize the utterly singular status of the rules that enable the language games. As he notes, rules in Wittgenstein's understanding of language do not function as an a-temporal, universally shared system of coordinates that is instantiated in particular cases. This is because Wittgenstein's understanding of rules does away with the assumption of a "self-identical form that marks their boundaries and makes their varying manifestations instances of the same. Wittgenstein's account runs counter to those views that see human activities as structured by 'implicit rules'; for him the actual instances of usage are our 'rules.' The instances of usage are spatiotemporal phenomena, and are to be 'applied' to the understanding of new cases, not as a rule conceived as logos or intelligible
