<p>
Surely no one could doubt that the discourse of atomic physics changed
utterly at 8:15 <small>A.M.</small> on Monday, 6 August 1945. Nuclear
fission had only been definitively accomplished seven years before, and
its use for a bomb, rather than for the positive energy source that some
theorists had imagined, was the result of the secret laboratory work of
a few physicists and government sponsors.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 The U.S. bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki represented not only
 a shift in global political power, but also a major change in what
 Tom Wilkie calls "the style of science"&#8212;from the "era of the
 great university laboratories" (such as Ernest Rutherford's Cavendish
 Laboratory at Cambridge) to the era of "big science," of Los Alamos.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 But perhaps the biggest transformation occurred in the way the public
 came to understand atomic physics. The popular vision of the discipline
 as arcane and theoretical&#8212;as characterized by X rays and obscure
 energy sources&#8212;was replaced by horrific images from Hiroshima:
 human bodies turned to ashes or shadows; people who were not even
 at the bomb site suffering from a mysterious, incurable illness; and
 people at ground zero who saw the flash but heard nothing while others
 miles away heard a deafening blast. In other words, one could no longer
 speak of atomic physics without also speaking of biology, of bodies.

<p>
One of the many people who groped for a vocabulary with which to
understand Hiroshima was Edith Sitwell, whose "Three Poems of the Atomic
Age" consisted of "Dirge for the New Sunrise," "The Shadow of Cain,"
and "The Canticle of the Rose."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 These poems were perhaps the strongest works of the last phase of her
 career, although the most sustained discussion of them

<b></b>

has primarily focused on their religious implications.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Certainly Sitwell would have approved of the perceptive religious
 readings of the nature of guilt in her poems, but the tight focus
 upon theology seems not to have permitted these scholars to consider
 the vast array of scientific concepts invoked in the poems <i>as
 science</i>. Rather, they are treated (if they are examined at all)
 as symbols for religious concepts.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 The wide range of scientific texts evoked in these poems should,
 however, be given as much weight as the religious themes. Indeed,
 revisiting Sitwell's later work provides an argument for her
 significance not simply as a poet characterized by her early radical
 sound and word experiments in <i>Fa&ccedil;ade,</i> her eccentric dress
 and self-presentation, and her endless skirmishes with The Movement
 over the legacy of modernism, but rather as a thinker who complicates
 our sense of the interaction between public and scientific cultures in
 the immediate post-World War II era. Sitwell's atomic bomb poems, and
 "The Shadow of Cain" most strikingly, muster an array of scientific
 texts from several centuries to trace the role of the organic in the
 now-dangerous atomic order. They argue for a reintegration of the
 organic with the inorganic, of biology, natural history, and ethics
 with physics. She strategically uses alchemy and other discredited
 sciences to critique the conceptual bifurcation of the organic and
 inorganic worlds that in modern atomic physics had led to such lethal
 consequences.

<p>
Sitwell recognized that the bomb almost instantaneously caused a shift
in the broader public perception of physics&#8212;one that entailed a
serious rethinking of the roles of biology and of <i>life</i> itself in
the seemingly cold and intellectually detached realm of

<b></b>

atomic physics. The blurring of the disciplinary boundary between modern
physics and biology had certainly occurred before. Evelyn Fox Keller
has chronicled the debate that the Second Law of Thermodynamics 
caused "concerning the place of living systems in the laws of physics."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 The search for increasingly efficient steam engine models, ones that
 could transform heat into mechanical energy without loss of energy, led
 to the Second Law, which very quickly entailed a number of different
 and vexing concerns for scientists and the general public during the
 Victorian and even the modernist period. One of the most prominent
 issues was what Hermann von Helmholtz called "thermal death." As
 Ernest Rutherford asserted half a century later, "Science offers no
 escape from the conclusion of Kelvin and Helmholtz that the sun must
 ultimately grow cold and this earth become a dead planet moving through
 the intense cold of empty space."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Fears of inevitable, frigid planetary death racked res from Charles
 Darwin (who lamented that millions of years of evolution would end in
 the natural cooling of the planet) to H. G. Wells and D. H. Lawrence.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
As this example demonstrates, scientific "breakthroughs" can precipitate
crises. Different scientific discourses&#8212;or science and other
discourses&#8212;seem incompatible, and micro- and macro-level
explanations do not appear to be reconcilable. I want to argue that
the atomic bomb precipitated such a moment. Physics, the life sciences,
and understandings of human agency in the natural world seemed to reel
from what Sitwell clearly perceived as the simultaneously moral and
scientific blow of nuclear fission.

<p>
Atomic physics had provoked the imagination in primarily positive ways
before the bomb. Countless people marveled at seeing through opaque
matter with X rays, and wondered about the possibilities of mysterious
energy rays. In the 1930s Sitwell herself had turned to atomic energy as
a positive metaphor for the power of modernism. Praising T. S. Eliot's
work, she asserts:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The older beauty, the beauty of the old masters, is the beauty of species
and mass&#8212;the new beauty is highly individualised and separate. The
modern artist is not concerned with things in the mass, he is passionately
interested in the fulfilling of the destinies of the single individuals
that make up the mass&#8212;whether these individuals are men, or leaves,
or waves of the sea. The great quality of the old masters is force, used
in the scientific term of the word&#8212;the binding together of the
molecules of the world. That is partly what makes their sense of design
so tremendous. The great quality of the modern masters is an explosive
energy, the separating up of the molecules, exploring the possibilities
of the atom.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is at once the quality and the danger of pioneer poetry. The aim
of the modernist poets&#8212;the constant aim&#8212;is to reconcile this
necessity of exploring the possibilities of the atom with the necessity
for logical design and form.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Portraying modernism in terms of individualism, antimass sentiments,
and iconoclasm was nothing new. These terms had been around since before
Sitwell had first appeared on the London scene during World War I. But
Sitwell moves into unusual territory as well, exploring individualism
and energy with atomic-age metaphor, combining modernist "pioneering"
with scientific exploration.

<b></b>

<p>
But when the bomb made the concentrated release of radioactivity into
a destructive reality, and not just an optimistic metaphor, Sitwell was
forced to turn the clock as far back from 1945 as the sixteenth century in
order to rethink the relationship between biology and atomic physics. The
life sciences and physics for the most part had gone their separate ways,
and nineteenth-century evolutionary models of life largely dissociated
themselves from&#8212;and displaced&#8212;religious dogma. After the
bomb, though, Sitwell rejected the twentieth-century atomic physics that
had contributed to its creation. She seems to have read Albert Einstein
and Cambridge astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington, but I find no evidence in
the poems or notebooks of her grappling with the studies of Rutherford,
Frederick Soddy, Enrico Fermi, or Niels Bohr, for instance.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 Rather, after exploring the natural history of the planet in works
 by nineteenth-century thinkers, such as Ernst Haeckel, Charles
 Lyell, and Lorenz Oken, she turned to much older texts, including
 the seventeenth-century natural history treatise of Thomas Burnet
 and, most markedly, the sixteenth-century alchemical writings of
 Paracelsus. These thinkers united physics, the life sciences, and
 religion into seamless systems.

<p>
It is no coincidence that Sitwell would turn to alchemical
writings. Alchemy had often been invoked in the early years of atomic
physics: Rutherford's 1899 experiments showed that decaying radioactive
elements could induce radioactivity in other substances, and with Soddy
he discovered that thorium was transmuting itself into helium.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 As Linda Henderson notes:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Although Rutherford cautiously used the terms "transformation" and
"sub-atomic chemical changes" in his publications, he would later title
his [1937] book on radioactivity <i>The Newer Alchemy.</i> By contrast,
Soddy, a chemist with a prior interest in alchemy, immediately cultivated
the association of radioactivity with alchemy in his lectures, his
articles and, ultimately, his 1909 book, <i>The Interpretation of
Radium.</i> Soddy even suggested in print that radium might be the
alchemist's long-sought "Philosopher's Stone," capable of transmuting
metals and serving as well as the "elixir of life." [<i>DC,</i> 23]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Modern popularizers of alchemy likewise saw the discovery of
radioactive decay as evidence confirming their beliefs (<i>DC,</i>
24-5). Yet the atomic paths pursued by Rutherford and his successors
led not to productive and life-giving transmutation, but rather to
the most powerful weapon ever used. Just as alchemy had been used as a
positive conceptualization of atomic science before the bomb, so Sitwell
strategically redeployed one of the most famous of all alchemists to
reconre the orientation and responsibilities of nuclear physics.

<p>
In the nuclear age, her atomic bomb poems suggest, gold represents the
human greed that causes wars (the biblical res in the poems, Dives
and Cain, symbolize this drive for material gain); the Sun symbolizes
the extreme heat of the bomb blast; and alchemy evokes the horrific
transformations of elements and bodies by atomic physics and the hidden
secret essences of elements that the "newer alchemy" had discovered
could damage or transform the hidden, genetic essences of life through
radiation sickness, cancer, and birth defects.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 However, Sitwell reevaluates and transres each of these terms by
 returning to early modern science. For Burnet, the

<b></b>

conflagration of the earth is only a natural step toward salvation. For
Paracelsus, alchemy was a healing art: gold is the quintessence of
the sun, and is linked to the cure for leprosy, a disease that rots
the ailing body just as radiation burns the flesh. Thus, for Sitwell,
Hiroshima and Nagasaki come to represent a kind of self-inflicted leprosy.

<p>
Sitwell's unpublished notebooks show her writing and rewriting the atomic
bomb poems&#8212;sometimes dozens of times&#8212;as well as dictating
reading lists to herself and making notes on the texts that ultimately
were incorporated into these poems. Her notebooks and the poems' final
published versions suggest that she conceived not of a physics that
exempts life from its calculations (as Kelvin reluctantly posited),
but rather of one that restores life to a central place.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 The return to early modern science was not a na&iuml;ve reactionary
 diatribe against contemporary science, but rather an imaginative call
 for modern physics (and the society that employs it) to rethink the
 segregation of the sciences from each other and to focus on the larger
 picture in an essentially ethical way.

<p>
To illustrate this call for scientific reintegration, I will focus on
"The Shadow of Cain," which contains the fullest elaboration of Sitwell's
scientific synthesis. The poem's introductory stanzas initiate the wide
range of scientific perspectives and natural phenomena that she wished
to combine. The poem is set in a biting cold that would seem to be the
obverse of the destructive heat of the atomic blasts in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki: "Under great yellow flags and banners of the ancient Cold /
Began the huge migrations / From some primeval disaster in the heart
of Man."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Just as earlier intellectuals had worried about the heat death of the
 planet, Sitwell begins the poem with a strident but chronologically
 nebulous evocation of extreme cold and its consequences. Her approach
 recalls the Christian concept of the Fall, but also employs words
 that connote the scientific discourses to follow. "Huge migrations"
 and "primeval" seem more related to the discourse of natural history
 and evolution than to Genesis, and "ancient Cold," while seeming
 to reverse the temporal direction of the heat death of the planet,
 introduces a concept that will immediately be taken up again in several
 scientific paradigms.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
Major nineteenth-century texts on natural history and evolutionary
biology inspire the poem's vision of the interconnectedness of organic and
inorganic processes in the history of the planet. In the second stanza,
the coldness is linked to terms directly out of natural history texts:
"There were great oscillations / Of temperature. . . . You knew there
had once been warmth" (<i>CP,</i> 366). These lines (and many of the
following stanzas) allude to Charles Lyell's magnum opus, <i>Principles
of Geology.</i> Lyell used the systematic study of fossil and geological
evidence to conclude that plant and animal species had come into being and
become extinct throughout millions of years of geographical and climatic
change before any human had walked the earth. His conclusion predated
Darwin's evolutionary writings and helped to cause the crisis of faith
that famously inspired Tennyson's bleakest moments in <i>In Memoriam</i>.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 Yet, responding some hundred years later to the same passages from Lyell
 that Tennyson read, Sitwell does not seem uncomfortable with the fact
 of evolution. She was reading Darwin while working on drafts of "The
 Shadow," but beyond a single reference to Darwin in a passage seemingly
 taken from Thomas Huxley's <i>Lectures on Evolution</i> , Darwin
 does not seem to have significantly influenced these poems.

<b></b>

<p>
In her notes for the essay, "The Making of a Poem II: The Shadow of Cain,"
Sitwell writes, "In Sir Charles Lyell's 'Geology,' there is a description
of the finding of a mammoth's tooth with a pine-leaf, symbol that there
had once been warmth, hid in the crevice. He speaks too of the variation
in temperature in that early stage of the earth's history."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 In the sixth and seventh stanzas of the published poem, Sitwell provides
 imagistic specificity to the concept:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And now, in memory of great oscillations
<br />
Of temperature in that epoch of the Cold,
<br />
We found a continent of turquoise, vast as Asia
<br />
In the yellowing airs of the Cold: the tooth of a mammoth;
<br />
And there, in a gulf, a dark pine-sword
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
To show there had once been warmth and the gulf stream in our veins
<br />
Where only the Chaos of the Antarctic Pole
<br />
Or the peace of its atonic coldness reigns. [<i>CP,</i> 366-7]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In volume one of <i>Principles of Geology</i>, Lyell explores the fossil
evidence of the mammoth to demonstrate gradual climate shifts on the
planet and their effect on different species. He rules out the mammoth
as a migratory species, refuting the theory that they went extinct as the
climate first became colder, and concludes that "The increasing cold, and
greater frequency of inclement winters, would at last thin [the mammoths],
and their final extirpation would be consummated by the rapid augmentation
of other herbivorous quadrupeds more fitted for the new climate."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 Though the description may seem callous, for Lyell&#8212;and indeed
 for Sitwell&#8212;the fossils merely write a chapter in the history
 of natural climate change and species adaptability.

<p>
Sitwell does not explicitly cite Lyell in her published notes to the poem,
but his presence is felt in the poem's multiple allusions to "primal" and
"primeval" "disasters" of climate and glaciation (stanza ten), and its
many allusions to now extinct species, such as the mammoth (stanza six),
megatherium mylodon (stanza nine), mastodon (stanzas nine and twenty-one),
and pterodactyl (stanza eleven). But in revising the general statement
"there had once been warmth" to "there had once been warmth and the gulf
stream in our veins," Sitwell not only emphasizes human morality (not a
feature of Lyell's writing), but also makes humanity part of the larger
natural history of the planet rather than a separate, superior history.

<p>
To provide a vision of human beings and their ancestors as part of a
natural organic and inorganic world, Sitwell turned from Lyell to another
evolutionist, Ernst Haeckel. He is present (if unacknowledged) throughout
the early passages of "Shadow." Sitwell copied multiple passages from his
<i>The Riddle of the Universe at the Close of the Nineteenth Century</i>
(or <i>Die Weltr&auml;thsel</i> [1900]) into her notes, and grappled
with his discussion of <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> in a number of
revisions of "Shadow."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Haeckel, who taught at Jena, was a nineteenth-century zoologist
 who fought against religious dogma for the validity of evolutionary
 theory. Like Sitwell, he desired a greater integration of the sciences
 into philosophy. "Unfortunately," he argued, "this vast progress

<b></b>

of empirical knowledge in our 'Century of Science' has not been
accompanied by a corresponding advancement of its theoretical
interpretation&#8212;that higher knowledge of the causal nexus of
individual phenomena which we call philosophy" (<i>RU,</i> v). Calling
for a "philosophy of nature" that would go beyond pure empirical research,
but that would use research to ground what he saw as the merely abstract
philosophical musings of the metaphysicians, Haeckel developed a theory of
"Monistic Philosophy" that reconciled these seemingly disparate projects.

<p>
Haeckel clearly saw himself as exploring the consequences of Darwin's
theories of evolution and natural selection. In a chapter on "The History
of Our Species," he writes a brief history of evolutionary thought,
praising Lyell, Lamarck, and Darwin for breaking theological fetters.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 He lauds his own work, <i>General Morphology of Organisms</i> 
 and his popularizing <i>Natural History of Creation</i> , for
 addressing "one of the most pressing of the many important tasks
 which Darwin proposed to modern biology . . . the reform of the
 zoological and botanical <i>system</i>" (<i>RU,</i> 80). In these
 earlier books, he argued that the "history of the embryo (ontogeny)
 must be completed by a second, equally valuable, and closely connected
 branch of thought&#8212;the history of the race (phylogeny)" (ibid.). He
 affirms the "theory of the descent of man from the ape" from Lamarck,
 Darwin, and others, and uses paleontology, ontogeny, and morphology to
 sketch an ancestral tree for humans as far back as "Silurian fishes"
 (<i>RU,</i> 83-4).

<p>
Haeckel's emphasis on phylogeny and biological systems influenced
Sitwell's notes and drafts of "Shadow," and she worked materials from
his chapter on "The History of Our Species" directly into the poem. In
notebook 61, Sitwell took notes on Haeckel's evolutionary sequence:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Pithecanthropus erectus. P.71 Haeckel. The Mesozoic mammals. The Triassic
period, the marsupials in the Jurassic. Eocene (period?) Miocene.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the Pliocene period arises the Ape-Man without speech (the
pithecanthropus alalus). Meso[crosses out "zoic" and writes "lithic"]
Stone Age between paleolithic and neolithic. Mesophyll: Danei [?] of
leaf; mesozoic: [?] [?] geological period / Paleontology: study of
extinct organized beings. [<i>N,</i> 61]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Sitwell copied directly from the end of the chapter a passage on
<i>Pithecanthropus erectus,</i> which Haeckel saw as important because it
"served to elucidate the origin of the placentals related to our own stem,
the legion of primates" (<i>RU,</i> 86). Sitwell wrote:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The most famous and most interesting of these discoveries is the fossil
ape-man of Java, the much-talked-of <i>pithecanthropus erectus,</i>
found by a Dutch military doctor, Eugen Dubois, in 1894. It is in truth
the much-sought "missing link," supposed to be wanting in the chain of
primates, which stretches unbroken from the lowest catarrhin&aelig;, to
the highest-developed man. I have dealt exhaustively with the significance
of this discovery in the paper which I read on August 26th, 1898, at
the Fourth International Zoological Congress at Cambridge.[. . .] The
pal&aelig;ontologist, who knows the conditions of the formation and
preservation of fossils, will think the discovery of this pithecanthropus
an unusually lucky accident. The apes, being arboreal, seldom came into
the circumstances (unless

<b></b>

they happened to fall into the water) which would secure the preservation
and petrifaction of their skeleton. Thus, by the discovery of this
fossil man-monkey of Java the descent of man from the ape has become
just as clear and certain from the pal&aelig;ontological side as it was
previously from the evidence of comparative anatomy and ontogeny. We
now have all the principal documents which tell the history of our
race. [<i>N,</i> 61]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Haeckel's certitude regarding his ability to "tell the history of our
race" seems to have inspired the scientific confidence that Sitwell
needed to ground her religious poem firmly in a dynamic and developing
natural world.

<p>
Early drafts of stanzas eight, nine, and ten of "Shadow" more explicitly
allude to the passage she copied from <i>Riddle</i> and provide a more
detailed sense of Sitwell's debt to Haeckel than the published poem
does. There are three notebooks (61, 64, and 310) that contain drafts
of passages inspired by Haeckel. Notebook 310, probably the earliest
of the three, situates his phylogeny in the larger context of inorganic
processes:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the era of the Eocene
<br />
Tertiary formations, when the Pampean
<br />
mud was formed, where the Megatherium Mylodon
<br />
lies buried
<br />

<br />
After the slow upheaval and subsidence of a race
<br />
During the Pliocene Period, arose the Ape-Man
<br />
That has no speech, Pithecanthropus Erectus . . .

<p>
We would have liked to have stretched a hand out to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each other, but had forgotten

<p>
The nature of Death sank
<br />
Sank into the saps of the world in our great spring.

<p>
I feel sometimes as if my tongue had been melted by the dust of Death

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These deformities
<br />
Arisen from cosmic causes . . . from the influence
<br />
of the external inorganic world from oscillations
<br />
of [?], the violence fallen from vermillion
<br />
Processions of suns [<i>N,</i> 310]
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Most of these stanzas were not published, but were early drafts of what
finally was published as stanzas nine and ten. From Lyell-inspired
thought about the procession of eras and formation of sediment and
fossil remains of extinct creatures (the megatherium), Sitwell turns to
Haeckel to invoke human ancestors that were like us but could not speak,
only to compare them to the current breakdown in communication after the
bomb. Communication and human compassion, the stretching out of hands,
has been forgotten in the face of death. But Sitwell then res death
as part of a process that also involves the renewal of life through sap
and spring. Death and

<b></b>

inorganic processes (such as the climatic changes Lyell
describes)&#8212;the "influence of the external inorganic world"&#8212;are
brought into a picture of cosmic proportions. They are, perhaps, a kind
of consolation in this early draft, precisely because they were not
caused by humans. The manipulation of the inorganic world by nuclear
fission creates a violent "procession of suns" that has no meaning in
the larger geological and biological history.

<p>
The version in notebook 61 encompasses what became stanza nine in the
published poem (and correctly names <i>Pithecanthropus alalus</i>),
but also includes a passage that eventually was transformed into stanza
six of the published version, firmly tying Lyell's geological vision to
Haeckel's phylogeny.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Finally, the version in notebook 64 (which is too long to quote in
 full), brings together several versions of stanza six (the turquoise,
 pine-sword, glaciation/oscillation stanza), with versions of stanza ten
 and other stanzas containing allusions to <i>Pithecanthropus alalus.</i>
 It also bring together elements of stanzas ten and eleven of the
 published version, introducing the "iron-wing" allusion to the airplane
 that dropped the bomb with the eventually omitted <i>Pithecanthropus
 erectus</i> passage:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->

And the sound of the ancestral voices

[<i>N</i>, 64]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Sitwell seemed to have had in mind a kind of natural history lesson
for the poem. The development of human beings from not only prehuman
primates, but even preprimate animals, the extinction and change of
species as a constant rule of nature, the effect of the inorganic on
those processes, the development of speech in the ancient past with
<i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>: all of these echoes of nineteenth-century
evolutionary biology and paleontology seem aimed at creating a sense
of our embeddedness in the larger organic and even inorganic schemes of
the planet.

<p>
In the poem's published version little remains of Sitwell's detailed
notes on Haeckel, or of her early drafts. But the will to read

signifies Haeckel's presence. The shift from <i>Pithecanthropus alalus</i>
to <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> in Haeckel is consigned to a past in
which "There was still some method of communication / Between Man and his
brother Man," and the challenge for humanity now is not to subside into
silence and cold (ibid.). But the sense of migration, quest, and even
paleontological and geological expedition that Sitwell had, in part,
borrowed from Lyell changes here as she moves mankind into a prehistory
charted by Haeckel.

<p>
Haeckel, though, had more to offer than the consolations of paleontology
(one draft in notebook 64 had lamented: "And we were left with our
Paleontology&#8212; / Our cold study of that most ancient race, the race
of the Dead"). Some elements of his work could be tied into another aspect
of the poem: physics. Sitwell wanted a greater sense of interconnected
system than Lyell, Darwin, or even Haeckel's zoology could provide, so she
also turned to aspects of Haeckel's work that asked larger questions about
the realm of physics. In the draft of another omitted stanza, she writes:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
It was the time of Love.
<br />
The meeting of atoms . . . Love, in the summer grass . . .
<br />
In the halls of tenements
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
It was the time of love . . .
<br />
The accidental collision of motes in the light of the sun [<i>N,</i> 64]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
It is unclear where Sitwell was headed with these lines, but they seem
to raise two possibilities: that love, one of the most revered human
emotions, is simply a "meeting of atoms," an "accidental collision of
motes in the light of the sun," or that the fortuitous concourse of
atoms in fact has a principle behind it that might be described in terms
of love.

<p>
These lines may have been inspired by Sitwell's readings of Haeckel's
attempt to link the animate and inanimate. She frequently wrote a
list of page numbers in the front or back of a book for passages she
found especially interesting. Apart from the <i>Pithecanthropus</i>
discussion, the passages that she marked in Haeckel all tend to involve
his attempts to bridge seemingly separate, irreconcilable worlds. In
one passage he unites the plant and animal kingdoms, and then goes
even further&#8212;returning to Spinoza to help propound his own
monism. Haeckel writes:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Every single object in the world which comes within the sphere of our
cognizance, all individual forms of existence, are but special transitory
forms&#8212;<i>accidents</i> or <i>modes</i> of

<b></b>

substance. These modes are material things when we regard them under the
attribute of <i>extension</i> (or "occupation of space"), but forces or
ideas when we consider them under the attribute of <i>thought</i> (or
"energy"). To this profound thought of Spinoza our purified monism returns
after a lapse of two hundred years; for us, too, matter (space-filling
substance) and energy (moving force) are but two inseparable attributes
of the one underlying substance.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
By Einstein's era, matter and energy had indeed come to be seen as
something like "two inseparable attributes of the one underlying
substance." Sitwell felt that the cold abstraction of mass/energy
conversion had somehow contributed to the nuclear holocaust, though,
and Haeckel had something much more sweeping in mind&#8212;"energy"
could also include "thought" or human sentience.

<p>
In another passage that Sitwell marked in her edition, Haeckel speaks
of atoms and molecules, fundamental building blocks, in terms of a
principle of attraction that sounds very much like the stanza on love
that she omitted from her poem:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Goethe, in his classical romance, <i>Affinities</i>, compared the
relations of pairs of lovers with the phenomenon of the same name
in the formation of chemical combinations. The irresistible passion
that draws Edward to the sympathetic Ottilia, or Paris to Helen, and
leaps over all bounds of reason and morality, is the same powerful
"unconscious" attractive force which impels the living spermatozoon to
force an entrance into the ovum in the fertilisation of the egg of the
animal or plant&#8212;the same impetuous movement which unites two atoms
of hydrogen to one atom of oxygen for the formation of a molecule of
water. This fundamental <i>unity of affinity in the whole of nature,</i>
from the simplest chemical process to the most complicated love story,
was recognised by the great Greek scientist Empedocles, in the fifth
century <small>B.C.</small>, in his theory of "the love and hatred of
the elements." It receives empirical confirmation from the interesting
progress of cellular psychology, the great significance of which we have
only learned to appreciate in the last thirty years. On those phenomena we
base our conviction that even the <i>atom</i> is not without a rudimentary
form of sensation and will, or, as it is better expressed, of feeling
(<i>&aelig;sthesis</i>) and inclination (<i>tropesis</i>)&#8212;that is,
a universal "soul" of the simplest character. The same must be said of the
molecules which are composed of two or more atoms. Further combinations of
different kinds of these molecules give rise to simple and, subsequently,
complex chemical compounds, in the activity of which the same phenomena
are repeated in a more complicated form.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Haeckel has departed from cold paleontology and hard science to
express a version of physics that had few adherents in the twentieth
century, one in which volition, love, soul, and desire still had a place.

<p>
Sitwell found, and extensively marked, one other source from
nineteenth-century science that would attempt the kind of synthesis of
the sciences and the mind that Haeckel advocated. Lorenz Oken, though
now obscure, was seen (along with Joseph Schelling and Henrich Steffens)
as one of the major <i>Naturphilosophen.</i>
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<i>Naturphilosophie,</i> a movement in the sciences during the first
third of the nineteenth century, was a loose combination of Kantian
dynamism (which Kenneth Caneva describes as "the notion that matter is
defined in terms of opposing attractive and repulsive

<b></b>

forces") and philosophical Romanticism, whose primary goal was to
challenge mechanistic explanations of nature, particularly Newtonian
physics.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 Haeckel's appropriation of Goethe's notion of affinity in the natural
 world seems to follow this line of science. In a way that would
 clearly be attractive to Sitwell in her appraisal of atomic physics,
 Romantic science (as Mullen calls it) tended to substitute biology
 for physics as the major discipline. Moreover, as Mullen explains,
 the <i>Naturphilosophen</i> held "that there is an identity of nature
 and spirit, and that there is an underlying unity of organic and
 inorganic nature" ("RS," 382). Oken sought to theorize such a unity,
 and his works were of major importance to nineteenth-century attacks
 on mechanistic science.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 He attracted not only Goethe's (briefly admiring) attention, but also
 that of Coleridge, who extensively annotated his copies of <i>First
 Ideas</i> and the <i>Compendium,</i> the same work to which Sitwell
 would turn in 1946 as a philosophical anchor for her atomic bomb poems.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
Sitwell's copy of Oken's <i>Compendium</i> was translated in English
as <i>Elements of Physiophilosophy</i> . As Mullen puts it,
<i>Elements</i> "stands as the best known of all nature philosophy books"
("RS," 388). Its first part, "Mathesis," propounded a cosmological
principle of generation through primal tensions initially between zero,
or nonbeing, and its opposite, being. Its second part, "Ontology,"
examined inorganic nature, viewing the creation of the world as a process
of crystallization resulting from activity in the aether. Finally, the
last section, "Biology" (a word Oken coined), posited living nature as a
process of constant transformation and attempts to approximate archetypes.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
Sitwell marked pages and passages throughout her copy of <i>Elements of
Physiophilosophy</i> and seems to have read most of its 665 pages.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 It was a major influence on "Shadow" and "The Canticle of the
 Rose." Oken saw mathematics as a place from which to begin making
 a theory for the most simple of relations, that between being and
 nonbeing.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 In notebook 64, Sitwell transcribed passages from the beginning
 of "Mathesis," in particular from its first section, which was
 provocatively entitled "Nothing." She notes, drawing from Oken's
 proposition 34, "(Mathematics Oken is a something in relation to
 0. The first act towards realization or the becoming something, is an
 origination of Many. All reality can, therefore, manifest itself only
 in multiplicity" (<i>N,</i> 64). And she then copies out the following
 lines from Oken's proposition 37: "What zero is in infinite intensity,
 that are numbers in an endless extensity. Zero is of two forms: under
 the ideal it is mere intensity; under the real mere extensity, or a
 series of numbers. The latter is only expanded intensity, the former,
 extensity concentrated on the point" (ibid.).

<p>
Oken began the "Nothing" section with a line that Sitwell directly echoes
in "Shadow": "The highest mathematical idea, or the fundamental principle
of all mathematics is the zero=0. The whole science of mathematics depends
upon zero. Zero alone determines the value in mathematics. Zero is in
itself nothing. Mathematics is based upon nothing, and, consequently,
arises out of nothing" (<i>EP,</i> 5). The primal tensions between
nonbeing and being are generative. Sitwell works these ideas directly
into stanzas three, four, and five of "Shadow":

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
But the Cold is the highest mathematical Idea . . . the Cold
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is Zero&#8212;

<p>
The Nothing from which arose
<br />
All Being and all variation. . . . It is the sound too high for our
hearing, the Point that flows
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Till it becomes the line of Time . . . an endless positing
<br />
Of Nothing, or the Ideal that tries to burgeon
<br />
Into Reality through multiplying. . . . Then Time froze
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
To immobility and changed to Space. [<i>CP,</i> 366]

<p>
She grafts the idea of the absence of heat&#8212;the cold that she
had already invoked in geological and paleontological terms that
recall anxieties about thermal death&#8212;onto Oken's key concept of
zero. Space (extension), time (sequence of numbers), motion (oscillation),
and causality&#8212;all are effects of the simple positive generation
from zero.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 Sitwell's early drafts of what eventually became "But the Cold is the
 highest mathematical Idea . . . the cold is Zero&#8212;" played with
 various permutations of Oken's theorizing:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
The cold is Infinity; a repetition of the Ideal . . . an incessant
positing of the Idea . . .
<br />
The cold is the highest mathematical Idea, Zero
<br />
The cold is infinity . . . an incessant positing of the ideal, the
becoming something . . .
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
What Zero is in infinite intensity
<br />
Numbers are in endless extensity. [<i>N,</i> 64]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Sitwell continues Oken's logic, making a kind of positive virtue out of
the absolute cold and extreme heat of atomic physics. Nothing creates
"All Being and all variation," which creates a sequence, "the line of
Time . . . an endless positing / of Nothing."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
Oken's mathematical physics quickly move beyond the kind of cosmological
questions with which Sitwell begins her poem, into labyrinthine
explications of physics, geology, and biology. Sitwell noted passages
on metals, crystallization, minerals, and jewels, as well as the optics
of the eye, but she also marked many passages about the plant and animal
kingdoms. Many of these contain rich statements that convey the kind of
interconnectedness that she wished to reassert between the sciences. Oken
clearly saw the animal world as more complex than that of the plant.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 However, many of the passages that Sitwell marked are preoccupied with
 theories of plant life as simple yet rich systems:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1164. Root and stem are the water- and earth-plant, the leaf is the
air-plant, the flower is the light- or rather fire-plant.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1165. In the flower the problem has been solved, of producing an entire
plant simply by the light without earth, water, and air, or as it were
in a merely spiritual manner.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1166. The plant is a flower that has been posited under three ideas,
under the idea of earth, water, and air. As in aether or fire all the
elements are dissolved; so are all the

<b></b>

elements of the plant in the flower.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1167. The flower is truly, not merely in idea, the whole plant with all
systems and formations, posited under a <i>single</i> idea, under that
of the aether, namely, of the gravity, light and heat, or the fire.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1168. The flower as the aether-organ of the plant is not so independent
as an animal, but subordinated to the planetary systems, being only a
separation of the parts of the trunk, not a new formation, as in the
animal kingdom. [<i>EP,</i> 229-30]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
From these passages arose some of the language and some parts of the
conceptual scheme of "The Canticle of the Rose," the third of Sitwell's
atomic bomb poems. Stanzas two and three have the "Rose upon the wall"
crying:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
I rise upon my stem&#8212;
<br />
The Flower, the whole Plant-being, produced by Light
<br />
With all Plant-systems and formations. . . . As in Fire
<br />
All elements dissolve, so in one bright
<br />
Ineffable essence all Plant-being dissolves to make the Flower.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
My stem rises bright&#8212;
<br />
Organic water polarized to the dark
<br />
Earth-center, and to Light. [<i>CP,</i> 373]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Oken had frequently discussed even animals as moveable stems and blossoms,
defining animals as "self-moveable or automatic blossoms," and noting
that "A blossom, which, when separated from the stem, maintains by its
own motion the galvanic process or the life within itself, and gets its
process of polarization, not from a body lying external to or coherent
with it (as is the vegetable stem); but only from itself&#8212;such
blossom is an <i>Animal.</i>"
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 In "Canticle," Sitwell reworks a traditional symbol for Jesus&#8212;the
 rose upon the cross&#8212;into a vision of the divine as embodied in
 the nexus of the organic and inorganic <i>systems,</i> suggesting that
 the chemistry of elements, the physics of light, and the organic life
 of the plant are inextricably intertwined.

<p>
Sitwell's poems of this period often explore the simple systems of sun,
plant, and soil, yet revel in the development of more complicated animal
systems (especially the human) that share an essential unity with those
other realms. Oken's thinking gave a richly phrased and evocative account
of these relationships. Even words, humans' greatest accomplishment,
are organic systems according to Oken. In a passage Sitwell marked,
he wrote, "Words, which are connected together according to organic
laws, form an organic system, are at once alive, and have a meaning"
(<i>EP,</i> 473). Sitwell marked the following passages as well:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1783. In so far as the animal vesicle is a whole solar system, to it,
the characters that transcend the plant, such as motion, belong.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1784. But motion is not that alone which is displayed in the floral
cyst when it has become solar; but with it there is yet something higher
bestowed.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1785. Like light or sun the vesicle has the principle of its polarization
or determination in

<b></b>

itself; and it is certainly itself which moves its organs in conformity
with this self-determination; but it is withal in antagonism towards the
elements, like the sun is towards the planets. Through this antagonism
the sun is destined unto the development of light. Although the light
is its own product, still it perceives the object toward which the
aether-polarity is directed. This perception of the direction, whither
motion should act by means of the central polarity, is in the animal
called <i>Sensation.</i>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1786. Sensation is the relation of the Central to the Peripheric, of
the sun to the planet; motion is the relation of the periphery to the
centre, of the planet to the sun. The Animal emerges into being from
the alternating play of the supremest antagonism in the heavenly bodies,
the Vegetable form that of the terrestrial antagonisms.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1787. Emission of light is discharging or unloading of the sun achieved
by the influence of the planets; sensation is unloading of the animal
by objects, by the world, and by its own organs.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1788. Sensation is therefore a positing of <i>want</i> in the
animal. Through sensation nothing comes into, but rather something passes
out of us.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1789. The animal vesicle is a sentient or feeling blossom. [<i>EP</i>,
324-5]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Next to proposition 1785, Sitwell wrote in the margin, "Its
self-determination was destined to develop." Passages like these
fascinated her with their bold assertion of the unity of physics, the
inorganic, the organic, and even the sentient: animals as solar systems,
sensation as motion, radiation of light as a discharging of the sun like
the sensations in animals.

<p>
As in "The Canticle of the Rose," "Shadow" holds up the unity of the
organic and inorganic in the face of atomic holocaust. And as the natural
history lesson of the first few pages of "Shadow" begins to wind down,
the general "we" of the poem discovers not only Cain, Dives, and Christ,
but also a connection between the splendors of inorganic earth and its
living systems:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
There were great emerald thunders in the air
<br />
In the violent Spring, the thunders of the sap and the blood in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the heart&#8212;
<br />
The Spiritual Light, the physical Revelation. [<i>CP,</i> 368]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In the context of Oken's book, "the Spiritual Light, the physical
Revelation" suggests a broader Romantic science of physics, biology,
and spirit, and not simply an orthodox "divine revelation," as the
religious readings of the poem have suggested. And at this point the
poem turns back even further in time: it looks to early modern science
to explore the connectedness of spirit and humanity to a unified natural
world. Sitwell turns to the seventeenth-century thinker, Bishop Burnet,
and finally, but most prevalently, to the sixteenth-century alchemist,
Paracelsus, in order to explore these connections.

<p>
Lyell, Haeckel, and Oken had given Sitwell imaginative ways of gaining a
longer perspective on life on earth, and Haeckel and Oken, in particular,
had emphasized a unity in that vision that helped redress the imbalance
that the physics of Soddy, Rutherford, Oppenheim, Bohr, and others seemed
to have created. But her sources in the first part of the poem had not
offered her a theory of catastrophe on the planet that

<b></b>

could set such an event in both scientific and religious contexts. Haeckel
(who was virulently anti-Roman Catholic), Oken, and Lyell might have
had personal beliefs, but they disavowed religious dogma as scientific
explanation. Lyell, in fact, explicitly rejected notions of catastrophic
change. Yet certainly the atomic bombs required an image of change wrought
upon nature by an extreme, traumatic event. Not only did human bodies
continue to die from radiation effects for years after the blast, becoming
sterile and cancerous, but the impact upon the nonhuman&#8212;organic
and inorganic alike&#8212;was also remarkable. In a passage that might
even have suggested part of the poem's title, "Shadow," Hersey writes:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The scientists noticed that the flash of the bomb had discolored concrete
to a light reddish tint, had scaled off the surface of granite, and had
scorched certain other types of building material, and that consequently
the bomb had, in some places, left prints of the shadows that had been
cast by its light. . . . (A few vague human silhouettes were found, and
these gave rise to stories that eventually included fancy and precise
details . . .) [<i>H,</i> 95-6]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Shadows burned onto stone as horrific inorganic reminders of the recent
presence of the organic&#8212;tokens of human life rendered permanent
in the inorganic&#8212;was only one of the strange consequences of the
bomb. In "The Canticle of the Rose," Sitwell asks of a victim, "Where
is she now? / Dissolved and gone&#8212; / And only her red shadow stains
the unremembering stone" (<i>CP,</i> 374). Hersey notes that scientists
estimated the heat at ground zero to have been over six-thousand degrees
centigrade, and noted phenomena like melted tiles, instantly carbonized
telephone poles, fission fragments on buildings, and mica that had been
fused onto granite gravestones (<i>H,</i> 107).

<p>
After the natural history stanzas, Sitwell turned to more explicit
evocations of the cataclysmic destruction of the bomb:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
The Sun descending and the Earth ascending
<br />
To take its place above . . . the Primal Matter
<br />
Was broken, the womb from which all life began,
<br />
Then to the murdered Sun a totem pole of dust arose in memory of
Man. [<i>CP,</i> 369]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In her drafts for her essay on the making of "Shadow," she writes:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
On the 10th of September 1945, my brother Osbert and I were in the train
on the way to Brighton where we were to give a reading. He leant across to
me and handed me The Times [sic], pointing to a paragraph in it . . . a
description by an eye witness of the horror at Hiroshima . . . That
witness had seen a totem pole of dust arise to the sun . . . . . . . a
totem pole . . . the symbol of life, the symbol of procreation . . .
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
From that moment, night and day, the poem began. But it was not written
until April of the following year. [<i>N,</i> 307]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Sitwell cites the article in her notes to the poem: "Transcript
of an actual report by an eye-witness of the bomb falling on
Hiroshima.&#8212;<i>The Times,</i> September 10, 1945" (<i>CP,</i> 427).

<b></b>

One might read the evocation of "a totem pole of dust" as horribly
ironic&#8212;a symbol of life and procreation, caused by the mushroom
cloud of the bomb, to be followed by sterility and miscarriage. But the
strange effects of the catastrophe, and the need to find a vision of
hope, turned Sitwell's thoughts in less ironic directions. Hersey had
written that, only a few weeks after the explosion,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Over everything&#8212;up through the wreckage of the city, in gutters,
along the riverbanks, tangled among tiles and tin roofing, climbing
on charred tree trunks&#8212;was a blanket of fresh, vivid, lush,
optimistic green; the verdancy rose even from the foundations of ruined
houses. Weeds already hid the ashes, and wild flowers were in bloom
among the city's bones. The bomb had not only left the underground
organs of plants intact; it had stimulated them. Everywhere were bluets
and Spanish bayonets, goosefoot, morning glories and day lilies, the
hairy-fruited bean, purslane and clotbur and sesame and panic grass and
feverfew. Especially in a circle at the center, sickle senna grew in
extraordinary regeneration, not only standing among the charred remnants
of the same plant but pushing up in new places, among bricks and through
cracks in the asphalt. It actually seemed as if a load of sickle-senna
seed had been dropped along with the bomb. [<i>H,</i> 91]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
One might recall Oken's tripartite understanding of plant life
that Sitwell had carefully noted: "Root and stem are the water- and
earth-plant, the leaf is the air-plant, the flower is the light- or
rather fire-plant" in relationship to Hersey's explanation of the sudden
profusion of plant life (<i>EP,</i> 229). If the false sun of the bomb
had murdered the natural sun and destroyed everything above the surface,
it had only destroyed part of the plant life, and nature is resilient.

<p>
Press accounts of the phenomena related to the nuclear explosion
suggested a catastrophe with biblical resonances. Hersey's portrayal of
the aftermath of the bomb included vortexes of fire, whirlwinds, thunder,
and even mysterious rains:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Houses nearby were burning, and when huge drops of water the size of
marbles began to fall, he half thought that they must be coming from
the hoses of firemen ting the blazes. (They were actually drops
of condensed moisture falling from the turbulent tower of dust, heat,
and fission fragments that had already risen miles into the sky above
Hiroshima). [<i>H,</i> 25]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In stanzas twenty-one through twenty-four, Sitwell provides an account
of the cataclysm which owes much to Thomas Burnet, the private chaplain
of King William III.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 Between 1680 and 1691, Burnet published (originally in Latin and then
 in English translation) the four books of <i>Telluris Theoria Sacra,
 or The Sacred Theory of the Earth.</i> The first book explores the
 deluge, the second the paradise that preceded it, the third the future
 conflagration of the world, and the fourth the paradise to come.

<p>
Though many scientists (including Lyell), made Burnet out to be a medieval
fundamentalist, he was a cutting edge scientist of his day.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 He argued in his preface that



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
'Tis a dangerous thing to engage the authority of Scripture in disputes
against the Natural World in opposition to Reason; lest Time, which
brings all things to light, should discover

<b></b>

that to be evidently false which we had made Scripture to
assert. . . . We are not to suppose that any truth concerning the Natural
World can be an Enemy of Religion; for Truth cannot be an Enemy of
Truth, God is not divided against himself; therefore we ought not upon
that account to condemn or censure what we have not examined or cannot
disprove; as those that are of this narrow Spirit we are speaking of,
are very apt to do.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As Stephen Jay Gould puts it, "Burnet's basic position has been advanced
by nearly every theistic scientist since the Newtonian revolution:
God made it right the first time. He ordained the laws of nature to
yield an appropriate history; he needn't intervene later to patch
and fix an imperfect cosmos by miraculous alteration of his own laws"
(<i>TA,</i> 29).

<p>
For Burnet, then, science is based upon reason and the observation
of a world ruled by unchanging natural laws. Gould notes that "Burnet
viewed the flood as central to his methodological program. <i>The Sacred
Theory,</i> therefore, does not proceed chronologically, but moves from
deluge to preceding paradise, for Burnet held that if he could find a
rational explanation for this most cataclysmic and difficult event, his
method would surely encompass all history" (<i>TA,</i> 31). So Burnet
calculates the volume of the ocean and finds that rain itself could not
account for a flood of the magnitude described in the Bible. Instead,
he imagines a perfect earth with a smooth surface and no oceans, but
with a layer of subterranean ocean under a thin mantle. The mountains
and the oceans we see today are a result of ruin and disorder, as the
mantle collapses, dropping the land mass into water, causing the flood and
the disarray of current topography (<i>TE,</i> 1:140-5). Burnet's book,
like Oken's centuries later, explains the unity of all aspects of nature
and humanity. His theory of creation and destruction accounts for plants
and animals, the modes of human society, geographical and mineralogical
features, and the influence of celestial objects. Even the seasons are
seen as a post-Flood phenomena, as the earth's axis of rotation did not
tilt until the catastrophe. In Burnet's case, unity results from a divine
plan that is encoded into the natural laws that drive history.

<p>
But from the descriptions of the terrors of the rains and floods, Burnet
turns to the even more horrifying descriptions of the conflagration,
which he believes will be ignited by natural causes, such as volcanos and
a long drought. Eventually even the soil melts and rock burns: "there is
no terrestrial Body that does not finally yield to the force of fire,
and may either be converted into flame, incorporated in fire, or into
a liquor more ardent than either of them" (<i>TE,</i> 3:46). Moreover,
"the whole exteriour region of the Earth, to the depth of the deepest
part of the sea, will suffer in this fire; and suffer to that degree,
as to be melted down, and the frame of it dissolved . . . there will
be a sort of liquefaction and dissolution; It will become a molten sea
mingled with fire" (<i>TE,</i> 3:53).

<p>
Sitwell's language and imagery in stanzas twenty-two and twenty-three of
"Shadow" ("The violence of torrents, cataracts, maelstroms, rains / That
went before the Flood," "the forked lightnings of the gold / From the
split mountains," "Amid those terrible rains") seem based upon Burnet's
depiction of the deluge (<i>CP,</i> 369). They are perhaps also based upon
a passage from Burnet concerning the conflagration: "Lastly the Lightnings

<b></b>

of the Air, and the flaming streams of the melting skies, will mingle and
joyn with these burnings of the Earth" (<i>TE,</i> 3:84). His influence
continues in stanza twenty-four:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
The gulf that was torn across the world seemed as if the beds of all
the Oceans
<br />
Were emptied. . . . . Naked, and gaping at what had once been the Sun,
<br />
Like the mouth of the Universal Famine,
<br />
It stretched its jaws from one end of the Earth to the other. [<i>CP,</i>
369]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Even more specifically, these lines suggest a passage in Burnet's third
volume that seems appropriate to the nuclear fire at Hiroshima that
melted even the sand beneath it. Burnet argues that the conflagration
will entirely destroy the surface of the earth, not just scorch it:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Furthermore, the Renovation of the World, or The New Heavens and New
Earth, which S. Peter, out of the prophets, tells us shall spring out of
these that are burned and dissolved, do suppose this Earth reduc'd into
a fluid Chaos, that it may lay a foundation for a second world. If you
take such a skeleton of an Earth, as your scorching Fire would leave
behind it; where the flesh is torn from the bones, and the Rocks and
Mountains stand naked and staring upon you; the sea, half empty, gaping
at the Sun, and the cities all in ruins and in rubbish; How would you
raise a New World from this? [<i>TE,</i> 3:81]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, Sitwell chooses imagery from the <i>wrong</i> version&#8212;the
scorched-earth version&#8212;of the conflagration, rather than the
complete annihilation and liquefaction that Burnet predicts. Why?

<p>
Sitwell chooses the scorched-earth imagery because the nuclear
conflagration is <i>man made,</i> not the judgment of God written into
the natural laws and history of the planet. The nuclear fires will leave
the imperfections of the world. The earth will recover from destruction
caused by human degradation. It is <i>this</i> world that concerns
Sitwell, and not a future paradise that Burnet predicts after the world
cools and reforms. Though Burnet gives Sitwell a way of imagining an
earth in the throes of catastrophe, she ultimately resists his vision
of complete destruction. The scientific discourses that dominate the
rest of the poem are those of healing and alchemy&#8212;of Paracelsus.

<p>
Sitwell possessed a copy of <i>The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of
Aureolus Philippus Theophrastus Bombast, of Hohenheim, called Paracelsus
the Great</i> translated by Arthur Edward Waite . Like her copy
of Oken, she read it carefully, listing many passages in the front.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 Her notebook drafts of the poem (and the drafts of her notes to the
 poem, which she also published) reveal that the writings of this Swiss
 alchemist, physician, astronomer, and general scientific theorist
 pervade the last half of "Shadow." Sitwell's search for a unifying
 science led her through Lyell, Haeckel, Oken, and Burnet, but it found
 its logical conclusion in the work of Paracelsus. Tropes of alchemy had
 been used to describe atomic physics in the early twentieth century,
 and Sitwell focused much of the second half of "Shadow" on recovering
 a different

<b></b>

sense of alchemy: moving away from the simple transmutation of elements,
she envisioned an alchemy that would reintegrate the sciences, creating
organic and inorganic unity in twentieth-century physics. Paracelsus
represented a kind of cosmological and scientific view that Sitwell
advocated as a response to a nuclear holocaust caused by the dissociation
of the sciences. As Webster explains:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
As far as Paracelsus was concerned, man and the cosmos were analogues
which were inseparably linked. The study of man the microcosm was
unthinkable without an appreciation of his place in the physical and
spiritual macrocosm. What Paracelsus termed 'astronomy' always found a
central place in his accounts of his medical system. . . . Thus, although
Paracelsus regarded his primary practical goal as the reform of medicine,
his religious standpoint, repeated use of the microcosm-macrocosm analogy,
and recognition of the powerful effects of the celestial environment on
man, constantly threw him back into the fields of cosmology and cosmogony.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Transmutation and alchemy in the atomic age had led to the bomb, and gold
represented the nationalistic avarice and greed that caused world war
and conflagration and was embodied by Dives. But Paracelsus's alchemy,
which explored the interrelationships of life and physics and the healing
power of gold over the physical decay of leprosy (again, a corollary to
radiation sickness and cancer), could suggest an alternative vision of the
sciences as healing and as drawing knowledge together into a benign unity.

<p>
Sitwell weaves Paracelsian thinking into the poem as she intentionally
conflates the stories of the two different Lazaruses in the
Bible&#8212;Lazarus, brother of Martha and Mary of Bethania, whom Jesus
raises from the dead (John 11: 41-4), and Lazarus the beggar who is
spurned by the rich man known as Dives in the Middle Ages (Luke 16:
19-31). After the stanzas invoking Burnet's description of the flood
and the conflagration, Sitwell turns to the first Lazarus:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And in that hollow lay the body of our brother
<br />
Lazarus, upheaved from the world's tomb.
<br />
He lay in that great Death like the gold in the husk
<br />
Of the world . . . And round him, like spent lightnings, lay the
Ore&#8212;
<br />
The balm for the world's sore.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And the gold lay in its husk of rough earth like the core
<br />
In the furred almond, the chestnut in its prickly
<br />
Bark, the walnut in a husk green and bitter.
<br />
Then to that hollow sea
<br />
The civilization of the Maimed, and, too, Life's lepers, came
<br />
As once to Christ near the Sea of Galilee. [<i>CP,</i> 369-70]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In John, Lazarus is resurrected by Jesus, but Sitwell also introduces
the other Lazarus. In Luke, Lazarus is a beggar with a horrible skin
disease that has long been assumed to be leprosy. He begs for crumbs at
the table of Dives, the rich man, but is spurned and is left to the dogs
at the gate. When both men die, Lazarus is taken to a heavenly

<b></b>

banquet, while Dives from the grave wishes Lazarus could bring him
even a drop of water. Though willing, Lazarus is not allowed to offer
relief. However, Sitwell's specific imagery of Lazarus lying "like gold
in the husk / Of the world . . . And round him, like spent lightnings,
lay the Ore&#8212; / The balm for the world's sore" is not from the
Bible, but rather from the connection she makes over the next several
stanzas to Paracelsus's writings, and, in particular, his discussions
of gold as a cure for leprosy. The plant imagery (almonds, chestnuts,
and walnuts) in stanza twenty-six is also from Paracelsus.

<p>
Sitwell was clearly fascinated by the parallel between the leprosy
that Paracelsus sought to cure and the radiation sickness&#8212;and,
more metaphorically, the moral sickness&#8212;associated with the
atomic bomb. The parallel she develops between these illnesses
becomes part of her poetic argument about the sciences. In the
second volume of <i>Hermetic Medicine and Hermetic Philosophy,</i> in
<i>The Archidoxies,</i> Paracelsus defines what he means by the word
"quintessence":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The quintessence, then, is a certain matter extracted from all things
which Nature has produced, and from everything which has life corporeally
in itself, a matter most subtly purged of all impurities and mortality,
and separated from all the elements. From this it is evident that the
quintessence is, so to say, a nature, a force, a virtue, and a medicine,
once, indeed shut up within things, but now free from any domicile and
from all outward incorporation. [<i>HA,</i> 2:22]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
He argues that "The quintessence of gold corresponds with fire" and,
indeed, with the Sun (<i>HA,</i> 2:23). In passages to which Sitwell
refers in her published notes in the <i>Collected Poems,</i> Paracelsus
believed that the quintessence of gold, not just gold itself, could
cure a leprous body. Her note to verse twenty-nine appears as: "'Also
we must say that this or that is a disease of Gold, and not that it is
leprosy.'&#8212;<i>Paracelsus</i>, Appendix I, Chapter VI."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 The note to verses thirty-one through thirty-four includes: "'Gold is
 the most noble of all, the most precious and primary metal. . . . And
 we are not prepared to deny that leprosy, in all its forms, can be
 thereby removed from the human frame.'&#8212;<i>Paracelsus.</i> These
 verses also contain references to Hermetic Writings" (<i>CP,</i> 428).

<p>
Sitwell was attracted to the notion of quintessence of gold curing leprosy
because it could serve as a commentary on atomic theory. According to
the theory that developed the bomb, elements do each have something more
"elemental" than their humanly tangible form. Uranium, like gold in
Paracelsus's writings, can be touched and apprehended by human beings,
but through a kind of alchemy, its inner "being" can release great
energy. However, this energy is used entirely for destruction, and it
is motivated by greed, symbolized by the very gold that heals leprosy
(and heals the composite Lazarus in Sitwell's poem). Of course, Sitwell
is not suggesting that Paracelsus understood atomic physics and sought
nuclear fission. Rather, she saw Paracelsus's version of "atomic fission"
as setting a proper course for science. The pure hidden forces of the
elements of the universe, in the hands of the right scientist, are a
source for the healing of bodies, not a cause of their illness. Illness
becomes a kind of metaphor for twentieth-century nuclear physics.

<b></b>

<p>
Moreover, Paracelsus's understanding of the hidden properties of elements
was tied into a much larger sense of the relationship between organic and
inorganic (which lived on, to some extent, in the search for unities in
Burnet, Oken, and Haeckel). The pamphlet version of "Shadow" included,
beyond the two notes quoted above, several notes that were not reprinted
in the <i>Collected Poems</i>:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
<i>Page 14, last verse.</i> "Some of the visible trees produce their
fruits covered up, for instance, chestnuts under a prickly bark, walnuts
under one that is green and bitter, and under this again a bitter
membrane, and then at last the kernel. So it happens in minerals, the
kernels of which, that is to say, the metals are separated just like
those others by barks."

<p>
Parcelsus's similes in these passages&#8212;minerals and metals are like
the kernels of nuts; gold "grows" like a tree or like a rose from a rose
seed; gold restores the body like a honeycomb purged of its honey and
wax&#8212;are verbally rich, but they are also much more than simply
similes. The rative language reinforces a major argument that runs
through Paracelsus's writings: the inorganic and organic world are
intimately tied together.

<p>
Indeed, an early draft of stanzas twenty-five and twenty-six makes more
explicit the connection between Lazarus, who "lay in that great Death
like the gold in the husk," and the passage about the unlocking of life
and hidden potentials, where the gold "in its husk of rough earth" is
juxtaposed with the nutritive nuts in their green bitter husks (<i>CP,</i>
369). In the draft, which appears in an undated letter the poet sent to
John Lehmann, Sitwell included both ideas in the same stanza:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And in that hollow lay the body of our brother
<br />
Lazarus, heaved from the world's tomb; and round him the gold
<br />
Lay in the husk, as the chestnut in the prickly
<br />
Bark, the walnut under one that is green and bitter
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The same draft version makes stanza twenty-seven more explicitly
Paracelsian. The published version tells that "Life's lepers, came /
As once to Christ near the Sea of

<b></b>

Galilee" (<i>CP,</i> 370). The draft in the letter reads: "The cripples,
the maimed, the blind of life were brought&#8212; / Down to that Place
of Gold / As once to Christ near the Sea of Galilee."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>

<p>
Likewise, the early draft of stanza thirty-three connects the organic and
the inorganic. In this case, the organic is connected to the catastrophe
of flood and nuclear conflagration and is made more explicitly Paracelsian
with the inclusion of an image of a honeycomb:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
He did not look at us:
<br />
He said "What was spilt still surges like the Flood.
<br />
But Gold shall be the Blood
<br />
of the World . . . Brute gold condensed to the primal essence
<br />
Has the texture, smell, warmth, colour of Blood. Will it shape
<br />
Again the Shadow of Man? At least it will take
<br />
From what roots of life are left the symptoms of the leper&#8212;
<br />
And make the body sharp as the honeycomb. . . ." [<i>CP</i>, 370]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This early draft and the many drafts in the notebooks (too numerous to
quote here) tinkered with the phrasing, sometimes drawing more heavily
on Paracelsus's writings on leprosy and the quintessence of gold, and
healing plants and gems. At other times, Sitwell moved closer to the
synthesis of those ideas with the final vision of the poem, which brings
Dives and Cain into a composite picture of betrayal and greed.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>

<p>
Sitwell ended "Shadow" with a religious sense of the collective guilt
of a culture that murdered so many thousands at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
noting that "those ashes that were men / Will rise again / To be our Fires
upon the Judgment Day!" (<i>CP,</i> 372). Yet the scientific discourse
of healing with alchemy and medicine took precedence in the phrase
with which she summarized the poem: "In this poem I show the sufferers
from the disease hoping to cure themselves by means of some universal
application of a medicine made [from] the diseases' quintessence, used
as a prophylactic" (<i>N,</i> 62). The poem powerfully suggests that a
response to the biological crisis that atomic science had precipitated
by creating the bomb could only be met by a concerted and healing
reintegration of the sciences into an ethical whole, a unity with roots
that Sitwell could trace from the Romantic science of Oken and Haeckel
back to the alchemy of Paracelsus.

Edith Sitwell read John Hersey's <i>Hiroshima</i> (1946, originally
published in the <i>New Yorker</i>) and copied passages from Hersey and
from bomb reportage in the <i>Daily Mail,Daily Express,Scottish Sunday
Express,</i> and other newspapers. John Langdon Davies's article,
"Atom Bombs: Some Dread New Facts" (<i>Daily Mail,</i> 2 September
1946), conjured nightmarish visions that Sitwell copied into her undated
notebook 78 of "subhuman" Japanese babies born centuries in the future
due to radiation damage. Davies also described a radioactive dust
dropped from planes onto unsuspecting towns at night to create "hidden
biological results" and expressed the fear that "200 aeroplanes each
with an atomic bomb could sterilise or cause chromosome injury to the
entire population of Britain." The section called "Three Poems of the
Atomic Age" first appeared in Edith Sitwell, <i>The Song of the Cold</i>
(New York: Vanguard, 1948).

<p>
<a name="FOOT4" href="#REF4">4</a>.
Sitwell was on the road to a conversion to Roman Catholicism&#8212;she
was received into the church in 1955&#8212;and had addressed religious
issues fairly directly in her poetry from the 1940s, and even, in a less
sustained way, as far back as <i>Gold Coast Customs</i> . Scholars
have not engaged with Sitwell's later poetry to the extent that they
have with, for example, <i>Fa&ccedil;ade</i> . The flurry of
work on "Three Poems of the Atomic Age" that appeared in the 1960s and
1970s largely emerged from Catholic journals and book series by scholars
explicating Sitwell's religious vision. See, for example: Ralph J. Mills,
Jr., <i>Edith Sitwell: A Critical Essay</i> (Grand Rapids, Mich.: William
B. Eerdmans: 1966), published as part of the "Contemporary Writers in
Christian Perspective" series; publications by Sister M. Jeremy and John
Ower in <i>Renascence,</i> which was published "by the Catholic Renascence
Society, Inc., to promote the study of values in literature"; and articles
appearing in religion-oriented journals such as <i>The Personalist</i>
and the <i>American Benedictine Review.</i> John Ower published three
essays on Sitwell during the period, and claimed her as a Catholic
thinker well before her conversion: "Edith Sitwell was received into
the Roman Catholic Church in 1955, but her poetry reflects Christian
and specifically Catholic ideas well before that date." See John Ower,
"Edith Sitwell and the Atomic Bomb," <i>American Benedictine Review</i> 27
: 428, n. 2; hereafter abbreviated as "ES." Even recent work still
focuses primarily on the religious vision without exploring any of the
scientific contexts of the poem. See, for example, Pamela Slateliggett,
"The Vision of Edith Sitwell: Prophecy and Sensation in Her World War
II Poetry," <i>Language and Literature</i> 22 : 93-102.

<p>
<a name="FOOT5" href="#REF5">5</a>.
Ower offers the most thorough religious criticisms, and his careful
exploration of the Biblical images and concepts from "Salvation
History" provide us with a theologically sophisticated account of
Sitwell's interpretation of the atomic holocaust. He suggests that
Sitwell's "vision of Fall and Redemption" was based on a dynamic
between "alienation" and "atonement," which he calls the "matrix of
reconciliation" ("ES," 427). For instance, Ower reads the ice age imagery
and the "great oscillations / Of temperature" in the poem as symbols of
the disjunction between the mind and instincts and emotions, which he
suggests Sitwell sees as an aspect of the Fall ("ES," 428, n. 3). He reads
the passages about intense cold as symbolizing the "loveless isolation"
of the mind and an ironic parody of divine creation <i>ex nihilo</i>,
without exploring their sources in scientific tracts that Sitwell cites
in her published notes to the poem. Two of the most important of these
are Charles Lyell's <i>Principles of Geology</i> (1830-33; Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1990), hereafter abbreviated as <i>PG</i>;
and Lorenz Oken's <i>Elements of Physiophilosophy,</i> trans. Alfred Tulk

Sitwell's word choice also recalls press accounts of the paradoxical
chill of radiation burn victims. In one poignant passage from Hersey's
<i>Hiroshima</i> a priest helps a woman with "huge, raw flash burns on her
body": "She began to shiver heavily, and again said it was cold. Father
Kleinsorge borrowed a blanket from someone nearby and wrapped her up,
but she shook more and more, and said again, 'I am so cold,' and then she
suddenly stopped shivering and was dead." John Hersey, <i>Hiroshima</i>

His mature works began with <i>Compendium of Nature Philosophy</i> ,

notes, "sought to construct a whole world from deductive premises"
("RS," 387).

There were certainly more recent challenges than <i>Naturphilosophie</i>
to mechanistic philosophies in the modernist period. For instance, it is
hard to imagine that Sitwell was unaware of the work of Henri Bergson and
the vitalist philosophy that was at its height from the late nineteenth
century through roughly the 1920s. See Sanford Schwartz, "Bergson and the
Politics of Vitalism," in <i>The Crisis in Modernism: Bergson and the
Vitalist Controversy,</i> ed. Frederick Burwick and Paul Douglass (New
York: Cambridge University Press, 1992), 277-305. I don't find direct
evidence that Bergsonianism played a role in Sitwell's thinking in the
1940s. Instead, it appears that Oken's attack on mechanistic sciences
and his highly idiosyncratic and imaginative attempt to weave together
a system that would unify biology, physics, geology, and virtually
all other sciences, captured Sitwell's fancy in a way that Bergson may
not have. Sitwell owned a copy of Bergson's <i>Creative Evolution</i>
, but her 1959 reprint was published well after the composition
of the bomb poems.

<p>
<a name="FOOT28" href="#REF28">28</a>.
See "RS," 388-9 for a succinct summary of Oken's voluminous work and
his coining of the term "biology."

<p>
<a name="FOOT29" href="#REF29">29</a>.
On the front leaf Sitwell noted 110 different pages, sometimes with
annotations, and she marked in the margins, sometimes with annotations,
188 separate propositions (the book was published in the form of
numbered propositions). However, two pairs of pages, 585-6 and 587-8,
were never cut, so she must not have read every page (these pages contain
descriptions of various categories of worms).

<p>
<a name="FOOT30" href="#REF30">30</a>.
Oken begins by making a number of claims about the mathematical nature
of the universe:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
2. The universe or world is the reality of mathematical ideas, or,
in simpler language, of mathematics.

<br />
3. Philosophy is the recognition of mathematical ideas as constituting the
world, or the repetition of the origin of the world in consciousness.
<br />
4., 5. Spirit is the motion of mathematical ideas. Nature, their
manifestation.
<br />
6. The philosophy of Spirit is the representation of the movements of ideas
in consciousness. [<i>EP,</i> 1]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
<a name="FOOT31" href="#REF31">31</a>.
Oken claims that "The law of causality is a law of polarity. Causality
is valid only in time, is only a series of numbers" (<i>EP,</i> 21).

<p>
<a name="FOOT32" href="#REF32">32</a>.
Sitwell's lines, "Then Time froze / To immobility and changed to
Space," while conjuring a sense of the response to the tragic news of
Hiroshima&#8212;time froze&#8212;probably owes more to Oken than to
popular readings of Einstein's connectedness of space and time.

<p>
<a name="FOOT33" href="#REF33">33</a>.
Oken asserted that "Animals are entire heavenly bodies, satellites or
moons, which circulate independently about the earth; all plants, on the
contrary, taken together are only equivalent to one heavenly body. An
animal is an infinity of plants" (<i>EP,</i> 207).

<p>
<a name="FOOT34" href="#REF34">34</a>.
<i>EP,</i> 322. Regarding polarization in plants, Oken notes: "The plant
may be characterized as organic water which is polarized upon two sides,
towards the earth and the air. The vegetable vesicle must therefore
maintain two poles" (<i>EP,</i> 206).

<p>
<a name="FOOT35" href="#REF35">35</a>.
In the first edition of "Shadow" (a 1947 pamphlet), Sitwell attributes
the first two lines of stanza twenty-five&#8212;"The gulf that was
torn across the world seemed as if the beds of all the Oceans / Were
emptied . . . Naked, and gaping at what once had been the Sun, / Lies
the mouth of the Universal Famine / It stretched its jaws from one end
of the Earth to the other"&#8212;to Bishop Burnet's <i>Theory of the
Earth.</i> In the later <i>Collected Poems</i> version of these notes,
she omits this attribution, instead citing <i>Theory of the Earth</i>
only for the first, second, and fourth lines of the twenty-third stanza:
"And with them, the forked lightnings of the gold / From the split
mountains, / Blasting their rivals, the young foolish wheat-ears /
Amid those terrible rains" (<i>CP,</i> 369).

Stephen Jay Gould has written one of the most probing reassessments
of Burnet in recent years, arguing against a vision of history that
only considers the "progress" of science: "the rationale for such a
simplistic one-way flow from observation to theory has become entirely
bankrupt. . . . Scientists are human beings, immersed in culture,
and struggling with all the curious tools of inference that mind
permits&#8212;from metaphor and analogy to all the flights of fruitful
imagination that C. S. Pierce calls 'abduction.'" Stephen Jay Gould,
<i>Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle: Myth and Metaphor in the Discovery
of Geological Time</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press,
1987), 6-7; hereafter abbreviated as <i>TA.</i> Gould explains that, in
this theory of history, "Thomas Burnet, villain by taint of theological
dogmatism, wrote his <i>Sacred Theory of the Earth</i> in the 1680s. The
first hero, James Hutton, worked exactly a century later, writing his
initial version of the <i>Theory of the Earth</i> in the 1780s. Charles
Lyell, second hero and codifier of modernity, then wrote his seminal
treatise, <i>Principles of Geology,</i> just fifty years later, in
the 1830s" (<i>TA,</i> 4). He points out that, by the early nineteenth
century, geologists like Lyell had come to ridicule Burnet's scientific
methods for their fancifulness, religious dogma, and lack of compelling
scientific evidence, yet Lyell's sense of "scientific history" is the
very kind against which Gould argues. Of Burnet's <i>Sacred Theory,</i>
Lyell wrote:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Even Milton had scarcely ventured in his poem to indulge his imagination
so freely in painting scenes of the Creation and Deluge, Paradise
and Chaos, as this writer, who set forth pretensions to profound
philosophy. He explained why the primeval earth enjoyed a perpetual spring
before the flood! Shewed how the crust of the globe was fissured by "the
sun's rays," so that it burst, and thus the diluvial waters were let loose
from a supposed central abyss. Not satisfied with these themes, he derived
from the books of the inspired writers, and even from heathen authorities,
prophetic views of the future revolutions of the globe, gave a most
terrific description of the general conflagration, and proved that a new
heaven and a new earth will rise out of a <i>second chaos</i>&#8212;after
which will follow the blessed millennium. [<i>PG,</i> 1: 37-8; italics
in original]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
So why would Sitwell include both Burnet and Lyell as building blocks for
the same poem? I would argue that her vision of the history of scientific
"progress" is more like Gould's than Lyell's. And, beyond even Gould's
understanding of the embeddedness of science in the cultural texture
of its day, Sitwell seems to have seen that the imaginative resources
of the past can be brought to bear upon the present to help revise
scientific emphasis.

Historians have recently redeemed Paracelsus from his reputation as
the last gasp of the Dark Ages and magic before true science began with
Newton and others. Andrew Weeks has explored Paracelsus's role in the
Protestant Reformation in <i>Paracelsus: Speculative Theory and the
Crisis of the Early Reformation</i> (Albany: State University of New
York Press, 1997). Charles Webster has shown that "the first major
confrontation of the Scientific Revolution was between Paracelsus and
Galen, rather than between Copernicus and Ptolemy." Charles Webster,
<i>From Paracelsus to Newton: Magic and the Making of Modern Science</i>
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), 3-4. Paracelsus can be
seen as a father of modern pharmacology, and Webster argues that even the
mechanical philosophy of the seventeenth century did not make Paracelsian
thought obsolete. Webster detects Paracelsus's influence on the Atomism of
Pierre Gassendi, the work of Francis Bacon, the chemistry of Robert Boyle,
and chemical therapy in the later seventeenth century. He argues that
the English physiology of Francis Glisson, John Mayow, and Thomas Willis
were all influenced by Paracelsus. Webster also notes that Newton had a
lively interest in magic and alchemy, possessing volumes by Paracelsus
in his enormous collection of alchemical works.

<p>
<a name="FOOT39" href="#REF39">39</a>.
Webster, <i>From Paracelsus to Newton,</i> 4. Arthur Edward Waite, the
translator of the version of Paracelsus's writings that Sitwell used,
stridently emphasized the interconnectedness of all aspects of science
and religion in Paracelsus that Sitwell desired. In his preface, he
argued that:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
With Paracelsus the province of alchemy was not limited to the
transmutation of metals. It was, broadly speaking, the development of
hidden possibilities or virtues in any substance, whether by God, or
man, or Nature. Thus it included the philosophy of creation, and dealt
with the first matter as developed into the universe by Divine Power. It
included as the natural evolution which takes place round us, whether in
the formation of metals within the earth, or the formation of animals
in the matrix. Finally, it included the development by man's skill and
art of whatsoever was capable of improvement in the products of Nature.

<i>CP,</i> 428. The complete passage from Paracelsus reads: "I would
persuade every one to be more accurately acquainted with the trees, for he
who knows not their seed is involved in fundamental errors. Also we must
say that this or that is a disease of gold, and not that it is leprosy"
(<i>HA,</i> 2:320).

<p>
<a name="FOOT41" href="#REF41">41</a>.
This passage, which Sitwell copied out in notebook 62, is further
explained by the following passage in Paracelsus:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
There are some trees which bear their fruit, not nakedly, but under
mixed conditions. The chestnut, the nut, and other similar growths, have
a bark, thorny in appearance, and inside another, while, lastly a thin
skin encloses the kernel. So, in like manner, there are metals, also,
and minerals lying hid in flesh and skin, such as are the ore of iron,
the ore of silver, and so on. These have to be removed in order that,
after separation, the desired fruit may be extracted. [<i>HA,</i> 1:242]

Stanza thirty-seven in the <i>Collected Poems</i> includes: "But near
him a gold sound&#8212; / The voice of an unborn wheat-ear accusing
Dives&#8212; / Said, 'Soon I shall be more rare, more precious than gold"
(<i>CP,</i> 371). The draft version of these lines that appears in the
letter to Lehmann drew the use of wheat as a life-giving commodity
(subject to greed, but more necessary than gold) into the dialogue
with Paracelsus on leprosy: "But the unborn wheat-ear said 'When the
quintessence / Shall be extracted from the amber or from musk / There is
left only the husk- / A body that stinks and is dry as what was once the
gold swoln wheat-ear.'" In the published poem, Sitwell includes part of
this last line in stanza thirty-two, after describing Dives who is now,
in a turning of the tables, suffering from leprosy of the heart. In
stanza thirty-one, she writes: "Like a great ear of wheat that is swoln
with grain, / Then ruined by white rain, / He lay. . . . His hollow face,
dust white, was cowled with a hood of gold" (<i>CP,</i> 370).
