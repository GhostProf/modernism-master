<p>In her great modernist polemic "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown," Virginia Woolf constructed not only her "Georgian" canon but also her roster of "Edwardian" precursors entirely of male writers: "Mr. Wells, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Galsworthy I will call the Edwardians; Mr. Forster, Mr. Lawrence, Mr. Strachey, Mr. Joyce, and Mr. Eliot I will call the Georgians."<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Although some recent critics have written about the ironic as well as strategic nature of the Georgian list, modernist scholars still tend to take Woolf's word that available Edwardian models were male novelists.</p>
<p>Yet recent scholars of the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> like Elaine Showalter, Ann Ardis, Talia Schaffer, Kathy Psomiades and Marysa DeMoor show us a critically-acclaimed and widely-read group of female and often feminist writers of the generation preceding Virginia Woolf's who produced novels that were aggressively "modern" in their attitudes and subject matter, if not in their relation to inherited narrative forms and styles.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Woolf read, and in some cases wrote, reviews of fiction by these women writers. Her relation to them, however, was at best ambivalent; her refusal to mention them in her major documents about the Edwardians protected them from her direct criticism, but in the same gesture implicated them in the judgment "that there was no English novelist living from whom" writers of her generation "could learn their business" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CB</span>, 99). Furthermore, by refusing to mention these female writers in her great canon-forming polemics, Woolf helped make them forgotten by much of twentieth-century literary history, or at best, regarded as minor. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The feminist writer of this group who is the most evident Edwardian antecedent of Virginia Woolf is the American-born London actress, actor-manager, suffrage spokeswoman and critically acclaimed novelist, Elizabeth Robins. Jane Marcus and Joanne E. Gates have written about Robins as a foremother of Woolf, a writer of the previous, maternal generation of fiction writers who shared Woolf's concern for women's rights and understanding of women writers. But both critics see the relation between Robins and Woolf as congenial and unproblematic.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> Two reviews that Virginia Woolf wrote of Robins's books and several of her references to Robins in diaries and letters as well as some anecdotes in Leonard Woolf's memoirs indicate that, on the contrary, to Virginia Woolf, Elizabeth Robins was outdated, "a prewar writer" who also put herself forward as a public re in ways that made the younger woman acutely uncomfortable.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Some of Robins's novels were also prime examples of what Woolf decried in "Mr. Bennett and Mr. Brown" as the characteristic incompleteness of Edwardian novels, provoking frustrated readers "to join a society, or, more desperately, to write a cheque" to finish them (<span style="font-style:italic;">CB</span>, 99). Yet Robins wrote about some of the same subjects that Virginia Woolf addressed only a few years later. Her anonymously published <span style="font-style:italic;">Ancilla's Share</span>, a denunciation of "sex-antagonism," made many of the points and used many of the images that appear in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One's Own</span>, published five years later.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> Her 1905 scandal novel <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dark Lantern</span>, treated sympathetically, but with a very different attitude toward doctors, the themes of sexual trauma and the rest cure that appeared in Woolf's 1925 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>. And as this essay will discuss, a 1913 scandal novel, published in England as <span style="font-style:italic;">Where Are You Going To . . .?</span> and in the U.S. as <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, deals with the same questions about the education of young women and female sexual slavery as does Virginia Woolf's first novel <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, published in 1915. I use this original edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, based on the 1915 Duckworth publication, rather than the Harcourt edition, which reproduces the text that Virginia Woolf revised in 1919-20, because the Duckworth edition demonstrates that even in the first published version of her first novel Woolf was experimenting with a narrative strategy of withholding or presenting conflicting tonal cues, thus at key points refusing to give readers authorial guidance about how to evaluate events, comments or characters.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>The clearly feminist themes are raised and complicated very differently in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> (I use the shorter U.S. title throughout) than in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>. In its own terms <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> is a brilliant novel, a gripping and persuasive horror story with a memorable message about female sexual slavery and female education.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> It has been overlooked until recently because modernist aesthetic values largely triumphed over those of late Victorian and Edwardian precursors. These modernist aesthetic values included repugnance for sentimentality and overt social and political engagement, and constructed late Victorian and Edwardian feminist polemical novels as a useful "other" to innovative early twentieth-century art and aesthetic theory. Scholars of modernism, however, can step back from the prohibitions that historically helped generate a new body of work—including the fiction of Virginia Woolf. This essay thus suggests another kind of antecedent for Woolf's modernism, and suggests further that we take seriously the tradition of the feminist polemical novel, which continued into the 1930s and arguably resumed with Second Wave feminist fiction in the 1970s. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The differences between Robins's and Woolf's novels illuminate, on one hand, the unexpected strengths of the sentimental tradition used by Robins to deal with provocatively "modern" subject matters in her polemical novel, and on the other hand, the counter-polemical tendency that complicates and qualifies ethical, political and aesthetic issues in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> The earlier drafts of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, initially titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span>, show how conscious and measured the process was whereby Woolf arrived at a different form—and consequently, I will argue, more radical thematic as well as stylistic possibilities—for her first novel.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> The stylistic difference in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> is most centrally a calculated complication or withholding of <span style="font-style:italic;">tonal cues</span>—evaluative markers signaling how readers are supposed to "take" key phrases and passages, scenes and characters.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Like <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister, The Voyage Out</span> raises urgent questions about the education and position in society of young women, female creativity and aspiration, the potential and dangers of heterosexual romance, and the most obvious model of the public woman, the prostitute. Further, Woolf's first novel aligns the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bildungsroman</span> theme of being brought "out" with an entry into imperial and racial otherness.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> Yet even in this early work, Woolf often refrains from presenting an attitude or pronouncement that can be recognized as authorially sanctioned.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Crucial scenes where readers are denied clear directions telling them what attitudes to assume toward an event, character, statement or description include Rachel's reaction to Richard Dalloway's kiss; the two dream sequences—the first following on that kiss, the second when Rachel is in the coma that leads to her death; the trip into the interior of Santa Marina; and the characterization of Evelyn Murgatroyd. Although the <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span> manuscripts present clearer values and often allow the third-person narrator to guide readers' attitudes, these drafts cannot be used to put political and ethical positions "back into" the published novel without a dubious theory that the drafts constitute a somehow truer, purer or uncensored form of the novel that Woolf finally submitted for publication.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Her revisions, like all those in her ensuing novels, tended toward greater sophistication and stylistic complexity as well as tonal ambiguity. To treat <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span> as an archive of governing intention, a means of "clarifying" recommended attitudes in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, is to disrespect Woolf's choices in the process of revision. This essay, on the contrary, sees these revisions, and especially the increased uncertainty in affect and value, as part of Woolf's modernist turn. The contrast with Robins's very different feminist project using many of the same themes points up how radical Woolf's techniques were from the beginning of her career as a fiction writer, at the same time that it emphasizes how these techniques involved presenting conflicting, unclear or simply absent tonal cues, so that readers are often uncertain about how they are supposed to feel and judge. The end result of such evasions is consonant with what Rebecca Walkowitz has called "critical heroism" and, wryly, "bad modernism." As Walkowitz explains, the purpose is ethical as well as aesthetic: "one must risk being bad—uncertain, inconsistent, and unsuccessful—in order to keep being good."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Problems of the Public Woman</h1>
<p>When in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, the young protagonist Rachel Vinrace becomes excited about a brave new world that has such people in it as Richard and Clarissa Dalloway, she consults the book on board her father's ship that promises to provide the most concrete information on the subject: <span style="font-style:italic;">Who's Who</span>. There she finds "biographies of bankers, writers, clergymen, sailors, surgeons, judges, professors, statesmen, editors, philanthropists, merchants, and actresses," only the last category apparently containing women, for the list continues, "what clubs they belonged to, where they lived, what games they played, and how many acres they owned" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 85). The incident sums up the situation of a 23-year-old upper-middle-class English girl in the first decade of the century who is realizing that there are other points of view than those of her immediate family. Although Rachel goes on from this passage to entertain a "vision of her own personality, of herself as a real everlasting thing, different from anything else," she has also learned something about the social limits to her possibilities (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 86). The only women granted the distinction of a listing in <span style="font-style:italic;">Who's Who</span> are those ambivalent res actresses, who <span style="font-style:italic;">because</span> they are professionally in the public eye are popularly associated with that most fearsome emblem of the public woman, the prostitute.</p>
<p>The prostitute was the shadow attending the newly public status of middle-class women. She was the woman "of the street," who incarnated a threat to the reputation, and even the body, of any female claiming the independence to step out on her own. As an actress and actor-manager whose immersion in Ibsen converted her into a highly effective public speaker for the suffrage cause,<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> Elizabeth Robins was acutely aware of how indeterminate both professions could be in public discourse—and of the connotations of "profession" in any reference to women. As she noted, "[t]o say 'a public woman' is, or was recently to say a woman of the streets."<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> In her great suffrage novel of 1907, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Convert</span>, she played on the ambiguity by making the suffrage activism of its protagonist a consequence of prior sexual vulnerability. Vida Levering becomes a public polemicist for the movement in part because she earlier had a sexual relationship with a man who coerced her to get an abortion when a child was unsuitable to his political future. Her "fall" motivates her to enter public life, not because she has no honor left to lose, but because her experience prompts her to question the standards of gentility giving chastity its value and isolating privileged women from their working-class counterparts. But in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Convert</span>, as in Robins's other overtly feminist works such as the 1908 short story "Under His Roof" and the provocative 1913 best-seller <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, educative sexual experience seems to preclude further heterosexual entanglements. In Robins's fiction, the move into the realm of politics and social organizing comes at the expense of traditional romance. The protagonist enters the public sphere instead of continuing a relationship with a man. Despite some gestures toward male feminism and the strategic value of women who are married to powerful men, Robins in her explicitly political fiction presented activism and leadership as clear alternatives to the kind of steamy sexual partnership she had portrayed in her 1905 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dark Lantern</span>.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, the character who chooses public life is the significantly unnamed narrator: the older sister, the counterweight to Bettina, who is the "little sister" of the title. The decision of this narrator to devote her life to medicine, or to public agitation against sexual slavery (or possibly to both: the terms of the final-page dénouement are vague) comes as a consequence of Bettina's kidnapping and disappearance into "one of the most infamous houses in Europe" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 258). The narrative of this older sister, who is "made of commoner clay" than the conventionally beautiful and accomplished Bettina, provides an implicit antidote to the disastrous story of an early twentieth-century doll, who is restricted not by an overbearing man, but by her own hyperbolically feminine mother to the infantilizing doll's house (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 36). The narrator recalls critically her own and Bettina's protective upbringing and spells out the logic that left them ignorant of men's sexual desire but wholly reliant on men's protection.</p>
<p>Despite the emphasis of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> on girls' education, however, the widespread public response to the novel focused entirely on Bettina's story and its lurid climax. In most reviews, the narrator dropped out of sight altogether. For example, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span>' enthusiastic report, Robins had written "this heart-breaking story of the little sister, whom we accompany through her watched and exquisite childhood, her wildflower maidenhood, willful, a little spoiled, but utterly lovable, and whom we leave dancing and laughing on the edge of the ghastly abyss, into which she is so soon to be pushed."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> If this account seems blind to the way Bettina generally res only in the background of key events (because, the narrator explains, she is too delicate to take risks or responsibilities), it expresses a contemporary fascination with "white slavery" that mixed indignation with prurience. (The racially loaded designation "white slavery" does not appear in Robins's novel.) Robins initially conceived <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> as a joint project with her friend W.T. Stead, the publisher of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pall Mall Gazette</span> and author of the famous 1885 article "Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon," which first exposed to a mass audience the practice of child sexual slavery in the East End of London.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Because an abbreviated version of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> was first published in serial form in the U.S. magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">McClure's</span> in 1912, it reached an American public shortly after the Mann Act, criminalizing aspects of the traffic in women, was passed by Congress. Robins exploited the sensational nature of the topic and adopted a particularly extreme version of the style of sentimental fiction—by that point a genre associated almost entirely with mass-market writing. For these reasons, although she had structured her novel around a set of devastating dramatic ironies, her style and the context of her treatment in effect discouraged readers from looking for subtleties.</p>
<p>Yet the central irony of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> stands in direct opposition to a dominant ideological tenet of sentimental fiction: that there is an essential and redemptive feminine difference, usually embodied in female sexual purity. In <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One's Own</span> Woolf remarked on "[t]hat profoundly interesting subject, the value that men set upon women's chastity and its effect upon their education."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> Robins addressed that profoundly interesting subject directly, suggesting with characteristic irony that one effect of the value set upon women's chastity is an education fitting women only <span style="font-style:italic;">for</span> prostitution. The training Bettina receives in the arts of pleasing prepares her beautifully <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  for a career in a brothel, where she is last seen singing a childhood song—full of suddenly apparent double entendres—to a circle of fascinated gentlemen. Throughout the course of the novel, neither she nor the narrator has any notion that prostitution exists, or even "that men desire women," to borrow a circumlocution from Woolf's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 82). After Bettina is absorbed by an international prostitution ring, the narrator realizes that many of the same police and eminent gentlemen to whom she turned for protection are involved in maintaining the brothels, and moreover are responsible for allowing the kidnappings by which procurers cater to a taste for young virgins. Using all the resources of a sentimental stylistics already in the process of being discredited, she emphasizes the implications in terms of gendered knowledge:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Eric, and all the rest (this it was that crushed hope out of my heart)—they all <span style="font-style:italic;">knew</span>. And they accepted this thing.</p>
<p>That was the thought that again and again tore me out of my bed, and brought the great Darkness.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 299)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The overriding theme of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> is that feminine innocence is sustained by a calculated withholding of exactly the information that might allow women to protect themselves.</p>
<p>In a subsequent essay, Robins wrote that she had deliberately set the story among the upper classes because readers would not take seriously a novel about forced prostitution if it involved a "common girl."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> In a context suggesting that the only real violation consists in the fact that the missing Bettina has more influential friends than does the usual kidnappee, a London policeman voices this bias in the novel: "But usually it's poor girls" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 294). In <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, class is a crucial part of the prohibitions that bear on both sexuality and gender. The narrator broods over the way her widowed and mysteriously traumatized mother turns out a pregnant housemaid and refuses to shelter and feed a female migrant farm worker with her infant child, although this same mother cannot bear to hurt a spider.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> And when this narrator falls in love with a scientist and naively aspires not only to be with him but to be <span style="font-style:italic;">like</span> him by studying to gain entrance to medical school, both the mother and the scientist himself find her ambition vulgar as well as unfeminine. Claims of gentility and purity combine to keep "respectable" women in the private sphere.</p>
<p>As Robins indicated, however, private and public cannot be separate in a society where successful marriages are a matter of packaging and value for money. A "discussion of supply and demand" initiated by an intrusive neighbor points up the similarities between prostitution and the licensed sexual servitude of marriage:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Lady Helmstone laid down the law that a girl's best "opportunities" came before she was twenty. In these days of Gaiety girls and American heiresses the whole question had grown incomparably more difficult. "Mothers with a sense of family duty—I may say of patriotism—have to think seriously about these things." She herself, having married off three daughters and two nieces, might be considered something of an expert.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 140-41) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The mother is furious at this mercantile approach on the part of the <span style="font-style:italic;">nouveaux riches</span>, but she is equally disdainful of her older daughter's incipient professionalism, preferring to provide for her children by offering only a more mystified version of a wife's relationship to her breadwinner: "'You will have husbands, I hope, to take care of you'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 44). The catastrophic conclusion makes Bettina the object lesson and the narrator the student who learns it. Apparently discarding her lover, who has proved capable of taking care of no one, she turns toward some unformulated ideal of public activism. In the novel's terms, the entrance of women into the public sphere is an unmitigated good.</p>
<p>The relation of young women to the public sphere is far more complicated in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, although Woolf's novel, too, considers the dangers of naivety, narrowness and prolonged childhood. For Rachel Vinrace, however, ignorance of the ways of the world and almost complete isolation from society have allowed her access to something else, something that Woolf signaled here—as later in "A Sketch of the Past"—with the word "reality":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>It appeared that nobody ever said a thing they meant, or ever talked of a feeling they felt, but that was what music was for. Reality dwelling in what one saw and felt, but did not talk about, one could accept a system in which things went round and round quite satisfactorily to other people, without often troubling to think about it, except as something superficially strange.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 32)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The reality "dwelling in what one saw and felt, but did not talk about" is not the same reality revealed in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, the masculinist structure of society with its framework of unspoken class and imperial assumptions and Victorian conventions, including conventions about male sexuality and female economic survival. The major contrast in Woolf's novel is not between private and public spheres, but between, on the one hand, a world of commonplace and shared meanings and values that incorporates both private and public, and on the other hand, a world of essentially solitary, ontologically privileged experience.</p>
<p>From the opening pages, Rachel seems most at home in what is almost a parallel universe of unmediated contact with the real, where like a Heideggerian metaphysician she is "overcome with awe that things should exist at all."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Her suddenly defamiliarized apprehension of a tree, "which, although it did not grow across her path, stopped her as effectively as if the branches had struck her in the face," is one paradigm of an encounter with Heideggerian <span style="font-style:italic;">Sein</span>, Sartrean existence, the "Mere Being" celebrated in Stevens's poem, or, for that matter, the "reality" or "being" that in "A Sketch of the Past" presents Woolf herself with "shocks": "It was an ordinary tree, but to her it appeared so strange that it might have been the only tree in the world. . . .Having seen a sight that would last her for a lifetime, and for a lifetime would preserve that second, the tree once more sank into the ordinary ranks of trees."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Her gift for music is the sign of her aesthetic (and implicitly metaphysical) way of taking hold of things, a means that enables intense responses at the expense of conventional communication.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Yet these same intense responses inevitably bring her into <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  intimacy with the strange and fascinating population inhabiting her brave new world, "human beings" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 143). Like the sheltered girls in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, she grows up to have experiences as a body with other bodies despite, or perhaps because of, her ignorance about sexuality and gender relations. In her case, too, these embodied experiences seem to lead to her destruction.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, sexual ignorance has equivocal connections with the central theme of silence—the subject for a novel that Terence Hewet proposes, involving "the things people don't say" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 238). Hewet's phrase has two distinct applications within the story. First, it designates the realm of reality that Rachel tenuously inhabits at the opening, a range of ineffable experience that by definition is distorted and constrained by the attempt to translate it into conventional modes of expression. Second, however, "the things people don't say" comprise the official codes of behavior and institutions that are unmentionable in polite society. As in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, the most important of these is prostitution.</p>
<p>The specter of the prostitute haunts the tiny community of English tourists who comprise the fictional universe of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> An unspeakable woman ("I wouldn't like to say what <span style="font-style:italic;">she</span> is!" another character remarks [<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 123]) drifts through the life of the San Marina hotel residents. Not only unspeakable, she is speechless, and thus a fitting revenant of the things people don't say, passing between rooms in the night until she finally is "hoofed out," in St.-John Hirst's phrase—an instance of scapegoating that causes the more progressive and Bloomsbury-like of the characters to reflect on the Ibsenesque theme of the "monstrous, hypocritical smugness" of the English (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 342). To Helen Ambrose, St.-John Hirst and Terence Hewet, prostitution is a fact of life, a bourgeois masculine accommodation to the Victorian ideology of sexual repression. Implicit in their attitude is a desire to minimize this sort of fact and this sort of life: not to allow details like prostitution to affect the day-to-day functioning of educated, civilized people.</p>
<p>But as <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> has shown, the existence and meaning of the prostitute are of acute importance to a young girl entering the arena of sexual arrangements. After reporting that Richard Dalloway kissed her, Rachel responds to Helen's information "that men desire women" (women's desire, a major focus of this novel, is never a subject of conversation) by demanding, "Tell me . . . what are those women in Piccadilly?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 82). The Piccadilly streetwalkers are the most visible prostitutes in the lives of officially respectable young London women, and serve for them as an outward manifestation of their worries about sexual impulses, gender subordination, class and the relation of sexual ownership sanctioned by the institution of marriage. Evelyn Murgatroyd, the novel's ambiguous example of a young woman who yearns to act in the public sphere, confides one of her projects to Rachel: "We ought to go into Piccadilly and stop one of these poor wretches and say: 'Now, look here, I'm no better than you are, and I don't pretend to be any better, but you're doing what you know to be beastly, and I won't have you doing beastly things, because we're all the same under our skins, and if you do a beastly thing it does matter to me'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 276). This speech suggests how a young woman, at the age when she is by definition concerned with her marriage prospects, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  regards her situation as in some inchoate way bound up with that of the prostitute. The link must remain inchoate because it threatens the whole distinction between the nubile girl and the woman for sale. Despite her social concerns, Evelyn does not venture to wonder <span style="font-style:italic;">why</span> somebody might do "a beastly thing." Both girls inhabit a universe in which marriage, although conventionally represented as the romantic choice of a life partner, is still the prime means of subsistence for women.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">What Girls Should Know</h1>
<p>The question of education in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> is not limited to whether young women should learn about male desire and alternate ways of earning a living, nor is a career presented as the alternative to the marriage market. Although written before British women got the vote and the right to enter the professions, Woolf's novel—in striking contrast to the narrator's yearnings in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>—in a sense assumes these advances as rights, if not yet achieved facts. Secondary characters like Evelyn Murgatroyd or Mary Datchet in <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span>—women who are in some respects independent or aspire to independence—embody a reservation about what Evelyn calls "doing something" as the chief goal of female endeavor. The overriding concern Woolf had with the female artist, perhaps most tellingly articulated in her discussion of the woman of genius in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One's Own</span>, entailed prizing qualities that require shelter from public scrutiny: not only the solitude and independence implied in the demand for a room of one's own, but also a kind of anonymity or invisibility that informs the presentation of female characters in such novels as <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span>.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> To Evelyn's accusation, "We don't <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span> things. What do you <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span>?" Rachel answers "I play," a punning assertion Evelyn takes in only one sense: "That's about it! . . . We none of us do anything but play" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 275). After all, Bettina in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> played—and in fact played the piano—as part of her preparation for being kept as an upper-class wife. Rachel, however, "plays" as an artist. Her activity bears little resemblance to what the voices of English respectability regard as work. The Dalloways, for example, are comfortably censorious in their assumption that art is escape, or as Clarissa elaborates, "shutting oneself up in a little world of one's own, with pictures and music and everything beautiful, and then I go out into the streets and the first child I meet with its poor, hungry, dirty little face makes me turn round and say, 'No, I <span style="font-style:italic;">can't</span> shut myself up—'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 41). In many respects Rachel's "play" is the novel's most privileged activity—a point I will come back to a bit later.</p>
<p>But Rachel's "play" is also the activity most endangered by the process of bringing Rachel "out." The power of her own sexuality and the shock of learning about the importance of sexuality in the great world of "human beings" provide her with momentous experiences, which make clear that her sexual feelings, like the emotions aroused and assuaged by music, belong to the realm of the "real" to which the novel gives aesthetic and metaphysical priority. At the same time, they force on her an understanding of her availability and vulnerability. She responds to Richard Dalloway's kiss with a range of entirely physical reactions, to her uninterpretable, and presented in the text without <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  interpretation: "Rachel stood up and went. Her head was cold, her knees shaking and the physical pain of the emotion was so great that she could only keep herself moving above the great leaps of her heart. She leant upon the rail of the ship, and gradually ceased to feel, for a chill of body and mind crept over her" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 77). As her attention drifts away from her own sensations, however, she encounters an image of ease, acceptance and peace, and her feelings adjust to the mood suggested by the "little black and white sea-birds" who rise and fall "with smooth and graceful movements in the hollows of the waves" and seem "singularly detached and unconcerned." She addresses them, "You're peaceful." And her mood follows this identification: "She became peaceful too, at the same time possessed with a strange exultation. Life seemed to hold infinite possibilities she had never guessed at" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 77).</p>
<p>One of the great achievements of this description is that it tells a great deal about the incident without in social terms defining what has happened and thus without prescribing how readers should feel about and judge it. For example, it does not reveal whether Rachel likes or dislikes the kiss, is aroused or horrified by Richard Dalloway, is attracted to or repelled by men. The description of her dream that follows, with its motif of entrapment in a deathly vaginal tunnel and its gibbering "barbarian" men, establishes for her the threat posed by male, and perhaps also her own, sexual desire (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 78). But nothing in these accounts provides readers with unmistakable clues about Rachel's sexual preferences or attitudes, or even responses to this particular incident. This passage withholds tonal cues from readers in the same gesture as it represents Rachel not knowing herself how she feels.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> She wanders among the possibilities encoded in ready-made expressions, telling Helen "I like him," "I became terrified" and "I shall think about it all day and all night until I find out exactly what it does mean."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> The fluctuations and intensity disturb Helen, who counsels, "The pity is to get things out of proportion" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 82). But for Rachel, as later for Septimus Smith in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, proportion may signal assimilation into socially restricted, "normal" classifications of thought and feeling. Rachel's nonverbal and nonrepresentational art seems to draw her away from restraints and norms. She runs to extremes. Rachel's gender, on the other hand, constitutes within the world of the novel an overriding social reason that she should submit to social molding.</p>
<p>In direct opposition to the message about education for women in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, for Rachel, knowledge of and entrance into the public realm involve endangering other kinds of knowledge and other realms of ontological contact. The ominous analogy of "the white, hairless, blind monsters lying curled on the ridges of sand at the bottom of the sea, which would explode if you brought them to the surface" suggests that in being brought "out," Rachel moves fatally out of her element (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 16). Instead of exploding, however, she appears to be compressed into lethal clarity, as the representational strategies of the narrative define her body more and more in terms of an observer's gaze. At the beginning of the story her physical appearance, from Helen's point of view, is vague and blurred, described as much through negations as through assertions: "Her face was weak rather than decided, saved from insipidity by the large enquiring eyes; denied beauty, now that she was sheltered indoors, by the lack of colour and definite outline" <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 13). Three months into her stay in the South American town of Santa Marina, however, she has acquired more precise form: "a keen observer might have thought that the girl was more definite and self-confident in her manner than before" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 100). By the night of the dance she has modulated into a suitable heroine for a romance plot: Helen judges her "certainly more attractive than the generality of young women" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 174). And Terence recognizes his own attraction to her when he acknowledges that she has "a body with the angles and hollows of a young woman's body not yet developed, but in no way distorted, and thus interesting and even lovable" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 227). Once she is in focus, Rachel manifests the physical qualities that fit her for heterosexual love and its concomitant institution, marriage. Or, more disturbingly, she manifests a <span style="font-style:italic;">lack</span> of the physical qualities that will <span style="font-style:italic;">un</span>fit her for this generic requirement. Her body is "not yet developed" but, the narrator assures us (suggesting that Terence assures himself), "in no way distorted." Although the initial description of creatures lying at the bottom of the ocean associated her with the monstrous and perhaps also the marvelous, by the time of her engagement she has congealed into the right sort of shape.</p>
<p>The external description of Rachel's increased definition is only one of the strategies indicating that something supremely important is lost in the voyage that brings this young girl from the state of being an inchoate subject of experience to the state of being visibly and acceptably delineated. This peculiar process of social embodiment, in which Rachel acquires hard edges and discernible attractions in the eyes of her beholders, incarnates a more overt concern that Rachel herself voices about the inadequacy of cultural forms of representation. "Why don't people write about things they do feel?" she demands of Terence as he tries to mold her literary tastes (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 330). Her point, reiterated at key moments in the story, is that the established categories for containing and conveying reality are so irrelevant to her own impressions and sensations that they amount to lies. The implied parallel is that her own socialization into an appropriate appearance and role is also a lie—and a danger, because to become appropriate is to be appropriated.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Music and Reality</h1>
<p>The opposition between reality and conventional categories that Rachel embodies is identifiably modernist. The idea of a noumenal but (partially or tangentially) accessible realm different from the common-sense formulations and functional understanding of everyday life characterized the popular philosophical writings of Henri Bergson and the aesthetic formulations of Viktor Shklovsky, which helped define modernist literary aesthetics.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Woolf's middle-period experimental novels "of vision" and the treatment of "being" or "the real" in "A Sketch of the Past" assume this opposition (<span style="font-style:italic;">SP</span>, 70). When we first encounter Rachel thinking over the difference between words and music, she functions to some extent as the vehicle of Woolf's nascent modernist aesthetics. In her groping formulations, Rachel reflects that reality is apprehended by feelings, and that music, rather than language, gives apposite shape and expression to these feelings. As in <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span>, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, Woolf made a non-literary art the re for <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  a reinvented version of narrative, in this instance a version gestured toward but not formally enacted, by the novel itself.</p>
<p>Unlike painting, music has a long tradition in the West as an inherently nonrepresentational form. Against the self-styled and culturally sanctioned literary (and Cambridge) men Terence Hewet and St.-John Hirst, Rachel stands for an art defined and judged by the internal coherence of its structure.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> In the imaginative process of representing a nonrepresentational mode of art, Woolf described Rachel's temporal performances on the piano in terms of designs in three-dimensional space, aligned with the abstract and artificial structures of architecture: "Now she stumbled; now she faltered and had to play the same bar twice over; but an invisible line seemed to string the notes together, from which rose a shape, a building" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 55). The analogy suggests an aesthetic form that invents rather than represents, and suggests further that this form is something to inhabit, if only for a brief period. In all these respects, Rachel's experiences of music have clear affinities with what Woolf would call in "A Sketch of the Past" moments of being.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup></p>
<p>As the most evident prototype of modernist aesthetic sensibility in the novel, Rachel displays a detachment from the social realm that accompanies a frequently shocking readiness to make observations about its fundamental assumptions. She tries to get at what Hewet means when he refers to the sorts of question no one asks, by inquiring, "Whether we've ever been in love? . . . Is that the kind of question you mean?" until Helen tells her she is like "a puppy that brings one's underclothes down into the hall" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 154). In turning over in her mind Richard Dalloway's smug picture of a world wholly contained by the tenets of the Conservative Party, she considers unity and continuity not as high-minded abstractions, but as applied, with enormous effort, to the concrete elements of her own experience: "How if one went back far enough, everything perhaps was intelligible; everything was in common; for the mammoths who pastured in the fields of Richmond High Street had turned into paving stones and boxes full of ribbon, and her aunts" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 67). Her naivety has the satiric effect of defamiliarizing ordinary situations, provoking wonder about what purposes they might serve and what realities they might veil. By the time she declares "I tell you, Helen, the world's bad. It's an agony, living, wanting—," she has established so much credibility that her tirade rips through the surface of the things people don't say with the force of prophecy (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 292). Perhaps the world <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> bad. Perhaps living and wanting <span style="font-style:italic;">are</span> only agony, with no fulfillment possible. At the close of the novel, various characters consider and do their best to dismiss these possibilities in the wake of her death.</p>
<p>The aesthetic capacity that allows Rachel to gesture at the ineffable also brings the most acute feminist critical perspectives into the novel. Her defamiliarizing gaze is not always directed at ultimates and universals. On the contrary, it often has the force of cultural criticism, and never more so than when she is learning or revealing the unspoken rules of gender division. When Richard Dalloway declaims about the wealth of possibilities in "the age we live in" and concludes, "But what about yourself?" she says, "You see, I'm a woman"—a demystifying remark indicating that his talk of possibilities applies to an audience other than his present one, although Dalloway characteristically <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  recognizes the assertion of difference only as a provocative reminder of sexuality (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 76). Her conversations with Terence similarly dwell on difference: his own well-lit, much-discussed tradition and future as opposed to "this curious silent unrepresented life" led by women throughout the history that ignores them (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 234). Terence is feminist inasmuch as he is passionately curious about this life, especially as led by Rachel, but her attitude toward it disconcerts him, indicating as it does a way of existing so at odds with his own that he infers "she would never care for one person rather than another; she was evidently quite indifferent to him." What she says is</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>"A girl is more lonely than a boy. No one cares in the least what she does. Nothing's expected of her. Unless one's very pretty people don't listen to what you say. . . . And that is what I like," she added energetically, as if the memory were very happy. "I like walking in Richmond Park and singing to myself and knowing it doesn't matter a damn to anybody. I like seeing things go on—as we saw you that night when you didn't see us—I love the freedom of it—it's like being the wind or the sea.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 236-7, Woolf's ellipses)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This speech shifts course abruptly when apparent pathos emerges as power. Without warning, Rachel suddenly displays the curious, silent, unrepresented life of women as a force undermining the priorities that Terence has accepted without question. Her maiden aunts, for example, strike her in the telling as "very real," and she describes them "building things up" so that "there's a sort of beauty in it. . . . so unconscious, so modest" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 235). Like Rezia Warren Smith or the retooled Clarissa in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, or like Mrs. Ramsay in <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span>, these women make art out of their restricted domestic spaces and concerns; the restriction essential to the art, a defining element of its form and harmony.</p>
<p>Thus in praising unknown women, Rachel voices a part of Woolf's own complex feminist position, perhaps most clearly set out in the famous passage of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One's Own</span> suggesting that Anon "was often a woman."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> The arts historically practiced by women were a by-product of women's historical subordination, just as Rachel's aesthetic development follows from Rachel's mediocre and thoroughly typical at-home education, which "did not teach anything, but. . . put no obstacle in the way of any real talent that the pupil might chance to have," so that "Rachel, being musical, was allowed to learn nothing but music . . ." (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 29). This account of the undemanding curriculum designed for girls destined to be gentlewomen recalls the contrast set out in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> between the self-discipline and altruism characterizing the male scientist and the chagrin of the narrator at her own unfocused home schooling (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 78). The important difference, in many respects the most obvious index of Woolf's own modernist turn, is that in the case of Rachel the gendered absence of academic standards and demands has a complex value, positive as well as negative. The mediocrity of her education paradoxically fosters the aesthetic capacity that gives her a more intense and ontologically valuable reality of her own at the same time as it gives her a privileged viewpoint on the manners and mores defining the new world of social interactions in which she finds herself. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Social Killings</h1>
<p>Yet as in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, the qualities of the feminine private sphere come into direct conflict with the power that installs and sustains them: not just male dominance, but in particular the dominance of masculine heterosexual desire. Such desire penetrates even into the ontologically privileged realm that Rachel sporadically occupies because it claims authority over how to interpret her experiences as a body. Especially because she is a woman and subject to exploitation, she cannot simply <span style="font-style:italic;">have</span> these experiences. She must classify and define them in ways that make them normal, communicable and bearers of unambiguous value, even if such translations inevitably misrepresent what she feels.</p>
<p>When she describes to Terence "what it's like—to be a young woman," she lists the subjects that have come to preoccupy her: "Women one sees in the streets," "Men kissing one," "Things one guesses at" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 236). As in the aftermath of Richard Dalloway's kiss, it is impossible for readers to discern whether these experiences are "terrors and agonies" in themselves, or whether they terrify and agonize because they are unexpected and unknown, "[t]hings one guesses at" as a consequence of overwhelming ignorance. Once again, the suggestion is that Rachel herself does not know. Her relationship to Terence promises her an opportunity to find out. But this relationship, which begins with striking examples of how both are unable to comprehend their own desires, turns quickly into an appropriation—society's appropriation of both of them into its categories of romance and engagement and then as a corollary, Terence's appropriation of Rachel in accordance with the rules of romance and engagement.</p>
<p>What is touching and promising about the initial connection between the young man and woman is that it does not conform to established categories that either of them recognizes. Terence first acknowledges that he has singled out Rachel when he wonders, "Did love begin in that way, with the wish to go on talking?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 198). Rachel's feeling for Terence is nothing <span style="font-style:italic;">but</span> physical sensation, characteristically unverbalized: "When she thought of their relationship she saw rather than reasoned, representing her view of what Terence felt by a picture of him drawn across the room to stand by her side. . . . but what it meant she did not know" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 248). Against the familiar typology of romance presented by pictures on piano music, descriptions in popular literature and the dampening example of the newly engaged, thoroughly ordinary Arthur and Susan, these beginnings suggest the possibility of a wholly different kind of heterosexual bond based on conversation and companionship (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 197; 247; 148-9). Rachel holds on to this possibility even when Terence has lapsed into the comfortable sentimentality of regarding them as "in love." "No!" she cries, "I never fell in love, if falling in love is what people say it is, and it's the world that tells the lies and I tell the truth. Oh, what lies—what lies!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 326)</p>
<p>Despite her objections, once their bond acquires a name, Rachel is translated completely into the idiom of social relations. The engagement goes public during a startling moment in which she is abased and displaced: first struck to the ground and "[r]olled this way and that," and then presented with a view of the "great heads" of her aunt <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and her lover kissing in the air above her—as Laura Marcus suggests, a sort of primal scene in which she is pushed back into infancy while the alternative couple become her parents.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> As in so many of the important moments in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, psychological conflicts here becomes literalized in officially playful acts of physical dominance:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>A hand dropped abrupt as iron on Rachel's shoulder; it might have been a bolt from heaven. She fell beneath it, and the grass whipped across her eyes and filled her mouth and ears. Through the waving stems she saw a re, large and shapeless against the sky. Helen was upon her.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 315)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The violence apparently disappears for Rachel when "she too realised Helen's soft body, the strong and hospitable arms," but as is often the case in Woolf's work, the maternal is also a menace. In particular, the sentence "Helen was upon her" anticipates the uneasy musings of another fragile and perceptive character, Septimus Warren Smith in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, who regards the threat to his freedom as coming from another ostensible caretaker, his doctor—"Holmes was on him"—and also from the vast conspiracy of what Rachel called human beings—"Human nature . . . was on him."<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> At this point, individual caretakers and society <span style="font-style:italic;">en masse</span> loom over Rachel. As in the story of Septimus, their idols are ultimately proportion and conversion. Helen comments after Richard Dalloway kisses Rachel, "Men will want to kiss you, just as they'll want to marry you. The pity is to get things out of proportion. It's like noticing the noises people make when they eat, or men spitting: or, in short, any small thing that gets one one's nerves" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 82). The examples of purportedly similar things one should not get "out of proportion" are themselves hilariously disproportionate—and from a category of vulgar and obnoxious behavior, an odd way to locate a first kiss. Helen's attempts to teach Rachel "how to be a reasonable person" seem aimed at denying that an experience should, or even can be momentous (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 85). The process that I have called translating Rachel into the idiom of established social relations might by another metaphor be a conversion to a belief in a particular system of meanings for experiences.</p>
<p>The jarring event of Helen's appropriation follows a dreamlike idyll in the jungle in which both lovers feel they are under water. It inaugurates a series of events establishing Rachel as beached on the shoals of the marriage plot, although she ts valiantly to return to her element. At one key moment she and Terence again literalize the combat of their newly acquired gender roles by playfully ting "for mastery" over whether, as he contends, she will throw him "into the sea" or whether she herself will be "flung into the sea, to be washed hither and thither, and driven about the roots of the world," an idea she finds "incoherently delightful" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 331). When he prevails, throwing her to the floor, she cries, "I'm a mermaid! I can swim . . . so the game's up" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 331). It appears that although she might dry and harden, she can never drown.</p>
<p>But Terence has already begun trying to alter her miraculous and monstrous abilities, criticizing her art and undertaking to revise her aesthetic understanding by replacing the "antiquated problems [sic.] plays" she favors with "poetry, poetry, poetry!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 325). Ironically, his own opinions take on a resemblance to someone like Thorvald Helmer <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  in that antiquated problem play <span style="font-style:italic;">A Doll's House</span>, in that he begins to assume that any accomplishment she displays should be for his ultimate benefit.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Irritated by the late Beethoven sonata she is practicing, he complains, "I've no objection to nice simple tunes—indeed, I find them very helpful to my literary composition, but that kind of thing is merely like an unfortunate old dog going round on its hind legs in the rain" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 324). In the midst of scenes of puppyish tussling, this remark is oddly resonant. It looks forward to his assessment of the "curiosity and sensitiveness of perception" that she can bestow on him, an assessment, however, that is joined to an aesthetic appreciation of her naivety: "What would experience give her after all, except a kind of ridiculous formal balance, like that of a drilled dog in the street?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 333). It also summons into textual memory Samuel Johnson's famous remark about a woman's preaching being "like a dog's walking on his hind legs. It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> Bringing Rachel "out" involves refashioning her into the sanctioned form of the helpmeet. In the process, it rules out her art.</p>
<p>Terence's discovery of what he loves in Rachel ironically foreshadows this development. In one of the most affecting moments of their eccentric courtship he arrives at a revelation: "'Oh, you're free!' he exclaimed, in exultation at the thought of her, "and I'd keep you free. We'd be free together" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 271). But <span style="font-style:italic;">keeping</span> someone else free is an oxymoron. The whole notion of keeping entails control. A keeper may not drill a dog to walk on its hind legs, but he makes sure the animals in his charge stay within bounds. More ominously, the scientist who desires to keep in specimen bottles the "monsters lying curled on the ridges of sand at the bottom of the sea" may be intent on preservation, but what is preserved will not be alive (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 16). In the case of the submarine creatures, in fact, they will never even reach the embalming stage. As Mr. Pepper earlier explained, they will explode if brought to the surface (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 16).</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> sets up its catastrophe very carefully. This catastrophe is in its own way as lurid and shocking as the catastrophe of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>. In both novels a young woman is annihilated, although in Robins's story it is unclear whether Bettina literally dies. In both novels, the annihilation is linked to a culturally-enforced denial of education and experience predicated on gender- and class-based definitions of the lady. But <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> refuses to provide the object lesson of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>. Robins's novel is clearly "Edwardian" in the sense Woolf described in "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown": it leaves the reader with such a sense of "incompleteness and dissatisfaction" that "it seems necessary to do something—to join a society, or, more desperately, to write a cheque" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CD</span>, 99). Needless to say, the society and the cheque are responses Robins actively solicited. Like the gallant and pathetic Evelyn Murgatroyd in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, she urgently wanted to "do something," with the difference that she was well informed about what, exactly, should be done and how one might go about doing it. She constructed her novel with the intention of reevaluating the education given to women of all classes, as well as exposing forced child prostitution and gaining widespread support for legislation against it.</p>
<p>In contrast, and against Evelyn (and in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, Elizabeth Robins), Rachel is committed to "playing"—which is to say art and aesthetic experience, the stuff of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  what Woolf would later call vision. Her own entrance into the region of sexual desire has positive potential, signaled by the strength of her physical responses and her resistance to routinizing these responses into the banal formulations of social interaction. In this respect, her erotic awakening is like hearing or playing music, or perceiving suddenly the unanalyzable being of a tree. It is unlike aesthetic experience, however, in portending consequences in the public sphere. As in the case of Richard Dalloway's kiss, rather than being allowed to "think about it all day and all night until [she finds] out exactly what it does mean," Rachel must yield her sexuality to a public system of signification in which female desire ultimately translates into being kept or being conquered (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 81-2).</p>
<p>This tension between the experiences of sexual life and their social implications sets up the extraordinary account of Rachel's dying. Three motifs re-emerge with particular force in the part of the last chapters focalized through Rachel's consciousness—or more often, through Rachel's unconscious.</p>
<p>First, the metaphor of the underwater creature—mermaid or monster—returns to suggest that when Rachel falls into a coma she returns to the element from which she has been pulled. In a new version of the dream she had after Richard Dalloway kissed her, the oozing, dripping tunnel through which she passes is under the Thames, and eventually she escapes the requirement of attention to events outside herself and the pursuit of her "tormenters" by falling into "a deep pool of sticky water" where she lies, "not dead, but curled up at the bottom of the sea" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 368, 378). As she approaches death, however, she suffers the fate of the white hairless blind monsters taken as specimens and floats limply "to the surface of the dark, sticky pool" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 385-6). Her return to consciousness signals to her doctor that she has little hope of survival.</p>
<p>Second, the menace that Rachel apprehends becomes in these chapters more feminine than masculine. Instead of "the little deformed man who squatted on the floor gibbering" of her first dream, there are "little deformed women sitting in archways playing cards" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 78, 368). When Terence later kisses her "she only [sees] an old woman slicing a man's head off with a knife" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 376). These images transform earlier psychic material, working not only on the dream of "barbarian men" but also on subsequent events of her life in Santa Marina. The deformed woman is most obviously the nurse who plays cards by her bed. During the church service in which she repudiated any religious belief, Rachel judged this woman "slavishly acquiescent" and engaged in "adoring something shallow and smug," qualities that in her mind come to epitomize the role of respectable women in British culture (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 253). The banality of the letters of congratulation she must answer—and does answer, finding herself using virtually the same formulaic phrases—intimates that with her engagement she has been swept into the world of female civility, in which women in myriad ways ease social interactions. Terence, the self-proclaimed writer of the couple, regards such compositions as her exclusive duty.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> The hallucination of decapitation recalls the scene Rachel viewed from a hotel window of an old female servant cutting off the head of a chicken. The metamorphosis, and the image of the woman rather than the man as executor (and implicit castrator), suggest that she fears her own ferocity in the sex war that her social <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  experiences reveal to be the underside of heterosexual bonds. This image of aggression, like the dream of barbarian men harassing her, comes in response to a kiss. Still further, the multiple images of female violence suggest that her own sexual desires are a source of revulsion because they have betrayed her into the social world where she is pursued and tormented. And of course the old women, especially, suggest a second betrayal by the mother (the first betrayal was her mother's death), and perhaps also a betrayal by the primary object of her desire. Helen has been adept in turning Rachel's newly awakened affection toward heterosexual objects, including wildly inappropriate ones: at one point she solicits the socially maladroit, arguably homosexual St.-John Hirst to teach Rachel "the facts of life. . . . What really goes on, what people feel, although they generally try to hide it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 174). The terrifying or repellent res of women in Rachel's hallucinations signal a self-loathing and a mistrust of the maternal within the amniotic environment of the "sticky pool."</p>
<p>Third, the idea of chastity acquires new prominence. Rachel becomes ill when Terence is reading aloud to her from Milton's <span style="font-style:italic;">Comus</span>, a masque about the attempted violation of a Platonically inclined Lady. Moreover, Rachel acknowledges her headache at the point where the goddess Sabrina is invoked to "Listen and save!" the Lady whose virginity the pagan god has menaced.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> Sabrina, the <span style="font-style:italic;">genius loci</span> of the Severn River and herself a virgin, is another version of salvation (perhaps <span style="font-style:italic;">as</span> death) by water, as well as being a female and vaguely maternal refuge. When Rachel moves from <span style="font-style:italic;">Comus</span> to coma, she thus brings together a group of ideas not only about male sexual conquest, but also about female suicide. And in this context chastity becomes an issue to Rachel herself, and many of her concerns begin to resemble those of Bettina and the narrator in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> Robins separated female eroticism from female achievement and service in the public sphere. Following through the logic that gradually emerges during the course of the story, Bettina's sister implicitly decides that autonomy and activism cannot be reconciled with the model of romance offered by her suitor. Her realization that love seems inevitably to entail dependency for the woman comes through a play on the idea of "need." As the two girls travel to London to stay with their ostensible aunt, the narrator confides to Bettina what she regards as a devastating truth about gender relations: "We don't only care more than men do . . . . We <span style="font-style:italic;">need</span> men more than they need us" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 226). Her discovery is based on the observation that men's lives are full of interests and responsibilities, whereas women's lives are full of men. After Bettina's disappearance, however, the narrator revises her opinion to accommodate what seems a far more horrible truth. "So I had seen 'the need' wrong," she realizes. "The lamp of a young girl's hope, held up in her little world, to help her find a mate—that light was pale beside the red glare of this fierce demand from men" (<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 298). In this account, female desire is not only weaker than, but also different in kind from male desire. The narrator's conclusion moves the fictional universe close to the tenets of the late nineteenth-century Social Purity movement, making the "red glare" of male sexual needs so strong as to be uncontrollable. Men "need" women more; thus they take and use them. The narrator's culminating burst <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of imagery to describe what she imagines has happened to her sister suggests how committed she has become to an anti-(hetero)sexuality, in which penetration is painful and so toxic as to cause death:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>When I was not delirious, the reason I lay still was sometimes half a nightmare reason; a feeling that the muffled night-sounds were like the bees at home in the rhododendron, drumming softly so long as we sat still. The moment we rose up, the bees rose too, with angry commotion, ready to fly in our faces and sting. Just so with that muted hum of London. If I were not very still, if I were to rise and venture out, all the stinging, angry noises would rise, too, and overwhelm me.</p>
<p>And out there in the heart of the swarm, Bettina. Being stung and stung, till feeling died.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">MLS</span>, 302-3)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Rachel does not "need" men in the sense the narrator of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> initially means. Terence both fears and admires the way she seems to depend far less on him than he does on her: in her "impersonality" as she plays piano, and in her apparent capacity to "cut herself adrift from him, and to pass away to unknown places where she had no need of him" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 323, 336). But in acquiring the status of fiancée, Rachel also moves into the realm where like the Lady in <span style="font-style:italic;">Comus</span> she requires saving from his need—not, however, his sexual desire, but the desires that arise from his position in the social system, desires that seem ordained to violate the purity of her solitary, unverbalized experiences. In this way the notion of rape is finally articulated in the novel, not as the real issue cloaked by gendered euphemisms ("the lamp of a young girl's hope . . . to find a mate") but on the contrary, as a <span style="font-style:italic;">re</span> for the act of cooptation that threatens to disperse Rachel's aesthetic integrity into the various and banal duties and identities that attach to the dependent wife.</p>
<p>What Rachel needs is a body detached from social consequences and left in the realm of the purely physical. In an essay on Woolf's middle-period novels I called the representation of such protected corporeality the "visionary body."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, we see how the heterosexual romance plot puts the experiencing body of a young woman at enormous social risk. In this first novel only illness can give Rachel this purely physical body—through the irony of trumping social consequences by providing instead the alternative of dying. Visualizing the "glassy, cool, translucent wave" that <span style="font-style:italic;">Comus</span> has presented as an escape for the beleaguered Lady, she finds "[s]he was completely cut off, and unable to communicate with the rest of the world, isolated alone with her body" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 366). In a 1926 essay, "On Being Ill," Woolf treated illness as a privileged site of both physical experience and impenetrability. In this essay she identified illness as another ineffable experience, uncannily like the moments of being and sharing with the visionary a resistance to everyday language: the patient "is forced to coin words himself, and, taking his pain in one hand, and a lump of pure sound in the other . . . so to crush them together that a brand new word in the end drops out."<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> On the overt level of plot, Rachel's illness is purely contingent, something picked up in the tropical climate and probably linked to the walk she and Terence took in the jungle, when they became engaged. In terms of the narrative logic, however, the disease is a consequence <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of the move into sociality culminating in the engagement.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> It is the redemptive mode in which Rachel's inviolability and integrity are preserved. Its <span style="font-style:italic;">reductio ad absurdum</span> is death, which preserves these qualities forever.</p>
<p>Rachel's death thus raises the disturbing question of whether there is any role or adult position in life that Rachel could occupy within the social world without sacrificing her own identity and aesthetic capacities. The question may have pressed on Woolf herself, who, as she was beginning the book, wrote to a friend about her own attachment to a noumenal, ineffable realm: "My present feeling is that this vague and dream like world, without love, or heart, or passion, or sex, is the world I really care about, and find interesting. For, although they are dreams to you, and I cant express them at all adequately, these things are perfectly real to me."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> During the eight-year period she was composing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, she turned from her close relationships with women to experiments with several kinds of courtship and several kinds of men, married Leonard Woolf, and entered a period of mental illness in which she attempted suicide.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span> draft shows that the emphasis on growing up and socialization as itself a tragedy came into the narrative quite late. In the earlier version Terence is far less overbearing and Rachel more receptive; the illness is not coded as redemptive; and Rachel remembers "that she ought to t something" even when she is dying.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> In the published version, on the contrary, "[s]he did not wish to remember; it troubled her when people tried to disturb her loneliness; she wished to be alone" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 385-86).</p>
<p>The conclusion—of Rachel and of the novel—is correspondingly more radical than the conclusion of Bettina in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>. Far from surrounding Bettina's disappearance with a haze of inevitability, Robins maintains in <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span> that the tragedy could and should have been prevented. In the process, of course, she enlarges male "need" into a conspiratorial force that finally seems to contaminate any act of heterosexual penetration, so that the viable alternative for women appears to be celibacy.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, however, it is difficult to see that Rachel has any alternatives to dying. While the last two chapters juxtapose the contingency and horror of her death with various characters' inadequate efforts to find reasons or purposes for it, there is a larger sense in which death is the necessary ending to her story. Rachel cannot become an adult and a wife without ceasing to be Rachel. Woolf's first novel implies the unsettling conclusion that for a young woman a "real" or "visionary" mode of being cannot survive social incarnation.</p>
<p>In a relatively early scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, Rachel chooses to read a "modern book" "such as Mrs. Ambrose detested, whose purpose was to distribute the guilt of a woman's downfall upon the right shoulders, a purpose which was achieved, if the reader's discomfort were any proof of it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 131). This uncomfortable fiction might well be Elizabeth Robins's <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>, a late example of the "incomplete" sort of work that irritates the reader into joining a society or writing a cheque. But <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> itself is about a woman's downfall. It does not distribute the guilt anywhere in particular, providing instead a range of complicated social, environmental and perhaps even developmental reasons—some clearly mutually exclusive—for the death of a young woman. Although it is the first novel in Woolf's <span style="font-style:italic;">oeuvre</span>, and frequently termed "Victorian" <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  or "realist" in the relative traditionalism of its narrative technique, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> does not use its third-person narrator to articulate political (including feminist) <span style="font-style:italic;">positions</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">opinions</span>—although as numerous writers on Woolf have pointed out, all the novels have important political and especially feminist <span style="font-style:italic;">themes</span>. Rather, it produces effects of political and ethical questioning, qualification, revision, indecision and indeterminacy. The ambiguities of affect and judgment that I describe here became even more marked in Woolf's later novels, starting with <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> and taking especially extreme forms in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waves, The Years</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span>.</p>
<p>The ambiguities of feeling and value that Woolf created in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> show up vividly against the example of its near-contemporary <span style="font-style:italic;">My Little Sister</span>. Robins's novel not only directs readers' sympathies but obviously tries to arouse outrage at the masculinist exploitation of women in all the different classes of society. In contrast, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> seems in many ways to be <span style="font-style:italic;">about</span> tonal ambiguity: about not knowing how to feel, speak, act and interpret a world that in many respects seems to require learners to begin from scratch. Rachel thus embodies the reader, who has no explicit indication of how to "take" the dreams, Richard Dalloway's kiss, the scenes in the jungle and the village, and her final catastrophic illness. Her immediate, untranslated, and by implication untranslatable, experience prompts both wonder and criticism, evading ready-made categories that entail ready-made feelings and assessments.</p>
<p>But as I intimated at the beginning of this essay, the comparison between Robins's and Woolf's novels also has another and contrary effect. It reminds us why chroniclers of "a woman's downfall" might want to assign guilt, producing perhaps not only discomfort but also enlightenment and action. Seeing the tradition of the feminist polemical novel as one of her early influences allows us to indicate more precisely what Virginia Woolf turned away <span style="font-style:italic;">from</span> in her modernist turn. It also affirms that insofar as modernist innovation is a continuation as well as a reaction, Woolf's novels took on themes and criticisms pioneered by female writers of the maternal generation. Elizabeth Robins, both nemesis and progenitor of Virginia Woolf, provided subject matter and examples of audacity that Woolf could appropriate and complicate.</p>

Reviewing the novel <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dark Lantern</span>, the young Virginia Stephen wrote (revealingly), "It explains how you fall in love with your doctor, if you have a rest cure.

Robins, who had been a friend of Virginia's mother, became a neighbor in Sussex, and the Hogarth Press published one of her memoirs. At that time Virginia described her as "a great curse to me" with "her infinitely intense, exacting, persnickety demands" and reported later that "L[eonard] was riddled &amp; needled by Miss Robins for 2 hours (<span style="font-style:italic;">Diary</span>, 5: 21, 5: 278).

"Most women" was a characteristically precise bit of wording.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f8" href="#f8-text">8. </a>Farfan notes that Robins's performance style in defining roles as Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and Hilda Wangel in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Master Builder</span> were avant-garde moments that transformed theatrical tradition while at the same time Robins made use of traditional melodramatic conventions combined with Victorian traditions of moralizing (11-33). As a theatrical performer too, then, Robins was paradoxically both traditional and modernist.

<p class="display">The Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen was one of the most important formative influences on the polemical feminist novel in Great Britain. Ibsen's particular modernity, as Martin Püchner observes, derived from challenging a tradition of stylized actions with a bleak, corrosive naturalism. (Introduction, <span style="font-style:italic;">Six Plays By Henrik Ibsen</span>, trans. William Archer [New York: Barnes and Noble Classics, 2003], xii-xiv). This turn in the European theater to what theorists of the novel would regard as a mode of realism led to a radical change in modes of dramaturgy and performance. Productions of Ibsen's plays in London and provincial theaters inspired national debates on feminist subjects like "Is Marriage a Failure?" (Mona Caird, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Westminster Review</span> 1888, cited in Elaine Showalter, <span style="font-style:italic;">Sexual Anarchy: Gender and Culture at the Fin de Siécle</span> [Harmondworth: Penguin, 1991], 39). Furthermore, Ibsen's theatrical innovations inspired a generation of feminists to write not only polemical plays but also polemical novels with the Ibsenesque project of unmasking bourgeois hypocrisies about the roles and status of middle-class and sometimes also working-class women.</p><p class="display">One irony of this story of influence is that, as Farfan notes, Ibsen himself was no feminist, and in fact had little interest in any of the social movements that based arguments on characters and events <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  in his plays . Yet not only feminists but also democratic socialists like Bernard Shaw saw in Ibsen's exposés of the bourgeois family and its role in hiding problems from blackmail to syphilis a call for fundamental social change. Among British intellectuals and activists, "Ibsenism" became a political philosophy (Bernard Shaw, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Quintessence of Ibsenism</span> [New York: Hill and Wang, 1966]).</p><p class="display">One reason Ibsen was so important for novel writing, at least in Great Britain, was that he brought previously private concerns into the public arena of the theater. While novels had during the course of the nineteenth century opened the private family house to the attention of a widespread readership, novel readers are by definition solitary, and the novel is historically centered more on individual agency than on collective conditions and actions. Ibsenesque political theater, however, combined naturalism with elements of melodrama to incite organization and collective action, using realist staging and performance to enact possibilities for intervening in the public sphere. The political novels inspired both by Ibsen's plays and by British plays taking Ibsen's work as models similarly combined empathic elements, notably features of the sentimental tradition, with a brutal naturalist representation of oppression and exploitation at all levels of society.</p></p></div>

Louise DeSalvo (New York: New York Public Library, 1982). DeSalvo notes that in a 1909 letter to her brother-in-law Clive Bell, Virginia Stephen defended what Bell had seen as her tendency to be "didactic, 'not to say priggish. . . . My boldness terrifies me'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span>, xxiii). That such "boldness" was transformed in subsequent revisions into something quite different, a multiplication of affective and evaluative possibilities, does not necessarily entail that this innovative narrative strategy was motivated by timidity.</p></div>

Interestingly, Farfan shows that Robins eventually criticized Ibsen for his lack of tonal cues, which she associated with feminist emphasis as well as other sorts of ethical and political evaluation: he was "not so much profound in his judgements of women as vivid in his powers of transferring materials for judgement to the mimic scene" ("Some Aspects of Henrik Ibsen," Lecture at the Philosophical Institute of Edinburgh, 1908 [Typescript Elizabeth Robins Papers, Fales Library, New York University], quoted in Farfan, 21).</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f13" href="#f13-text">13. </a>The idea that Woolf's revisions constitute self-censorship has been set out most directly by Louise DeSalvo in <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf: The Impact of Childhood Sexual Abuse on Her Life and Work</span> (Boston: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Beacon, 1989), but many Woolf critics bring in passages from <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span> (and drafts of other novels) as if these versions constituted an archive of submerged intentions or a somehow "more real" version of the politics and ethics in the novel that Woolf chose to publish. An interesting exception is Christine Froula's <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Avant-Garde: War, Civilization, Modernity</span> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2005), which treats the published drafts and the original published text of each work as though they constituted one large and varied text. See especially Chapter Two, "Rachel's Great War: Civilization, sacrifice, and the Enlightenment of Women in <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>": 34-84. The status of manuscript drafts is one of the most interesting—and the least theorized—elements of modernist studies today.</p></div>

Although the mother refuses to speak about what happened, the colonial setting and conventionally "savage" metaphors ("there are worse than tigers in the world's jungle," 114), suggest the danger of the colonizer who has gone native or perhaps of the native himself: a further irony, of course, because the conclusion of the narrative reveals that some of the most eminent Englishmen are the sponsors of kidnapping and sexual slavery.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f28" href="#f28-text">28. </a>Readings dealing with the many instances of lesbian eroticism in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> often present this account of the kiss and its aftermath as evidence of a primary sexual identity for Rachel, reading her attitude toward Dalloway's kiss as fundamentally one of repulsion. This essay acknowledges the many homoeroticisms of the novel, especially between Rachel and Helen, but finds the notion of any specified sexual identity problematic both because of the absence of clear tonal cues and because, as I go on to develop, such notions of identity constitute a narrowing and hardening antithetical to Rachel's creativity. Among lesbian readings, see especially Patricia Morgne Cramer, "Trauma and Lesbian Returns in Virginia Woolf's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf and Trauma: Embodied Texts</span>, ed.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f29" href="#f29-text">29. </a>(<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 81-2); In the printed version of a <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span> draft, a much more self-possessed and articulate Rachel explains to Helen, "I felt he could do what he chose with me. . . . It takes one back to pre-historic times" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span>, 63). The voiced explanation is banal—perhaps necessarily so, given the way it limits the complexity of possible responses. Woolf decided very late in the long process of writing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span> to conjoin Rachel's feminist knowledge to an emphasis on the ineffability of Rachel's aesthetic and metaphysical insights. The latter emphasis, distinctively modernist, adds a radically new dimension to the story of a young girl's education and destruction.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f38" href="#f38-text">38. </a>(<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 326, 328); Once the two are engaged, Evelyn Murgatroyd (who remains confusedly but stubbornly single) conflates them in her mind with the bovine Susan and Arthur: "Although they were so different, she thought that she could see in each the same look of satisfaction and completion, the same calmness of manner, and the same slowness of movement. It was that slowness, that confidence, that content which she hated. . . . but the real things were surely the things that happened, the causes, the wars, the ideals, which happened in the great world outside, and went on independently of these women, turning so quietly and beautifully towards the men" (<span style="font-style:italic;">VO</span>, 357). Evelyn voices an opinion congenial to Robins's novels, and in accord with certain parts of Woolf's own polemical essays. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, however, her position is compromised, in that the "real things" that Rachel understands are of a very different ontological order, residing in the noumenal rather than either public or private <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  worlds. The character of Evelyn is complicated and fascinating because she embodies in part values that Woolf endorsed in part. She is more like the earlier Rachel of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span> drafts, who was significantly more self-possessed and critical than Rachel in The Voyage Out. Evelyn's desire to "do something" and her commitment to (inchoate) public activism are treated ironically—for example, usually aligned with Evelyn's forthright approaches to, and then boredom with, various suitors. Yet the degree of irony fluctuates with Evelyn's various appearances.</p></div>
