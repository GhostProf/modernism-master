<p id="lead">Sometime around 1877, while beginning work on what would become the opera <i>Parsifal</i>, Richard Wagner was sent an anonymous pamphlet attributed to a "significant Jewish voice." The pamphlet prophesied the inevitable victory of "the modern world" over the old, "orthodox" one, in spite of the power and elegant rhetoric of conservative forces: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Modern journalism and Romanticism have utterly conquered the freethinking Jewish and Christian worlds. I include the freethinking Jewish world &#x2013; for in fact German Jewry is working so forcefully, so colossally, and so tirelessly on the new culture and science that, consciously or unconsciously, the majority of Christendom is being led by Jews.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Wagner could not agree more ("How true!"), and quoted the pamphlet at the opening of his vociferous and explicitly antisemitic attack on "the new culture" (not yet called "modernism").<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  His salty attack itself had the concise and apt title "Modern," and in it he reiterated and condensed opinions he had long expressed: "Modern" was fleeting and arbitrary, moved by whimsy rather than deep necessity, linked to "<i>Mode</i>" (fashion), to the base manifestations of the new materialist civilization, to France and to the Jews&#x2014;and hence foreign both to the German spirit and to art itself.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Wagner's radical artistic program rejected the modern present even as it shared modern culture's rejection of traditionalism&#x2014;but instead of "the modern," Wagner spoke of revolution and the future.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>   </p>

<p>It is not my intention to rehash the debates among latter-day Wagnerites and their detractors concerning the degree and importance 

<b></b>

 of the composer's antisemitism and its relationship to his art. Still, the most extreme of these defenses&#x2014;arguing either that Wagner's statements on Jews and culture were not particularly hateful, or were simply consistent with ideas current when he was writing&#x2014;miss the centrality of the re of the Jew in the edifice of Wagner's rhetoric on the art of the future.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Whatever he might have felt about real, existing Jews (his antipathy toward his rival Meyerbeer notwithstanding), the absence and/or presence of "Jews" is key to the structure of Wagner's arguments about the value of this or the other art, and the historical trajectory of art.  </p>

<p>I want to suggest that it is not for nothing that this early formulation of antisemitic antimodernism agrees so readily with its concurrent philosemitic modernist triumphalist counterpart. Both depend on a story of emancipation-assimilation-integration where presence immediately becomes omnipresence, and participation becomes hegemony (of a surreptitious kind), leading to the emergence of modernism. But this emergence is not as linear as it sounds. To return to the passage quoted above, the Jews are won over to or "conquered" by the modern, the triumph of which constitutes the illicit conquest of the German Christian population by the Jews. A bracketed phrase betrays that this conquest is especially nefarious because the vanquished are not even aware it has happened; neither, it seems, are the victors. To demonstrate this invisible truth, the writer points out that hardly a newspaper or other publication is produced in Germany that is not "directly or indirectly" in Jewish hands. The philosemitic and pro-modernist argument is in this case (as in others) dependent on the twin premises that modernism is Jewish, and yet that modernism's Jewishness is somehow hidden and needs to be revealed. A recurring strategy for making this invisible Jewishness visible again concerns what seems to be a dialectic of Jewish presence/absence, by posing a counter-factual or counter-historical hypothesis: suppose Jews were absent from modern culture? How would it look then? Wagner pursues this precise tactic. In "Judaism in Music" he had already made a claim both for the total "jewification" of modern art (employing the unlikely and repugnant term "<i>Verj&#x00FC;dung</i>" that the Nazis would make familiar a three-quarter century later), and that "the Jews have not produced a single true poet."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Without Jews, the modern culture industry, as Wagner understood it in his own time, would vanish, or transform itself completely; art, on the other hand, would be unaffected. So in this incipient instance of modern German cultural antisemitism&#x2014;an only half racialist Jew-baiting with one foot in the illustrious past, one in the formidable future of Christian German Jew-hatred&#x2014;and in this attack on Franco-Jewish modernism <i>avant la lettre</i>, a rhetorical strategy emerges that will come into its own after Wagner's death. This rhetoric poses the questions: You want to know how the Jews have spoiled the modern world? What's Jewish about <i>die Moderne</i>?<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  What's wrong with the Jewish Modern? And responds: Take them away and you'll see! </p>

<p>There are reasons for me to begin my contribution to a special issue looking back at "Jewish modernism" with this reminder of the moment where Wagner anticipated it; of course, as I pointed out above, in his own view he was diagnosing the present, and dreaming of a different future. The object to be traced here is specific to German-speaking central Europe, and it is a re that has been particularly powerful 

<b></b>

 there, although significant aspects of the re will be more broadly familiar. I call this <i>j&#x00FC;dische Moderne</i> or Jewish Modern a re and expressly avoid discussing it as a catalogue of authors or works. To think of "Jewish modernism" in a topical way, as though there were a specific corpus or prescriptive formal definition captured by the term, seems futile at best (if not ominous). There can be no literary history of Jewish modernism. Perhaps, though, there is a history to be told about a discourse on Jewish modernism in German-speaking central Europe. Even that discourse is not singular, prescriptive, or consistent, but may perhaps better be characterized by its operation than by its contents. If this is the case, then our question cannot be what is or was Jewish modernism, but what work does and did the re "Jewish modernism" do for its users. This is not to warn contributors and readers of this special issue that to invoke this re is to play with fire, but rather to consider ways in which one might "think with" Jewish modernism, engage it on the multiple levels on which it has functioned, without being swept in its tide. If, as in the Wagnerian example, Jewish modernism is a complex field of self-contradictory tensions and inversions, its story cannot simply be narrated, but can perhaps best be captured by representing a constellation of moments in its elastic life.  </p>

<p>"Modernism Without Jews" borrows from another title familiar to German and Jewish studies readers. Hugo Bettauer's 1922 novel and the generally faithful 1924 Hans Karl Breslauer film adaptation were both called <i>Die Stadt ohne Juden</i> ("The City Without Jews.") <sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Bettauer was born to a Jewish family as Maximilian Hugo Bettauer, but was a convert and a Protestant, although his real faith was in progressive secular rationalism; he was a publicist, journalist, and writer of a score of rapidly published popular novels, the best-selling of which was to be <i>The City Without Jews</i>. His writing, in other words, was a prime example of the burgeoning popular culture industry in the era of the Weimar Republic. Bettauer's easy-reading tale is set in the not-so-distant future (its subtitle in German is "a novel from the day after tomorrow"), and it is clearly a light-hearted satire rather than the warning-toll of catastrophe that it has been made out to be. <i>TheCity Without Jews </i>bases itself on the premise, meant to be somewhat absurd, that in a time of financial and cultural crisis not unlike the mid-1920s, the parliament of Austria passes a measure expelling the country's Jews. A unifying melodrama involving the separation of the young Jewish hero Leo Strakosch from his gentile beloved and his maneuvers to reverse the order ties together a series of scenes displaying the cultural anarchy the absence of Jews in Vienna unleashes: we witness the anarchic collapse of the stock market and of consumer culture, among other hallmarks of modern life. Strakosch, meanwhile, moving through Vienna in disguise as the bearded Frenchman Henry Dufresne, puts out a series of pamphlets calling for the reversal of the expulsion and signed by the "League of Truthful Christians," leading to a parliamentary vote on repeal, which he ingeniously rigs, and the Jews are welcomed back into the city. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>There are several ways in which we may see Wagner's text and Bettauer's (and Breslauer's film even more starkly) as bookends of "German-Jewish modernism." Once again, this term cannot refer to a particular kind of modern culture that is Jewish, but rather a complex discourse linking an origin of authorship to 'the modern' in a network of self-contradictory but compelling ways. These bookends reflect one another in an apparently inverted way&#x2014;but inversion seems to be integral to the discourse I am describing. Just as Wagner was able to introduce the essay "Modern" with a (presumed) philosemitic text understood to be by a Jew, Bettauer/Breslauer's enlightened texts conjure the utopian fantasy of Jewish absence in order to refute antisemitism. As with all inversions, elements remain intact and often enough identical in both versions: today's viewers of Breslauer's film will be struck by the persistence of horrific antisemitic stereotypical caricatures throughout, which is the case in the book as well; a simple analysis of character types in the film shows that the rudest portrayals and greatest number of such portrayals are of Jews, while the pan-German antisemites and others are represented at worst as a bit dim. Granted, the young Jew Strakosch is a romantic hero, but one who vanquishes the antisemites at the price of proving their central theses: there is a Jewish conspiracy, and modernity is in the hands of the Jews. He slips back into Austria in disguise, passing as a Christian. Another inverted twin of this film, Hippler's Nazi propaganda feature <i>The Eternal Jew</i> , employs passing as a primary trope in persuading the audience of the invisible, infiltrating, alien presence. A famous dissolve sequence, from the faces of a group of bearded Polish Jewish men in kaftans to the same men groomed as "Westerners," dissolving then to a cocktail party of cultivated Berlin Jews, gives visual form to the conflicting notions of Jewish passing and essential difference, ineradicable separateness and total infiltration and saturation.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In <i>The City Without Jews</i>, Leo Strakosch reveals himself in a scene that inverts Hippler's dissolve. At the moment the ban on Jews is lifted, he tells the story of how he has been responsible for this happy turn of events, all the while clipping and shaving the beard of his Christian-French alter-ego and revealing himself to be the "handsome, smooth-faced" young hero.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Of course, one could protest, the inversion is meant to reverse the meaning of the antisemitic narrative, but this example shows how in spite of these admitted intentions, the inversion "proves the rule": the Jew has passed and has infiltrated, he has used the sham popular mechanisms of democracy to further his own ends, and he has done so through deception and dissimulation&#x2014;and his primary personal motive, after all, is the desire for an "Aryan" woman.  </p>

<p><i>The City Without Jews</i> seems not to be able to help but compulsively name and confirm every tenet of anti-modernist antisemitism. An interesting case of this involves the propaganda surrounding the film's distribution, where great efforts were made to mark the film as a vehicle of enlightened anti-antisemitism that was coming from rational German Christians. Bettauer's and the film's antisemitic opponents naturally aimed first to expose the fact that this was really a propaganda piece generated by a Jewish culture industry, and they did not have to scratch the surface of the production very hard to find more than a few participants who were Jewish according to their own criteria (not least, of course, Bettauer himself). Interestingly, though, this drama is inscribed 

<b></b>

 in the book and film themselves, with the question of pseudepigraphy embodied in the propaganda leaflets "signed" by the non-existent organization "League of Truthful Christians," which the audience/readers know is neither a league, nor truthful, nor Christian, but the fabrication of a single, lying Jew.  </p>

<p>Even more than with other works, today one cannot write about <i>The City Without Jews</i> without placing it within a dense historical context that foregrounds its afterlife, and confounds where else it might be placed in relation to its own past, present, and future. Its eccentric fantasy of the elimination of Jews from a central European country&#x2014;the absurdity of the thesis in its time is impossible for us to reproduce&#x2014;must seem to every contemporary reader/viewer a shockingly frank prophesy of the Nazi final solution, rather than an "amusing" satire of the Austrian Christian Social past and contemporary pan-German antisemitic rhetoric.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Within two years of the release of the film, Hugo Bettauer was to be murdered in his own office by a fanatic with Nazi ties, making the link of the 1922 text and its author to the Nazi violence of the future impossible for latter-day readers to disaggregate. Recall, too, that Bettauer's subtitle was "a novel from the day after tomorrow," although the English translation of a few years later changed the subtitle to "a novel of our times." For the American public of 1926, the author of satirical future fantasy has become "first and last a realist, an accurate and astute observer."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  The film's "rediscovery" and reconstruction in 1991 was the object of an extremely heavy investment of effort led by the Filmarchiv Austria and leading to the publication of a 487-page documentation volume accompanying the release of the digitally restored and reconstructed film, making this relatively minor production among the most documented German-language films from the interwar period, the powerful scholarly interest in Weimar film history notwithstanding.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>   </p>

<p>While the "discovery" of the film has produced a flurry of culture studies interest in the early twenty-first century, the example of Hugo Bettauer has long been seen to offer a dense case study of the complex of Jewishness/Jewish self-hatred/antisemitism in relation to modernism/modernization/modernity. "The Bettauer Case" was in fact the title of one scholar's attempt at synthesizing Hugo Bettauer's biography, historical contexts, and literary texts. Ironically but significantly, a lead article of the same title graced the front pages of the antisemitic bi-weekly <i>Der Weltkampf</i> (<i>World struggle</i>) by the journal's editor, no less an ideologue of the Nazi movement than Alfred Rosenberg.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The propagandist and the scholar share more than a title, though. They both find Bettauer of interest as a symptom of his time (just as retrospective observers would call the <i>City Without Jews</i> a <i>Zeitdokument</i> or documentation of its time)<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> . Bettauer was not only a prolific writer of popular fiction, he was also a tireless publicist for sexual enlightenment, and editor of a publication designed to popularize freethinking and open discussion of issues regarding sexuality entitled <i>Him and Her</i>.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  He was an outspoken campaigner for the decriminalization of homosexuality, and pushed the envelope of censors by testing the boundaries of permissible publication of erotica. All this led to a widely publicized indecency case, itself a product of the cultural politics of the Austrian battle between progressive socialists and antisemitic Christian Socials. Bettauer's assassination by a right-wing dental student in 1925 was clearly a result of 

<b></b>

 this sort of sensation, but the trial of the murderer became no less a sensation; like so many fanatic right-wing murderers of Weimar Germany, Otto Rothstock got off with a remarkably light sentence, hailed by many on the right as a moral hero. "The Bettauer Case" hence refers to an immensely ramified exemplar that includes these two sensational court cases, played out in public with richly overdetermined meanings. The articulation and interpretation of these strands of meaning is an objective shared to a remarkable extent by the two "Bettauer case" texts, one Nazi and one German studies. Both concern themselves with the network of "new" mass culture texts, including pulp novellas, popular sex education, erotica, scandal, and sensation. For both critics, this was a modernity infused and obsessed with Jewishness. </p>

<p>The epigraph to the Filmarchiv Austria documentation volume is a one-page condensation of a 1956 article by Harry Zohn, called "The City Without Jews," recalling Bettauer's "strangely prophetic book from the year 1922, a sort of inverted utopia describing Vienna without Jews and the subsequent collapse of the economic and cultural life of the city." Zohn goes on to ruminate on present-day  Vienna, the relatively peripheral if not fully non-existent Jewish population of the city, and attribution of the "provincialism of daily life, the brutalization of taste, the reduction of cosmopolitanism of the city" to the decimation of its Jewish population.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Steven Beller's 1989 <i>Vienna and the Jews</i>, a chief history of the Jewish cultural presence in Vienna in the period of high modernism, cites the same source, using the same strategy: also deploying the term "prophetic" to describe the 1924 novel, he summarizes Bettauer's fantasy of a city stripped of contemporary popular culture (but not the opera), essentially stagnant and uneventful, and determines that, "for anyone who has been to Vienna in the 1980s, there are remarkable similarities between what Bettauer foresaw and what the present city is like..."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Bettauer is an apt introduction to Beller's book, certainly, since it is no exaggeration to reduce Beller's thesis to the crudest reading of <i>The City Without Jews</i>: Viennese modernism was/is Jewish, whether it was/is visible or not (and mostly, it seems, it was). The awkward similarity of this central thesis to the central thesis of the modernists' contemporary antisemitic critics is not lost on Beller, but he does nothing to suggest what we are to do with this similarity, or to account for the recurrence of this pattern in any way.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The resemblance has been taken more seriously by other readers. Sir Ernst Gombrich, invited by the Austrian Cultural Institute to contribute to a 1996 seminar on "Fin De Si&#x00E8;cle Vienna and its Jewish Cultural Influences," took the occasion to resist the given topic, "the Jewish influences [sic] on the visual arts."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Focusing particularly on Beller's thesis on the Jewish character of "Vienna 1900," Gombrich expressed his objection as succinctly as possible: "I am of the opinion that the notion of Jewish Culture was, and is, an invention of Hitler and his fore-runners and after-runners."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Among these fore- and after-runners, Gombrich seems to have counted his fellow Vienna Jews Stefan Zweig (who calculated nine-tenths of nineteenth-century Viennese culture to 

<b></b>

 have been the property of Jews) and George Steiner (who attributed "most of the innovations" of the twentieth century to Viennese of Jewish extraction). Gombrich is baffled by such claims, and finds himself at a point in his own lecture where, to refute the apparently insuperable non-logic of (Austro-)Jewish modernism, he disavows it by tracing his own intellectual genealogy&#x2014;naming the fathers of the Vienna School of art history, including Wickhoff, Riegl, Dvorak, and von Schlosser&#x2014;and certifying that none of these were Jewish. Beyond the macabre resemblance of this method to the Nazi requirement of producing baptismal certificates of four grandparents, this moment in Gombrich's very sound lecture also frankly adopts the despicable practice of "racial" identification and cultural attribution that he condemns. Unlike those he critiques, though, Gombrich is acutely aware of the processes of adoption and inversion mentioned above, and that these inversions prove the rule of antisemitic antimodernism, rather than performing a reversal. In his own, pithier phrase, "even if you turn a myth on its head, you do not get the truth." </p>

<p>The perspicacious Viennese cultural critic Hermann Bahr (allow me to abstain from identifying him as a Jew or a non-Jew)&#x2014;early diagnostician if not founder of such latter-day historiographical principles as "Secession," "fin-de-si&#x00E8;cle," and "modernism," actually&#x2014;could not resist this observation in his portrait of Vienna: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The real Jew has no power in the city of Vienna. Unfortunately. It could use some of his diligence, his industriousness, his earnestness. But the city has always defended itself against him. It doesn't want the competence, greatness, and strength of Jewry. But the Jew who doesn't want to be one, who betrays his race by leaving it, the one who plays something he is not, he is Vienna's kin. The artificiality of these fugitive beings who, emptied of all past, crave to cloak themselves in any present and any future, who are no more than shells of men ready to spout off something different every day, who are capable of being nothing but appearing anything&#x2014;these have always allured the Viennese. He finds himself in such people. If we take the term in this way, it can be said that Vienna is jewified [<i>verjudet</i>] through and through. It was so before the first Jew arrived.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>It seems that to be the first both to identify literary modernism as a critical category and to designate turn-of-the-century Vienna as the modernist cultural capital par excellence, Bahr could not but invoke Jewish modernism. Here the myth is turned not so much on its head as inside-out: Vienna is a city so jewified that its Jewishness preceded the Jews, just as a latent Vienna Modern anticipated modernity.  </p>

<p>"Jewish modernism" is clearly a potent historical re that calls for study, and at the same time it seems to have been immensely difficult to employ any variant of this re without reproducing, more than analyzing, the problem complex to which it refers. The point here is not simply a methodological one (e.g., how to find a way of studying the discourse of Jewish modernism without merely reproducing it). What kind of problem is "Jewish modernism"? 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>In German, the term "Jewish modernism" coincides not only with "Jewish modernity," but also with "modern Judaism." "Die Moderne" had a special ring at the turn of the century, referring at once to a new age and an avant-garde art; "Die j&#x00FC;dische Moderne" was the title of an important lecture given by early Zionist Nathan Birnbaum in Vienna and published in 1896.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Birnbaum seems to have been the one to have coined the term "Zionism" a decade before this lecture, but by the turn of the century his place in the movement was all but utterly eclipsed by the hero of political Zionism, Theodor Herzl. Birnbaum, at much the same time as Herzl, began to dream of a Jewish state in Palestine in light of what he saw as the failed project of assimilation. But Birnbaum stood among those "cultural Zionists" who emphasized the spiritual renewal of Judaism through the Zionist venture, their internal rejection of the abject state of assimilated Jewishness, and consciousness-raising among Jews in the Diaspora. The term "Jewish modern" in his essay plays two apparently contrary functions. It is used as a disdainful term for assimilationist Jews who consider themselves forward-thinking ("modern"), but it also stands for Judaism at a moment of reorientation; the plea of the essay is for the Jewish modern to appreciate that what is needed is an independent national existence. <sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Birnbaum's re of "die j&#x00FC;dische Moderne," not unlike other aspects of his thought, ultimately proved too confusing&#x2014;too complex, ambivalent, or even self-contradictory&#x2014;for his contemporary audience.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  "Jewish modernism" was hence overtaken by the term "Jewish Renaissance," which was favored by other cultural Zionists in the same period, particularly Martin Buber and Ahad Ha'am.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  While the linkage between Renaissance and modernity is not unfamiliar, the former re unambiguously emphasized a return to Jewish spiritual roots. "The modern," as Birnbaum himself suggested in one way the term is used in his own essay, seemed to imply a rejection of the past, of tradition, or of history. As Wagner's essay of that title already showed, the root "modern" was weighed down by its own baggage in the German and German-Jewish context. But it is precisely that complexity that Birnbaum wanted to capture, and that indeed the term Jewish Renaissance did not wish to dispose of: the relationship between historical consciousness and creative innovation was neither meant to be oppositional, nor simply complementary.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Rather, res of history/tradition/memory/the past and /radical innovation constituted poles of a field of tension, sets of axes within a single apparatus. </p>

<p>It was both the strength and the weakness of the term "j&#x00FC;dische Moderne" that it stood for too many things at once, and the same must be said of our meager translation "Jewish modernism." It would be a mistake to bracket the historical debates around the Jewish Modern as somehow referring to something else than our concerns in this issue, because its intended referent (unlike ours) was internal to Jewish culture. The different meanings of the term, from an aesthetic modernism leaning toward abstraction, commodified mass cultural organs and their products, a condition in the secular world putting pressures on a Jewish community struggling for continuity, and the intrinsic refashioning of that community itself, were all part of a single complex. A recent user of the term, for instance, defines it as "a series of disjointed efforts to renew traditional 

<b></b>

 ideational, social, and textual patterns broken by the uneven encounter with Western culture."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  As in both the antisemitic and Jewish uses of the concept so far, this definition establishes a distinction of Jews and Western culture (or else there would be no "encounter"), and also allows one to think about specifically Jewish engagements in terms of the guiding forms of modernism; at the same time, the special investment of these specifically Jewish engagements in orientalism/primitivism/spiritualism, and so on, informed modernism back in turn.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Of course, the antinomies of Jewish modernism were not just inscribed in the sideline voices of Nathan Birnbaum and the creative adherents of a Jewish Renaissance, but mainstream Zionism itself emerged in this very context, and nourished it as well.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Not only Birnbaum's "j&#x00FC;dische Moderne," but Herzl's <i>Altneuland</i> ("Old-New Land") was infused with all of the principle features of the texts discussed above: the paradoxes of tradition and innovation, the destiny of essential character and the promise of a radical break from it, discomfort with a present "modernity" above all. This is not to repeat the thesis that Zionist and certain contemporary antisemitic discourses shared a certain lexicon with their common antiliberalism, cult of youth, and so on.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  All of the manifold (including the now forgotten) branches of the <i>fin-de-si&#x00E8;cle </i>Zionist imaginary shared this play of past, present, and future, as well as the dialectical presence/absence fantasies present in the above texts of Wagner, Bettauer, and Bahr.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Zionist writings, youth movements, international congresses and the like further nourished these discourses in turn, setting on a grand stage, as it were, fantasies of a Jewish withdrawal from European modernity and the inauguration of a different future utopia, just as their relentless critiques of assimilation echoed those of Wagner's successors. Zionism was nothing if not Jewish modernism in all these senses. </p>

<p>Clearly the complexity of the relations between the res of modernism and of Jewishness stems in no small part from the famously ambiguous status of modernism itself, as well as its relationship to modernity on the one hand and popular culture on the other.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  The discourse on "Jewish modernism" in the German-language context, I am arguing, encompasses these very tensions, giving them specific form. While this discourse is surely one that took familiar form over the course of the last half of the nineteenth century and remained intact through the first half of the twentieth, the Jew and so-called Jewish question already played central roles in German Enlightenment discourse, representing, as it were, the tension between universalism and particularity.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  But the German (including German-speaking Austrian) eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were not haunted by a discourse on Jews until the mid-nineteenth century, and by the 1880s onward the culture was saturated by it. While it would be too much to claim that to speak of "die Moderne" after Jewish emancipation was to speak of Jews, a linkage of these res in the period cannot easily be dismissed. It is hence a somewhat counter-historical exercise to seek to reconstruct a German discourse on the modern or "modernism" purged of reference to Jews, Judaism, or Jewishness. This is odd because modernism, in at least one of its principle contemporary versions, stood for a presumed anti-contextualism as well as an anti-historicism; it famously made a claim for aesthetic autonomy.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  This is a contradiction at the core of the whole notion 

<b></b>

 of Jewish modernism. There is no reason to rehash a difficult discussion of aesthetic autonomy here, or to evaluate the difference between the program and practice of "art for art's sake"; our concern is rather with the relationship of programmatic modernism and its histories (or criticisms). We have seen how antisemitic and philosemitic programmatic statements on the Modern seem to bear an unshakeable rhetorical kinship with German and Jewish studies treatments of them, so that in some cases they are structurally identical. Similarly, certain critical methodologies such as the American post-war New Criticism shared distinct elective affinities with aestheticist formalism, such that our contemporary critical discourse on modernism developed in a mutually reflexive relationship to it.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  In other words, if German-Jewish studies cannot help but posit a modernism as inexorably "Jewish" as the antisemites', there is also an insufficiently historicized criticism of modernism that is stripped of these associations. But this "modernism without Jews" is not a history of German modernism freed from its antisemitic discursive associations, but a disavowal. </p>

<p>Paul de Man's influential essay "Literary History and Literary Modernity" would seem to be an account of modernism without Jews; in its sly use of the term "literary modernity," it seems to be able to do even without "modernism".<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  De Man's essay, at its core an exegesis of one of Nietzsche's short pieces from the <i>Untimely Meditations</i>, became exemplary for a generation of literary critics (although not historians) interested in a modernism that was neither a static descriptor of literary history nor a self-cannibalizing category of aesthetic formalism free of context. De Man sees the category (again, "modernity" rather than modernism) emerging as ideological weapon, theoretical problem, and promising link between theory and praxis.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  This discussion of modernism leads provocatively to a lucid statement about the textuality of history: that intensive textual interpretation is true historical work, and that historical phenomena are texts in other guise.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>   </p>

<p>While influential, de Man's essay is often misunderstood. Many readers see it as casting (or recasting, after Nietzsche) an ironclad binary of history and the modern.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  That binary is the starting point rather than de Man's own polemic&#x2014;the presumed opposition of history and the modern is what he took to be obvious, modernism's own self-mythology. In Carl Schorske's words, the modernists "all broke, more or less deliberately, their ties to the historical outlook central to the nineteenth-century liberal culture in which they had been reared".<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  The opposition between "history" and "modern" is established in de Man's text (and, in his reading, in Nietzsche's) only to be broken down: modernism's concern for futurity implicates it at once in the "chain" of history; its self-consciousness entails reflection, even as it demands a spontaneity at odds with such reflection: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Considered as a principle of life, modernity becomes a principle of origination and turns at once into a generative power that is itself historical. It becomes impossible to overcome 

<b></b>

 history in the name of life or forget the past in the name of modernity, because both are linked by a temporal chain that gives them a common destiny &#x2026; <i>Modernity and history relate to each other in a curiously contradictory way that goes beyond antithesis or opposition.</i> If history is not to become sheer regression or paralysis, it depends on modernity for its duration and renewal; but modernity cannot assert itself without being at once swallowed up and reintegrated into a regressive historical process. &#x2026; Modernity and history seem condemned to being linked together in a self-destroying union that threatens the survival of both.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>De Man very clearly identifies the relation between history and modernity in Nietzsche's text with the trope of <i>aporia</i>. This re, which in classical rhetoric signified the moment of real or feigned undecideability between two mutually contradictory positions presented by a speaker (from the Greek for "impassable"), was a privileged one for practitioners of deconstruction. For a reader like de Man, this prime trope of doubt and undecideability points to the paradox wherein the conditions of possibility of something like "modern" are also the elements blocking its existence.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Nietzsche does not so much argue for modernity against history (the Nietzschean "Now" against historicist reflection), according to de Man, but rather his own text is caught in the aporia of reflection and immediacy, of history and the modern. This reading is persuasive. Still more interesting than its accuracy is its mirror-like identical inversion of the position of Walter Benjamin familiar to so many in German studies: the dialectical image, frozen in a lightening-moment in which the then and the now, history and the modern, coincide.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  De Man does not mention Benjamin in this essay, and the latter's presence lingers in implication only. The "aporetic" in de Man's usage could be seen in contrast to the "dialectical"; of course the former term is the one that emerges from literary criticism, rhetorics or tropology; dialectics is the historical concept. By insisting on the aporetic rather than dialectical relation of the terms reflection and spontaneity (or history and modern), de Man, with Nietzsche, refuses the primacy of history while insisting on keeping it braided with the modern within a single knot. If that knot does not bear the name "Jewish modernism," that is so in part because of the conspicuous absence not only of Benjamin but of other prime subjects of German(/Jewish) studies whose projects describe the collision of reflection and spontaneity, namely Freud, or history and modernization, like Marx.  </p>

<p>The deconstructionist taste for aporia&#x2014;if anyone indulged in it more often and more idiosyncratically than de Man, it was Derrida&#x2014;reminded these thinkers' critics of the accusation of moral relativism. That is certainly a debate that is too expansive and too distant from our discussion of Jewish modernism to be included here. Yet, it is worth mentioning that this criticism reached its most fevered pitch around an affair involving issues very close to those we have been discussing. Attackers' of a wide range of theoretical work in literary criticism came to claim that this critical work was tainted, and could not be seen without reference to the historical fact of the author's collaboration. A particularly influential report by Jon Wiener in <i>The Nation</i>, for instance, specifically cited de Man's "Literary History and Literary Modernity" as evidence of the objectives of "Deconstruction," namely to "[free] literature from context and history.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup> 

<b></b>

 But de Man's claim in this essay we have been discussing was precisely not that history should be ignored, in the name of aesthetic autonomy; rather, he asserted that intense scrutiny to the work on its own terms would constitute historical work. Real formalism&#x2014;the rejection of history and context of the New Criticism, for example&#x2014;he attacked ruthlessly.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  </p>

<p>At the center of the sensation was a piece a twenty-one-year-old de Man had written on the subject of "Jews and contemporary literature."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  In this one-page contribution, it cannot be disputed that de Man enlists antisemitic discourse, but the question of how he engages it has been the object of some discussion. For the major thrust of the article is without doubt contrary to the central thrust of the Nazi antisemitic view of the role of the Jews in modern culture: the accusation about a penetrating Jewish presence in modern culture is a "lapidary judgment," a product of "vulgar antisemitism" or even a "myth" spread in part by the Jews themselves; but modern European culture, far from being "jewified" (<i>enjuiv&#x00E9;, </i>the standard contemporary translation of <i>verjudet</i>), was healthy at its root, not fundamentally affected by the relatively minor Jewish participation, and indeed, an imagined solution to the Jewish question involving the Jews' isolation from Europe would "not entail, for the literary life of the West, deplorable consequences."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  A complex case, to be sure&#x2014;blatantly antisemitic discourse deployed in a way that undermines the ideology? To interpret this appalling text, readers have to contextualize it, historicize it, in different ways. They recall the immediate context of de Man's collaborationist activity, and his apparent resistance to contribute to this special issue of <i>Le Soir</i> on Jews and literature, for instance; some readers focus on de Man's involvement in a group on the anti-fascist and democratic left not long before this moment; for critics, the future doctrines of de Man's literary theory would be as crucial a context as those more immediate to this text.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>   </p>

<p>For our own purposes, we note perhaps that this 1941 de Man, like exterminationist antisemites of his time no more or less than the murdered Hugo Bettauer, posits a European modernity without Jews as a rhetorical strategy. We have come full circle back to Wagner's essay "Modern" a century before: both imagine a modern popular sphere (for de Man the "phony and disordered existence of Europe since 1920") rife with Jewish influence, and both determine that this Jewish sphere has not touched true art. And so, in de Man's writing, another pair of bookends&#x2014;at one end, modern literature without Jews, at the other a literary modernity that sublates history and leaves both Jewishness and antisemitism unspoken. Jewish presence/absence, history and the modern, face one another in an impassable encounter&#x2014;an aporia. </p>

<p>When my subtitle only somewhat ironically announced that this discussion of Jewish modernism would be "counter-historical," there were several competing meanings at work. This is necessarily so, in light of the similarly concurrent and conflicting strands of "Jewish modernism" itself. Some of the reference points of Jewish modernism and counter-history map on to one another neatly: the Zionist Jewish <i>Moderne </i>immediately 

<b></b>

 concerned itself with the self-conscious effort to remake Jewish destiny by resisting its own lachrymose history&#x2014;instead of being subjected by history, the new, creative and activist Jews would reauthor themselves. David Biale embodied the term with new life in his study of Gershom Scholem, where he suggested that the revival and reinterpretations of Jewish mystical tradition rewrote the story Judaism told itself about its own rationalist and legalistic core.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  While the Zionist "muscle-Jew" and his counterpart student with Rosenzweig's <i>Star of Redemption</i> under his arm may have had little to say to each other, both were "Jewish modernists" concerned with the innovative and even redemptive moment that came in an engagement with a Jewish historical essence that was also a refusal; an insistence on identifying with a Jewish "essence" that other Jews would have found alien. This complex pattern of identification and dis-identification with history&#x2014;closely linked to a focus on the redemptive inauguration of a utopian future&#x2014;is not far at all from the contemporary discourses on Jewish modernism by self-identified non-Jewish Germans. These Jewish modernisms, as we have seen, entailed their own versions of counter-history, imagining what various modernisms and modernities would look like if purged of the historical presence of Jews. To be clear, my argument is not that all of these different discourses are in concord with one another, describing a same or similar <i>Moderne</i>, Jewish in one and the same way; rather, to regard all of these preoccupations as part of a landscape, to stand back and blur the eyes, is to draw out a field of tension among res of self and other, past and future, text and author. This murky and ambivalent field is covered, as it were, by the name Jewish modernism, rather than denoted by it.  </p>

<p>Technically speaking, a counter-historical argument is a rumination about the succession of past events that relies upon a counter-factual premise, for example, "If Hindenburg had not appointed Hitler chancellor of the Reich in 1933," "If the Jews had not been emancipated," or "Had the Weimar Constitution not included the Emergency Powers provision&#x2026;" While historians have traditionally espoused skepticism regarding the legitimacy of counter-historical arguments, implicitly many if not most historical arguments rely on such premises. A recent interest in counterfactuals and history has surfaced, as a flurry of conference panels and publications seems to indicate.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  While eccentric imaginary historical experiments are a staple of a genre of popular counterfactual history, professional historians are more comfortable with counter-historical arguments based on realistic premises.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Upon examination, many historical arguments utilize implicitly counterfactual reasoning: In asserting the association of Viennese modernism and its Jews, for instance, Beller in his <i>Vienna and the Jews</i> must silently imagine what that modernism would have looked like without them. German-Jewish studies, no matter how patently historical, hence often resorts to premises that might be as extravagant as the statement, "if turn-of-the-century Vienna had no Jews&#x2026;" To analyze the Jewish influence on the work of a Kafka, a Freud, a Marx, or a Mahler does after all suggest that their work would have to have been essentially different if they were <i>not</i> Jews.  </p>

<p>For our purposes, I wonder if a counter-historical exercise of precisely this extravagance would not be useful to flesh out our historiographical dilemma and its consistent 

<b></b>

 entanglement with the problematics of "Jewish modernism." Generations of scholarship, invective, and silent public opinion have culled meaning from the relationship of texts like "On the Jewish Question," <i>Moses and Monotheism</i>, and so on, to the facts of the Jewish origins of their authors' families. There is no use disputing that many deep insights into these and a great many works more remote to Judaism have been made on the basis of this contextualization. But what if it were now to be discovered that these artists and thinkers, or one of them, did <i>not </i>actually have Jewish origins, that this had just been assumed on the basis of a later manipulation of the historical record, or a mistake? Too much of a stretch, surely, to imagine, but it must be confessed that a text like either of the two mentioned<i> could</i> be authored by someone with no discernable Jewish origins, and in that case, would have to be interpreted differently. We could perform this eccentric experiment in another way, no less stark: what if the author of the <i>Genealogy of Morals</i>, Friedrich Nietzsche, were the son not of a Lutheran minister, but, like Marx, of a convert from Judaism? From an intellectual historical perspective, it is an absurd premise&#x2014;the life of Nietzsche would have been utterly different had this been the case, the environment informing the oeuvre completely different, the professional training and trajectory impossible. Yet, we can say with certainty that if this were the case, and we had before us the text <i>Genealogy of Morals</i>, shelves of its interpretation would be saturated with references to the author's relationship to his Judaism, the Jewish education or popular knowledge informing the text, Jewish self-hatred, the context of antisemitism, and so on. And, <i>voil&#x00E1;</i>! Suddenly we have a cornerstone of the canon of Jewish modernism.  </p>

<p>Cultural historians (including myself) are convinced that texts, res, and ideas are embedded&#x2014;they have a relationship to their given historical contexts and are unthinkable without them. Thinkers like de Man offer the possibility of unthinking this truism. What is called the "autonomy" of the text or of art can really be seen as a willed assertion, a hypothesis: <i>what if</i> texts/works/res could be understood outside of the presumed overdetermined contexts of their authorship?<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  </p>

<p>My question in this essay is somewhat different: How are we to historicize "Jewish modernism"? How is it to be defined, how can it even be invoked without immediately falling into the traps set by its own violent history? A common strategy for historicizing a concept, movement, or work calls for an excavation of an author's origins and intentions, but the difficult case of Jewish modernism shows that there are reasons to take a step back from this model of contextualization. The constellation of disparate historical moments I have organized here under the rubric "Jewish modernism" is intended to bring these reasons into relief, and to provide a context of a different sort&#x2014;one that helps situate an elusive object that is not a body of work nor a register of authors, but a way of thinking about oneself and one's place in relation to the past, the future, and creativity.

The locus classicus for this observation is the 1850 essay, "Judaism in Music," but the explicit and polemical antisemitism of this and other essays can be read as contexts for the aesthetic program in essays on "Art and Revolution," "The Art Work of the Future," and others. In "Judaism in Music," the most often cited piece in regard to Wagner's programmatic antisemitism, the author assumes a recognizably alien relationship of Jews to European art; much later essays like "Modern" and "What is German?" express the more nefarious linkage of Jews to modern German culture that is particularly relevant to our inquiry. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT5" href="#REF5">5</a>. In short, a "neutral" position identifies and historicizes an antisemitic strain in the socio-cultural critique essays, usually focusing particularly on "Judaism in Music," and brackets the question of a relationship between these opinions and the artistic work, see e.g. Dieter Borchmeyer's excellent summary in Ulrich M&#x00FC;ller and Peter Wapnewski, <i>Richard-Wagner-Handbuch</i> (Stuttgart: Alfred Kr&#x00F6;ner, 1986): 137&#x2013;61; many lengthy studies avoid discussion of this element, and where they handle it cursorily, tend to dismiss it, e.g. Curt von Westernhagen, tr. Mary Whittall, <i>Wagner. A Biography</i>, 2 vols (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1978); some treatments deal with the problem at length but ultimately apologetically, considering antisemitic attitudes to be discrete artifacts of Wagner's milieu&#x2014;one source for instance equates his views on Jews with those of Marx and Disraeli, see L. J. Rather, <i>Reading Wagner: A Study in the History of Ideas</i> (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1990): 114&#x2013;217; many even argue that the "Judaism" essay was nothing more than a personal attack on Meyerbeer (who is not named in the essay). Since T. W. Adorno's <i>Versuch &#x00FC;ber Wagner</i> (Frankfurt a.M.: Suhrkamp, 1952), various studies have tried to relate the antisemitism of the essays to the content, form, imagery, or score of the music dramas, see esp.

Levin, <i>Richard Wagner, Fritz Lang, and the Nibelungen</i> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1998); most recently, Wolf-Daniel Hartwich offers a reading of this relation that goes furthest beyond looking for Jewish allegory in the dramas, see <i>Romantischer Antisemitismus.

On the same page, he names the objection that considering all these people and works Jewish reiterates the Nazi practice, but dismisses it apparently on the basis of the fact of Jewish cultural predominance.  </p>

Birnbaum's Zionism floated from an emphasis on territory in Palestine to "present-work" focusing on the welfare and education of Jews in the diaspora or exile (<i>Golus</i>), to a return to religious orthodoxy. More than one commentator has seen in this complexity or even inconsistency the key to his relatively low status in the Zionist pantheon (in spite of apparently having coined the movement's name).

A similar result, from the opposite direction, was achieved by Noah Isenberg in his <i>Between Redemption and Doom: The Strains of German-Jewish Modernism</i> (Lincoln, Neb.: University of Nebraska, 1999), which consisted of case studies of three Jewish contributors to the German modernist canon (Kafka, Arnold Zweig, and Walter Benjamin), and one of the Jewish-themed film <i>Der Golem</i>.

The difficult problem of the "dialectical image" is not exactly a historical or narrative model in the sense that dialectics in classical Hegelianism and Marxism have been, in that it "freezes" a dialectical moment rather than moving forward; it is also different from de Man's aporia in that it freezes the then and the now together in an active and spontaneous way, rather than at an aporetic impasse. Frequently, Benjamin's "messianic" revisions of Western Marxism are explained, again, by resorting to the fact of his German-Jewish background. A symptomatic example that is expressly relevant to the problematic explored in this essay is Robert Alter, <i>Necessary Angels: Tradition and Modernity in Kafka, Benjamin, and Scholem</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991). </p>

<p><a name="FOOT51" href="#REF51">51</a>. The most recent conference of the American Historical Association (Philadelphia, 2006) featured an Association-sponsored roundtable entitled "Not Just a 'Parlour Game' Anymore: Counterfactual History in the Historical Mainstream." In 2004, the professional organ of the association published an article on the issue of counterfactual history and created an online forum for a discussion. See Martin Bunzl, "Counterfactual History: A User's Guide," <i>American Historical Review</i> vol. 109, no. 3 (June 2004) &lt;<a href="http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/109.3/bunzl.htm">http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/109.3/bunzl.htm</a>l&gt; (21 Feb. 2006). The general direction of these discussions seems to be not only to diagnose the phenomenon of the resurgence of counterfactual history, but to consider what its appropriate methods, boundaries, and applications are. Richard Ned Lebow, in "What's So Different about a Counterfactual?" <i>World Politics</i> 52, no. 4 (July 2000): 550&#x2013;585, argues that counterfactual historical arguments are not inherently different from factual ones, although the examples he reviews are logically deficient in his view. An influential collection to this field was Niall Fergusen, ed., <i>Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals</i> (New York: Macmillan, 1997). On the level of popular history, an example is the Robert Cowley series <i>What If? Eminent Historians Imagine What Might Have Been</i> (New York: Putnam, 2001) and his earlier volume focusing on military history; Steve Tally, <i>Almost America: From Colonists to Clinton: a "What If" History of the United States</i> (New York: HarperCollins, 2000), and a veritable spate of fantastical books with titles such as <i>Roads Not Taken, History that Never Was, The Way It Wasn't, </i>and <i>Alternate History Stories.</i> </p>

<p><a name="FOOT53" href="#REF53">53</a>. Distinct but related hypotheses are posited by the well-known essays by Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault assessing the problem of authorship: See R. Barthes, "The Death of the Author," <i>Image, Music, Text</i> ed. and trans. Stephen Heath (New York: Hill, 1977): 142&#x2013;48, and Michel Foucault, "What is an Author?" trans. Donald F. Bouchard and Sherry Simon, in <i>Language, Counter-Memory, Practice</i>, ed. Donald F. Bouchard (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1977): 124&#x2013;127. These texts could be said not only to be well-known, but widely influential, like de Man's essay, which was published close to the time these essays came out in English translation. Nonetheless, that influence does not seem to have extended to Jewish and German studies treatments of Jewish modernism. The problematic of authorship is a central strand of the discourse complex I have been discussing under this rubric. For the discursive complex of "Jewish modernism," it seems important to remember Barthes' old claim that in writing "everything is to be <i>disentangled</i>, nothing <i>deciphered.</i>" </p>
