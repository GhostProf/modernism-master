<p class="noIndent">
The morning was beautiful. Beautiful as if it wanted to herald one of those days that continue to resonate in us for a long time like the chiming of bells. A nearly Italian-blue sky arched over the bridges, and the water in the River Vltava glistened gaily as if it were still flowing through meadows instead of through a metropolis with all its garbage, foul smells, and loud noises.
</p>

<p>
A morning like this is quite exhilarating. I had to "go into the city" as we say in Prague, when we are heading downtown, but otherwise I had an almost free day ahead of me. In the evening I had an interpreting assignment, but since I was very familiar with the subject matter, there wasn't much to prepare. Disturbing and painful as that particular job would be, I tried to keep it off my mind on this bright morning.
</p>

<p>
The trolley I boarded was covered with pictures of lilies of the valley promoting the pleasures of a breath-refreshing chewing gum. Usually, I get annoyed by that sort of transformation of public transportation into advertisement vehicles. I don't appreciate having to squeeze myself through a packed car while its exterior walls feature the slim, freely bopping legs of young women advertising pantyhose, or, worse, having to get into a car picturing desert sand with a camel&#x02014;what else&#x02014;promoting Camel cigarettes. This time I could simply overlook such nonsense.
</p>

<p>
The center of the city presented the usual picture or rather, what has become in recent years the usual picture, albeit always filled with surprises&#x02014;such as a citizen of Prague discovering a new bank where she used to get fish; or the latest models of Jaguars displayed behind the windows of what once was a bakery; 

<b></b>

or instead of the delicious aroma of assorted open sandwiches that wafted from the shelves until quite recently, the blaring sounds of rock music underscoring the display of T-shirts decorated with all sorts of fancy emblems, from the USA, Singapore and China. <i>Tempora mutantur</i>.
</p>

<p>
But none of that could faze me on that particular morning. The moment I woke up I made up my mind to spend the day as carefree as possible, gathering energy for the difficult evening hours. Affectionately I looked at the old buildings, as more and more of them were showing off their make-over. There are now fa&#x000E7;ades in cheerful shades of green, rose, and yellow with bright red roofs smiling at us while stuccos and graceful decorations constantly emerge from the dark gray soot of decades. And above it all shone the Italian-blue sky.
</p>

<p>
On &#x0017D;elezn&#x000E1; [Iron Street], which leads from the Karolinum to Old Town Square, I noticed an older man with his arms dangling in an odd way; he stopped every few steps, turned his sad face from side to side and with trembling hands drew invisible circles in the air while mumbling soundlessly. What was he looking for? Was he looking for someone? His shaky gait and jittery movements suggested a mentally disturbed person. Some people turned to look after him, shaking their heads. A boisterous little boy tried mimicking the man's gait, which earned him a couple of annoyed nudges from his mother. Somehow the poor madman didn't fit into the cheerful street scene.
</p>

<p>
I stopped and also turned to look after him. Had nature wrought havoc with this man or had his fellow human beings treated him so badly that for the rest of his life he would find it necessary to defend himself against invisible threats?
</p>

<p>
Nonsense! The difficult evening hours I anticipated seemed to cast their shadows and force such ideas into my head. The poor man was obviously sick, that was all.
</p>

<p>
A huge crowd had gathered in front of the Old Town Hall on the big square at the lower end of &#x0017D;elezn&#x000E1; waiting for the hourly attraction when the two little windows above the old clock would open and the twelve apostles would pass by, followed by the miser shaking his sack of money, and death wiggling its pale skull. Then the cock would crow above the dial with the nearly indecipherable astronomical signs, and the whole apparition would be gone for another hour.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I had lost track of the madman.
</p>

<p>
"Adam and Eve"&#x02014;the two towers of Tyn Church, the pointed roof of the house "At the Stone Bell," the elegant Kinsky Palace seemed to be carved into the sky. Even though&#x02014;or maybe because&#x02014;I have been living in Prague&#x02014;albeit with some voluntary as well as involuntary interruptions&#x02014;since my very first scream, I can't get enough of its dreamy, somewhat melancholy and at the same time comforting familiar beauty. And on such a morning to boot!
</p>

<p>
At the corner of Dlouh&#x000E1; [Long Street] at the right lower end of the Old Town Square a young gypsy woman held up her begging hand towards me. She was wearing a flower-print skirt (with large flower print), a red and green scarf around her head, and carried a sleeping child in her arms. A Madonna of the streets? No way! I had met this woman at other corners around town, with different children in her arms, wearing different skirts. As one tried to pass her, she offered to tell the future in a unique 

<b></b>

mix of Czech and German. On that morning in the square bustling with tourists, she looked like a cleverly staged re.
</p>

<p>
Maybe it was the gypsy baby or, in any case, the particular corner of Dlouh&#x000E1;, that suddenly triggered a childhood memory. Before World War II a Jewish welfare organization was located down the street. Named the Israelite Confraternity, it supported the needy members of its faith and organized cultural events to raise money for its charitable activities. My parents were members of the confraternity.
</p>

<p>
For some occasion which I can't remember&#x02014;it was probably a Jewish holiday&#x02014;they produced a children's play in which I played a part. This was quite unusual, because my parents usually restricted their participation to paying their membership fees without getting involved in any organized activities. More than anything, they didn't want to be different from the other tenants in our building and from the people in our street. My mother especially was afraid to stand out among her fellow citizens in the district of Karl&#x000ED;n. To her mind it was enough that she came from the German speaking town of Saaz [now &#x0017D;atec] in western Bohemia while my father hailed from the Czech part of Prague. That alone attracted attention. She was afraid that emphasizing their Jewish origins would harm their business and, above all, burden the children.
</p>

<p>
How futile her motherly considerations would turn out to be later!
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, as mentioned already, I did participate in one theatrical event. It was a fairy tale by Wilhelm Hauff, titled <i>Caliph Stork</i>. I must have been eight or nine years old. Today I barely remember what the play was about. But I have not forgotten that I played a stork and that they dressed me in orange stockings and short white pants, and put paper wings, a long papier m&#x000E2;ch&#x000E9; neck and a long red papier m&#x000E2;ch&#x000E9; beak over my head. In those days, people advertising various products used to run around the streets stuck inside such box-like costumes. (Trolleys back then were painted in red and yellow, the colors of Prague; they were not permitted to display advertisements by anyone, of anything.)
</p>

<p>
My papier m&#x000E2;ch&#x000E9; costume was quite heavy and rather tight with only two small round openings in the neck through which I could peek out. They put a string in one of my hands, which made my long red beak clack whenever I pulled on it. I thought that was neat, much better than the few words I had to squeak through my papier m&#x000E2;ch&#x000E9; neck.
</p>

<p>
"Good day, Dame Longlegs. I have to dance for my father's guests tonight and would like to practice a little right here." Well, try practicing a dance with a heavy papier m&#x000E2;ch&#x000E9; neck on your shoulders!
</p>

<p>
As I said before, I barely remember the fairy tale. I only know that I had a partner, Dame Longlegs. On that beautiful morning I suddenly remembered the magic word that could turn the jinxed caliph and his vizier back into their human shape: <i>Mutabor</i>.
</p>

<p>
I have no idea why the Jewish Confraternity chose to present an Arab fairy tale, of all things. Maybe there was nothing remarkable about it at that time, many years before the founding of the state of Israel. But the sudden memory of it on that early summer day in 1995, in light of the reprehensible events that had occurred in the meantime in and concerning Israel, felt like a warm breeze, a greeting from a distant, supposedly more innocent time. <i>Mutabor</i>.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The man with the swaying movements and the restlessly circulating hand had caught up with me in the meantime and like me, turned his searching gaze towards Dlouh&#x000E1;. I looked at him more closely now. Could it be that I . . . Many years after my clacking beak debut I used to come daily through this street, where my office at the monthly magazine <i>In the Heart of Europe</i> was located. But I certainly had never seen this man before.
</p>

<p>
The house, Dlouh&#x000E1; # 12, was built in the thirteenth century. Orbis Publications had it renovated for a large amount of money. Originally, it was supposed to have been a beer hall or an inn. The gothic vaults in the basement support this assumption.
</p>

<p>
On an August morning in 1968, also under a clear blue sky no one took notice of then, I wasn't squiggling through throngs of curious tourists across the Old Town Square; rather I squeezed between the tanks and other military equipment of uninvited Soviet invaders, in a state of horror, outrage and profound agitation. Wasn't it enough that years ago German fascists had occupied my Prague, did we have to be occupied again, for a change, this time by Soviet Communists? Some heavy artillery had been positioned in Dlouh&#x000E1; under the windows of the editorial offices. We worked hard to ignore this metal giant and did our best under the new dictatorship to keep up our public work (sometimes not so publicly). On the third or fourth day after the invasion a colleague burst into my tiny office, laughing and screaming: "Look out there, quickly!" I ran to the window.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, "our" occupying soldiers were having their laundry day. Underpants, socks, three shirts, full of holes, were dangling from the barrel of the gun. The sky was blue; I wished for rain.
</p>

<p>
That's what happens, or rather, that's what happens to me when I am running through Prague and an Italian-blue sky not only lightens up the gilded crosses atop the church spires and the freshly painted stuccos on the old walls of historic buildings, but also shines through memories&#x02014;of things that happened recently or long ago, of matters closed and wide open, through what one had done and what had been done to oneself.
</p>

<p>
Enough. I turned my back to Dlouh&#x000E1; saturated as it was with memories.
</p>

<p>
What time is it? When would I have to be on my way to get to my interpreter's booth on time? Why was my heart pounding already?
</p>

<p>
I had accepted an assignment scheduled for that day to interpret during a German-Czech colloquium in northern Bohemia. In the rush of preparations the organizers almost forgot that not all participants in this international dialogue would speak both languages. I was asked at the last minute. It wasn't linguistic matters that would be demanding; I was vaguely afraid of the place itself and of what I would hear. It was a place where I needed someone at my side. Therefore I was glad that D., an excellent interpreter and my good friend for many years, had agreed to work and get through the evening with me.
</p>

<p>
We had to go to Theresienstadt. A taxi was to get us there. It picked us up on time in the afternoon. When we left Prague the sky was still Italian-blue. I wanted to enjoy the drive through the early summer landscape and tried to suppress the thought of where we were headed. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Soon we had left the city behind us. Meadows, tilled fields, a small forest. Villages with red tiled roofs, everything very friendly, matching my inner picture of lovely Bohemia. Early summer roses were blooming in the gardens, here and there shrubs of late lilacs. Only the many "Rooms Available" signs on the fences or next to the front doors flooding the landscape didn't quite fit into the rural idyll, they were&#x02014;as far as one could see from a passing car&#x02014;the most noticeable indication of the new era.
</p>

<p>
Spreading in the distance were the rounded bluish silhouettes of central Bohemia's long extinct and overgrown volcanoes. From the top of one of them, the legendary Mount Rip, &#x0010C;ech the founding father is said to have awarded his tribe this land with its fertile soil, its abundance of game in the forest and bounty of fish in rivers and creeks.
</p>

<p>
God knows why I suddenly had to think of the poor madman with the searching eyes in Prague's Old Town. And of the young gypsy woman with the infant in her arms. Can those two feel like I do about Bohemia as their lovely homeland.
</p>

<p>
"Don't think about it now," D. suddenly said. She must have taken my contemplative gaze for nervousness about the evening event. "We'll be hearing enough of it tonight."
</p>

<p>
"That's for sure," I replied, unable to suppress a sigh, "From Eichmann's trains to Theresienstadt the area must have looked quite different. And 'available rooms' wouldn't have been offered, but simply taken over."
</p>

<p>
How absurd, really, taking a taxi to Theresienstadt. The same route as the trains crammed with Jews being deported to the ghetto, and with prisoners transported to the Little Fortress.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the driver slammed on his brakes. He had nearly hit a little boy who was running across the street without looking.
</p>

<p>
"They go crazy when they see that stuff there," the driver grumbled.
</p>

<p>
Pretty shaken, I looked in the direction the boy was headed and at that moment I thought that now it was me who was about to go a little crazy.
</p>

<p>
A regiment of dwarfs was lined up at the side of the road. When and from where did they march in? They stood there motionlessly, with permanently frozen grins on their stupidly friendly faces, threatening only because there were so many of them. White plaster dwarfs on thin little legs with beardless, chubby cheeks and glaring little eyes, they were positioned according to their size from tiny to wildly oversized. Standing spellbound in front of them was the little boy who just a moment ago had been saved from being run over only by our driver's presence of mind. A young man with black curls wearing a T-shirt with grotesque designs was lolling about behind the parade of dwarfs.
</p>

<p>
"I must be dreaming," I exclaimed, "I've never seen those before!"
</p>

<p>
"You'll be seeing plenty more," the driver remarked dryly.
</p>

<p>
Sure enough&#x02014;we were already zooming by the next booth. Here the dwarfs were quite colorful in blue, green or purple jackets and red caps, surrounded by ceramic piglets of various sizes. They would bring good luck, promised a sloppily written sign in glaring colors. Good luck here and in such company?

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
I wondered whether "Dwarf Nose," the character of another Hauff fairy tale with a bad spell and a happy ending, was among those more recent creations. On this route towards a destination where a few years ago thousands of children were not freed from a spell, where the worst ending was in store for them instead.
</p>

<p>
"Could we go a bit slower?" I asked, so I could get a better look at this peaceful but awful invasion.
</p>

<p>
The driver laughed. "You're really seeing those for the first time?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes. And I can't fathom who'd buy such things."
</p>

<p>
"You'd be amazed. After all, these people would only offer things they can get rid off."
</p>

<p>
He certainly had a point. But how could I have imagined that on the road from Prague to Theresienstadt hordes of dwarfs would be lined up for sale and actually be bought to enhance meticulously clipped lawns. (" . . . they cost practically nothing in our German Marks. Have them wrap up a few, dear . . . ") Besides the dwarfs there also was an offering of giant plush Mickey Mice, lovable dinosaurs and similar creatures in sizes to suit all decorative needs.
</p>

<p>
"Right after Theresienstadt, towards the border, it's getting worse," said D. "There are fewer dwarfs, but dozens of young girls lining the road, among them gypsy girls way under age."
</p>

<p>
Madonnas of the street? Lovely landscape, beautiful morning? What have I dreamt up once again? The begging gypsy mother with her child in her arms, which she got who knows how, and her sisters along the highway between Bohemia and Germany&#x02014;they were today's reality, as yesterday's was the ghetto, which was not a magic spell cast on Theresienstadt, but rather its reorganization, where later this evening we would be interpreters at a Czech-German colloquium that fortunately could once again end well. <i>Mutabor</i>.
</p>

<p>
We left the interstate highway.
</p>

<p>
"Where should I drop you off?" the driver wanted to know. "At the museum? That's usually the destination of my passengers to Theresienstadt."
</p>

<p>
"No, take us to the Town Hall, please."
</p>

<p>
We turned into a quiet street. On both sides the portly bourgeois houses of a small old northern Bohemian town. No people. The car turned into another street. The same scene. More or less well preserved or newly painted houses, a few modest stores, one fashionably calling itself a "boutique." No one around.
</p>

<p>
We approached a grassy area. Big old trees, their wide branches arching under the fresh foliage, specks of sun between the empty benches. At the end of the square a low, wide building. An arch of black and white rectangles above the driveway glistened in front of us. A small black square next to a white one, then again the black painted wall, another white square and so on forming an arch which seemed to smile almost benignly in the early evening hour.
</p>

<p>
Was this the driveway to the ghetto barracks or to the prison in the Little Fortress?
</p>

<p>
The car stopped. The Town Hall looked like similar buildings of bygone days in similar towns in this part of the country.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
We got out of the car and looked around. No one in the street. Were there so many dead that the town itself had finally died from so much dying?
</p>

<p>
When my mother had already passed through the entrance gate, framed then in white and ochre, and was assigned to the ironing room for the guards' uniforms, I was jailed in an ancient prison in Paris. The institution had a deceptively pleasant name: La Petite Roquette: Little Wild Tendril. That was the only pleasant thing about the expansive complex with walls so thick they barely let any light through. For over a hundred years the construction served its cheerless purpose, most recently as a jail for women, and there was nothing but brownish, dirty gray or black walls, dark corridors, barren yards for the inmates' dreary rounds, when they were ordered out of their equally dreary cells for their ten-minute "promenades."
</p>

<p>
When I came back to Paris for the first time several years after the end of the war, I went to look at the prison I had known only from the inside. There were no windows in the police cars that brought us from the interrogations to the Palace of Justice and back to the Roquette. So I stood quite surprised in front of the long wall overgrown with ivy, which made it look almost inviting. Only the heavy door with its rows of heavy locks was an indication of what was beyond the ivy-covered walls.
</p>

<p>
That chapter of my life found an altogether surprisingly good ending. Recently, a woman friend who had been jailed there at the same time sent me a newspaper clipping with a photograph that was taken at the moment the Roquette's surrounding wall was torn down and collapsed. A few buildings were still standing to the left and the right, but the middle part was already wrecked, turned to rubble for good.
</p>

<p>
For a long time I had the photograph on my bookshelf; it made me go on whenever I became faint-hearted. You see, it seemed to tell me, the Petite Roquette doesn't exist anymore, even though it appeared to be absolutely indestructible. That's also possible. Darkness, the indestructible, doesn't exist anymore.
</p>

<p>
"Look," D. said suddenly as we stood in front of the town hall not quite knowing what to do. We had expected someone from the colloquium to greet us and show us the way. I looked in the direction she pointed.
</p>

<p>
I started.
</p>

<p>
A man was sitting on a bench under a magnificent chestnut tree. With a blank stare, he was drawing invisible circles in the air. An older man with a finely chiseled and not at all mindless face, with a high forehead and dark, wide open eyes. Sitting there, and starting again and again. Always the same, rather large invisible circles.
</p>

<p>
"The only person we encountered up to now," D. whispered.
</p>

<p>
I nodded, stunned. Naturally I had to think of the madman I saw this morning. But here, in this fortress town which had been transformed into a city of death, the encounter had yet another, quite different effect on me. Where did this lonely man direct his fearful and at the same time empty gaze? What did he and only he see? What vicious circle did he try to trace with his restless hand? What was the meaning of these two encounters on one day, under my Prague's blue sky and now in this shut-down town? Was this coincidence really a coincidence . . .
</p>

<p>
The international dialogue that brought us here was animated by the sincere desire to build new bridges. The light was fading beyond the high windows of the town hall, 

<b></b>

where the meeting took place. There wasn't a sound coming in from outside; no car, no truck, no one calling, no one laughing. All the benches under the old trees would certainly be empty by now. No one in the street.
</p>

<p>
I translated the welcoming words of the mayor, a resolute, simple woman. Then there were lectures, some in Czech, some in German. I interpreted. Mechanically. Naturally the talks were about the terrible years, when the town was forced into a ghetto existence. Its original inhabitants, all of them Czech citizens, were expelled; they had to give up their homes by order of the Nazi administration. What were they told? What reason were they given for their sudden forced relocation? Did they know who would move into their living rooms, bedrooms and kitchens? Did they have any idea what a hell their sweet homes would be turned into? Were they told lies about officers' quarters, or were they told the truth&#x02014;that "sub-humans" would be concentrated inside their former four walls? How did those Czech citizens, the majority of them ethnic Germans, adjust to this unexpected new purpose of their town? Surely they were not asked, they simply were forced out, and yet. What were they thinking? Were they unhappy, outraged, indifferent or agreeable? At the very least they must have been sad to have to leave so suddenly. But what was their sadness measured against the sadness that moved in!
</p>

<p>
Some houses were used as SS headquarters, all the others were changed into prison quarters with quickly cut and stacked plank beds for thousands, no, tens of thousands of Jewish men, women and children. As long as Czechoslovakia was a free nation, eight thousand people had lived in this town. Later thirty to fifty thousand had to be packed in there at times. My father and mother, my grandmother, uncles and aunts were among them.
</p>

<p>
On that early summer evening when I found myself in Theresienstadt, I could translate only mechanically, while I listened for the silence in the street and was suddenly afraid that the earlier, unstoppable clamor from the crowded quarters would erupt in the treetops above the deserted square; calls for help, curses, last sighs.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly an unexpectedly angry voice pierced my earphones; demanding my immediate undivided attention, it quickly dispersed my panicked visions. A young German&#x02014;purple T-shirt, curly shock of hair tied with a green ribbon&#x02014;raged against the continued existence of IG Paints while everyone knows that back in those years . . . <sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Abruptly I was back in the present. The other participants responded to the young man with calming restraint. Shortly afterwards, the conference was over. I was looking for the mayor, I wanted to talk to her briefly, I wanted to find out how many people were still living in that quiet town. About one thousand eight hundred, she said. Once again I looked through the high windows onto the deserted square, and I decided to come back soon, without a colloquium.
</p>

<p>
Late at night, driving back to Prague, there was nothing to see of the landscape on either side of the highway. A pale light here and there, trembling in the bluish-black darkness. One could no longer make out whether "Rooms available," "Sandwiches" or "Eros centers" were offered at the curbs.
</p>

<p>
I stared intensely into the darkness. Where were they now, those squadrons of dwarfs parading past us on both sides of the road? Where did they come from and to 

<b></b>

where did they disappear? Had they been living here all those years, in the houses and barracks of Theresienstadt, between the stones of the Little Fortress, beneath the damp tiles of the barrack floors, in a dark corner of the execution space? Were they helpful as in the fairy tale of Snow White, or were they like their descendants, those funny little guys in the Disney movie? Or did they steal the last bites of stew right off the plates? Did they smudge the writing in secretly kept journals or trick the terrified people with delusory visions?
</p>

<p>
The endless circles made by the two madmen's restless hands . . .
</p>

<p>
Enough, enough, I admonished myself in the dark corner of the car gliding through the night. Despite everything, despite the epidemics, the constant dying, and the deportations without return, there was also life in the town turned ghetto, the present Hitler gave the Jews, as Goebbels's outrageous propaganda was to make the world believe. Not the so-called ordinary life, to be sure, with its small and big worries and joys, once taken for granted, but still&#x02014;
</p>

<p>
As thousands of Jewish children were horded into Theresienstadt, some women and men&#x02014;former teachers, educators, musicians and actors&#x02014;decided to brighten up a bit the limited lives of their youngest members, to penetrate the thick walls of the fortress with a little bit of joy. Even here children should not forget how to laugh.
</p>

<p>
During the thirties, in the early phase of the Czechoslovakian Republic, there was one theater among Prague's many stages that featured two funny wooden puppets as their main characters: Father &#x00160;pejbl and his silly little son Hurv&#x000ED;nek. Both were bald; Hurv&#x000ED;nek sported one single curl above his high forehead. Both looked at the puzzling world through big round eyes, both had ears that stuck out wide. They were the special favorites of all Bohemian children. Thus the artists interned at Theresienstadt decided that they should delight their young audiences even there.
</p>

<p>
After laborious and at the same time feverish preparations the day of the opening finally arrived. The attic of the barrack where the performance was to take place was filled to the last corner. The anticipation was nearly tangible, one could almost hear the impatient pounding of the little hearts. And then the joyous buzz, when father &#x00160;pejbl appeared in his black frock coat, with his little son in his short pants. They started their funny verbal duel, &#x00160;pejbl trying again and again to educate his son who resisted those attempts with his deadpan, precocious remarks.
</p>

<p>
But what was happening? The audience got quieter and quieter. The actors in the makeshift scenery looked at each other, stunned. Why was there hardly any laughter? Why were the children so quiet all of a sudden?
</p>

<p>
"I'll take a look," offered one of the actors and he stepped between the two wooden puppets. "Alright everybody," he called out into the packed auditorium as cheerfully as he could manage, "let's greet our dear Hurv&#x000ED;nek with a loud 'Ahoj!'"
</p>

<p>
Only a few thin little voices followed his suggestion.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter," the man now asked in a factual tone from the stage, "don't you like it?"
</p>

<p>
A little girl, her wild curly hair decorated for the occasion with a shiny pin, lifted her hand like she once used to in school.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
"Hurv&#x000ED;nek," she said haltingly, "is he one of them now?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean," said the man on stage, a bit uncertain now.
</p>

<p>
"Well, like . . . from the headquarters, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Hurv&#x000ED;nek? What on earth would make you think that?"
</p>

<p>
"Because he has no yellow star. But all of us have to have one."
</p>

<p>
Neither the director nor the actor had thought of that. The oversight could quickly be corrected and no one marked with the Star of David had ever been greeted so lovingly and enthusiastically as those two darlings of Prague's children by the prisoners of the ghetto.
</p>

<p>
Why was it garden gnomes, of all things, taking position along the highway that leads to the former ghetto and beyond, to another country, I contemplated on the way home. With their dumb faces they could hardly be the messengers of a hitherto unknown fate, a more bearable one perhaps, especially since they had settled here only very recently. Where were they when hell broke loose in our country? Moreover&#x02014;human visitors arriving at our borders were carefully scrutinized, searched and even x-rayed, if deemed necessary. But those garden gnomes marched in here without any troubles. In the vicinity of Theresienstadt, where the unspeakable still is and might well be forever suspended in the air, this cutefied commercial nonsense seemed nearly unbearable to me.
</p>
<br /><br />

<p class="noIndent">
A few weeks later I am on the way, as I had intended, for my second visit to Theresienstadt. This time a German friend takes me there in her car. Frau H. devotes her intermittent sojourns in Prague to intensive research of the cultural activities in the ghetto. As we chat, I manage to pay only fleeting attention to the awful gaggle of dwarfs along the road. However, looking another way is pretty much impossible, since the mini-regiments of this recent invasion of gnomes have taken position shoulder to shoulder on both sides of highway E55&#x02014;the stretch that has become famous in recent years for its infamous border-crossing sex tourism&#x02014;with dwarfs grinning at travelers from the left and the right.
</p>

<p>
Around 11 <small class="caps">A.M.</small> we reach the first fortress wall and pass by the former Sudeten Barracks, so called by the Nazi occupiers, not by the Czechoslovaks they had forced to leave. Originally it had been built as an arsenal, which was nothing out of the ordinary in a garrison town. But at the end of November 1941, in the close vicinity of the Berlin liaison office, the first transport was housed there, the so-called <i>Aufbaukommando</i> or construction commando, because now the whole town was to be transformed. The disturbed Jewish men, whose absurd task it was to make an international ghetto out of a provincial Bohemian town, found no one in the street whenever and wherever they were sent to do their job, which shook them up further. No one had told them, of course, that everyone had been forced out. They were told nothing. They were called up, packed up, shipped off and unloaded. What would be lurking there in the eerily deserted buildings, which spook would play its dreadful tricks between the old fortress walls? They looked around in fear. No one in the street. What could that mean? What fate was in store for them in that eerie place? Luckily they could envision only the imaginable.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
At that time, by the way, there also was an Aussig barrack in Theresienstadt. It was an assembly point for the processing of transports in the "dead of the night," a sort of clothing depot, which gradually filled up with the possessions of the inmates. If each of the thousands and ten thousands left only one dress, once pair of shoes, if each child left just one toy, there must have been piles of clothes, mountains of shoes, heaps of books and fabulous quantities of dolls and other toys in the central storage room of the Aussig barrack. But there was certainly nothing fabulous about this place.
</p>

<p>
Another barrack&#x02014;named Hohenelber after the village in the Riesengebirge [now Krono&#x00161;e mountains] housed the main hospital, where the interned physicians fought for every single life as if they did not know how short-lived they would all be around here. At that time there also was one Bodenhauser barrack that served as an armory. I don't know, nor do I have an explanation for the reason behind the specific name of each object. Perhaps the gentlemen of the occupation administration wanted to award those towns for their good efforts in realizing the wishful motto: <i>Heim ins Reich</i> ("Home to the Reich")? I really don't know.
</p>

<p>
"Why on earth would they have picked local Sudeten German names for these horror buildings?" Frau H. wondered that same moment as we were passing these complexes. "Is this what the local Nazis wanted?"
</p>

<p>
"Not really," I replied, "even though, at that time, in 1941, they were still deluded by expectations of victory. But they also established 'real' German barracks, as it were, a Dresden barrack for women, a Magdeburg ward for the Council of Jewish Elders under the supervision of the SS, a Hamburg building which was occupied primarily by Jewish people from Holland. That's also where they had the so-called 'lock' for the transports to the East."
</p>

<p>
Frau H. steps on the brake and looks into my face.
</p>

<p>
"You are saying this so matter-of-factly. Without a trace of hatred in your voice."
</p>

<p>
"Hatred? That won't do any good. It just sours life."
</p>

<p>
"And mourning?"
</p>

<p>
"Mourning remains, it fills every corner of the soul. If one knows that, one can deal with it. Mourning doesn't hate and it doesn't forgive, it is quiet and deep down. Touched by it, one can almost live life more fully . . . Here is the town hall."
</p>

<p>
Frau H. parks the car, we get out. We look at the rectangular town green, framed by trees. Deserted. Only one lonely man is sitting on a bench, an older man in a grey suit. Sitting there, looking nowhere in particular and . . .
</p>

<p>
No, it couldn't be. I have met this man before, right here. Does he come to this bench every day? Does he have to come? Why? Does he relax in this friendly spot or is it the mourning deep down in his soul which brings him here again and again? With a strikingly delicate hand not disred by manual labor the man is drawing his invisible circles in the air. One, two circles, followed by a short break and then again, one, two circles. Why? A question without an answer.
</p>

<p>
"We have to go in," Frau H. gently touches my arm, "the mayor must be waiting for us already."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course," I say. "I am glad you are here with me."

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The mayor, who has known Frau H. from earlier meetings, welcomes us graciously, gives me all the information, talks openly about her concerns. The conversation proceeds calmly, to the point, over cups of coffee.
</p>

<p>
I look at the face of the woman talking to me. She must be in her late forties, too young to remember the war and the horrible fate of this town. Now she carries a large part of the responsibility for it. She regrets that she can't do what's necessary to improve the environment, because the funds provided for this purpose aren't enough. There is more money for the upkeep of the Memorial, she notes, from different sources, of course, and that's perfectly alright. Still, I can hear a touch of bitterness in her voice. She seems to regret that quite a bit is being done for the dead and not enough for the living town. Since the garrison has been vacant&#x02014;its last residents were the soldiers of the "brotherly" Soviet occupation force that invaded in 1968&#x02014;there are hardly any employment opportunities in Theresienstadt.
</p>

<p>
My ears prick up: A town hardly able to scrape by if it isn't filled with soldiers? How strange.
</p>

<p>
"We have a few new job opportunities in the psychiatric clinic," the mayor tells us. Maybe she noticed my astonishment. "It's a Prague institution that moved here."
</p>

<p>
"Out here?" I picture the man on the town green. "Psychiatric patients?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," says the mayor and adds reassuringly: "But only harmless cases, depression and such. They aren't dangerous at all; after all, they bring us a few jobs and they increase our inhabitants by about two hundred and fifty."
</p>

<p>
Two hundred and fifty psychically damaged people. I get up and walk to the window. The man is still sitting on the bench, drawing his circles.
</p>

<p>
"Can Theresienstadt be the right place to cure depression?" I thought out loud.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you know," the mayor shakes her head a bit helplessly, "most of the patients don't even understand where they are. And there are highly educated personalities among them, professors and such. You come across them in town. When it's warm, they are sitting on the benches. Quite possibly one of them is there right now. They are very quiet and don't harm anyone."
</p>

<p>
I thank her for the conversation. Frau H. still needs to discuss with her a few details concerning an upcoming concert of composers from Theresienstadt.
</p>

<p>
The wooden staircase creaks a bit under my feet as I walk down. On the town square I sit down next to the man on the bench.
</p>

<p>
"Good day."
</p>

<p>
He gives me a blank look. Is he one of those highly educated personalities, one of the professors? Is his personal drama connected to the tragedy that still remains locked inside those buildings?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, the man turns to me. I look in his intelligent, infinitely sad face with its two lifeless eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," he says quietly, "good day. Thank you."
</p>

<p>
That's all. Then he turns back inside himself, drawing his endless circles with his delicate hand. I sit quietly next to him and suddenly I think I see the man in the bustling Prague street. In his restlessness, he too kept drawing the same circles. Why?

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Finally I get up, apparently unnoticed by my companion on the bench, and I look around. No one in the street. Only one mentally disturbed person. Theresienstadt, half a century after its liberation. The town square with its green, overshadowed by trees, was also deserted during the ghetto years. The men and women with the yellow Star of David on their chests, herded together in the various barracks, making their way with great effort through the crowded streets, were not allowed to enter the expansive square until 1944, one year before the inevitable collapse of Hitler's regime. That was when they expected the visit of a commission from the International Red Cross. For the occasion, all of Theresienstadt was "humanized" like a stage set. Only death didn't want to play along. It stuck to its daily activity.
</p>

<p>
For years I had avoided&#x02014;or, to put it more honestly, rejected all commemorative events, reverent cultural presentations or political manifestations in this town. My father died here of scarlet fever shortly after his internment. All I know about my older sister is that she and her eight-year-old son died in the gas chambers somewhere in Poland. I never found out where, and it would not have changed anything about this weighty fact. My younger sister's last journey took her from the Gestapo headquarters in Prague via the concentration camp of Ravensbr&#x000FC;ck to her death in Birkenau. And my mother . . .
</p>

<p>
My mother was a trained dressmaker. She never really practiced her profession until it was put to use in this place. She was ordered to work in the ironing room. After the war I was told by one of my former colleagues, who had been a member of the Jewish self-government (though sickly all the years I knew her, she had survived the dirt, the constant fear, the epidemics):
</p>

<p>
One day she saw the name of my mother on the list of the next transport to Auschwitz. Immediately, she took action. She got the Council of Elders to issue a document that stated that my mother was urgently needed in the ironing room (where the uniforms were pressed). Literally at the last moment she ran with it to the ramp, where the train was ready for the deportation. My mother was taken out of the line and ordered back into the ironing room.
</p>

<p>
But a few weeks later it started all over again. Again the woman found my mother's name on the fateful list. Again she took immediate action, again she rushed to the ramp, where my mother with all the others ordered onto this transport were standing in front of the cattle train, ready to board.
</p>

<p>
"I waved from afar with the life-saving paper, but your mother only shook her head and didn't move. She thanked me," the woman quietly reported after the war, "and then she climbed into the car. She knew that the transport had to be complete. If she had stayed behind, someone else would have had to go."
</p>

<p>
"Did she know what happened to my sisters?"
</p>

<p>
The woman shrugged her shoulders. "We didn't talk about that. But once I saw her almost beaming. That was when she told me that you were safe."
</p>

<p>
I was struck to the core. Not that my safety was all that assured at that time, but still. Having survived all one's loved ones is hard to bear. One often shudders at one's own fate in view of such an undeserved gift. That's when the thought of my mother's face lighting up for a moment brought unexpected consolation.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
But I never ever wanted to go to Theresienstadt. And now I am here. Now I am here and I think I hear the dragging of resigned steps, the whispers of young people still resonating with indefatigable expectations and dreams, the chatter of unsuspecting children, the whispered prayers of the faithful desperately imploring their God who didn't seem to hear them, the hearses creaking under their loads.
</p>

<p>
Behind the row of trees facing the bench with the quiet man rises the Church of the Resurrection of the Lord. Here? In this garrison town turned monster ghetto, originally founded by the Empress Maria Theresia&#x02014;surely, this is not the place where the Jew Jesus Christ could come back to life. Here, his guards would have caught him right away, they would have tortured him again, killing him a thousand times. "<i>Rex Judaearum"</i> reads the gilded inscription underneath Christ's image on Prague's Charles Bridge. The King of the Jews&#x02014;in Theresienstadt?
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, the church on the square, the Theresienstadt Square of the Czechoslovakian Army (that name no longer corresponds with the present either) isn't all that old. Though built only in the nineteenth century, its vaulted ceiling has dangerous cracks. To prevent it from collapsing it would have to be thoroughly supported and renovated. The mayor also mentioned this concern, adding quickly that she is firmly resolved to find the necessary money, no trifle to be sure, since the restored church would also serve as a concert hall. The works of composers imprisoned and for the most part also murdered in Theresienstadt would be performed here.
</p>

<p>
"Everything requires money," sighed the woman in the town hall, "lots of money&#x02014;and also many diligent hands. But as you can see yourself, there are not many people, and there certainly isn't any money."
</p>

<p>
Her words suddenly brought back the roadside dwarfs. Their fairy-tale brothers used to be quite diligent, now they could get to work in the deserted town, and they'd better find a pot of gold. Unfortunately, their commercial copies along Route E55 will hardly come up with such magic deeds.
</p>

<p>
The epoch now gradually fading after the passage of half a century was marked by some minor events, besides the big ones, that, aside from their brutality, were downright absurd. When Joseph II, one of the many children of Empress Maria Theresia, initiated the construction of this fortress at the confluence of the rivers Elbe [now Labe] and Eger [now Ohre], he wanted to protect Bohemia against hostile invasions from the northwest. Was that a reasonable project? No doubt. It certainly made sense to his imperial mother and co-ruler, after whom the town was named. To protect lovely Bohemia.
</p>

<p>
Decades, centuries went by. The fortress of Theresienstadt was no obstacle to modern raids of Bohemia. When the Germans occupied the country and the Nazis, both native and from across the border, converted it to its new function, it became the setting for yet another, most grotesque atrocity.
</p>

<p>
After World War I, the young Czechoslovakian Republic decided to honor the sons who had died for its freedom and independence with a Grave of the Unknown Soldier. The remains of Czech soldiers were deposited in the chapel of Prague's Old Town Hall together with a handful of earth from various battlefields.
</p>

<p>
But they were not yet to find eternal peace. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
A place of honor for the men who fought for the establishment and independence of Czechoslovakia was unacceptable to the occupants of 1939. During the night from 22 to 23 October 1941, eight men under the leadership of one SS man Klein entered the chapel, cut open the zinc tomb and the wooden coffin, and brought what they found there to the Prague Gestapo headquarters in Bredauer Street. It's hard to explain the reasons for this strange undertaking. Did they expect to find weapons or even a treasure in the tomb? Maybe. However, the chapter of unreason was not yet finished with the moving of the bones. In April 1945, when the majority of tormented Europeans found themselves liberated from the terror of oppression, the Gestapo transferred the robbed and desecrated Grave of the Unknown Soldier to the Little Fortress in Theresienstadt. What better place for freedom-loving citizens than this proven prison, which had been degraded as the site of death of an entire human community. This is where the spoils of Prague's Old Town Hall were buried hastily in a secret place shortly before the end of the war. Buried and never found again.
</p>

<p>
That too is part of the heavy historic burden of the small town between the gentle slopes of northwestern Bohemia, the town named after an Austrian empress whose initials grace the municipal code of arms to this day.
</p>

<p>
During my second visit, I again avoid the Ghetto Museum. Two foreign busses are parked in front of its entrance, one from Germany, the other from Poland. I simply can't bear to look at the display of drawings, paintings and photographs of those forcefully interned here, squeezed between groups of tourists. And what if I suddenly were to stand in front of the face of my grandmother or my mother . . .
</p>

<p>
To get to the Little Fortress, one has to cross to the other side of the River Eger. After a few steps on the stone bridge I go to the railing and look upstream. That's the place&#x02014;that is where the ashes of those burnt in the crematorium were dumped into the river. Did they sink to the bottom, are they still there or were they swept away by a merciful wave that carried them through hostile Germany towards their own final solution&#x02014;giving the last remains of those martyred people the unlimited freedom of the open ocean?
</p>

<p>
"The Little Fortress." That doesn't sound so bad, almost friendly. But the massive, reddish wall along Princip Road, squatting there in front of me, cowering in the landscape, as it were, doesn't make a trustworthy impression at all. The glaring, black-and-white masonry around the main gate is not in the least bit inviting, but rather terrifying. Like a shrill scream in the silence all around. Well, one can't expect anything inviting from a fortress, even if it's just a little one. This one has an especially sinister past. During World War I, the Serbian students who assassunated Ferdinand d'Este, the Austrian successor to the throne, and his wife Sophie, were imprisoned there. During the Czechoslovakian Republic the Little Fortress served as a military jail and during World War II as the prison of the Prague Gestapo. A truly terrible fate. And now?
</p>

<p>
No one in the street and no one in the Little Fortress either. But the courtyards, the blocks and the cells are there and with them everything that had been committed and suffered here. Yet only my steps echo across the stone pavement, only my heart pounds in such a fright that I can actually hear it, only my eyes trying to look away still 

<b></b>

have to look into the dark cells, between the thick bars, at the narrow wooden planks. I certainly am not a newcomer to this environment, I can recognize a prison in one breath, I can smell what's no longer there, I can feel the cold, the hunger and the thirst the people in here were exposed to. Also their fear and their desperation.
</p>

<p>
During the past years, to be sure, the permanent exhibit and the gallery in the former SS barracks opened the eyes of many people to the unbelievable events in this place. But I don't have to go in. I don't want to see the former workshops in courtyard II either. (Was this where the ironing room was located?) And I certainly don't want to see the execution site of Czech resistance ters and Jews from half of Europe. I know people who had to die here. Fortunately, I also know some who were liberated.
</p>

<p>
Who knows why on this dreary, trampled down, mercilessly hard floor I worriedly asked myself: Why did the man on the town square of Theresienstadt draw his constant invisible, closed circles in the air? Why did he have to draw them endlessly? And the man I met on that bright carefree early-summer morning in Prague, with the same obsessive compulsion, where did he come from and where did he belong? Had he also been interred here? Or did he have a similar fate in another place? Are both of them ting their inescapable captivity? Could they be drawing their robbed, locked-in freedom? Is the restlessness of the man on the lonely bench in Theresienstadt the same as the other's on the overcrowded street in Prague? Is there consolation for them? Or liberation even from their nightmares?
</p>

<p>
On the entangled roads of memory those unanswerable questions suddenly bring back to my mind the young man in the purple T-shirt, his agitated voice during the colloquium I interpreted at the local town hall. If this young German chose to come here, of all places, if all the other young people with their justified outrage and resolve freely speak up here, in this place, ask their questions and state their demands, then even Theresienstadt can finally begin to breathe and believe in a future. Then maybe even the restless hands can find some peace.
</p>

<p>
No one in the street. Even that will change some day. The fairy-tale dwarfs will have nothing to do with it, only the people, the people.
