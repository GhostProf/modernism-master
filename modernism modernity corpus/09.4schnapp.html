<p>
Down with professors!
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 The slogan resounds throughout the early manifestos of Italian Futurism,
 underscoring the movement's two-pronged assault on the historicist cult
 of the past and the positivist culture of scientific rationality. From
 the front page of <i>Le ro,</i> the 1909 Founding Manifesto had
 promised not only to destroy the institutions of memory ("museums,
 libraries, and academies of all sorts") but also to free Italy "from its
 fetid cancer of professors, archeologists, ciceros and antiquarians"
 (<i>TIF,</i> 11). Five years later, in the spring of 1914, this
 polemic was alive and well, as attested by a mock funeral for "the
 pass&eacute;ist philosopher" Benedetto Croce held in the Sprovieri
 Gallery in Rome. A large papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; head "sculpted by
 means of slaps" was paraded about the gallery on a worm-eaten book
 while the painter Giacomo Balla rang a cowbell and emitted the sounds
 <i>nyeeet-nyeeeet</i>&#8212;a hybrid of sheep bleats and Russian
 "nays." For his part, Marinetti pronounced a funeral oration that
 justified the sculptor's violent technique by citing the professor's
 rotten breath and tongue, the potatoes and onions fermenting in his
 brain, and his capacity to kill genius and to stink up even the divine
 Roman springtime. The stench was such, he claimed in his valediction,
 that, in order not to wretch, he needed to light a cigarette. (A
 cigarette was lit and the attack of nausea was nipped in the bud.)
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

<p>
Even when World War I was five years away, there was never any doubt
that the "fetid cancer" that was filling Italian minds with potatoes
and onions was a Teutonic export, even if championed

<b></b>

by the likes of Croce. The Futurist offensive against the old Italy thus
necessarily had a northern neighbor in its sights: "We combat Germanic
culture, not in order to defend Latin culture, but in order to defeat
these two equally noxious cultures in the name of the contemporary Italian
creative genius. Our answer to [Theodor] Mommsen and Benedetto Croce is
the Italian <i>scugnizzo</i> [street-urchin]" (<i>TIF,</i> 336). In the
place of the Neapolitan germanophile, Futurism embraced the legendary
Italian double of the Brazilian <i>meninho da rua</i>: a trickster,
lawbreaker, and troublemaker, and a street-guerrilla who lived for the
present alone, whose laboratory and library were the modern urban jungle.

<p>
Marinetti was, of course, a most improbable <i>scugnizzo</i>, having
earned a degree in law from the University of Genoa, gained acclaim in
France for works such as <i>La Conqu&ecirc;te des &eacute;toiles</i>
 and the Jarry-esque <i>Le Roi Bombance</i> , and having
inherited a considerable fortune from his father Enrico.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 But with the <i>scugnizzo</i>-ideal firmly in mind and armed with
 abundant street smarts, he did everything within his powers to promote
 the fame and fortune of the Futurist movement from the moment of its
 birth to the time of his death in 1944 at the age of 68 (the result
 of a heart condition, developed in the wake of a voluntary stint on
 the Russian front). Among his most characteristic techniques was the
 meticulous and systematic compilation of press clippings, essays,
 and books concerning Futurism and the reception of his work. Whether
 such materials were favorable or unfavorable mattered less than
 their immediate use-value or potential to be recycled in movement
 publications. Much as in today's film advertisements, Marinetti
 would lift the most tenuous sliver of praise from a wholly negative
 context in order to use it for promotional purposes. In this manner his
 Futurist propaganda machine abrogated all of the movement's founding
 principles in the process of documenting its conquests. Words of praise
 from eminent res, however faint, or the right sort of shocked
 and hidebound words of criticism were viewed as equally valuable in
 buttressing Futurism's claim that it represented the central force of
 renewal in contemporary life. Little did it matter that they should
 issue forth from the most fetid potato- and onion-brained members of
 the professoriate, such as Croce, Mommsen, or even Karl Vossler.

<p>
In the spring of 1914, probably during one of his German speaking tours,
Marinetti became aware that, in the course of extending the scope of
his already renowned <i>Italienische Literaturgeschichte</i> (1900; 2nd
ed. 1908), Vossler had given a series of public lectures at the Frankfurt
<i>Freies deutsches Hochstift</i> in which he had concluded with a brief
discussion of Futurism's impact on the Italian literary scene.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Vossler occupied the chair in Romance Philology at the University of
 Munich as of 1911 and, not being an expert on contemporary literature,
 had been forced to scramble. (He confessed to Croce that "I'm reading
 fast and furiously when I can so as to bone up a bit.")
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Well received, the lectures were expanded and published in May of that
 same year as <i>Italienische Literatur der Gegenwart von der Romantik
 zum Futurismus.</i> The book version consisted in a chronologically
 ordered sequence of case studies extending from Alessandro Manzoni to
 Giovanni Pascoli to Gabriele D'Annunzio, and closed not with Futurism,
 but with an entirely new coda: a full chapter dedicated to Croce,

<b></b>

the great "renewer of aesthetics and literary criticism" to whose critical
writings, Vossler proclaimed, "I owe almost everything."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 (The treatment of Futurism, expanded to ten paragraphs, was wedged into
 the conclusion of the D'Annunzio chapter.) This Crocean teleology,
 intended from the start but absent from the lectures, may seem
 unpromising from a Futurist perspective. Not reading German and
 acquainted only with the book's title, Marinetti didn't know better. But
 he knew that Vossler was a re of enormous prestige thanks to the
 recent appearance in Italian translation of his <i>Positivismus und
 Idealismus in der Sprachwissenschaft</i>  and of his commented
 edition of Dante's <i>Commedia.</i>
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 In the first of these, a ferocious antipositivist polemic, combined with
 a claim that individual artistic creation represented the essence of
 human language (and, therefore, the basis for all linguistic inquiry),
 might well have seemed in harmony with the values of a movement that,
 despite its commitment to industrial civilization and mechanical
 reproduction, never tired in asserting the superiority and autonomy
 of art. In any event, Marinetti mobilized in the usual manner, dashing
 off a letter with accompanying Futurist enclosures.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
Vossler's reply is preserved in Yale University's Beinecke Rare Books
Library. Dated 28 July 1914, the fateful day of Austria-Hungary's
declaration of war against Serbia, it starts by staging its own little
funeral:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
My dear Marinetti,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have asked my publisher to send you a copy of the little volume that
interests you [<i>Italienische Literatur der Gegenwart</i>]. But you
will surely be disappointed because it treats Futurism not as a new
beginning but rather as the final expression of a movement that starts
with Romanticism. In short, I'm sorry to have to say so, but it judges
Futurism from a pass&eacute;ist standpoint. As a matter of fact, my
view is that Futurism has within it something that has already come and
gone, something dead or, better, still-born: to wit, the same ironic and
playful sense of humor [<i>umorismo</i>] with respect to the real that,
though stale as could be, can be found in the Romantics, especially the
German Romantics. The latter informs Schelling's theory and program and
the art and style of the Schlegels, Hoffman, etc.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am deeply persuaded that life is anything but a game. Which is to say
that I <i>believe</i> in life and that I approach it with the utmost
seriousness. I observe that Futurism also has a serious, vital side, fed
principally by the sense of tedium it feels when confronted by aesthetes
and dilettantes like Anatole France and the Dannunzians. It won't be easy
to kill them off or to bury them, but if anyone can accomplish the task,
I think you are the ones. The fiercest humor [<i>umorismo</i>], the most
biting irony, the most gleeful kicks in the shin are all befitting of
and appropriate to this labor of destruction. But when you do battle
against everything old, even libraries, I'm no longer with you. Modern
life is a tree that needs to push ever higher and higher and, for this
very reason, it needs to plunge ever more robust roots into the soil of
tradition, into the past. We professors of history are the hidden heels,
the underground veins, the subtle threads that take suck and nourishment
from these roots. And even among you Futurists, there is a tendency
towards historical recurrence, towards a return to so-called "prehistoric"
primitive art, especially in the domain of painting. Your proposals and
efforts to create words-in-freedom and the wireless imagination also
involve a return to a type of art that has something antediluvian about
it ("antediluvian" in the best sense of the word). It is this strain of
primitivism in your art that bodes best for the future, in my view. Go
back to the art of Negroes and

<b></b>

gorillas. Why not? To justify your style you claim that poets and
audiences are old friends who understand one another with a mere
wink or nod: without syntax, without connective ties [<i>fili</i>],
without logical argumentation [<i>ragionamenti</i>]. True, but only
of the primitive state that you wish to revive. It is also true that
pure lyricism has no need for temporal perspective or for spatial
proportion. If there's a defect in your program, it consists in the fact
that it remains a program (or, rather, that it strives to present itself
as such). Techniques can't simply be decreed. Every poet has to find
and elaborate his own. But at its core your program itself is a form
of poetry, which is to say song, a song about song [<i>un canto sopra
un canto</i>]. The theories that a song contains cannot be discussed;
they can only be savored. This is all I have to say at this point. Maybe
some day or other I'll write an interpretive article on Futurism. But
my ideas aren't limpid or sober enough quite yet. After all, a high
degree of sobriety is required to interpret the enthusiasms, mysticisms
and intoxications of your movement. Thus far no one has attained such
sobriety and, unsurprisingly, you yourselves least of all, because poets
are fated to remain ineffable enigmas to themselves.

<p align="right">
Yours sincerely,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    K. Vossler
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

</blockquote>

<p>
Though the letter opens with harsh criticisms comparable to those found
in the 1914 volume&#8212;the book reduces D'Annunzio to a mere master of
commercial self-advertisement and casts the Futurists as merry pranksters
[<i>Spassv&ouml;gel</i>] who have taken the "decomposition of real
consciousness into the dream of art . . . to the ultimate extreme of
absurdity"&#8212;it closes on a friendlier note.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 A nadir is marked with Vossler's identification of Futurist
 words-in-freedom poetry with "Negro art" and gorilla grunts. But
 then comes a sudden swerve towards recognition that Marinetti's
 theorizations are themselves meta-lyrics (literally "a song <i>on
 top of</i> a song"): lyrics that perhaps are not exalted enough to be
 treated as philosophical utterances, yet tasty all the same.

<p>
Just how amicable is this swerve? Only slightly so. A passage from
<i>Italienische Literatur der Gegenwart</i> suggests that the conflict
that structures Vossler's letter is not reducible to that over whether
it is Crocean pass&eacute;ists or Marinettian Futurists who are truly
still-born, or simply to the opposition between humor and seriousness,
drunken poets on a destructive rampage and sober professors of history
patiently absorbing the juices of tradition at the root of the tree of
modern life. Rather, such literary skirmishes appear enfolded within
the impending Franco-Italian/German hostilities. The seriousness and
sobriety repeatedly celebrated in the letter are distinctively German
attributes, attributes that must be defended because, according to the
book, they are under attack: the jocular Marinetti, Vossler insists,
"writes French better than Italian" and "considers <i>the serious German
people</i> an inferior race."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 Paradoxically, this explicit apology for German sobriety and implicit
 critique of Franco-Italian insobriety admits some leakage. Whereas
 in the book Futurism's predecessors were only said to be French and
 English, in the letter they become (presumably unserious) Germans
 of the ilk of Schelling, Schlegel, and Hoffman or of the oddballs
 [<i>Querk&ouml;pfe</i>] that cheered Marinetti in Berlin.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 Whereas in the book the Futurists were the unabashed advocates of
 turning hospitals and cemeteries into night clubs, in the letter they
 too, despite themselves, are granted a slice of the <i>Sachertorte</i>
 of seriousness. Finally, whereas

<b></b>

in the book the philosopher of language was the stolid champion of the
"hard and modest labor" that he attributes to the "greater and better
portion of the [Italian] populace" that, unlike the Futurists, is immune
to "megalomaniacal pan-Italian imperial dreams," in the letter he himself
seems to have succumbed to the ambient mirth.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Despite the fact that he takes life "terribly seriously," his ideas
 are not (as yet) so limpid and sober as to permit the drafting of an
 interpretive article.

<p>
Limpidity and sobriety never came. The essay in question was never
written.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Nor did Marinetti ever find a use for Vossler's criticism or praise. The
 exchange proved something of a draw, though; with the outbreak of the
 Great War, tipsy gorillas assumed a place of honor atop the tree of
 modern life.

<i>Contro i professori</i> is the literal title of a text dating
from May 1910 that Marinetti would later anthologize in <i>Guerra
sola igiene del mondo.</i> See Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, <i>Teoria e
invenzione futurista,</i> I. Meridiani, ed. Luciano de Maria (Milan:

The event was described in <i>Lacerba</i> by an anonymous commentator:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The poet Radiante [Revillo Cappari] and the painter [Fortunato] Depero
(with their heads concealed within huge black tubes with eye- and
nose-holes cut out) were carrying the head of the philosopher on their
shoulders propped atop a worm-eaten book along the sides of which hung two
arms made of rope and hands made of paper. The painter Balla, disguised as
a sexton, brandished a paint brush like a torch and went about irregularly
beating a cowbell, intoning in a nasal voice: <i>nyeeet-nyeeet</i>.

happening see Claudia Salaris, <i>Marinetti. Arte e vita futurista</i>

The lectures took place in March and were published as "&Uuml;ber neuere
italienische Literatur" in the 1914-15 edition of the <i>Jahrbuch des
Freien Deutschen Hochstifts.</i> The discussion of Futurism is limited
to two paragraphs on pp. 19-20.

<p>
<a name="FOOT5" href="#REF5">5</a>.
The entire passage reads: ". . . I'm sorry to have partly lost contact
with things Italian, especially now that I am preparing a series of
lectures on modern Italian literature to be presented in Frankfurt. I'm
hoping they will prove good enough to be published. I'm reading
fast and furiously when I can so as to bone up a bit." Karl Vossler,

<a name="FOOT6" href="#REF6">6</a>.
"I must acknowledge that, as is evident from my bibliography, I owe
almost everything to the outstanding critical works on contemporary
Italian literature authored by Benedetto Croce that have been appearing
over the last twelve years in his review <i>La Critica.</i>" See
Vossler,"Vorwort," in <i>Italienische Literatur der Gegenwart von
der Romantik zum Futurismus</i> (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1914), 5;
hereafter abbreviated as <i>ILG.</i> "Renewal of Aesthetics and Literary
Criticism&#8212;Benedetto Croce" [<i>Erneuerung der &auml;sthetik und
literarischen Kritik&#8212;Benedetto Croce</i>] is the title of the book's
final chapter. Croce was duly touched by this tribute and replied, "Your
exposition is so accurate that at many junctures&#8212;I'm not saying
this to flatter you, but because it's the truth&#8212;you have illuminated
me about myself." Croce to Vossler, 8 June 1914, <i>CCV,</i> 183.

<p>
<a name="FOOT7" href="#REF7">7</a>.
Vossler's reputation had been further enhanced by publications including
his 1904 study of the philosophical groundings of the <i>dolce stil
nuovo</i> and various studies of the Troubador tradition (most recently
of Marcabru).

The Italian original reads:




<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Carissimo Marinetti,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ho dato ordine al mio editore che vi spedisca una copia del volumetto
che vi interessa. Ma sar&agrave; una delusione per voi, perch&egrave;
il futurismo vi &egrave; considerato solo come il punto finale d'un
movimento che comincia col romanticismo, non come principio d'un altro
movimento. Insomma, vi &egrave; giudicato, mi dispiace doverlo dire,
passatisticamente. Infatti, mi pare che c'&egrave; qualche cosa nel
futurismo che &egrave; gi&agrave; passata, gi&agrave; morta ossia nata
morta ed &egrave; specialmente quell'umorismo ironico e giocarellone
dinnanzi alla realt&agrave;, cosa stantivissima che si trova tale e quale
nei romantici specialmente tedeschi; vi si trova come teoria e programma
nello Schelling e come arte e stile negli Schlegel, Hoffman, ecc.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Io sono profondamente convinto che la vita &egrave; tutt'altra cosa che
un gioco, cio&egrave; <i>credo</i> alla vita e la prendo terribilmente sul
serio. Vedo che anche nel futurismo c'&egrave; il lato serio, cio&egrave;
vitale, ed &egrave;, prima di tutto, il tedio che voi provate contro
gli esteti e dilettanti, contro gli Anatole France e i D'Annunziani; e
se c'&egrave; qualcosa che riesce ad ammazzarli e seppellirli&#8212;cosa
difficile assai&#8212;credo che siate voi. In questo lavoro di distruzione
ci pu&ograve; essere e sta benissimo il pi&ugrave; feroce umorismo, la
pi&ugrave; sarcastica ironia, i pi&ugrave; divertenti calci. Ma se ve la
pigliate con qualsiasi cosa vecchia e perfino con le biblioteche, non ci
sto pi&ugrave;. La vita moderna &egrave; un albero che deve spingersi
sempre pi&ugrave; in alto e appunto perci&ograve; deve sprofondare
le sue radici anche pi&ugrave; forti nel suolo della tradizione, del
passato. Noi professori di storia siamo i tacchi nascosti sotterranei
fili e filetti succhianti e poppanti della radice. E in voi futuristi
stessi c'&egrave; una tendenza al ricorso storico, alle arti primitive
cosidette preistoriche, specie nella pittura. Nel programma e tentativo
vostro delle parole in libert&agrave; e dell'immaginazione senza fili vi
&egrave; un ritorno ad un genere d'arte che ha dell'antediluviano (sia
inteso in senso buono). Ed &egrave; appunto questa primitivit&agrave;
della vostra arte che me ne sembra il migliore augurio. Tornate pure
all'arte dei negri e dei gorilla, non sar&agrave; male. Voi dite per
giustificare il vostro stile che il poeta e il pubblico son amici
vecchi che s'intendono con un cenno, senza sintassi, senza fili, senza
ragionamenti. Ci&ograve; &egrave; vero per lo stato primitivo che volete
ripristinare. Ed &egrave; anche vero che il lirismo puro non ha bisogno
di prospettive temporali n&egrave; di proporzioni spaziali. Se c'&egrave;
un torto nel vostro programma &egrave; di essere un programma, cio&egrave;
di darsene la sembianza. La tecnica non si pu&ograve; proclamare; ogni
poeta deve trovarsela ed inventarsela da se. Ma in fondo il vostro
programma &egrave; una poesia, &egrave; un canto anch'esso, un canto
sopra un canto. Le teorie contenute in un canto non si discutono, si
gustano. Ecco quanto saprei per ora dirvi. Pu&ograve; essere che un giorno
o l'altro io scriva un articolo interpretativo sul Futurismo. Ma finora le
mie idee non sono ancora abbastanza nette e sobrie. Perch&egrave; bisogna
essere molto sobrio per poter interpretare gli entusiasmi, i misticismi
e le ebbrezze del vostro movimento. Finora mi pare che nessuno abbia
raggiunto questa sobriet&agrave; e voi stessi, come &egrave; naturale,
meno di tutti poich&egrave; il poeta &egrave; a se stesso il pi&ugrave;
ineffabile enigma.

<p align="right">
Abbiatemi vostro,
<br />

"Commercial advertisement [<i>Gesch&auml;ftsreklame</i>], an area in
which D'Annunzio is a true master, disorients the public and renders
ever more difficult the task of separating the good from the merely
showy [<i>des Gediegenen vom Flittergold</i>]" (<i>ILG,</i> 116). "Such
an estrangement of art from life, or better, such a decomposition of
consciousness of the real [<i>Wirtlichkeitsbewusstseins</i>] into the
artist's dream of art [<i>K&uuml;nstlertraum</i>] is today being taken
to the ultimate extreme of absurdity by the Futurists. Therein lies,
if I am not mistaken, the task, the raison d'&ecirc;tre and the purpose
[<i>Ernst</i>] of these pranksters" (<i>ILG,</i> 120).

<p>
<a name="FOOT11" href="#REF11">11</a>.
The original phrases are "der besser Franz&ouml;sisch als Italienisch
kann" (<i>ILG,</i> 120) and "<i>das ernste Volk</i> der Deutschen"
(<i>ILG,</i> 122; emphasis added). Vossler repeatedly levels the same
accusation at the Italian press in his subsequent correspondence with
Croce: "Here the grandest of spectacles is unfolding: the reawakening of
a nation of seventy million, united to a man, from the emperor on down
to the humblest rag picker. The ideas of modern socialism are merging
with those of military feudalism. Colossal social relief measures
are being implemented. Every individual lives for the collective, for
the fatherland. And to all this Italy closes its eyes, lending an ear
instead to the humanitarian phrases and empty sentimentalism of the
French." Vossler to Croce, 24 September 1914, <i>CCV,</i> 185. Vossler
published an open letter in <i>Il Giornale d'Italia</i> 3 (19 October
1914) making precisely this same point.

<p>
<a name="FOOT12" href="#REF12">12</a>.
The original reads: "Darum h&auml;lt Marinetti das ernste Volk
der Deutschen f&uuml;r eine inferiore Rasse, obgleich er in Berlin
Querk&ouml;pfe genug gefunden hat, die ihm zujauchzen" (<i>ILG,</i> 122).

<p>
<a name="FOOT13" href="#REF13">13</a>.
"This type of reaction [i.e. the revolt of the Futurists] is hopeless. One
can't escape boredom by means of games and fussing about [<i>Spielerei
und Getue</i>], but rather only through hard and modest labor. Such is the
toil being generously undertaken by the greater and better portion of the
[Italian] populace" (<i>ILG,</i> 123). "[Italy is summoned] to sell off
its art and museums to purchase instead cannons, aircraft, destroyers
and dirigibles. . . . This is how Futurism tumbles and, thanks to its
megalomaniacal pan-Italian imperial dreams, falls into the void" (ibid).

<p>
<a name="FOOT14" href="#REF14">14</a>.
Vossler returned to the topic of Futurism only in cursory fashion. The
expanded third edition of his <i>Italienische Litteraturgeschichte</i>
contains a new pair of final paragraphs culled from <i>Italienische
Literatur der Gegenwart</i> and concludes with the remark that "Italy's
entry into the World War was for these giddy individuals the biggest
party they had ever attended" ("Der Eintritt Italiens in dern Weltkrieg
war f&uuml;r diese Taumelnden das gr&ouml;sste Fest ihres Lebens"). See
Karl Vossler, <i>Italienische Litteraturgeschichte</i> (Leipzig:
G. J. G&ouml;schen, 1900; revised 3rd ed., 1916), 153. He also made
only minimal changes to the second edition of <i>Letteratura italiana
contemporanea dal romanticismo al futurismo</i> (trans. Tomaso Gnoli
[Naples: Ricciardi, 1916; revised 2nd ed., 1922]), principally in the
form of a reference to Marinetti's 1921 "Manifesto of Tactilism" and to
the ongoing productivity in Italian culture of "futurism, expressionism,
dadaism and other programmatic extravagances" (142, 147).
