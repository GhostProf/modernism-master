Introduction

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From impressionism to futurism to surrealism and beyond, the avant-garde
movements of the twentieth century seem to share a rigidly oppositional
logic. These antagonistic programs are united in their efforts to
construct authority against and through the rival claims of each
other. For each, the attempt to establish a certain authenticity, a new
perspective, a transcendent consciousness depends upon the presence of
some fallen other, some decadent or marked double. Indeed, as argued
by critics from Walter Benjamin to Rita Felski, it is this oppositional
logic that informs the avant-garde's tendency toward violence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  Avant-gardism is all too easily aligned with imperialism, with
  discourses of racial and cultural superiority, of progress and
  evolutionary advance. Similarly, it often exhibits an aggressive
  chauvinism, a hostile and repressive attitude toward the cultural
  markers of the feminine. Moreover, it is precisely this oppositional
  logic that links the avant-garde with totalitarian politics. The
  aesthetic and fascist movements of the early twentieth century are
  united in their celebration of violent renewal, by their faith in an
  aesthetic transcendence of the fallen world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  What needs to be realized, however, is that these movements, both
  aesthetic and political, tend to abandon the conventional terms
  of tyranny--order, control, stasis--for a dialectic between stasis
  and change, regulation and revolt. In other words, what defines the
  aesthetic politics of the period is a <I>romantic</I> metaphysic in
  which authority exists only by way of dissent, the center by way of
  margins, the self in and through the other. As the romantic

<B></B>

artist evokes a creative struggle of work and world, the nation
establishes itself through "war, the world's only hygiene."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  Importantly, as Russell Berman and Andrew Hewitt have argued, these
  violent dialectics move us beyond specific aesthetic and political
  regimes to a much more pervasive influence. The conflation of order and
  progress helps to affirm a specific economy. For both art and politics,
  only within the bourgeois struggle for significance is any significance
  possible--individual, national, or historical. A romantic aesthetic,
  as it is diffused throughout the social order, offers ontological
  stability to a culture driven by market relations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The British avant-garde, however, needs to be explored as part of a
larger national reaction to both bourgeois liberalism and the successive
invasions of romantic modernism from the continent. Artists such as
T. E. Hulme, Lewis, and Ezra Pound found themselves in the peculiar
position of needing to be modern after the modern had, in some ways,
already occurred. The value of their work, as they saw it, was its
recognition of the collusion between romanticism and reification. Modern
society, they argued, may now exhibit an unprecedented state of freedom,
but it has never experienced a greater standardization. Thus, throughout
<I>Blast</I>, Wyndham Lewis argues that the aesthete and the average
man have grown indistinguishable; chaos and conformity work together
to destroy social integrity. He laments a seemingly free world given
over to mechanical progress and ceaseless faddism, a world in which
"there is no revolt, it is the normal state."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  In response to this state of affairs, the British avant-garde turned
  to classicism. For them, classicism represented an artistic and social
  integrity, one that eschews bourgeois individualism and foregrounds
  the material tensions that define and delimit individuals, classes,
  and nations. The classical aesthetic, particularly in its more tragic
  aspects, begins with the chaotic energy of the romantic spirit,
  but subject and object exist in a dynamic tension that restricts the
  tendency of either to spin out of control. Worldly forces restrain and
  refine each other, producing a balanced order that is at once fluid
  and formal. The classical work of art expresses as it reinforces
  these tensions, and thus serves to halt, clarify, and redirect the
  violent production (and reproduction) of the world. It reveals as it
  challenges the material constraints of the individual and his seemingly
  free activity. In Hulme's famous formulation, "The classical poet never
  forgets this finiteness, this limit of man. He remembers always that
  he is mixed up with earth. He may jump, but he always returns back; he
  never flies away into the circumambient gas." Similarly, the classical
  work of art foregrounds discursive limitations, the symbolic coordinates
  of the individual. Again, Hulme, in his essays on political conversion,
  argues, "Beliefs are not only representations, they are also forces,
  and it is possible for one view to compel you to accept it in spite
  of your preference for another."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I hope to show that many feminists at this time, attuned to the material
and discursive structures that shape experience, turned to classicism
as a viable form of aesthetic politics. For these activists, classicism
functioned as a critique and alternative to the oppositional logic of the
avant-garde and modernity at large. Classical art spoke to the creative
tensions between the private and the public, the fallen and the pure,
worldly praxis and the work of art. Specifically, though, feminists
adopted and adapted the

<B></B>

principles of classical ritual. For them, ritual explicitly united
action and symbol, the body and its representation, and thus became
an important tool with which to reconre the terms of culturally
inscribed power. It was neither static nor reactionary, but served as a
continuous argument, a constant construction and reconstruction of those
categories that govern the social. To borrow from Jacques Ranci&egrave;re,
this form of protest can be defined as a "process of subjectivization,"
in which the individual, made <I>subject</I> to others, achieves a
provisional identity. According to Ranci&egrave;re, subjectivization is
"the formation of a one that is not a self but is the relationship of
a self to an other." For militants, this process not only established
their presence within the public sphere, but revealed the extent to
which women participated in those processes whereby subject positions
are produced and maintained. More specifically, Ranci&egrave;re argues
that, for the disempowered, subjectivization entails an "enactment"
or "demonstration" of ideal identities and positions. Insofar as this
"enactment" exposes the conditional nature of authority, it confounds
and subverts the traditional relations of power.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  For the modern militant, that performance was directed at the
  foundational principles of the bourgeois public sphere, both its
  self-serving discourse of "equality" and its exclusionary construction
  of "universality." In the words of Janet Lyon, militant ritual, like
  the manifesto form, reconceived politics as "political dramaturgy" in
  which "the concept of universal equality is not a property available
  to particular groups of people, nor a coherent ideal, but rather a
  <I>logic</I> to be used in arguments that test the viability of the
  distribution of equality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  Ultimately, women writers and activists defined the social as a
  ceaselessly creative medium, one that conditions, and is conditioned
  by, multiple identities and relations. The individual, through ritual
  performance, was able to grasp and reshape the possibilities that
  limited her experience. According to Jane Ellen Harrison, suffragette
  and classicist, "Life is doomed to make for itself moulds, break them,
  remake them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  The relationship between the individual and her society is a single,
  conscious continuum, one in which "the soul is like a bird caught in
  a cage, caught and recaught ever in new births. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The sections of this essay, then, explore the politics of classicism
as well as the relation between feminist thinkers and modernism in
general. In suffrage protest, Harrison's anthropology, and H.D.'s poetry
we find a charged matrix of worldly and aesthetic praxes. Each posits
human desire as the basis of expression, and thus each finds in ritual
a medium at once vital and static, affective and conscious. For these
activists, ritual practice both activates and defines subjects in relation
to one another. It functions as part of a generative process in which
a community as a whole can create and understand its condition. The
following three sections, however, differ in their position along
a single continuum; the essay moves from political protest to ritual
performance to the written word. The first section offers protest at its
most explicitly physical, the latter at its most textual. In this manner,
I hope to dramatize not simply the differences between these forms of
activity, but the ways in which social praxis exists as both cause and
effect of all aesthetic activity. I seek to uncover the political aspects
of what are often criticized as the most rarefied and escapist forms of
modern literature. According to Harrison, the stages of social praxis are
"life with its motor

<B></B>

reactions, the ritual copy of life with its faded reactions, the image
of the god projected by the rite, and, last, the copy of that image,
the work of art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  For the scholar and her feminist cohorts, it was precisely this
  continuum that countered the oppressive logic of modernity and its
  avant-garde.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Deeds, not words!"--a fitting motto for the militant suffrage
movement. From protests, pageants, and fisticuffs to sabotage, smuggling,
and arson, deeds defined the movement from beginning to end. For women
who had been effectively barred from public life, action was imperative
and struggle a goal. Members argued that "revolt is a great and glorious
thing in itself" and drew little distinction between "the joy of battle
and the exultation of victory."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  But, despite these claims, one cannot deny the spectacular, performative
  aspects of the campaign. Firsthand accounts reveal that punches
  and kicks were often only suggested or mimed. In fact, one of the
  very first "deeds" was nothing more than an imitation of spitting;
  as Christabel Pankhurst explained, "It was not a real spit but only,
  shall we call it, a pout, a perfectly dry purse of the mouth."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  Often, suffragettes would tie stones to their wrists or wrap them in
  paper so that, when tossed, they would not cause material damage. Axes
  rarely fell, bricks dropped limply, and flags would poke into open
  windows and doors.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  Tellingly, militants defined themselves as a "stage army" and labored
  under the knowledge that she "Who takes the eye takes all!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  According to Lisa Tickner, these forms of demonstration were understood
  as "a way of living the abstract relations and demands of politics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  Militants were well aware of the power won through representation,
  and therefore focused their efforts upon the symbolic. Thus, as I hope
  to show here, the movement ultimately attests to a mutuality of deeds
  <I>and</I> words, and the ability of such to transform the public
  sphere. Militants sought not only to exploit this mutuality, but to
  posit it as the basis of an alternative, intersubjective community.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Any history of the suffrage movement, however, must begin with the fact
that militants consistently defined their cause in opposition to the
attitudes and values of the Liberal Party. Their campaign moved well
beyond the issue of the vote; its force and appeal lay in a much wider
attack on a complex matrix of individualism, free trade, progress,
and machinery.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Countless statements and speeches made by militants denounced the flat,
  frictionless world of Liberalism, the standardized chaos of bourgeois
  individualism. Moreover, they critiqued the presumed consensus of the
  rational public sphere, which could only obscure and uphold specifically
  masculine interests. Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, for example, criticized
  Liberals for conceiving freedom as an "ideal only of opposition,
  of vested interests, of inertia, and of prejudice."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  Dora Montefiore argued that Herbert Asquith "is against the women
  because they are for peace and he is on the side of the capitalist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  As Lyon has argued, it was precisely this critique that aligned the
  militant with the British avant-garde. The militant's disgust with the
  "sluggish respectability of the 'plain man'" clearly echoed Lewis's
  attack on the "abysmal inexcusable middle-class."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  Aptly, she defines this unity as a "shared

<B></B>

sense of deep disappointment that the promises for radical change
. . . had in fact been co-opted by the modern instrumental status quo"
(<I>M</I>, 94).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was in opposition to this seemingly rational order that militants
developed their strategy, particularly its materialist emphasis. For
Emmeline Pankhurst and her followers, history had taught that reasoned
argument would only delay change and protect the status quo, while efforts
to raise public sympathy proved nothing more than regressive. Thus,
throughout the campaign, militants focused upon the effective power of
the physical, what they called life's "hard and cruel facts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  In her famous address at Hartford, for example, Pankhurst describes her
  work as an attempt "to bring enough pressure to bear upon the government
  to compel them to deal with the question of woman suffrage." She
  argues that "it is not by making people comfortable you get things
  in practical life, it is by making them uncomfortable." As a whole,
  the movement measured effectiveness in terms of size, strength, and
  duration. Protests and pageants maximized pressure and discomfort
  upon civic surroundings. A turn to arson and vandalism sought wider
  and more lasting effects. As Pankhurst told her audience, "You have
  to make more noise than anybody else, you have to fill all the papers
  more than anybody else, in fact you have to be there all the time and
  see that they don't snow you under, if you are really going to get
  your reform realized."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moreover, this materialism was aligned with decisively antiproductivist
and antiprogressivist attitudes. Militant activity typically slowed
and retarded social machinery. Opponents dismissed most tactics as mere
nuisances--scraping golf greens, painting over house numbers, home and
prison blockades.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  But larger maneuvers--refusing the census, cutting down communication
  lines, and a rather peculiar week of self-denial--began to
  reveal a pattern. These acts of insurgency replaced the passion
  and violence of romantic revolution within conscious strategies of
  obstruction. According to Pankhurst, the most effective policies worked
  to create "a very paralyzing situation. . . . an impossible situation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  Thus, upon entering the streets, militants sought to impede civic
  flows. One observer acknowledged that "More and more it became difficult
  to belittle the movement . . . which could hold up the traffic of
  London with processions two or three miles long, and decked from end
  to end with hundreds of banners, some of them of vast size. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  Similarly, in breaking shopwindows and cutting down communication lines,
  militants halted the flows of the market. Their leader explained that
  "in this effort to rouse business men . . . we entirely prevented
  stock brokers in London from telegraphing stock brokers in Glasgow,
  and vice versa; for one whole day telegraphic and telecommunication
  was entirely stopped."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  Most radically, in hunger striking, militants interfered with the
  activity of the female body itself. This weapon, the "weapon of
  self-hurt," helped not only to generate sympathy for the cause, but
  to bring "great pressure" upon an otherwise smoothly functioning nation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
  As Jane Marcus explains, "When woman, quintessential nurturer,
  refuses to eat, she cannot nurture the nation" (<I>SP,</I> 1-2,
  339). Militants thus "withheld their consent" from what was considered
  their most important role in a social economy defined precisely in
  terms of ceaseless production and consumption.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Similarly, militants consistently valorized restraint. According to
the leaders of the movement, "our words have always been, 'be patient,
exercise self-restraint, show our so-called superiors that the criticism
of women being hysterical is not true. . . .'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
  On the one hand, this emphasis countered misconceptions about the
  supposedly hysterical female body. Lyon points out that a "discourse
  of anti-sentimentality and pure objectivity" provided access to
  "universalizing discourses that had been formative in the historical
  exclusion of women. . ." (<I>M</I>, 116). But, as important, restraint
  red as a powerful antidote to a dissipated liberal community. In
  <I>The Great Scourge and How to End It,</I> for example, Christabel
  Pankhurst presents sexual restraint as a positive quality that both
  clarifies and increases human potential. The militant argues that the
  current spread of sexual disease can be directly attributed to the loose
  values of liberal society; sexual free trade and rampant reproduction
  have worked together to destroy a once healthy nation. "Men whose
  will-power fails them," she laments, "are constantly infecting and
  reinfecting the race with vile disease, and so bringing about the
  downfall of the nation!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  In this context of bodily and national dissipation, Pankhurst outlines
  a metaphysics of restraint. As in the most radical modernist work, she
  provides an intriguing economy of energy and restriction, strength and
  intellect. Reversing gendered tropes, Pankhurst argues that excessive
  male sexuality leads only to physical distress and irritability.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Incontinence res as "a waste of vital force which impoverishes
 [men's] moral nature and weakens their body." She contends that passion
 "ought to lie dormant until legitimate occasion arises for its use,
 when it will be found to exist in full natural vigour" (<I>GS,</I>
 60-1). This dynamic system extends well beyond the body to
 incorporate other practices and values. Pankhurst turns to the intellect
 and praises the "active man who directs his energies more to his brain
 and muscles than to his sensual nature" (<I>GS,</I> 59). She even
 offers a radical aesthetic theory, one we will find echoed in the work
 of Harrison and H.D. She boldly concludes that "Art is creative. Sexual
 excess is a waste of man's creative energy" (<I>GS,</I> 127).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This very logic--in its emphasis on materiality, control,
and clarity--also informs the representational strategies of
militancy. Insofar as women found their efforts hampered by stereotypes
and standards, they focused their attacks upon the discursive. As Cicely
Hamilton notes,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Like nearly all girls of my generation I was bred in the idea that my
duty and advantage was to conform to the masculine ideal of womanhood;
this or that exercise of habit was forbidden because it clashed with
the ideal, and would therefore lessen our value in masculine eyes. I
do not mean that this principle was a matter of bald statement; but as
a tradition--spoken or half-spoken--it was a constant influence on our
thoughts and a constant director of our energies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not surprisingly, Hamilton equates her turn toward feminism with a
growing suspicion of male constructed ideals and symbols, to which the
female body was meant to conform. As she explains, "I became a feminist
on the day I perceived that--according to the story--[a girl's] 'honour'
was not a moral but a physical quality. Once that was clear to me my
youthful soul rebelled. . ." (ibid.). Similarly, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence

<B></B>

argues that "The world as we know it today is ruled by law, by custom,
and by public opinion, and women are beginning to realize that it is
a man-made world in the deepest sense of the word." For her, feminism
struggled against a world in which "there is nothing that expresses the
woman's point of view. There is nothing that tallies with the woman's
soul . . . everything is arranged on a plan different from their own,
and upon a system which has taken no account of their point of view."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  One cannot overemphasize, however, that these experiences allowed
  feminists to recognize and thus focus their attack upon the material
  aspects of language. Militants adopted an aggressive symbolism, one
  committed to manipulating the effective potential of the sign. They
  fully welcomed the spectacular, using pageants, publications, and
  speeches in order to control and manipulate the process of their
  signification. As Tickner asserts, "The raison d'&ecirc;tre of the
  suffragette movement was the campaign for the vote but one of the
  aims that motivated its supporters . . . was the legitimizing of
  new representations of women. Or, more precisely, the contesting,
  modifying and restructuring of representations of women already in
  circulation or in the process of emerging" (<I>SW</I>, 172).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Several scholars have already explored the narratives and symbols of
suffrage discourse and the manner in which they helped to shape new
female identities and communities. Barbara Green, Mary Jean Corbett,
and Caroline J. Howlett have each examined how even the most unique
feminist experiences would inspire imitators, thereby influencing and
informing other subjectivities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  Most suffrage statements, Green argues, "take up the performative
  nature of identity, revealing how feminist identities are produced
  through constant reiteration or performance." She adds that even "many
  of the seemingly less dramatic writings and speeches of suffrage also
  functioned in ways that constructed an oppositional identity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  Significantly, militant "experience" always occurred within a conscious
  performative loop, one in which origins and repetitions seemed to blur,
  lost in the infinite process of reiteration. By performing certain
  values or identities in public, militants inevitably called them into
  being. In the words of Pethick-Lawrence, "While working for the idea
  of political liberty, we were individually achieving liberty of a far
  more real and vital nature."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
  The most radical example of this reiterative process was Lady Constance
  Lytton's masquerade as the fictional Jane Warton. Hoping to publicize
  the hypocrisy of the legal system, Lytton disguised herself as a
  lower-class militant and was forcibly fed in prison. Her account of
  the affair and its aftermath suggests that even the most personal,
  incommunicable aspects of her experience contained performative,
  mimetic qualities. As she writes, "To think that I who have endured
  by far the least of all the 'forcibly fed' should be making people
  wake up more than all of them. . . . It is the other more heroic and
  first ones who have really done what I <I>seem</I> to have done."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With Lytton's example, it becomes clear how difficult it is to separate
the militants' active and representational strategies. Throughout the
campaign, the militant body functioned as the site of both work and
signification. While its force was inevitably expressive, its expression
released implacable forces. Deeds and words combined in an aggressive
struggle against the cultural inscriptions of power. "The argument of the
broken pane" was perhaps the most explicit realization of this unity. In
a seemingly

<B></B>

random series of attacks on nonpartisan shops and offices, suffragettes
did their best to assert female power and make Londoners very
"uncomfortable." The attacks, however, also gave expression to the
interconnectedness of private and public spheres, particularly as that
link was informed by economics. The protest, and others of its kind,
spoke from within a dynamic matrix of power. In fact, Emmeline Pankhurst's
speeches described with increasing confidence her position within this
larger network. As she told one audience,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Your business man who reads important communication through the post
does not want his communication to be interfered with as a regular and
permanent institution. . . . Your business man, whose customers mostly are
women, does not like that in the interval of buying hats, his customers
may be breaking his shop windows; and your insurance companies won't
like to have the drain upon their resources and their profits cut down
by having to make good these insurance policies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conversely, verbal protest tended to heighten and expose reservoirs of
oppositional power. The interruption of speech evoked previously hidden
hostility from the status quo. By shouting at government meetings,
dinner parties, sporting events, and theater performances, suffragettes
not only asserted their right to participate in a discursive order,
but also heightened, and thereby gave expression to, problems that had
previously been hidden within that order. Thus, Pankhurst was able to
argue that one of the most effective militant acts consisted of nothing
more than a question. For asking a question, just as men would have
asked it, "girls were treated with violence and flung out of the meeting;
and when they held a protest meeting in the street they were arrested,
and were sent to prison, one for a week as a common criminal, and the
other for three days."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This conflation of deeds and words, power and knowledge, was most
compellingly expressed in the popular slogan "You are an argument."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
  In fact, it informed the militants' conception of suffrage. Pankhurst
  understood the vote as both "a symbol. . . . a symbol of freedom,
  a symbol of citizenship, a symbol of liberty" and "an instrument,
  something with which you can get a great many more things. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
  Most intriguingly, this intense dualism can be detected in
  Pethick-Lawrence's understanding of the law. In one of her most famous
  speeches, she defines the law as a contingent process, a changing
  matrix of force and form. She claims that "In common we have felt
  the compulsion of this Law that has brought us into association
  together and has made us part of a living pattern, woven by destiny
  in the loom of Time, to a rhythm and rune which is making the world's
  story." Echoing Christabel Pankhurst, Pethick-Lawrence defines the law
  as the result of multiple pressures and demands. It is simultaneously
  revealed and transformed by the tensions that exist between various
  subjective positions. In fact, she argues "it is by the very enemy and
  the betrayer that the law is accomplished and destiny fulfilled." One
  cannot ignore the speaker's romantic excesses, but she consistently
  subsumes her mysticism within the material world. The rhythms of force
  and form are the rhythms of history. Power is made known only because
  it is contingent and immanent: it is both experienced and understood
  through the "material substance of things," "our own bodies."

Ultimately, militancy abandoned the modern valorization of the individual
for a more closely integrated community. It critiqued the myth of
the universal subject and the empty abstractions of representational
politics in order to explore the social as a modality of various
interests and desires. The bourgeois public sphere and its seemingly
rational laws, paradoxically constructed upon principles of exclusion
and noninterference, were rejected in favor of what appeared to be
more fluid processes of exchange and mediation. Perhaps, then, the
importance of the movement exists in its awareness that modern politics
are essentially <I>negative</I> in character, founded upon the belief
that the "individual" must <I>not</I> be encroached upon. In response,
it proposed a community that was radically positive, based upon a
constructive or creative interaction between its constituents. Of course,
community of this kind does not imply ideological freedom; the continuous
negotiation of power denies the possibility of a stable, transcendent
position from which that power can be clearly evaluated. Nevertheless,
this proposed community implies a point of access from which to grasp and
perhaps reconre specific relations. According to Pethick-Lawrence,
the individual does not exist apart from the "living pattern" and only
achieves "human consciousness" within that pattern.

  It is precisely this positive sense of the limited and the contingent
  that defines modern classicism and its power for feminist thinkers. Jane
  Ellen Harrison explored this collective mode as it existed in suffrage
  protest as well as the more formalized realm of ancient ritual. Her
  work argues that power relations can be radically transred by the
  performance of public rites.

Perhaps in order to avoid charges of deviancy, and as a testament to
their intellect and learning, suffragettes often borrowed from the art
of classical antiquity. They would frequently mimic the gestures and
attitudes of the Greek heroines, their pristine strength, grace, and
justice. This turn to antiquity, however, also implies an awareness that
militant protest--in its imagery, organization, and publicity--recalled
ancient transformative rites.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  Participants often dressed in the robes of ministrants or supplicants,
  and often formalized their practical, everyday activities. Memoirs
  and narratives frequently reveal "saints," "martyrs," and even "an
  overblown Adelphi heroine."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
  Similarly, service was interpreted as a process of suffering and
  redemption, death and rebirth. According to Mary Gordon, the average
  militant was "seized and used. She was both flame and burnt offering."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
  However, it would be left to a trained scholar of antiquity to
  explain the modern politics of ancient ritual. Jane Ellen Harrison,
  self-proclaimed feminist, suffragette, and anthropologist, offers
  an explicit account of the feminist turn to classical practice. Her
  work moves away from an ideological vision of enlightened antiquity
  in order to celebrate the material activity of the ancient masses. It
  redefines the public sphere by emphasizing the desiring body and its
  ability to enact law. Harrison's work offers a serious challenge to
  the oppositional logic of the avant-garde and modernity in general,
  as it more fully links deed and word within a single ritualized praxis.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Harrison's <I>Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion</I> looks
beyond the religious myths of fifth-century Greece in order to disclose
the material conditions and motivations of their creators. According
to her, "Some of the loveliest stories the Greeks have left us will
be seen to have taken their rise, not in poetic imagination, but
in primitive, often savage, and I think, always practical ritual"
(<I>P,</I> xvii). This assertion is grounded in the conviction that
every religion is essentially "conditioned by the circumstances of its
worshippers" (<I>P,</I> 85). Myths, gods, divine names and attributes are
but reflections of the mortal world, the material conditions that govern
earthly life. According to her, "the gods are as many as the moods of the
worshipper, i.e. as his thoughts about his gods. If he is kind, they are
Kindly Ones; when he feels vengeful, they are Vengeful Ones" (<I>P,</I>
214). Ultimately, these ideal subjectivities owe their existence to mere
mortals; for Harrison, divine power is alienated human power. In speaking
of women's rites and festivals, she argues that it was the goddess
"who imitated her youths and maidens," and not the reverse (<I>P,</I> 30).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Harrison's work, however, entails an intriguing ideological critique. She
first turns to the fifth-century and its unique deities, lonesome heroes,
and popular poets. These various incarnations of the divine, she argues,
affirm a social order driven by individualism and commerce. The Greek of
this period--with his carefully departmentalized gods, with his rituals
of "tendance" or exchange--is nothing more than an "archpatriarchal
bourgeois" (<I>P,</I> 285). His rites, his professions, and his
faculties are neatly governed by "ideas of law and order and reason"
(<I>P,</I> 397). More importantly, she criticizes this period for
its immaterialism. Its heroism, she argues, "is for individuals"; such
people "are cut clean from earth and from the local bits of earth out of
which they grew" (<I>AAR,</I> 161). She links this immaterialism with an
excessive pragmatism of language and an attendant violent aestheticism of
the natural world. "Eikonism," she explains, "takes the vague, unknown,
fearful thing, and tries to picture it, picture it as known, distinct,
definite . . . something as far rationalized as man himself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
  For her, <I>eikonism</I> implies a desire to control and master that
  which is other; it works to "comprise and confine the god within the
  limitations of the worshipper," affirming his power over the material
  world (<I>P,</I> 258).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Harrison, of course, laments the similar conditions of her own historical
moment, and asks readers to look beyond the affirmative myths of the
heroic age, beyond Homeric individualism and Platonic abstraction. Her
work returns to an even earlier period characterized by an intense
materialism, immanent deities, and sensual rites. Earlier societies
are celebrated for being in "touch with the confusions of actuality"
(<I>P,</I> 215). For these people, fears and joys are never abstract,
but earthly, tangible; they are haunted by the "actual ghost, not a mere
abstract vengeance . . . " (<I>P,</I> 217). Harrison's return to the
material world suggests a return to worldly potential. She asks us to
look beyond the omnipotent godhead to an originally human force, beneath
Olympian abstraction to a primal, chthonic practice. Specifically, she
locates an alternative model of social order and change within ritual
practice, within a performative logic that unites material force and
aesthetic form, bodily desire and abstraction.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Much like Pound, Yeats, and Joyce, Harrison places desire at the
center of ritual practice. She claims that most, if not all, rituals
are initiated through passion, the "supreme mysteries of ecstasy and
love." The Eleusinian rite of sacred marriage, for example, cultivates
sensuality as the precondition for the revelation of the divine. "It is
indeed," Harrison writes, "only in the orgiastic religions that these
splendid moments of conviction could come . . . " (<I>P,</I> 568). In
<I>Ancient Art and Ritual,</I> the scholar more specifically argues
that traditional ritual practice focuses on the representation of a
"thing desired" (<I>AAR,</I> 25). Here, she defines ritual as a form
of sympathetic magic, a conscious "mimicking of nature's processes"
(<I>AAR,</I> 129). This magic, she elaborates, begins with the subject's
desire for the return of certain natural events, such as the spring or the
rising of crops. In remembrance of past pleasure and in anticipation of
future power, the participant copies or mimics the conditions under which
these might occur. In seasonal rites, for example, the "savage utters his
intense desire for food." Harrison explains that "His impulse is towards
food. He must eat that he and his tribe may grow and multiply. It is
this that he <I>utters and represents</I> in his rites" (<I>AAR,</I> 65).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Christabel Pankhurst, like H.D., Harrison reveals a bias toward
the creative potential of restraint. In <I>Ancient Art and Ritual,</I>
she explains that the primal unity of desire and representation
is founded upon an inevitable tension or restriction. She offers a
psychological model that presents human constitution not as a bundle of
separate faculties, but as a continuous cycle of activities. Emotion,
perception, and action exist concurrently, in a ceaseless causal loop,
without hierarchy or telos (<I>AAR,</I> 39-40). Harrison, however,
notes that "perception is not always instantly transformed into action;
there is an interval for choice between several possible actions." She
argues that "Perception is pent up and becomes, helped by emotion,
conscious representation." It is only out of this "momentary halt"
in the cycle, this "unsatisfied desire," that "all our mental life,
our images, our ideas, our consciousness, and assuredly our religion
and our art, is built up" (<I>AAR,</I> 41). Thus, through restraint,
Harrison connects desire with the performance or representation of its
fulfillment, linking motive force with expressive form. As she explains:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A rite is . . . a sort of stereotyped action, not wholly practical, but
yet not wholly cut loose from practice, a reminiscence of an anticipation
of actual practical doing; it is fitly, though not quite correctly,
called by the Greeks a dromenon, "a thing done." . . . its mainspring
[is] not the wish to copy nature or even improve upon her . . . but
rather an impulse shared by art with ritual, the desire, that is, to
utter, to give out a strongly felt emotion or desire by representing, by
making or doing or enriching the object or act desired. [<I>AAR,</I> 26]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Harrison, ritual occurs at the interface of desire and restriction,
and thus it exists between the active and the symbolic, the creative
and the intelligible. The ritual participant at once utters and enacts
desire, proclaims and repairs the terms of his or her existence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In some sense, for Harrison, society is always ritualized, seamlessly
shifting between worldly and aesthetic praxes. It ceaselessly combines
<I>dromenon</I> (things done) and <I>drama</I> (performance). She
emphasizes, however, that insofar as desire is

<B></B>

intersubjective, its ritual performance mediates intersubjective
relations. For her, public ritual extends beyond the expression of
bodily need in order to expose social inequality and disadvantage. In
fact, for Harrison, social status exists only in its performance,
in the part-practical, part-symbolic gestures of public protest. For
the primitive as well as the modern, "one's ritual 'dances' are the
[expression] of one's importance" (<I>AAR,</I> 31). Ritual, however,
does not simply reveal, but shapes social relations; its power is
transformative as well. The ritual participant does "not simply 'embody'
a previously conceived idea, he begets it. From his performance springs
the personification. The abstract idea arises from the only thing it
possibly can arise from, the concrete act" (<I>AAR,</I> 71). Ritual,
much like suffrage spectacle, serves to conceive and thus enact new
modes and relations. The performance of desires arouses the spectator's
desire. Power is perceived in gestures that are then mimicked by the
larger population. More specifically, she contends that ritual first
obstructs the spectator's habitual patterns of behavior. The rite first
halts, then models and channels desire for the community as a whole. These
various stages of mimicry--because conscious--are open to choice and
change. At her most idealistic, Harrison argues that the process is at
once active and thoughtful, infinite and infinitely negotiable.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Harrison's discussion of the "Thesmophoria" offers the clearest example
of this theory and its political significance. Participants in this rite,
a self-elected group of women, would gather and then lower pigs into deep
clefts outside the village walls. After some time, the women themselves
would descend into the clefts, retrieve the rotten flesh and "place it
on certain altars, whence it was taken and mixed with seed to serve as
a fertility charm" (<I>P,</I> 123). Harrison asserts that the myth of
Demeter and Persephone was only later appended to this rite and thus
obscures its original, sympathetic intention, the mimicking of natural
cycles. But she focuses on the full name of the first deity, Demeter
Thesmophoros, which is translated as "law-carrier" or "law-giver." The
name of the deity, like all such names, is bound to an earlier adjectival
form. Thesmophoros derives from the activity of the earlier ministrants,
the original carrying and laying down of <I>thesmoi</I> or sacred
objects. The goddess who represents the law took her name from the human
ministrants who were "called Thesmophoroi because they carried 'the
things laid down'" (<I>P,</I> 137). For Harrison, this implies that the
law was laid down by the rite; it was based on an earlier "thing done,"
on the ritual gestures of earlier societies. She defends her argument
by pointing out that most ancient rites entailed "things said" as well
as "things done." Words uttered during a sacred performance correspond
to specific gestures and activities (<I>P,</I> 570); they re as an
"avowal of things performed" (<I>P,</I> 156). Harrison argues that ancient
law derives from these vocal components. The ritual creed developed "on
its social side into the ordinance and ultimately into the regular law"
(<I>P,</I> 142). For the ancient Greek, law, ritual, and desire are
inextricably linked. Power is at once symbolic and sensual.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As I mentioned above, the dynamics of ritual seem to embody what
Ranci&egrave;re calls the "process of subjectivization." Harrison clearly
echoes Ranci&egrave;re when she argues that "many, perhaps most of us,
breathe more freely in the <I>medium,</I> literally the <I>midway</I>
space, of some collective ritual" (<I>AAR,</I> 206). The strength of
this theory, however,

<B></B>

is its avoidance of the binary logic that governs bourgeois
politics. As a "universal transition space," ritual confounds those
dichotomies--the irrational and the rational, the marked and the fallen,
the private and the public--that enforce often gendered conrations
of power. Similarly, Harrison's theory offers a valuable counter to the
logic of the avant-garde. By locating material tensions and restrictions
at the center of representational practice, she confounds the avant-garde
opposition between aesthetic and worldly praxes. While ritual permits
contemplation, it denies the possibility of an autonomous, purposeless
space from which the world may be addressed. In fact, we will find that
the work of art, born of desire, is but "a later and more sublimated,
more detached form of ritual" that yet maintains its social power
(<I>AAR,</I> 225). For Harrison, as for H.D., art is always already
material, purposive, and social. Its beauty is collectively determined,
conditioned by "a keen emotion felt toward things and people living
today. . . " (<I>AAR,</I> 237).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, Harrison's theory grants contemporary women a position from
which to challenge institutional conrations of power. Her work clearly
celebrates an early primitive society defined by female practice. However,
insofar as she defines this practice as the ritual performance of desire,
she accounts for its possible return. In "Homo Sum," she argues that
this return has already taken form as the contemporary struggle for
suffrage. She explains that it was through her studies of antiquity
that she first became receptive to the activity of the militants. The
sexes have always been defined by an "artificial division of moral
industry." The current struggle res as part of a constant inscription
and reinscription of the relationship between the sexes. Harrison,
therefore, celebrates the suffrage movement not as an expression of
essential womanhood, but as a ritualized effort to rewrite the terms of
cultural power. She confirms that militant activity is based on the same
unity of knowing, feeling, and acting that marked ancient ritual. The
militants, she explains, have recognized that "To feel keenly is often,
if not always an amazing intellectual revelation." Their work is based
on an "awakening of the <I>desire,</I>" which is also "the awakening of
the <I>intention to act,</I> to act more efficiently and to shape the
world more completely to our will."

For Susan Stanford Friedman, H.D.'s early work is complicated by its
association with patriarchal attitudes and conservative politics, with the
"totalizing mythos of the reactionary center." Imagism, in particular,
comes under attack as a "critical cage from which the female poet needs
'liberation.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
  Consequently, Friedman praises H.D.'s turn toward nonrationalist,
  nonmaterialist perspectives in the mystical hermeticism of the later
  poems and novels. The late work is valuable as "a case in point for
  the gendered history of modernism, for the situation of a woman who
  writes out of the position of the Other."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
  Although it would be hard to deny H.D.'s romantic tendencies, I contend
  that her work consistently confounds the notion of otherness. If H.D.'s
  poetry gives voice to certain marginal experiences, it emphasizes the
  social tensions that define those experiences. Her verses foreground
  a dynamic intersubjectivity and only

<B></B>

thus entail a certain political, if not explicitly feminist,
engagement. We now turn to a third point on our continuum of deeds and
words, to the most formal mode of engagement, the work of art. H.D.'s
poetry reveals the effective unity of often gendered binaries, such as
subject and object, public and private, work and world. Her ritualized
poetry does not avoid political responsibility; rather, it raises
possibilities for a community that always already incorporates the
marginal, the feminine, and the poetic. As H.D. explained, "My work
is creative and reconstructive, war or no war, if I can get across the
Greek spirit at its highest I am helping the world, and the future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For H.D., spirit is always an immanent, effective presence. Her work
celebrates powerful, irrational forces as they both inform and clarify
worldly objects. Thus, while her poetry is infused with a fluid energy,
its images are vibrant and crisp. Its landscapes are at once tangible and
expressive, vital and intelligible. H.D.'s sea flowers, for example, are
caught amidst violent drifts and tides, but it is precisely their openness
to these conditions that lend them their beauty. Subject to elemental
forces, their features turn "hard," "bright," and "fresh." The "marred"
rose and "slashed" reed are "doubly rich" for their torment. Conversely,
these precise forms, in their graceful motions and swift mutations,
suggest the presence of elemental forces. The reed that is "lifted" gives
shape to the wind; "pebbles drift and flung" reveal the motion of the sea.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
  In "Sheltered Garden," H.D. explicitly celebrates this charged,
  contingent landscape. The poet first condemns the imaginative excesses
  of romanticism, which re as suffocation, solipsism, and satiety:
  "Beauty without strength," she declares, "chokes out life." Repulsed,
  the poet demands a spare, classical beauty governed by pressure,
  tension, and precision. The speaker turns to violent forces that
  "break," "snap," "scatter," and "fling," and forms that lie "torn" and
  "twisted." A true classicist, she seeks the beauty of a "terrible /
  wind-tortured place" (<I>CP,</I> 19-22).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These aesthetics are based on processes akin to those that inform militant
protest and classical ritual. H.D.'s clear, crystalline images do not
exist in isolation, but are embedded, and indeed result from tensions
within a dynamic field. Their existence is neither spontaneous, isolated,
or permanent, but conditional, resulting from their subjection to larger
forces. H.D. observed that she

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

grew tired of hearing the poems referred to, as crystalline. . . . For
what is crystal or any gem but the concentrated essence of the rough
matrix, or the energy, either of over-intense heat or over-intense cold
that projects it? The poems as a whole . . . contain that essence or
that symbol, symbol of concentration and of stubborn energy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
More importantly, this "energy," insofar as it informs and
shapes the phenomenal world, is decisively human. The winds and
tides of H.D.'s poetry suggest the power of a specifically mortal
force--inspiration--which she conceives as desire itself. From early
poems such as "Pursuit," "The Cliff Temple," and "Eurydice," to the later
"Choros Sequence" and "The Dancer," we find a passionate intensity that
cuts and marks all in its path, leaving its traces on both body and
world. The subject exists in a constant liminal state, between palpable
forces and a formal precision. Her body is subject to

<B></B>

contingent energy from both within and without, and thus grows
powerful as well as acutely sentient. According to Eileen Gregory,
the most remarkable quality of H.D.'s lyrics are their "liminality,"
a constant mediation of "boundaries between inner and outer, between
self and other." Its central qualities are at once "deeply subjective
and radically impersonal . . . they represent deep interiority infusing
in outward shape or motion, making it vibrant and golden."

In the 1920s, H.D. revisited her early classicism and developed a clear
theory of the desiring subject. H.D.'s "Notes on Thought and Vision,"
argues that the subject reaches her full potential only through "definite
physical relations." Sensual activity shapes identity and cultivates
physical as well as intellectual "talents."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>

There is, then, a set of super-feelings. These feelings extend

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Albeit bizarre, H.D.'s image of the over-mind provides a consistent
intersubjective model. The over-mind, subjectivity itself, exists
only in mutuality, in a kinetic coupling that is at once sensuous and
conscious. Moreover, for H.D., this model suggests the possibility of
the subject's empowerment. "The centre of consciousness," she explains,
"is either the brain or the love-region of the body" (<I>NTV,</I>
20). This conflation suggests a faculty that is at once active as well
as perceptive, creative as well as conscious. To illustrate her theory,
she turns to the sacred rites of Eleusis, in which "One must understand
a lower wisdom before one understands a higher" (<I>NTV,</I> 31). The
rites entail a three-step process that moves from "Crude animal enjoyment"
to pure "over-mind consciousness." Physical lovers re as prototypes
for "spiritual lovers," the latter having the power of "concentrating
and directing pictures from the world of vision" (<I>NTV,</I> 50). Like
Harrison, H.D. places desire at the center of her phenomenology. Body and
vision, "seed" and "word," coexist in a single, dynamic process. Thus,
subjection becomes subjectivization, and a position from which to
negotiate power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As we have seen in our discussion of "Sheltered Garden," H.D. associates
imaginative freedom with solipsism, sensual satiety with suffocation. For
this poet, true creation depends upon the constancy of desire; precision
is the result of restriction or tension. Thus, her work, much like that
of Pankhurst and Harrison, consistently outlines the benefits of bodily
restraint. "Notes on Thought and Vision" repeatedly warns against sexual
fulfillment and consummation. She pleads for chastity, claiming that
the artist can "retard" his powers by "neglect of his body" (<I>NTV,</I>
52). The "love-region," she argues, must remain in a state of constant
excitation, "its energy not dissipated in physical relation" (<I>NTV,</I>
22). Helen Sword's work on the visionary tradition elucidates this logic:

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Eros, or desire, in fact signifies an absence so powerful that it takes
on the role of a presence, so that the romantic pairings that generally
characterize human sexuality--dualities, if not always necessarily of
male and female, then at least of lover and beloved, self and an erotic
Other--triangulate into complex constellations that include as a third
party desire itself: eros as a force both motivational and mediatory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sword here locates the expressive power of those boundaries between self
and other. Eros proceeds from the absence of fulfillment, in longing,
in tension and pain. The artist must struggle with and against the other,
and thereby "create the desire that creates poetry" (ibid.).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Tellingly, it was H.D.'s psychic experiences in Greece that enabled
her to link desire, restraint, and vision. In <I>Tribute to Freud,</I>
the poet recalls how her trip was supposed to culminate with a visit
to Delphi. At Itea, however, she and Bryher were told that "it was
absolutely impossible for two ladies alone, at that time, to make the
then dangerous trip on the winding road to Delphi. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
  H.D. dramatically depicts her feelings of restriction and longing, but
  she also suggests that it was precisely these intense sensations that
  inspired her visionary experiences. Unable to visit the oracular seat,
  the poet finds her desire transmuted into oracular signs. Well-versed in
  psychoanalytic theory, she places her projections squarely between the
  wish-inspired dreams of Freud's work and the mystical, otherworldly
  speech of the mystics. Each one can be translated, she argues,
  "as a suppressed desire for forbidden 'signs and wonders'" or "an
  extension of the artist's mind, a <I>picture</I> or an illustrated
  poem, taken out of the actual dream or day-dream content and projected
  from within. . ." (<I>TF,</I> 76). Thus, for H.D., the event is both
  personal and impersonal; the visionary is caught between her intense
  passion and abstract form. One image, she claims, is "so impersonal
  it might have been anyone, of almost any country. And yet there was
  a distinctly familiar line about that head . . . dead brother? Lost
  friend?" (<I>TF,</I> 66). The deity that presides over this hybrid
  experience is none other than the winged Nike. The goddess appears upon
  a ladder, between two realms, the worldly and the divine. For her,
  the image, like those found in her early poetry, is "doubly rich"
  (<I>TF,</I> 83).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
H.D.'s poetry repeatedly returns to this relay of desire, restraint, and
creativity. Her verses are populated by "broken" lovers and distraught
visionaries, whose powers exist only in a passion deferred. "Fragment
Thirty-Six," for example, presents the following, frustrated lament:

The speaker cannot decide whether to seek fulfillment in the arms of a
lover or attenuate and thus transmute her passion into the clear words
of song. Masterfully, H.D. presents the lips as the source of both desire
and language. Kissing, of course, would

<B></B>

"slake / the rage that burns." With this act, all tension would
subside as subject and object dissolve into one. The speaker, however,
wonders whether she should turn away and "press lips to lips / that
answer not. . . ?" The verse aptly conveys the nervous transmutation
of passion into speech. In the absence of fulfillment or response, in
its willed deferral, kissing becomes song. Moreover, the lips offer a
precise image of that creative doubling or enfolding that defines all
experience. Difference and unity, engagement and detachment--it is this
"brokenness" that produces song:

With this verse, it becomes apparent that the song is already being
sung. The poem itself is an expression not of a decision made, but of
an attenuated state. Both sensual and sentient, aroused and detached,
the speaker writes herself within the dynamics of desire. Restraint
produces language, as language heightens and prolongs passion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not surprisingly, a similar dynamic informs the social potential of
classical art. Put bluntly, modernists understood the power of classicism
as its ability to occasion pain. The classical work of art both offers
and denies its beauty and thus arouses passions that remain torturously
unfulfilled. In other words, aesthetic distance prohibits the potential
sublimation of kinetic desire. Consequently, the energy that would be
lost in the work is diverted back toward the world at large. Harrison,
for example, argues that while the beautiful image can "discredit
the actual practical world," it never insists on its own "actuality
and objectivity" (<I>AAR,</I> 227). For her, art "invigorates life,
but only does it by withdrawal from these very same elementary forms of
life, by inhibiting certain sensuous reactions" (<I>AAR,</I> 236). Thus,
"imagination, cut off from practical reaction as it is, becomes in turn
a motor-force causing new emotions, and so pervading general life, and
thus ultimately becoming 'practical'" (<I>AAR,</I> 210). For H.D., also,
the sterile, ascetic aspects of the work refuse immersion and enforce
a return to worldly praxis. In "Notes on Thought and Vision," the poet
argues that aesthetic beauty is similar to that of the "loved one,"
but its inaccessibility leaves the mind "enflamed and excited." While
the work of art may excite the "love-region," energy is not "dissipated
in physical relation" and thus "takes on its character of mind. . . "
(<I>NTV,</I> 22). More aggressively, in a 1916 review, H.D. praises poetry
that "holds, fascinates and half-paralyses us, as light flashed from a
very fine steel blade, wielded playfully, ironically . . . with absolute
surety and with absolute disdain." As the poet explains, this hostile
beauty does not simply negate, but actively confronts a "world of shrapnel
and machine-guns," wages "battle against squalor and commercialism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
  Ultimately, like other forms of protest, her poetry halts, foregrounds,
  and suggests alternatives to the everyday. It both arouses and impedes
  desire, and thereby permits consciousness, various models

<B></B>

of behavior, and the possibility of choice. Adalaide Morris, in a
stunning article on H.D.'s <I>Trilogy,</I> explicitly aligns this aspect
of H.D.'s work with ritual practice. She argues that H.D.'s poetry "not
only <I>means</I> but <I>does</I>"; "it labors to create a formal break
with everyday life, a ritual space that invites the reader to return to,
reexamine, and rearrange the <I>ethos</I> of a community in crisis."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
  Similarly, Gregory contends that H.D.'s lyrics "demand from the
  reader a distinct dramatic form of attention and participation." By
  short-circuiting fulfillment, by refusing to dissolve into abstraction,
  they turn the poetic experience "inward, so that the reader is forced
  <I>through</I> the singular experience of the poem." Ultimately, the
  mediated space of the poem becomes a space of collective mediation. It
  signifies as it inspires "threshold states" in which "the tribe as a
  whole renews itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
H.D.'s various statements on the Eleusinian rites offer the most striking
account of this painful beauty and its effective power. In "Notes on
Thought and Vision," the poet argues that while the "Eleusinian mysteries
had to do with sex," sensuality was countered by "a certain amount of
detachment . . . a certain amount of artistic appreciation"(<I>NTV,</I>
29-31). Similarly, in "Helios and Athene," she claims that the
participant neither surrendered to desire nor achieved detachment,
but experienced a love that is "the merging and welding of both,
the conquering in herself of each element, so that the two merge in
the softness and tenderness of the mother and the creative power and
passion of the male" (<I>CP,</I> 330). In the poem "At Eleusis," however,
H.D. does not simply describe, but enacts this rite and its divine pain:

The italicized refrain clearly suggests a worldly enactment of
the divine. An anonymous, ecstatic "they" perform the power of the
god. Through their activity, they do not merely conjure, but become
that which they desire. Thus, with the poem's contrasting registers,
H.D. presents a rich doubling of deed and word, power and thought. Her
verses alternate between the abject and the divine, between passionate
engagement and formal gesture. The poet, however, is not content
with description or even suggestion, for she demands the reader's
complicity and thereby enacts the intersubjective nature of this
rite. The speaker engages us directly, calls forth an erotic potential
thus far obscured. However, the speaker demands our understanding as
well. Thus, the differing registers inspire and impede our desire,
encourage and deny the possibility of fulfillment. This call for
restraint is most dramatically seen in the transition between the second
and third verse, when the speaker shouts "Stop." With this "sudden
halt," the moment of unity is forestalled, and thus power and power
relations are made conscious. The priestess bars entry, and commands
us to "wait," presumably in order to achieve understanding, for "mind's
sake." Ultimately, we turn away, but now enflamed by a conscious desire,
by a renewed potential that still seeks outlet. Passion is heightened,
but now mediated and made thoughtful. Consummation is yet possible, but
informed by consciousness. The painful feeling of restriction transforms
dream into knowledge. As mortals, we wield the power of the divine.

Classical modernism, particularly as it finds expression in ritual
practice, complicates those categories with which we tend to organize
modernist literature: commitment and reaction, abstraction and
objectivity, masculine and feminine style. Not surprisingly, classical
modernism also complicates the distinctions that inform the logic of
modernity at large. First and foremost, it defines the individual
as inseparable from the material and discursive forces that shape
experience. Ritual performance consistently foregrounds the tensions that
exist between the desiring subject and its objective surroundings. Related
to this, classical modernism blurs the boundary between expressiveness
and the physical body, between the symbolic and the kinetic. In protest
as in poetry, image and desire are eternally yoked, together urging the
forces of history.
Finally, 

<B></B>

and perhaps most importantly, classical modernism confounds the
relationship between modernism and its legacy, namely, the politics of
postmodernity. Oddly, while classicism, particularly in its approach
to gender, anticipates postmodern strategies and attitudes, its most
vocal advocates--Lewis, Hulme, and H.D.--have either been dismissed as
reactionaries or dropped out of discussion altogether. Conversely, those
modernists who were most often criticized as romantic--Woolf, Stein,
and Joyce--meet today with almost universal approval. This complex
genealogy raises valuable questions not only about literary history,
but about political and economic history as well. The debate between
classicism and romanticism masked a much larger battle over the terms of
postwar society. It is time to revisit that debate and its consequences.

As Lyon explains, hunger striking served to challenge the "'natural

should also be noted that the Liberal government responded in every
possible way to restrict women to their former activity. The most violent

this patriarchal order was dependent upon the constant activity of
