<p>
Of all that has worked toward, furthered, and offered its services to 
National Socialism; of all that made it what it was; and of all that 
survives it without the most immediate horror, the most banal, 
self-evident and, therefore, most easily forgotten could also be the most 
effective. It is something that cannot primarily and in every instance be 
considered fascistic; something that has a very long and, many would say, 
venerable, mythological, theological, and philosophical prehistory; and in 
this history, especially in its most recent segment, it is what has been 
conceived of as a determination of man's essence. This banal, 
self-evident, and even still today widely presumed human factor is work. 
Work did not only organize what in fascism was crude violence and 
authority. The wish for work as the form of a remunerated life did not 
only aid Hitler's party in its ascent to power. This party did not only 
present itself as a labor party. Nor was it alone capital (according to 
Marx's handy formula, money that breeds itself, this self-producing and 
self-working capital) that paved the way for the Nazi clique. The call to 
work--to work on the country, work in industry, to work 
<I>on</I>
 the 
"people" and 
<I>for</I>
 the "people" of workers, to work on arms, to work 
with fist and brow, to work 
<I>against</I>
 everything and everyone who was 
said to be hostile or merely foreign to the work of the people--this call 
to work pervaded and determined 

 the entire 
ideological, social, and political organization of the fascist epoch. And, 
in turn, work--working out, working through, and working off 
<I>(Verarbeitung, Durcharbeitung, Aufarbeitung)</I>
--became the watchword 
for the atonement of guilt and the settlement of debts. Work, finally, 
comes to define the task that must be met by congresses for enlightenment 
and demystification. The meaning of this enlightenment and 
demystification, however, does not lie in mere working but, rather, in 
ceasing to carry on fascistically determined work. It lies in working 
through this work--and that also means in stopping or, at least, 
repeatedly interrupting it, to work off work, 
<I>this</I>
 work, its pre- 
and posthistory, the history of this work and history itself insofar as it 
determines itself as work. It lies in working through what work meant and 
what it demanded, in working out what it still means and demands. It lies 
in the imperative of work and in clarifying the work of this imperative: 
the opening up and disclosure of a dimension in which work stops and gives 
pause, desists and is ex-posed 
<I>(aussetzt).</I>
 As long as we do not 
clarify what work means for National Socialism and what National Socialism 
as an institution 
<I>of</I>
 work itself means, we cannot understand what 
this institution is beyond a political and ideological phenomenon of a 
past--yet how and to what extent "past"?--epoch. Nor can we clarify what 
work 
<I>against</I>
 fascism would mean and what we, for example, do--and 
whether "we" in fact "do" it--when we analyze some elements of this 
institution. 
<p>
The question about the work of fascism and about the endogenous fascism of 
work should not be posed solely for the sake of historical clarity. It is 
not only a historical or academic question. It is also a question about 
the structure of history, especially about the structure of what, from the 
perspective of work, the past and the future might mean and demand. Thus 
it is also a political question, one that, in principle, concerns the 
structure of present-day and future institutions--political, economic, 
juridical, and scientific. In his lecture "What Does It Mean: Working off 
the Past?" ("Was heisst: Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit"), a lecture that 
up to this day, twenty-five years after its publication, is not obsolete, 
Adorno aired the suspicion that the formula of "working off" tended to 
serve the "unconscious, but not all that unconscious, defense against 
guilt" and, consequently, to perpetuate injustice. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">
1</A>
</SUP>
The 
defense function is thus designated as one of the constitutive elements of 
work in general. The historical continuity of National Socialism, made 
possible by this defensive work, forms the basis of one of the decisive 
considerations of Adorno's brief talk: "I regard the afterlife of National 
Socialism 
<I>in</I>
 democracy as potentially more threatening than the 
afterlife of fascist tendencies 
<I>against</I>
 democracy" ("AV," 126). In 
this remark, Adorno has his eye partly on the "comeback" of shady res, 
but also, and here he does not leave the slightest doubt, on the systemic 
continuity of fascism and a certain praxis of democracy. If working 
through the past 
<I>("Aufarbeiten")</I>
--not coincidentally but, rather, 
precisely because it is work--always simultaneously entails a defense 
against and disavowal of this past, then work itself is a form of history 
that produces continuity in the semblance of change and survival in the 
guise of overcoming. The passing of the past, history itself, is work. 
Thereby, however, it is precisely that past above and beyond which work, 
working off, is supposed 
<B></B>
 to lead. The threat that 
issues from the National Socialism 
<I>within</I>
 democracy issues as a 
form of historicizing work, as the work of history, that is essentially, 
and this means before every particular content, homogenization and 
formation. But this also means that in it consists the exclusion, 
disavowal, and tendential, or real, extermination of the nonhomogeneous, 
the nonassimilable, and the formless. Work is the form in which fascism, 
especialy fascism, survives, because, on the one hand, it was the form of 
survival priveleged by fascism, and, on the other, because it was survival 
in the manner of formation. The afterlife of fascism 
<I>in</I>
 democracy, 
in short, belongs to the life of fascism itself--and may, moreover, belong 
to that specific form of democracy that defines itself through, and as the 
democracy of, work, as ergocracy. 
<p>
Wherever its concept or praxis happens to show up, work (this for the most 
part still hypothetical thought could be drawn out) is work against 
vanishing, against death or the work 
<I>on</I>
 death. As the form of 
counterdeath, as organized defense against finitude and as the 
phantasmatic institution of immortality, it must--whether it seems to be 
connected to manifestly political, cultic, or discursive forms--meet two, 
and indeed two mutually exclusive, demands. On the one hand, it must 
entertain the closest imaginable affinity to precisely that death against 
which it is meant to guard. On the other hand, it must assert the claim 
that it is more powerful than death, far above it and itself immortal, 
indestructable, and infinite. If the system of National Socialism--and, in 
general, every totalitarian political system--defines itself as a system 
of work, then, according to this hypothesis, it also defines itself as a 
system that outlives its "own," infinitely appropriable death. Work and 
its politico-economic, social, and discursive system, would thus be the 
praxis of a virtually infinite survival, the survival of its "own" death, 
the praxis of outliving itself. In this sense, we would do well to attend 
to a further remark by Adorno: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
National Socialism lives on, and even today we still do not know whether 
it lives on merely as the ghost of something so monstrous that it has not 
yet died of its own death or whether it never died in the first place; 
whether the readiness for the unspeakable lives on in men as it does in 
the circumstances that enclose them. ["AV," 126] 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
National Socialism does not lie behind us as a historically surmounted 
phenomenon; it may even be utterly insurmountable and resistant to 
attempts at working through it. For, as a "monstrous" form of work, it is 
nothing but the production of its own afterlife and survival, and thus it 
continuously produces itself as specter--not as a chimera and mere 
illusion but, rather, as a reality worse than death: namely, the sheer 
<I>positivity</I>
 of life, dead life, living death. In a very precise and 
yet to be determined sense, National Socialism was work; for this reason 
it is difficult, perhaps in the end impossible, to bring its conscious, 
political, and historical working through to a close. Therefore, up to 
today it is undecidable, Adorno fears, whether organized murder, or the 
mere readiness for it, survives. 
<p>
The question that might help us apprehend fascism as both a historical 
phenomenon and a principle for the organization of life and survival, a 
question that may at 

 the same time alter the terms 
in which fascism is analytically treated, might run as follows: What does 
"work" mean in fascist ideology and, insofar as this ideology is an 
integral moment of the fascist system, what does "work" mean as a fascist 
institution? In order to sketch an answer to this question--and anything 
more than a sketch cannot be attempted here--I shall refer to three 
authors and to three motives that gave shape to the system of work under 
fascism: one mytho-theological, one ontological, and one morphological. 
These motifs can obviously not be separated from one another; rather, in 
their interweaving, they characterize the structure of what--in this 
particular historical segment and at its borders and thus also beyond 
them--is called "work." 
<p>
As "creative work" 
<I>("schaffende Arbeit"),</I>
 work was for Hitler a 
distinguished and distinguishing form of battle, hailed as the struggle 
that would overcome class war and achieve the unity of "fellow countrymen 
and -women." In his address of 1 May 1933, he celebrates Labor Day in a 
natural-mystical sense as the "day of life's becoming" and "awakening 
nature," and thereby at the same time, as the "day of winning back our 
proper force and strength." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">
2</A>
</SUP>
As the day of return 
<I>("Wiederkehr"),</I>
 of coming back 
<I>("R&uuml;ckkehr"),</I>
 of 
recovery, repetition, and winning back, as the day of restitution and 
reinstitution of this "natural" and "proper" "force," May Day is for 
Hitler "thereby also and at the same time," the day of "that productive 
work that knows no narrow limits, that is not bound to the trade union, to 
the factory and the office--the day of a work that we want to recognize 
and advance wherever it is executed in the good sense for the being and 
life of our people" (
<I>HRP,</I>
 259). The fusion of life, nature, and 
work, the naturalization of work and the ergotization of nature and of 
life, is not the only rhetorical--and not only rhetorical but also 
ontological--trick the agitator deploys here in his effort to conjure 
accord, harmony, and agreement. The work he means is not work 
<I>on</I>
nature but the work 
<I>of</I>
 nature, that is, the work of 
<I>our</I>
proper nature, "of our proper force and strength," and only as such is it 
work for "the being and life of our people." Vitalistic and dynamistic, 
work becomes the preeminent form for the appropriation of "the being and 
life of our people," the master form of self-appropriation, a form of 
force that is both natural and societal. It is the form of the 
self-production of the "proper," of the "ours," of the "we": the form of 
autochthonous self-socialization and the form of winning back one's proper 
history, the form of self-presentation. Work is auto-fusion. It is thus 
not as if the chief ideologue attributes to his spellbound public a firm 
egological substratum, as though it were a self-sufficient given. Instead, 
he suggests that the community he imagines is one of self-production and 
self-generation through work. The egologically understood society is 
self-producing and, in thus producing itself, a society that returns to 
itself, an ergological society. The subject is its process of production: 
"people" is substantially work. For this reason, he speaks of work 
exclusively in terms of "construction," as constructive 
<I>("aufbauend"),</I>
 and in terms that imply elevation, "raising up" 
<I>("Erhebung"),</I>
 a vocabulary that follows the verticalism of his 
ontology of the "being . . . of our people" 
<I>("des Seins . . . unseres Volkes"</I>
 [
<I>HRP,</I>
 259]). 
<p>
The conjuring of the "collective and harmonious work of all," in which 
society 
<B></B>
 should understand and take hold of itself 
and the people should once again become properly a people, is directed, 
domestically, ideologically, and politically, against the class-war 
politics of the trade unions. And Hitler, 
<I>psychopompous,</I>
 makes no 
secret of this. "The people," he says, interpreting their "unconscious," 
"the people feel, unconsciously, in their interior [!], that those 
ceremonies of the Marxist kind were at variance with the dawning spring. 
They did not want hate; they did not want struggle: they wanted to rise!" 
(
<I>HRP,</I>
 261). Yet in Hitler's address (and in others by him as well), 
this rising--
<I>"Erhebung"</I>
 here connotes "erection" more than 
"insurrection"--in which the self-presentation, self-production, and 
self-positing of the people are accomplished through work, bears 
resemblance to a curious Christian theologeme: the idea of the 
"resurrection of our people" (
<I>"Auferstehung unseres Volkes"</I>
[
<I>HRP,</I>
 261]). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">
3</A>
</SUP>
The people that rises up through work to 
itself, to its proper "being and life," presents itself as a 
mytho-theological re, the divine savior, the hero, the redeemer and 
the self-redeemer, the resurrected Christ. The people is Christ, the 
<I>hic et nunc</I>
 resurrecting, insofar as it rises from the dead by the 
power of its work. The invocation of and the identification with this 
theological re assumes, however, that in the first place this people 
has been degraded and insulted (Hitler makes this assumption quite 
explicit, once again using the language of psychology to speak of an 
"inferiority complex" that has been "artificially inbred" [
<I>HRP,</I>
261]). It further assumes that this people has died and has become a 
corpse: "the world persecutes us[;] . . . it will not recognize our right 
to life" (
<I>HRP,</I>
 263). From the spell of humiliation and the denied 
right to life, from the spell of class conflict and death by lack of 
recognition, "we want redemption from this spell" (
<I>HRP,</I>
 261). We, 
the working people, want to redeem ourselves, this murdered and lifeless 
people. Work is the redemption of the inferior and from the inferior. It 
is the rise of the degraded to ranks of the chosen, the self-elected; and 
as self-elected, it is the resurrection of the dead in the radiant, 
spectral body--in the phantom, to recall Adorno's remark. The people, in 
its essence, is work, which, in turn, is essentially self-redemption. In 
his ergological restitution of the Christological myth, Hitler remains 
true to at least one motif of Christian dogma: this Christ that is the 
"German people" is not redeemed by a superior power. Rather, he redeems 
himself and rises by his own strength from the grave: "We know that all 
human work must in the end be vain if the blessing of Providence does not 
shine above it. But we do not belong to those who comfortably await the 
hereafter. We are given nothing. . . . We ask not of the Almighty, 'Lord 
make us free!' We want to be active, to work." (
<I>HRP,</I>
 263-64) Thus 
we alone, the unfree, make ourselves free: we 
<I>make</I>
 ourselves, we 
<I>work</I>
 ourselves, and we 
<I>liberate</I>
 and 
<I>redeem</I>
 ourselves 
through our own proper work. For the chief ideologue of the National 
Socialist German Labor Party and the chancellor of the Reich, work is--on 
Labor Day, 1 May 1933--the form of Christological self-redemption, 
self-erection 
<I>("Selbsterhebung"),</I>
 and the resurrection from the 
death of the Weimar Republic. It is the self-appropriation of the people 
in its self-production. Work is the mythical form of liberation, 
self-deification. The National Socialism that Hitler conjured up is a 
political mytho-theology of work. But this work is first of all 
<B></B>
 nothing else but a suggestion--in fact, the 
suggestion of 
autosuggestion and thereby the fictionizing of a self, the suggestion 
there could exist an autonomous, self-enacting, self-producing and 
self-resurrecting I. The real presence, transubstantiation, suggested here 
is a citation from an obsolete theology, from a theology become 
propaganda. It is a staged presence, and the work through which it seeks 
to become a reality consists in little more than the rhetorical 
reproduction of a mythological schema. It consists thus in the work of the 
refusal to work. The transred political body of the people "Christ" is 
not the spirit of Hitler's so-called spiritual people but, rather, its 
phantom, the specter of a specter. 
<SUP>

<p>
Resurrected through "creative work" in its Christo-mythological phantom 
body, this people is robbed of its trade unions the next day, on 2 May 
1933, and one year later, on 24 October 1934, it is surrounded by the 
"German Worker's Front" 
<I>("Deutsche Arbeitsfront"),</I>
 the 
"Organization of Productive Germans of the Brow and Fist." Its goal is the 
"formation" 
<I>("Bildung")</I>
 of a community of people as a community of 
performance, the "performing community" 
<I>("Leistungsgemeinschaft")</I>
of all Germans.

A few years later, the slogan 
<I>Arbeit macht frei</I>
 (Work makes free), which could have come from Hitler's May 
Day address, will bedeck the entrance to the euphemistically billed 
"concentration camp" Ausschwitz. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">
6</A>
</SUP>
In this sentence, we are to 
understand that work as the form of the self-appropriation of the "being 
and life" of a people is simultaneously the form of its liberation from 
everything that is not itself, that is not proper to it--that is improper, 
foreign, and, at the same time, according to a troglodytically bipolar 
thinking, inferior, debased, unfree, and dead. The sentence "Work makes 
free" is the resurrection formula of the national-Christian, 
necro-vitalistic mythology of fascism. It defines Auschwitz as workplace: 
a workplace where the nonproper, the nonworking--and, it is thus 
insinuated, the already dead--are once more put to death, in order that 
the proper, the society of work, can emerge as the product of its own 
labor. It defines murder as the work of life on itself. It defines Jews as 
the unredeemed; it defines Communists as the dualists of class conflict; 
it defines Gypsies as the homeless and propertyless; it defines 
homosexuals as the un(re)productive: it defines them all as material for 
work, as work materials--namely, as the always already 
<I>former,</I>
 as 
the dead, unproductive people--and it defines work, on the one hand, as 
the production of corpses, and, on the other, as the production of the 
"gleaming," spectral body of the work-state. "Work makes free" is not an 
arbitrary or cynical slogan. It is rather the 
<I>name</I>
 of Auschwitz and 
thus the name of National Socialist Germany. It does not deceive about the 
reality of work but, rather, pronounces its truth: the system of 
liberation through work and, consequently, the system of 
self-production--the production of the 
<I>re</I>
 of the self--is the 
system of Auschwitz. Yet the unreality that cleaves to this slogan, as 
well as to the reality of the work it defines, and that seduces one to 
understand it as mere cynicism does not lack objectivity. For this work 
deemed to make free consists essentially in the rejection of a 
structurally irreducible moment of work itself, in the rejection of what 
in work exposes it to something foreign, to something that does not define 
itself as work, that is inappropriable and that does not permit of being 
included within the 
<B></B>
 defining borders of a univocal 
concept, a form or an idea. Work, as it determines the system of 
Auschwitz, the system of National Socialism, defines itself as the 
rejection of what is foreign to work and the foreignness of work "itself" 
through murder: the practical condemnation and extermination of what in 
work does not correspond to an egological re and thus does not conform 
to the process of ration, of what in work is not itself and what does 
not come back to itself. 
<p>
I turn to the second of the three motives that define the concept of work 
under National Socialism, the ontological motif, which is closely related 
to the Christological one. This ontological motif was stressed most 
energetically by Heidegger in 1933 and 1934 and represents a peculiar 
reinterpretation--but also interpretation--of his existential analytic of 
Dasein. Of course, my concern in this short sketch of Heidegger's relevant 
remarks is not to reconstruct the many complications attending his concept 
of work (a task, incidentally, yet to be accomplished) and still less to 
discuss these complications in the context of his thinking and its 
metamorphoses. What is important to me here is that, in his Rectorship 
philosophy, Heidegger conceived of the essence of Dasein--of finite being 
oneself 
<I>("Selbstsein")</I>
--as work and that he placed this 
determination of the humanity of man in the service of National Socialist 
propaganda. On 22 October 1933, in the largest lecture hall of the 
University of Freiburg, Heidegger delivered a speech in front of six 
hundred unemployed persons slated to be put to work by the Work 
Procurement Program 
<I>(Arbeitsbeschaffungsprogramm).</I>
 After having 
greeted them as "fellow German countrymen! German workers!" summoned to 
"communal work," and having explained that the Work Procurement Program is 
properly--and this "properly" is what matters here--
<I>"erection"</I>
 and 
construction in the new future of our people," he says that the decisive 
characteristic in the creation of work lies in the fact that it must 
"first and foremost make one again fit for Dasein 
<I>["daseinsf&auml;hig"]</I>
 in the state and for the state and thereby 
for the whole of the people." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">
7</A>
</SUP>
The procurement of work makes 
one fit for Dasein. In this, work is not only characterized as ego 
enhancement (though Heidegger also suggests as much when he states that 
the unemployed "should, 
<I>before himself,</I>
 win back the dignity and 
footing 
<I>["Halt"]</I>
 that is fitting and, 
<I>before his fellow</I>
countrymen, earn for himself the security and determination that is 
fitting" [
<I>NZH,</I>
 199]). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">
8</A>
</SUP>
In this, it is above all 
postulated that Dasein itself is essentially work: the creation of 
employment "creates" the capacity for Dasein, and since Dasein "in the 
first place and above all" lies in this fitness, in its capacity and 
possibility, it "creates," along with work, immediately also Dasein. 
Dasein is work, and--according to the ideology of the reconciliation of 
classes and social strata--it is the work of the "fist" no less than that 
of the "brow." Since work, in itself, must already be knowledge if it is 
at all to be properly work, the creation of work must complete itself 
organically--thus runs Heidegger's argument--through the creation of 
knowledge 
<I>("Wissensbeschaffung").</I>
 Heidegger deduces the necessary 
(and, incidentally, politically inoffensive) consequence from this program 
of deprivileging when he says 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
"The worker" and a person in possession of scientific knowledge are not 
opposites. Every worker is each in his own way knowledgeable ["ein 
Wissender"], and only as one 
<B></B>
 with such knowledge can 
he work at all. The animal is denied the prerogative of work, and 
inversely, everyone who knowingly ["wissentlich"] acts and everyone who 
scientifically ["wissenschaftlich"] decides is a worker [NZH, 202]. 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
With this, as the (poorly founded) opposition to the animal well 
indicates, the essence of Dasein in general, its 
<I>humanity,</I>
 is once 
again located in conscious, knowing, and volitional work. "All work 
<I>as work</I>
 is something spiritual 
<I>["Geistiges"],</I>
 for it grounds 
itself on proper knowledge" (
<I>NZH,</I>
 202). 
<p>
For Heidegger, Dasein is characterized as the work of knowledge 
<I>(Wissensarbeit)</I>
 and thus, essentially, as technology. This 
characterization is made for the most part independently of the politics 
of class appeasement and against the background of 
<I>t&eacute;chne,</I>
from the lexicon of Greek philosophy, that is to say, understood above all 
as practical know-how and knowledgeable praxis. Heidegger postulates the 
identity of work and knowledge as 
<I>t&eacute;chne</I>
 in his Rectorship 
Address, written five months prior to his Work Procurement speech. In 
connection with the Aeschylus sitation, "know-ledge" ("
<I>Wissen"</I>
 is 
Heidegger's shorthand translation for 
<I>t&eacute;chne</I>
) "is much more 
impotent than necessity." Heidegger characterizes this "creative impotence 
<I>["Unkraft"]</I>
 of knowledge"--and thus of the work of knowledge 
<I>("Wissensarbeit"),</I>
 of work in general, and of 
<I>t&eacute;chne</I>
--as "
<I>the</I>
 ultimate form of man's 
<I>energeia,</I>
 the ultimate way of man's Being-at-work 
<I>["am-Werke-Sein"].</I>
"

Accordingly, he characterizes 
"theory itself as the ultimate realization of the true praxis" 
(
<I>SDU,</I>
 12). 
<I>T&eacute;chne,</I>
 in the double sense of knowledge 
and work, is thus for the Heidegger of the Rectorship Address "the 
ultimate realization" of Dasein; and 
<I>energeia,</I>
 as "Being-at-work," 
is Dasein itself. Like the questioning of the philosopher, this work is 
not a prelude to something else but is "itself the ultimate form 
<I>["Gestalt"]</I>
 of knowledge" (
<I>SDU,</I>
 13). It is, I repeat, 
"form," and as this "ultimate form," it is the "ultimate actualization" 
and therefore the actuality of Dasein. This means, however (and Heidegger 
deduces the consequence with the precision of a logician), that Dasein 
--determined as work, 
<I>t&eacute;chne,</I>
<I>energeia</I>
--
<I>creates</I>
 not only itself but also (incidentally, 
very much in contrast to the antisubjectivist conception of 
<I>Being and Time</I>
) its world. Heidegger writes: "If we want the essence of science 
in the sense of a questioning, unprotected steadfastness amid the 
uncertainty of beings as a whole, then this will to essence 
<I>["Wesenswille"]</I>
 will 
<I>create</I>
 for our people their world of 
most interior and exterior danger, that is, their truly spiritual world" 
(

 203).

The "form" 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 of work as 
the "essence" of science as well as of Dasein allows for steadfastness 
<I>("Standhalten")</I>
 in the world of danger. But to the extent that 
"form" willfully withstands this danger, Heidegger argues &agrave; la 
Hegel, it is not passively exposed to but is itself agent, mover, creator 
of this world and this danger. Dasein, therefore, is essentially 
constituted as 
<I>auto-t&eacute;chne,</I>
 and it is as such doubled in 
itself, polemically different from itself: it is the steadfast "form" of 
work and, at the same time, the working out 
<I>("Erarbeitung")</I>
 of 
danger--self-assertion and self-endangerment in one, creating and 
"creative impotence,"

<IMG SRC="thumb/3.1hamacher_greek01.gif">

</SUB>, which as such exposes itself to the 
<SUB>
<IMG SRC="thumb/3.1hamacher_greek02.gif">
ALT="[greek text]">
</SUB>
 it worked for and itself 
created. In contrast to Hitler's paranoid 
<B></B>
 dissociation of what is properly one's own and what 
is foreign, Heidegger insists that in the work of Dasein itself there is 
something at play that remains utterly irreducible to this work. If Dasein 
is work, then it is work only because it is exposed in itself to something 
other than itself. And yet, the Rectorship Address leaves no doubt that 
the work of Dasein ought not be work 
<I>with</I>
 or 
<I>on</I>
 this other 
but, rather, work 
<I>against</I>
 it. It should be work 
<I>against</I>
 what 
in this work itself stands out as "uncertain" (
<I>SDU,</I>
 13, 14), 
"constant world uncertainty" (
<I>"st&auml;ndige Weltungewi&szlig;heit"</I>
[
<I>SDU,</I>
 14]), as "hidden" (
<I>"verborgen"</I>
 [
<I>SDU,</I>
 11]), as 
"madness" (
<I>SDU,</I>
 19), "cessation" (
<I>"Ende"</I>
 [
<I>SDU,</I>
 10]), 
and "nonbeing" (
<I>"Nichtsein"</I>
 [
<I>SDU,</I>
 10])--in short, against 
what stands out as foreign to work, against what is out of work and 
unemployable. Dasein is ergontologically constituted. But, for precisely 
this reason, it cannot contest the necessary existence of what is foreign 
to work, of the other, without simultaneously entering into battle with 
itself as an other that is not yet itself. As work, Dasein, being-there, 
is being-there-in-danger 
<I>(Da-in-der-Gefahr),</I>
 and, as such, it is 
being-there-with-the-other 
<I>(Da-beim-Anderen-Sein).</I>
 Its 
<SUB>
<IMG 
SRC="thumb/3.1hamacher_greek01.gif"

</SUB>
exists only to the extent that it remains in itself exposed to an

<IMG SRC="thumb/3.1hamacher_greek02.gif">
ALT="[greek text]">
</SUB>. 
The option of thinking work as defined 
<I>against</I>
 this other is not a 
philosophical but a political (indeed, a national-political and 
ego-political) option--one with which the self of Dasein in the egological 
form of the 
<I>proper</I>
 people was meant to stand its ground and be 
hypostatized as an ergopolitical state of the self. 
<p>
Despite its recognition of the "uncertain," or "questionable," of the 
"aletheically" hidden and therefore irreducibly other, the ontology of 
work in Heidegger's Rectorship Address remains an ontology of the 
"questionability of 
<I>proper</I>
 Dasein" (
<I>"Fragw&uuml;rdigkeit des eigenen Daseins"</I>
 [
<I>SDU,</I>
 15]). It is an ontology of a particular 
"people" philosophically and politico-historically privileged in its work, 
an ontology of 
<I>proper</I>
 work and of work itself as inalienable and 
unexposed 
<I>propriety.</I>
 Very concretely, this means:  that work is 
the essential form of socialization;  that the society of work is 
always the only 
<I>proper</I>
 society--the "people";  that it can be a 
society only of aggressive appropriation, one that must "advance" and 
"march forward" 
<I>("vorr&uuml;cken")</I>
 into the uncertain (
<I>SDU,</I>
14); and  that this work-society must be voluntaristically organized, 
must be a work-state and leader-state. Heidegger declares in his Work 
Procurement speech that "'worker and work,' as National Socialism 
understands these words, divides not into classes but binds and unifies 
fellow countrymen and social stations into the one great will of the 
state" (
<I>NZH,</I>
 202). Work is the "will 
<I>of</I>
 the state"--that is, 
<I>genetivus subjectivus,</I>
 work is always already that which the state 
wills. However, it also means that all work, to the extent that it is 
work, is also already a will for the state and the work of the state and 
on the state. Heidegger, along with Ernst J&uuml;nger, calls the state of 
Dasein the "work-state" (
<I>"Arbeitsstaat"</I>
 [
<I>NZH,</I>
 202]); it is 
the state toward which the work of the self-enacting and self-instituting 
Dasein that wills itself as state strives. This"work-state"is Dasein itself; more precisely, it is the self of Dasein as 
institution. Understood as work and technology, Dasein is immediately its 
own proper instatement, its nationalization 
<I>("Verstaatlichung").</I>
 It 
is--in a turn of phrase that Heidegger soon thereafter, in the Nietzsche 
<B></B>
 Lectures, denounces as the last re of the 
occidental metaphysics of subjectivity--the will to power as state. And 
because work is the "ultimate form" (
<I>"h&ouml;chste Gestalt"</I>
[
<I>NZH,</I>
 202]) of man, it must subject itself to the principle of form 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 and follow a leader, in whom the "will of the state" 
(
<I>"Wille des Staates"</I>
 [
<I>NZH,</I>
 202]) embodies itself. In what 
the will to work wills, Heidegger can accordingly conclude, "
<I>we follow only</I>
 the preeminent volition of our leader. To become a follower 
indeed means: . . . incessantly 
<I>["unausgesetzt"]</I>
 willing that the 
German people, as a people of work, . . . as a work-state, secure itslongevity and greatness" (
<I>NZH,</I>
 202; my emphasis). Just as 
Heidegger insists at the end of the Rectorship Address that "our"decision for "ourselves" has "already been decided"by the 
"young and newest force of the people" (
<I>SDU,</I>
 19) and that our 
decision is, therefore, only a decision for the "force" and "form" of the 
decision, he supposes here, at the end of the Work Procurement speech, 
that the will of the "we" is "already" "surpassed" by the will of the 
"leader" and, thus, by a will to what has "already" been willed. Dasein, 
the will to power as state, can first come into its own, according to this 
logic of self-appropriation, self-forging and self-formation, in the 
re of the leader. It thereby adheres to a logic of the historical 
present thought as restitution and reinstitution. In willing the already 
willed and in deciding for the already decided, Dasein comes 
<I>back</I>
to its proper future as a past in which all that can be has "already" been 
willed and all that must be has "already" been decided. 
<p>
Inthis circular self-comprehension of the will in the form 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 of the state, "work-state" and leader-state, Dasein, 
thought and promulgated as work, achieves presence and denies, indeed 
disavows in its incessant 
<I>("unausgesetzten")</I>
 willing, that it must 
itself in the first place be experienced as exposedness 
<I>("Ausgesetztheit"),</I>
 if indeed it should be able to determine itself 
as work. "Work = presence" is the formula Heidegger uses in his Logic 
Lectures of the summer semester of 1934. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">
11</A>
</SUP>
The presence of 
which he speaks here is understood to be eminently historial, namely, 
productive of history. But it is auto- and tauto-historical.In a 
steadfast form attuned to "longevity and greatness," it is history as the 
self-appropriation of work: monumentalization of the autonomy of the self 
<I>("Selbst&auml;ndigkeit")</I>
 at the cost of all 
<I>others.</I>
 As with 
Hitler, the Christological feature of self-presentation and 
self-historicization is not lacking in Heidegger's treatment of the 
monument of work: "God is dead," Heidegger proclaims--citing the 
pronouncement of Nietzsche, the "last German Philosopher"--and suggests 
that he himself, as the very last, the final, or even post-final, 
philosopher, can proclaim the finite resurrection of this dead God, the 
restitution and return of finite Dasein in the form of the technological 
"work-state." 
<p>
Dasein is no longer a temporalizing projection into the unrepresentable 
and unbounded open as it was in 
<I>Being and Time.</I>
 It is also not 
ex-position and exile into the unembodiable, as in Heidegger's later 
philosophy. Dasein is here, in the political fundamental ontology of the 
Rectorship period, work as installment and installation, as the 
putting-to-work 
<I>("die Einsetzung und das 'Ins-Werk-Setzen'")</I>
 of the 
truth of its present decision for its "ownmost possibilities" in the form 
of the "work-state" and its "leader." And this Dasein is the 
self-production of the finite subject 
<B></B>
 only to the 
extent that it is the re-production of the previously posited 
Christological paradigm of reproduction. It is ex-position not to the 
unpositable but into positing--activism of positivity. Here, the question 
is no longer one of the openness of Being as being-other but of the arrest 
and internment of Being in what already is 
<I>(im schon-Seienden).</I>
 The 
political ergontology and morphontology of Heidegger during the Rectorship 
period was the ethical and political collapse of his philosophy: the 
collapse, namely, of the ontological difference, in many respects an 
endogenous collapse, for Heidegger never ceased to think Being as the 
Being 
<I>of</I>
 beings and 
<I>of</I>
 Dasein. 
<p>
I turn to the third determination of work, the morphological, and to the 
third author, Ernst J&uuml;nger. Though published before the National 
Socialists came to power in October of 1932 and denounced by Hilter as 
National Bolshevist, internationalistic and "dangerous to the public," 
J&uuml;nger's book, 
<I>The Worker</I>
<I>(Der Arbeiter),</I>
 is the 
protofascist manifesto par excellence. J&uuml;nger himself had dedicated a 
presentation copy of 
<I>Fire and Blood</I>
 in 1926 to "the national leader 
Adolf Hitler!" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">
12</A>
</SUP>
but after 1932 J&uuml;nger disdained all 
contact with the "shooting-gallery re." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">
13</A>
</SUP>
Much later, he 
time and again defended 
<I>The Worker</I>
 as a nonpartisan diagnosis and 
answered his critics with the charge, "after the earthquake, one smashes 
up the seismographs." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">
14</A>
</SUP>
This sententious defense is 
symptomatic in its dishonesty. In the first place, fascism was not a 
natural event--but this is exactly how J&uuml;nger, in a way that we will 
have to discuss, conceptualizes it. In the second place, after an 
earthquake one smashes up only the seismographs that failed to register 
the quaking. In the third place, the diagnostician of political 
catastrophes is, in fact, reproachable for not having taken steps to 
prevent them. Even in his muddled allegory 
<I>Auf den Marmorklippen,</I>
J&uuml;nger did not so much as lift a finger or utter a word against 
National Socialism. That he maintained a distance between himself and his 
protagonists was a matter of intellectual 
<I>d&eacute;go&ucirc;t.</I>
 That 
he later condemned them he himself repeatedly attributed to his contempt 
for their technical incompetence. In Heidegger's conciliatory but 
nonetheless devastating critique of J&uuml;nger, "Zur Seinsfrage" (On the 
question of being)--a text also readable as a self-critique of his 
Rectorship philosophy--Heidegger is less disingenuous, both politically 
and theoretically more precise, when he recalls that a small circle of 
university instructors, for whom he had elucidated 
<I>The Worker</I>
 in 
the winter semester of 1938-39, were not surprised that the discussion had 
been "monitored and ultimately broken up." "For," explains Heidegger, "it 
belongs to the essence of the will to power not to let the actual that it 
empowers appear in actuality as what it itself 
<I>is.</I>
" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">
15</A>
</SUP>
Translated, this means: the Nazis--the actualized will to power--wanted to 
prevent the truth about themselves from being told. And this means 
further: 
<I>The Worker</I>
 offers a phenomenology--but the most apologetic 
one imaginable--of the National Socialist system. 
<p>
J&uuml;nger concludes 
<I>The Worker</I>
 with the sentence, "Here, to 
partake and render service: that is the task that is expected of 
us." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">
16</A>
</SUP>
Like nearlyeverything else he has written, this 
not only pompously but also wretchedly formulated imperative, this "task 
that is expected of us," dictates "the steeling of arms and hearts." 
Evoking Max 
<B></B>
 Weber's metaphor about the "steel-hard 
casing" 
<I>("stahlharten Geh&auml;use")</I>
 required by the "rational way 
of life" and borne by "the spirit of Christian asceticism," J&uuml;nger 
does not of course reiterate Weber's culture-pessimistic alienation thesis 
but, rather, formulates the martial program of a constructivism that will 
bring "pure existence into view," "pure existence" as "form" 
<I>("Gestalt"),</I>
 in the unity of the "dominion and form 
<I>["Gestalt"]</I>
" of the worker (
<I>A,</I>
 246). From the first to the 
very last pages of his treatise, J&uuml;nger leaves no doubt that he is 
not concerned merely with a limited sociological phenomenon--the 
preponderance of the "lower classes," the ever increasing pervasiveness of 
its lifestyle, the planetarization of the "workshop-landscape." His theme 
is, more grandly, the "ultimate existence" (
<I>A,</I>
 36), the "fullness" 
of Being "in the force of a shaping 
<I>["Pr&auml;gung"]</I>
 that only just 
began" (
<I>A,</I>
 45). 
<I>The Worker</I>
 lays claim to being nothing less 
than an ontology--not an ontology of work (a task reserved until much 
later for the restorative attempts, Marxist in orientation, of 
Luk&aacute;cs) 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">
17</A>
</SUP>
but rather an ontology of the "form" 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 of its "bearer," a morphontology. J&uuml;nger's book 
presents itself not only as the diagnosis of a transformation of class 
structure, not only as a prognosis of the planetary uniformation of 
society, time- and space-experience in a "plan-state" and "plan-scape" of 
unimaginable proportion. It presents itself much more as the 
theory--better yet, the vision--of an organic as well as technical 
paradigm that--exempt from all fluctuations, movements, and 
developments--persists as the transhistorical ground of all res. "Thus 
the re of the worker," J&uuml;nger writes, "is more deeply and 
statically em-bedded in Beingthan all the likenesses and orders 
with which it confirms itself, deeper than constitutions and works, than 
man and his communities, which are like the changing expression on a face 
whose fundamental character persists unchanged" (
<I>A,</I>
 45). The name 
"worker" is neither a professional title nor a reference to human 
individuals or masses. Individuals and masses, according to J&uuml;nger, 
are bourgeois and thus obsolete categories. Rather, "worker" is the title 
of a "new type of man," a type in which the "form" 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 of 
the worker" is embodied" (
<I>A,</I>
 311). 
<p>
In its onto-morpho-logical conception, 
<I>The Worker</I>
 not only exhibits 
that disposition for totality whose loss had been bemoaned by left-wing as 
well as right-wing intellectuals of the Weimar Republic. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">
18</A>
</SUP>
It 
also "embodies" and "represents" this totality founded in the "re" of 
an indelible "Being." And to this "re" corresponds the totality of the 
world--a correspondence J&uuml;nger never tires of stressing. It is a 
world that increasingly assumes the character of a "work world" 
<I>("Arbeitswelt"),</I>
 without niches, refuges, or vestiges of nature. 
The convergence of "total work character" 
<I>("totalem Arbeitscharakter"),</I>
 which appears as the "mobilization of matter" in 
the "totality of technical space," with the "totality of the type," which 
sketches itself in the "mobilization of man"--this convergence of power 
and world "expresses itself," J&uuml;nger writes, "in the fusion of the 
difference between the organic and the mechanical world; its symbol is the 
organic construction" (
<I>A,</I>
 177). The fusion anticipated by 
J&uuml;nger between the work type 
<I>("Arbeitstypus")</I>
 and the work 
world 
<I>("Arbeitswelt"),</I>
 between organic and mechanical mobilization, 
is thus guaranteed by a kind of preestablished harmony. Here, they 
coexist in the transcendent "Being" of 
<B></B>
 the "re" 
<I>("Gestalt"),</I>
 which becomes visible in its symbol, the "organic 
construction" (
<I>A,</I>
 177). This "organic construction," this "symbol" 
of "static Being" is, however, nothing other than technology (
<I>A,</I>
309). It represents "form" 
<I>("Gestalt"),</I>
 whether in the means of 
production, from the wheel to electricity, or in lifestyle, from the 
uniform gesture to cultural orders. And conversely, technology is, as 
J&uuml;nger understands it, symbol. "Technology," he explains, "is 
meaningful only because it is the way in which the re 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 of the worker mobilizes the world. This fact endows it 
with the status of a symbol" (
<I>A,</I>
 200; cf. 196 and 311). Technology 
is symbol or representative or representation of Being. The "total 
mobilization" of matter and man through technology is the symbol or 
representative or incarnation of this static form 
<I>("Gestalt").</I>
 "The 
type . . . possesses rank in the degree to which it embodies the re of 
the worker" (
<I>A,</I>
 311). The "work-state" and its "plan-scape," the 
workshop-landscape and its "work-armies" 
<I>("Arbeitsheere")</I>
--or 
anything else that becomes an object of the physiognomic and political 
visions of J&uuml;nger--is embodiment, representation, expression, 
radiance, crystallization, appearance, symbol or--time and 
again--"representation" of "presence." And this holds a fortiori for work. 
It is always work in the strongest sense and has meaning as work 
exclusively to the degree that it is the work of signification, of 
symbolization, and of the representation of "the worker," of his "re," 
of his, and thus of its, 
<I>proper</I>
 "presence." It is 
<I>properly</I>
work only as a return to what does not work, work only as the annulment of 
work to the benefit of the epiphany of "static Being" (
<I>A,</I>
 309). 
<p>
It goes without saying that this conception of work, interpretation, 
language, politics, and being is anything but "revolutionary." Or, it is 
"revolutionary" only insofar as it is the restitution of a classical 
morphology, of an idealistic semiology--a symbology--the restitution of a 
classical, metaphysical ontology of work. What distinguishes J&uuml;nger's 
conception from these, however, is his taste for undifferentiated 
uniformity, his obsession with the formalism of the "total." As a result, 
he promulgates not a national or international socialism but a planetary 
socialism without society--not a worker's state, but a "work-plan-state" 
under the "will to total dictatorship" (
<I>A,</I>
 45). This may prevent 
him from being a vulgar racist, but it causes him to be a techno-racist, 
who glimpses the burgeoning of a "new race" of "consummate stamp" 
(
<I>A,</I>
 245), with "racelike quality" (
<I>A,</I>
 212), from the "native 
soil of the people" (
<I>A,</I>
 307). His fanatical fixation on the total 
permits him to consign to oblivion bourgeois museum culture and the 
"so-called cultural assets" whose conservation it serves. But, at the same 
time, it forces him not only to generalize art as the "representation of 
the form of the worker" (
<I>A,</I>
 217) but also to render it 
"absolute"--and, thus rendering it absolute, to conserve it. J&uuml;nger's 
totalism permits him to recognize that the universalization of 
technology--the "mobilization of the world through the form of the 
worker"--will result in the wholesale destruction of cult powers; his 
totalism also permits him to recognize in this universalization "the most 
decisive anti-Christian power" (
<I>A,</I>
 161). But this same totalism 
causes him, in turn, to assign "cultic significance" (
<I>A,</I>
 246) to 
the "form of the worker." In short, J&uuml;nger's gestures are dictated by 
a repetition compulsion. Not only does he time and again 
<B></B>
 repeat one and the same argument--his argument is itself 
fundamentally one of repetition, restitution, reinstitution: the cults 
must be destroyed in order that the one cult can be erected; thefeeble arts of civil society must beswept away and room made 
for absolute art as the representation of the generative "elementary 
forces" (
<I>A,</I>
 207);races are obsolete, but in their place 
rises a techno-race of precision and violence. Nation states are wasting 
away in the anarchy of competition. They will be replacedby the 
planetary dictatorship of a peerless order. The destruction of the 
particular is always at the service of its resurrection in the general; 
the dissolution of the manifold, at the service of the re-creation of its 
one model; the break up of forms and movements, at the service of the 
reconstruction of the one static form. J&uuml;nger's system is not 
National Socialist for the sole reason that it represents the latter's 
hypertrophy--and thus, quite simply, its principle. His system is the 
system of the planetary techno-morpho-logical archi-fascism. It is the 
system of "total mobilization" to the point of the immobility of the form 
(
<I>A,</I>
 220), the system of the planetary performance of form, ofpure positivity. 
<p>
"The task of total mobilization is the transformation of life into energy. . . . Thus, it draws on the potency of life, while formation gives 
expression to Being and must avail itself not of a language ofmovement but, rather, of a language of forms" (
<I>A,</I>
 220). The 
identity of energy and form, of a language of movement and one of forms, 
culminates in that "mathematically factual style," that "precise, univocal 
language" in the "univocal space" (
<I>A,</I>
 279) of an "univocal and 
rigid work world" (
<I>A,</I>
 277), whose organ is the press. The univocity 
of the language of work, which affords just as little latitude to other 
meanings as to other languages and fulfills itself every instant in the 
actualization of its ideal of discourse, finds its perfectly suited 
counterpart in the "changed way in which one today reads the newspaper." 
J&uuml;nger finds: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Even reading is no longer compatible with the concept of leisure; it 
appears far more with the markings of the special work-character. . . . 
One wants to feel that the world changes as one reads, yet, at the same 
time, this change is constant in the sense of a monotone alternation of 
the colorful signals one scurries past [in public transportation].

 277] 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The constant change at which the act, the "work-act" 
<I>(Arbeitsakt),</I>
of reading aims, according to J&uuml;nger, is a "change" exclusively 
within the static conditions of the one, final, "univocal world of work." 
It is the constant recurrence of the same, of the "monotone alternation" 
of traffic signals. The "total mobilization" of signal language and of its 
immediate correspondent signal reading is nothing else than the 
mobilization to the static form of "Being." In this totally mobilizedlanguage, the world changes instantaneously when it is spoken or read. 
It is a "happening" that "distinguishes itself through presence" 
(
<I>A,</I>
 277), through the presence, namely, of a form that lies in the 
generalized auto-performance as the automatic identity of stating and 
understanding, of mobilization and constancy, of act and meaning, 
addresser and addressee. It is in this perfect collapse of all pragmatic, 
semantic, grammatical, and

language that its "special work-character" takes shape. In this collapse, 
performativism and formalism, monosemantism and autotropism collaborate in 
the uniformed universe of there of the worker. The 
archi-fascism that presents itself in this re is nothing other than 
the system of technically installed presence: the system of the "nothing 
other." 
<p>
"Work in the highest sense," so writes J&uuml;nger, "means representation 
of the worker" (
<I>A,</I>
 212). But this means self
<B>-</B>
representation 
of presence, representation of what does not work; accordingly, work in 
the highest sense means the annulment of work. The consequence is 
compelling, and J&uuml;nger never ceased to repeat it in every imaginable 
variation. He thereby delivered the formula of the National Socialist 
ideology of work. For all three models of work discussed here--the 
mytho-theological, the ontological, and the morphological--work is, 
paradoxically, exactly what does 
<I>not</I>
 work. For Hitler, work is the 
propagandistic citation of the myth of resurrection and 
self-appropriation. It directs itself against everything that is other as 
the already dead and terminates political work in murder. For the 
Heidegger of the Rectorship philosophy, work is the structure of Dasein 
insofar as it does not just direct itself to but 
<I>against</I>
 the other 
and only thus assists in the establishment of one's proper "form" 
<I>("Gestalt").</I>
 For J&uuml;nger, it is the representation of "form" 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 and reabsorption of movement in its constancy. Defined 
as self-appropriation, self-restitution, and self-institution, work is 
always the technology, or symbol, of what does not work. It is stasis,order, mythically immobile form, or historically transcendent Being. 
It is thus the always already proper that should always already be 
belonging and conforming to itself. In work, all three models promise 
freedom from work. That means, however, that they promise freedom from the 
other. They are models of self-resurrection insofar as they are models of 
the destruction of the other. The work that they propagate is actually 
resistance 
<I>against</I>
 work. For, however much it may still be a 
project of appropriation and formation, work that is not fascistically 
organized is always exposed to an other irreducible to the form of the 
self and inaccessible to its appropriations. It is always also a project 
that remains open to the other, to nonwork, to what is foreign to work, to 
an 
<I>anergon.</I>
<p>
One of the reasons why it is so difficult to work through the fascistic 
obsession is that it is an obsession that consists in the systematic 
disavowal of work. The institutions of National Socialism did not want to 
be open projects but, rather, immediate realizations of an idea--orof a phantasm. The institutions wanted to bring history itself to a 
standstill in form and monument, and it is thus difficult, if not 
impossible, to integrate them into its course. If they can be worked 
through, then this work must not confine itself to a recognition and 
acknowledgment of their murderous atrocities. What has to be worked 
through is the resistance against work and against working through, 
against the resistance that was there from its start and that determined 
its political theories as well as its praxis. The work of National 
Socialism--the work of the "redeemer," of "form" of "Being"--was 
determined from the outset to produce nothing: nothing but its self, 
nothing but the form of its being, nothing but the self, and thus 
<I>nothing.</I>
 It was work as the work of the extermination of work and 
as the 
<B></B>
 work of self-extermination.

Working through this work does not only mean mourning 
<I>over</I>
 the 
victims of the fascists and thus 
<I>for</I>
 the fascists--namely, instead 
of them--but also 
<I>over</I>
 and 
<I>for</I>
 us: to mourn over what in our 
work is mere integration, assimilation, appropriation, self-assertion, and 
self-production and not also alteration 
<I>("Veranderung"),</I>
 to mourn 
over what is merely work and not also what in work itself is not and never 
will be work. The ideology of work, still dominant today, its concealment 
in sociological theories of intersubjectivity or interdiscursivity, its 
systematic idealization and its practical tyranny, we ourselves, to the 
extent that we are subject to, or take part in, it--all belongs to what 
makes up the arsenal of resistance against the working through of 
fascistic systems of work. We cannot allow ourselves to be contented with 
any theory of work, of production, or of positing that repeats the old 
morpho- and ergontologisms, even if only implicity, in the guise of the 
new, without opening them through attention for the amorphic and 
anamorphic, the anergic, unstable, and destabilizing, for the workless and 
for those who strike. Working through has a chance only when work itself 
is worked through and opened to what is not work, which is never static 
form, state, or statue, and never pure performance or pure re. Under 
conditions other than those of the 
<I>anergon,</I>
 of 
<I>afformation</I>
and 
<I>afration</I>
 there is no other future.

After having written in "Leisure and Idleness" in 
<I>The Gay Science</I>
about the "breathless haste" of work as the proper "vice of the new 
world," Nietzsche continues--and has not only America but also Europe in 
mind: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Even now one is ashamed of resting, and prolonged reflection almost gives 
people a bad conscience. One thinks with a watch in one's hand, even as 
one eats one's midday meal while reading the latest news of the stock 
market; one lives as if one always "might miss out on something." . . . 
More and more, work enlists all good conscience on its side; the desire 
for joy already calls itself a "need to recuperate" and is beginning to be 
ashamed of itself. "One owes it to one's health"--that is what people say 
when they are caught on an excursion into the country. Soon we may well 
reach the point where people can no longer give in to the desire for a 
vita contemplativa (that is, taking a walk with ideas and friends) without 
self-contempt and a bad conscience.

Regardless of whatever else it might have been,National Socialism 
could be all that it was only because it was a system of work. 
International capitalsocialism, in this respect, does not lag behind. It 
is the perpetuation of that system with scarcely altered means. One will 
have to, when confronted with both--and we all are, with no exceptions, 
confronted with both--one will have to ask oneself what in the structure 
of work and in the joints, rifts, and rejects of its system permits of 
another work 
<B></B>
 and perhaps something other than work, 
to ask oneself what its 
<I>Parerga</I>
 and 
<I>Anerga</I>
 and what "taking 
a walk with ideas and friends" allows. One will have to inquire into a 
conduct and a language--and, doubtless, not only inquire--that do not 
work, that cannot be deployed as a means, and that serve neither those 
systems nor like systems to come. 
<p>
One will have to work in such a way that the work of fascism, the fascism 
of work, cannot live off it and continue to work. Otherwise, the talk 
about working off the past is a feeble reclamation--to whose address? It 
must, however, have a sense that does not allow itself to be dominated by 
this past--or by any of the other pasts--but, rather, one that lays it 
bare and renders it analyzable under the very sober light of a still 
unimaginable future and of what in this future is more and something other 
than future. 
<p>
One will have to work in such a way that one bids farewell to the heroic 
redemption and damnation schemes of mythic provenience, which always and 
always 
<I>still</I>
 ally themselves with the concept and experience of 
work (and, once more, with concept and experience 
<I>as</I>
 work). One 
will have to work in such a way that one goes thence where the heroism of 
redemption 
<I>("Erl&ouml;sung"),</I>
 of dissolution--the solution 
<I>("L&ouml;sung"),</I>
 "final solution" 
<I>("Endl&ouml;sung"),</I>
immanent to work and discourse--and the fatalism of damnation, of the 
cursed earth, of work as socage, as punishment and humiliation, depose 
<I>("aussetzen").</I>
<p>
Working through history always runs the risk of falling under the law of 
vengeance. It runs the risk thus of falling under the law of exchange, the 
quid pro quo, the symmetry of the tooth for a tooth and between one eye 
and another and 
<I>ergo </I>
under the law of the repetition and 
perpetuation of the past. If this working through is to have a chance of 
breaking free from the vicious circle of vengeance, then it must break 
free from the circle of work determined as vengeance. In this work, 
something more than work, something other than vengeance, and something, 
with respect to the past, new must occur. From this excess, this 
excendence, of work something suggests itself in the concept of working 
through: on the one hand, it indicates the traversal of a traumatic event 
and its transformation into a conscious experience. Thus it indicates that 
process in which what has remained unconscious or preconscious and what 
persists in the form of phantasmatic reproductions is revealed to 
consciousness and becomes available for processing 
<I>("Verarbeitung").</I>
 In this sense, working through concerns the 
repetition compulsion that threatens to block work. Work itself, however, 
can be subject to repetition compulsion and, consequently, can itself 
constitute a blockageto work and to working through. In the pure 
mechanics of obsessive activities, it can be the unconscious execution of 
a traumatic command, the subservient fulfillment of a dictatorial scheme, 
the always identical reproduction of an always identical injury and its 
defense. Working through would mean, then, making this anxiety and that 
injury accessible in a gradual process, gaining access to the 
inaccessible, 
<B></B>
 passing the impassable. On the other 
hand, however, "working through" must mean further that one works 
<I>through</I>
 ("
<I>hindurch</I>
arbeiten") that trauma and this 
over-and-over-again 
<I>retraumatizing</I>
 work, that one does not stick to 
the work on trauma and the trauma of work but, rather, that one can 
<I>pass through</I>
 and 
<I>over and above</I>
 its permanent restitution 
and reinstitution. This working through and working one's way out of work 
can no longer be achieved 
<I>by way</I>
 of work, according to its scheme, 
its concept, and its ideal. It must far more pass through this scheme, 
this concept, and this ideal and pass over and above it. It must, as 
working through, be more and something other than work. Or it must, in 
accord with its tendency, at very least go 
<I>at </I>
this more and this 
other, approach them. 
<p>
Prepared long in advance, totalitarianisms have made work a trauma. They 
have laid it to waste. The history of capitalist work, which culminated in 
the National Socialist, Fascist, and Stalinist economies of terror and 
which, 
<I>far from over,</I>
 continues in the politics of exploitation and 
self-exploitation in not only the "developed" but also and especially in 
"underdeveloped" countries--this history of work, in the establishment of 
its absolute, that is to say, murderous and suicidal standard, has reached 
its end. We are not living 
<I>after</I>
 the end of this history; we are 
living 
<I>at</I>
 its end. We are living--if we can simply call this 
"living"--on the 
<I>border</I>
 of history determined as work, in its 
<I>epoch&eacute;</I>
 more than its epoch: there, thus, where this history 
no longer simply makes progress but, rather, where the scheme of this 
history, its historicity, the scheme of work--sheer 
auto-performance--opens itself. In this opening, the possibility of an 
other history or of something other than "history," the possibility of an 
<I>other</I>
 work or of something other than work, announces itself. But 
this is not a promise. The promise belongs--albeit ambiguously--to the 
order of the history of work. This does not give cause to hope. Hopes are 
oriented toward the future, toward what is to come, toward what comes 
forth and, working, produces itself, or what through work is produced. We 
touch now on--and have already for some time, and perhaps have already as 
long as "there is" time--the end of "work-time" 
<I>("Arbeits-Zeit").</I>
We touch it (I merely note these two examples) with the hyperstable 
apparatuses and the machines produced by machines that remove themselves 
further and further from "human" labor and leave a breach there where this 
"human" labor was. We touch it, on the other hand, in the fact of the 
finitude of "natural" resources: both times, in that we touch the border 
of classical work and work materials and thus touch upon something out of 
work. 
<p>
If the "re of the worker" constitutes a fusion in which the tendencies 
of the past join forces with the new instruments of technology in order to 
forge an autonomous type, or even the type of types, and if this re 
should represent a "destiny" whose historical emergence breaks through 
even history itself, then the question is, what does 
<I>not</I>
 fall under 
the precinct of the auto-morphosis, of this self-production of the 
re of work? 
<B></B>
<p>
What is an 
<I>anergon?</I>
<p>
Are the working conditions produced without exception by work? Are they 
the products of work? Or are they exclusively working material? 
<p>
What does not show itself, what does not work its way out, what 
<I>is</I>
not, as work? 
<p>
What is the metahorizon of the horizon, the other side of the horizon, 
that gives contour to the re of the worker? It is first the other side 
of the horizon that makes it possible for this re to erect itself, but 
on this other side it falls. 
<p>
What is the space--
<I>is</I>
 it and is it 
<I>something</I>
--in which the 
worker sets up his workshop? 
<p>
What does not conform to this re, without, however, resisting it? And 
what resists it without itself being an object? 
<p>
And, is it, in general, a what, a something, that does not work there, or 
is a "nonmodalizable," a withholding that eludes all modalities, all types 
and manners, all forms and measures, all procedures and means? What 
relation does the 
<I>ammodel</I>
 entertain with the model? I shall 
translate to prevent misunderstandings: what relation does the 
<I>admodel</I>
 (the outer horizon that first gives way to the possibility 
of a model and, thus, is itself not a model, but an 
<I>admodel</I>
) 
entertain with the model? And, does it 
<I>entertain</I>
 a relation at all? 
Can this relation of relation and "irrelation" be 
<I>maintained?</I>
<p>
The 
<I>ammodalization.</I>
<I>Ammodelation:</I>
 inauguration and 
suspension of the model, modus, and modernity, the so-called postmodern 
included. Modernity and postmodernity are historical concepts. Wherever it 
is a question of the structure of history and not of intrahistorical 
epochs, one will have to test out the "concept" of 
<I>ammodernization,</I>
of that event whose rhythm gives contour to particular historical epochs, 
modes, and res, to particular historical developments and concepts, 
and even to the concept of history as such, without itself assuming a 
historical form but not without taking something away from their form. 
<p>
The worker is the re of planetaryperformativity: in him it is 
no longer possible to separate reality from theater. He deploys himself, 
repeats himself, and changes himself: iteration and alteration dictate the 
ratio of the transformation of his re; they are his ration, his 
<I>morphosis.</I>
 By dint of its alteration, however, formation must 
always have at least one element that carries on its monstrousnonessence 
<I>("Unwesen"),</I>
 that does not let itself be reduced to 
form and to the process of formation. It must always have something 
unformed from which the form departs, something to which it owes itself 
and through which it is impeded. There must be at least this one element 
that is other than the form and other than the form of genesis of the 
form: an 
<I>afform,</I>
 an 
<I>afformative.</I>
 In it, the domain of the 
possible positing of forms is inaugurated--in this, it is an 
<I>ad-formative</I>
--and in it, the sovereign authority of this domain as 
well as each and every one of its manifestations, each and every one of 
its positings, is de-posed, suspended, disarrayed--in this, this 
<I>afformative</I>
 is an 
<I>a-formative.</I>
 In every 
<I>parergon</I>
 an 
<I>anergon,</I>
 in 
<I>morphosis</I>
 an 
<I>anamorphosis</I>
 or 
<B></B>
<I>amorphosis,</I>
 in every ration and transformation an 
ad-, an a-, an 
<I>afration,</I>
 must impart "itself." 
<p>
This 
<I>afration,</I>
 this 
<I>afformation,</I>
 which does not posit 
but ex-poses, is not something and "is" other than Being. 
<p>
The historian posturing as a border patrolman: he attempts to secure the 
borders between the past, the present, and the future, to regulate 
traffic, and will grant passage only to what can present its marks of 
identification and recognition. Hollywood did not invent the "time cop." 
He already existed as "history cop." Yet what comes to pass with that 
which smuggles itself in under another name, with a marked card, a marked 
mark? 
<I>What comes to pass with the passage itself?</I>
 Does it come to 
pass, or does it not? Where in history lies the counterpart to 
no-man's-land: no-man's-time? 
<p>
Since National Socialism, all concepts are ruins. They are not merely 
stigmatized, not merely damaged: they are rubble. This holds no less for 
the concept of the past than for the concept of recollection, no less for 
the concept of historical progress than for that of work. And it holds, 
moreover, for that of working through. Even for Freud, the ideal of 
working through lay in the cure and thus in the approximation of a 
condition of relative normalcy. This ideal of normalcy entertains too many 
close affinities to the norm implemented by the totalitarian regimes of 
this century not to have exhausted its viability. It can no longer serve 
as a means of orientation. We do, indeed, need criteria, but we do not 
have a single criterion at our disposal that would not be in ruins and not 
a single one that would not harbor the danger of becoming murderous. 
Idealizations are, indeed, structurally unavoidable, but every inherited 
and every imaginable idealization is monstrous. When in a book entitled 
<I>Representing the Holocaust</I>
 someone calls for the development of a 
"social ritual" that would make the work of mourning and the process of 
working through into an institution, when in the same context someone goes 
so far as to attribute a ritual dimension to historiography and ultimately 
asserts that a language adequate to Shoah depends "on ritual as well as 
aesthetic criteria," then one will certainly not be able to deny one's 
empathy with this hair-raising na&iuml;vet&eacute;. However, one will ask 
oneself with horror in what way the program of this aesthetic ritual 
should structurally differ from the program of exactly that ritual--that 
sacrificial ritual--whose working through it is meant to promote. 
The confusionism that here, with an appeal to the notorious ideal of 
critique and critical judgment, exhibits its distressing incapacity for 
critique would have to be understood, for better or for worse, as a 
symptom of the ambivalence of institutionalized ideals--including, of 
course, the ideal of critique. Every ritualization of working through 
would be exempted from working through. There is no "adequate" language 
for the mass murder of Jews, Communists, homosexuals, Gypsies, and the 
ill. There is no adequate concept and no adequate aesthetic form for that 
which could respond to the generalized terror under totalitarian regimes. 
There are only, once more, demolished concepts, ruined rituals, shattered 
forms of representation.
<B></B>
 The "aesthetic rituals" of 
which 
<I>Representing the Holocaust</I>
 dreams, would, of course, be just 
as harmless as they are na&iuml;ve if they were not in principle of a kind 
with the politics of belittlement, harmonization, standardization, and 
idealization-- of the idealization and aestheticization of the Holocaust. . . . 
<p>
It is also not enough to speak of the ruin of forms and their ruinous 
effects. One has to ask oneself what, exactly, remains of the standards, 
the ideals, the schemes of thought and action that organized 
totalitarianism, and one has to ask further what in the remains of the 
terror of work has been spared and may even be rescued from the danger of 
relapse. Little. The minimal structure of work: to relate to something 
other than it ever itself can become. 
<p>
The conceptual remainder that has survived work--and, accordingly, must 
have preceded its rule--this reef in the concept 
<I>(Riff im Begriff)</I>
on which the work of destruction and the self-destruction of work must 
founder, this that is undestructed and unprocessed (I am attempting to 
render this formal minimal structure of work more precise) is, in the 
first place, nothing but its unproductive surplus, its excess, its 
excendence out of the domain of positive, positing, and producing 
violence. This surplus, in any case, has the character of a transference 
<I>("&Uuml;bertragung")</I>
--not, of course, in the sense of a 
substitution of a past form, or its representation, with its "natural" or 
artificial surrogate, but rather a transference to an other that cannot be 
anticipated in a model or grasped according to the scheme of a form. In 
this transference that knows no transferential object, the scope of work 
(as well as, in particular, the scope of what can be called working 
through) is ripped open. In this transference without object and without 
end, without secure trajectory and without recourse, in this 
<I>exfert,</I>
 working takes place as the sheer project of relating to 
something or someone as yet--and always as yet--undetermined. Relating to 
an other, outside the field of work and irreducible to this field, 
transference--a trans-ference that is more than the carrying (the 
"ference") of something bearable, something tolerable or some gain--is 
exactly what remains of work: the play, the open rift in which it moves, 
and the absolute premise under which alone working and working through is 
possible. 
<p>
Freud's understanding of the psychoanalytic notion of working through has 
assumed this direction. Thus understood, working through is possible only 
in the open horizon of transference and relies in all its effects on this 
horizon and its possible opening. The resistance against working through 
is a resistance against transference, against addressing the other, 
against a course or a discourse where the speaking subject gives in to a 
movement in which it constitutes itself just as much as it deconstitutes 
itself. Working through is tranference. And just as working through is 
<I>above all</I>
 a working through virtually the entire complex of work, 
so the transference in question would be 
<I>above all</I>
 a carrying, a 
"ference" 
<I>("Tragen")</I>
 beyond every carrying. Its aim cannot be 
determined in any nominal unity, in any scheme of syntagmatization, or in 
any conventional performance. Since, however, in order to "suceed," every 
discursive movement, every transmission, every transference must 
<B></B>
 not only go above and beyond its objects and means but, at 
the same time, must also avail itself of certain means, objects, and 
addressees, a structurally unavoidable resistance brings itself to bear in 
the tranference against the transference and in working through against 
working through. The resistance to transference lies in that the 
transference is directed toward a particular object, a particular person, 
a form, a type, an ideal. The resistance to working through lies in 
working through itself whenever it follows a particular scheme of work 
with predetermined, schematic, conventionalized ends or contents.

In his "Direction de la cure," Lacan noted without further commentary: "le 
travail de transfert (Durcharbeiten)." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">

"Working through"--he 
translates it as perlaborer--designates for him simply the work of 
transference. In "Fonction et champ de la parole et du langage," where he 
confirms "c'est bien l&agrave; un travail" and not without irony recalls 
that one tends even to grant this work a certain "valeur formatrice" that 
in the end may succeed in producing a skilled worker, Lacan presents 
something like a formula of orientation for what happens in this work of 
transference. The subject, he writes, 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
dans ce travail qu'il fait de la reconstruire [to reconstruct the 
imaginary work that is its being] pour un autre, il retrouve l'alienation 
fondamentale qui la lui a fait construire comme une autre, et qui l'a 
toujours destin&eacute;e &agrave; lui &ecirc;tre d&eacute;rob&eacute;e par 
un autre. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">

<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The work of the subject, its being and its ego, is constituted as an 
other. As an other it is rediscovered anew in its reconstruction for 
another--the analyst, and from the very beginning 
<I>("toujours"),</I>
 it, 
this subject, this other-than-itself, is destined 
<I>("destin&eacute;e")</I>
 to be taken away 
<I>by</I>
 an other. The play 
of the prepositions and genera of the other Lacan opens up in his formula 
of working through proceeds unproblematically as long as it is an issue of 
<I>"pour un autre"</I>
 and 
<I>"par un autre."</I>
 It becomes 
uncontrollable and completes the turn toward a play in which the player 
loses himself as soon as 
<I>"comme une autre"</I>
 is in question. For 
<I>as an other,</I>
 the work of the subject, the image by way of which 
this subject constructs its identity and out of which it makes a Being 
for, and by grace of, others--
<I>as</I>
 such an other the subject is both 
constructed and reconstructed. Yet, it would have to be reconstructed in 
such a way that the latter, 
<I>as an other,</I>
 in its turn offers itself 
<I>as an other</I>
 other--not, however, 
<I>as such</I>
 and not 
<I>as itself.</I>
 The space of working through and of the work of transference 
would have to be such that in it the 
<I>as an other</I>
 sets itself apart 
as an 
<I>other</I>
<I>other </I>
and detaches itself from the construction 
and its repetition in the reconstruction. It would have to be the space 
and the time-space of detachment and thus the opening up of a time and a 
space in the first place. It could not be the restituting and resaturating 
renewal of the construction of the subject 
<I>for others;</I>
 rather, it 
would have to be the ex-struction of this 
<I>for others</I>
 in an 
unconstructed and unconstructible time-space interval, in which it is for 
<I>other</I>
 others and perhaps for another 
<I>for,</I>
 other than 
<I>for</I>
 and other than 
<I>as.</I>
<B></B>
<p>
Thus it is said, in passing through Lacan's leading formula and presumably 
a bit beyond it, that the work of transference comes to pass as the 
release of 
<I>one</I>
 other from an 
<I>other</I>
 other, of one 
<I>as</I>
from an 
<I>other,</I>
 one 
<I>for</I>
 and one 
<I>from</I>
from an other 
<I>for</I>
 and 
<I>from.</I>
 It comes to pass, that is to 
say, as the work of a differential re-petition of the scheme of work and 
thus as the opening of a difference, of a time-space and a movement one 
could provisionally designate as 
<I>alteralteration:</I>
 the alteration of 
that relation to the other through which the subject constitutes itself 
and the alteration of that particular other that is built according to 
precisely the ratio of this relation. Within the margin of free play 
between a 
<I>for others</I>
 and an other 
<I>for others</I>
--and this 
margin of free play is not coextensive with the difference between Lacan's 
two 
<I>a</I>
s, the small and the large--occurswhat tranference, 
the work of transference and working through, designates. It takes place 
in this margin of free play, mind you, that opens up as an unoccupied 
field already 
<I>before</I>
 the constitution of subject and object, I and 
other, thus already 
<I>before</I>
 the labor of its fixation to a re, 
an ideal or a work. Thus, it offers itself as a space neither of work, 
idealization, or oeuvre. This interspace, then, should not to be 
misunderstood as the empty space of lost or absent objects, to which what 
Freud calls the "work of mourning" might apply. Nor should it be 
misunderstood as the space of displacement or substitution, by way of 
which what he calls "dream work" renders unconscious representations 
accessible to consciousness. Working through allows the mechanism and 
contents of dream work to become recognizable. It takes part in the work 
of mourning, but it cannot be reduced to it, providing that this work is 
not merely a question of the formation and reformation of subjects and 
objects but, rather, of precisely that domain in which it might have a 
chance, at all, of forming and transforming itself. Since, however, the 
imaginary, idealizing, forming, and fixating relation to the other is the 
work and 
<I>"oeuvre"</I>
 (as Lacan writes) of the subject and the subject 
as oeuvre, there could be no (as Lacan does 
<I>not</I>
 write) working 
through and no work of transference that would not in extremis launch 
itself as interruption 
<I>("Aussetzung")</I>
 and ex-position 
<I>("Ent-setzung")</I>
 of work and thus (I take up a word from Blanchot) 
as 
<I>"desoeuvrement."</I>
 For the sake of exactness--and, more still, of 
<I>exaction</I>
--working through would have to be thought--and, more than 
merely thought--experienced not as 
<I>"perlaboration"</I>
 (as Lacan 
translates it) but as 
<I>allaboration:</I>
 asthe opening up of 
possible work 
<I>(adlaborare)</I>
 in which the res of work and the 
work of ration areabandoned 
<I>("aussetzen")</I>
<I>(a-laborare).</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">
23</A>
</SUP>
And further, since it is first this 
traversal of work that gives way to a worklessness in work and also to the 
history-space and time-space of alteration--of 
<I>alteralteration</I>
--there is history first and only when the res 
of space, time, and history are worked open and off 
<I>("auf- und offengearbeitet"),</I>
 when they, as res of work, are also exposed to 
something other than work. There is no history without work, but there is 
no work without its--and perhaps endless--end (without an end that is not 
even 
<I>its</I>
 end). The "infinite analysis" of which Freud speaks in his 
later work, the infinite working through and transference, is the process 
in which this other history, this history no longer related to any re, 
any oeuvre, or any work, opens. That it can be nothing but infinite means 
also that its agents and 
<B></B>
 objects are finite. This 
concept of infinite analysis and of infinite transference needs to be won 
for politics. 
<p>
In his small study of 1914 "Remembering, Repeating, and Working Through," 
Freud hints, toward the end of his deliberations, how the change from one 
other to an 
<I>other</I>
 other, from the one addressee of speech to that 
other, might look, that change in theprocess of working through 
cannot do without. The hint is given far more 
<I>despite</I>
 than 
<I>by</I>
 Freud. It has the character of an anecdote and stands in his 
text without metapsychological commentary or theoretical formalization. In 
psychoanalytic work, Freud recalls, the process of "overcoming" 
<I>("&Uuml;berwindung")</I>
 resistances is initiated by naming them to the 
patient. But this "naming" does not itself immediately effect the removal 
of the resistances. The effect of the ineffectiveness of naming does not, 
however, show itself principally in the analysand but, rather, in the 
analyst, whose conception of the power of naming, interpreting, and 
analytic words is considerably compromised. Freud writes: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
I have often been asked to advise upon cases in which the doctor 
complained that he had pointed out his resistance to the patient and that 
nevertheless no change had set in; indeed, the resistance had become all 
the stronger, and the whole situation was more obscure than ever. The 
treatment seemed to make no headway. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">
24</A>
</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
In this situation, it is 
thus the analyst who lodges complaint, he and not the patient who suffers. 
It is the analyst who needs an analyst and who turns to this 
<I>other</I>
analyst for advice. This almost inconspicuous turn in which the doctor 
steps out of the psychoanalytic situation in order to safeguard itfrom without, redefines not just the "situation" itself--it becomes a 
parasituation--but also the concept of work that can be performed in it. 
In this decisive phase--the phase to which Freud entrusted "the work which 
effects the greatest changes" ("RRW," 155) and in which it is precisely a 
question of working through resistances--the "situation" ceases to be the 
dialogical dyad in which an active analyst confronts a passive patient or 
an active patient confronts an attentive and understanding analyst and 
these two work together as a duo, reflecting their presentations one in 
the other (Freud says that the doctor puts the resistance before the 
analysand [
<I>"seinen Widerstand</I>
 vorgestellt"]), and define their 
work, however implicitly, as that of the pair, the reflexivity and 
specularity of a narcissism &agrave; deux. According to the expectations 
of the analyst, psychoanalytic work consists in the synthesis of 
representations 
<I>("Vorstellungen")</I>
 and must in every regard 
accommodate the ideal of cooperation if the analytic "pact" is not to be 
broken--which means, if the ego ideal of the analyst is not to be wounded. 
With the complaint of the analyst directed at another, at the analyst of 
the analyst, the dialogical dyad, the definition of work as normalization 
and idealization and the interpretation of the analysis as the work of 
identificatory naming, is left behind and abandoned in favor of a 
principally open, a no longer simply naming, a 
<I>transidealizing </I>
and 
virtually interminable 
<B></B>
 polylogical process. The 
condition of every transformation is a "trans" of formation as well as of 
form. The other, whose memory and speech are in the hands of the analyst, 
is himself refered to another, to an 
<I>other</I>
 other, the analyst is 
referred to an ana-analyst. With the introduction of the hyperbole 
of the addresses and representations of the other, with this hyperbole of 
the re of the specularly defined other, with this 
<I>alteralteration,</I>
 work itself sets out for an 
<I>other</I>
 work and 
something other than work: it ex-poses itself--stands still, stalls, seems 
"to make no headway." It abandons 
<I>(aussetzen)</I>
 the scheme of work 
that stipulates the instantaneous effectivity of the dialogical--or, 
equally, self-reflexive--word, turns to an other than 
<I>its</I>
 other and 
becomes working through. 
<!--_extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
"This gloomy foreboding," Freud continues, in his report on the complaint 
of the analyst that the treatment did not seem to be making any headway, 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
this gloomy foreboding always proved mistaken. The treatment was as a rule 
progressing most satisfactorily. The analyst had merely forgotten that 
giving the resistance a name could not result in its immediate cessation. 
One must allow the patient time to become more conversant with this 
resistance with which he has now become acquainted, to 
<I>work through,</I>
 to overcome it, by continuing, in defiance of it, the 
analytic work according to the fundamental rule of analysis. Only when the 
resistance is at its height can the analyst, working in common with his 
patient, discover the repressed instinctual impulses which are feeding the 
resistance; and it is this kind of experience which convinces the patient 
of the existence and power of such impulses. The doctor has nothing else 
to do than to wait and let things take their course, a course which cannot 
be avoided nor always hastened. ["RRW," 135-36] 
<!--_extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
"Allow time," "wait," "let things take their course"--this allowing, 
giving time, and waiting, this unavoidability and inaccessibility to the 
action of the analyst, characterizes an entirely new comportment in 
contrast to the analytic dialogue. For it distinguishes itself not by way 
of question and answer, action and reaction--and thus not by way of 
discursive interaction or interdiscursivity--but, rather, by way of an 
extraordinary inactivity, an actlessness and speech-actlessness, in which 
the analyst is no longer the addressee and conversation partner of the 
analysand but, rather, of an other analyst, a third or fourth or, in the 
end, uncountable one. It is an inactivity in which the analysand, in his 
turn, does nothing else but address his resistance--resistance, that is to 
say, delay, time given, the giving of time 
<I>("Lassen der Zeit").</I>
 He 
addresses thus that incalculable and chronometrically unlocatable 
<I>other</I>
 of the other and in him the withdrawal of the address, the 
ineffectiveness of the word, and the suspension of work. Working through 
is to submerge oneself in resistance, in the ex-positon 
<I>(Aussetzen)</I>
of work, in the allowing of time, in another beyond of a representable, 
definable, and measurable other. It happens where this other has no form 
but, rather, lets forms--of time, of space, of language or action--simply 
take their course. And it takes place thus, not in the time-space of 
res but in the rhythm of 
<I>afration,</I>
 as 
<I>anamorphosis</I>
and 
<I>amorphosis.</I>
 Not as action or speech-act, not as 
<B></B>
 work or the work of speech, in the precinct of interdiscursivity 
and its ideals but, rather, as the allowing of actions, works, 
performances: as 
<I>afformation,</I>
 as the speaking of not-speaking and 
the action of inaction.

Freud writes: "to immerse" oneself in resistance, "to work through, to 
overcome it." As its preparation by "immersion" and its continuation by 
"overcoming" shows, the concept of working through is coupled by him not 
only with the idea of a "through" but also with the idea of a "going 
through above and beyond" thus of a detachment from what, in the first 
place, must be traversed, of a perforation of resistance, which opposes 
itself to work (as the earth opposes itself to the mole insofar as it digs 
through the earth in order to enter, or exit, its hollow). Since 
idealizing--or, simply, conventionalizing--work accompanies working 
through, it is always work that constitutes a resistance to working 
through. However, work is not the first and final resistance. For since it 
is the form of the production of world consistency according to the ideals 
of discourse, it remains, in principle, susceptible to reworking in each 
and all of its posts. The resistance, which it is unable to adapt to its 
model, derives from the only field in which this form of production can 
possibly occur: from what, without itself being work, allows--and to some 
extent, necessitates--this work. 
<p>
If Adorno privileges the concept of "working off" 
<I>("Aufarbeitung"),</I>
then, surely, in order to place the accent on two semantic values that 
stand out from the conception of "overcoming" implicit in the concept of 
"working through," what must be "worked off" has not even been an object 
of work; it must be worked on retrospectively, like a trauma that strikes 
a body, psychical or political, so quickly that it has no time to mobilize 
its reserves, its defensive or integrative mechanisms. Moreover, in the 
"off " 
<I>(auf )</I>
 of "working off " 
<I>("Aufarbeiten"),</I>
 one can 
also hear "open" 
<I>("offen")</I>
 and, accordingly, understand "working 
off" as an opening 
<I>("&Ouml;ffnen"),</I>
 slackening, as the 
destabilization of a closed, contracted, monolithic complex, as a laying 
free by way of which what was and what still comprehends and arrests the 
present in the past is unlocked. As catching up 
<I>("Nacharbeiten"),</I>
working off 
<I>("Aufarbeiten")</I>
 operates the integration of the past 
and its remnants into the precinct of objectifying consciousness. As 
working open 
<I>("Offen-arbeiten"),</I>
 it goes over and above its 
idealizing, formative, and repressive borders. 
<p>
By way of its "paramorphemes"--through and off 
<I>("Durch und Auf")</I>
--working is absolved from its fixation to its auto-teleological, 
auto-eschatological, process. It does not refer to itself, to the ideal or 
the standard of the self determined as work, and, therefore, it cannot be 
trimmed back to the morphological scheme of self-reflexion, as Habermas, 
Hegelianizing, recommends in his (otherwise likable) reiteration of 
Adorno, "Was bedeutet 'Aufarbeiung der Vergangenheit' 
heute?" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">
26</A>
</SUP>
Working through and working off refer to something 
other than the self and 
<I>its</I>
 other; they refer, as all work ought, 
to an other that cannot be reduced to the self and its work and thus to 
the "re of the worker." In the work-break between our historical and 
our possible forms, as their possibility and their transformation into 
other forms and something 
<B></B>
 other than form, in forms 
that are no longer 
<I>ours</I>
 and perhaps no longer 
<I>forms,</I>
 we--or 
"we"--work 
<I>off</I>
 the form of work. 
<p>
Of the intellectuals who supported National Socialism with their theories 
and in their administrative functions, Heidegger is perhaps the only one 
in whose later writings one can read something of the working off of work 
here in question. The author of the sentence "Work is the presence of 
historial man" did not just change his mind and exchange his former 
opinion with a more accommodating, liberal-democratic one. Rather, he 
traced the implication of this sentence--that, namely, work is the essence 
of existence 
<I>("Dasein")</I>
--back to its ontological and, more 
precisely, techno-ontological tradition. When in "Zur Seinsfrage" (On the 
question of being) he points out to his former prompter, Ernst 
J&uuml;nger, that the metaphysics of work (which J&uuml;nger presents in 
<I>The Worker</I>
 with the subtitle 
<I>Form and Dominion</I>
) is nothing 
more than the thoroughgoing perpetuation of the metaphysics of the will to 
power, that"work" becomes identical with "Being," and that "Form" 
belongs essentially in thedomain of what Heidegger calls the 
<I>"Ge-Stell,"</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">
27</A>
</SUP>
this is, on the one hand, nothing less 
than a massive critique of exactly that techno- and ergontology Heidegger 
advocated in 1934 in J&uuml;nger's and Hitler's entourage and, on the 
other hand, everything but an ingratiating gesture toward the doctrines of 
1955--for theirs was just this ideology of work. Heidegger undertakes the 
working off of the ontology of work--he prefers to speak of its 
<I>"Verwindung"</I>
--from the perspective of the history of Being, since 
for him it determines not the character of a particular historical 
political system but the character of the entirety of modern thought. The 
"Letter on Humanism" of 1946 leaves no doubt in its equivocal apology for 
Marxist materialism that also in it Heidegger sees a "destiny within the 
history of being" behind which the question concerning Being must reach: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
The essence of materialism does not consist in the assertion that 
everything is simply matter but rather in a metaphysical determination 
according to which every being appears as the material of labor. The 
modern metaphysical essence of labor is anticipated in Hegel's 
Phenomenology of Spirit as the self-establishing process of unconditioned 
production, which is the objectification of the actual, through man 
experienced as subjectivity. The essence of materialism is concealed in 
the essence of technology. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">
28</A>
</SUP>
<!--_extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Thus, the essence of work, one could paraphrase, conceals itself in the 
essence of self-production, the unconditioned auto-performance that 
presents itself as subjectivity. With this sentence, Heidegger withdraws 
from the position he had assumed in the assertion--in the 
self-assertion--"Work is the presence of historical man." For work is no 
longer thought as self-presencing and self-execution but, for its part, as 
involved in a movement (Heidegger calls it, verbally, "essencing" 
<I>["Wesen"]</I>
) that is not absorbed in work and cannot be absorbed by 
it. From the thought on the essence of technology Heidegger can go on to 
the determination of work as 
<I>ekstasis</I>
<I>("Entr&uuml;cktheit")</I>
or "exposedness into being" 
<I>("Ausgesetzheit in das Seiende"),</I>
 which 
already in the 1934 Logic Lectures differed markedly from the 
J&uuml;ngerian doctrine of 
<B></B>
 the planetary dominion of 
the re of the worker.

It is this "ex-posedness" 
<I>("Ausgesetzheit"),</I>
 under the more precise name of "release" 
<I>("Gelassenheit")</I>
 and without the direction toward a domain of 
possible objectifications that allows for a resituation--and, in fact, 
de-situation--of work. In one of Heidegger's "field-path-conversations" 
<I>("Feldweg-Gespr&auml;che")</I>
 that dates from the end of the war, 
entitled "Evening conversation in a Prison Camp in Russia" 
("Abendgespr&auml;ch in einem Kriegsgefangenenlager in Ru&szlig;land"), 
work, in the context of acritique of nationalism and 
internationalism, is denounced as the form of a disastrous collective 
subjectivity: this subjectivity transacts the "business of devastation, 
that is, of work, on account of the heightened potential of 
work."

In the paragraphs headed "The Evaluation of Work" in 
<I>Mein Kampf,</I>
Hitler already in the 1920s follows the scheme of argumentation and 
suggestion integral to his address of May 1933, when he founds the 
differentiation between the "material" and "ideal" value of work in 
connection with a discussion of the "spiritual pliancy," the "spiritual 
levels" (
<I>HRP,</I>
 481), and "spiritual leadership" (
<I>HRP,</I>
 482), 
and in view of an "ideal Reich" (
<I>HRP,</I>
 487). The value of work is 
esteemed ideal where it is measured, mystico-naturalistically, both as a 
"offering of nature"--and thus of "birth"--and as gift of the "community 
of the people," and where this value as sacrifice is restored to the 
community and its nature, to this nature- and natal community. With the 
sacrifice of "ideal" work to its indigenous idea, to the "spirit" of the 
"community of the people," work departs from the domain of rationality, of 
isolation, and of contingency and enters the "Reich" of its necessity, 
organicity, and intimate communality. It is thus "essentially" a return to 
its origin, a return to its provenance, to its natural community, to 
itself and to its concept and, herein, "ideal," "spiritual." 
<p>
I shall cite a long passage from this complex of suggestions in which 
Hitler's rhetoric of naturalist ideality becomes apparent: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
Pure material value stands in opposition to that of the ideal. It does not 
rest on the significance of executed work measured materially but, rather, 
on its necessity in itself. [This] work goes on the account of its birth 
as well as on the thereby engendered formation ["Ausbildung"], which it 
receives from the people at large. . . . The form of the contribution [to 
the upkeep of the cultural community and state] is determined by nature; 
it falls to him merely to give back to the community of the people with 
diligence and uprightness what it itself has given him. Whoever does this 
merits the highest esteem ["Wertsch&auml;tzung"] and the highest respect . . . ; the ideal [wage], however, must lie in the esteem 
["Wertsch&auml;tzung"] to which all can lay claim who consecrate the 
strength nature endows and to which the community of the people gives form 
to the service of his nationhood. [Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf (Munich, 
1942), 483-84; my emphasis; hereafter abbreviated MK] 
<!--_extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
From this nature-spiritual cycle, which work as "necessity in itself" runs 
through, issues its definition as sacrifice and the muddled formulation of 
"the will to sacrifice for the deployment of personal labor" (
<I>MK,</I>
235) "In him [the Aryan], the drive for self-preservation has achieved its 
most noble form in that he willfully subordinates his proper I to the life 
of the whole 
<I>["Gesamtheit"]</I>
 and, when the hour demands, sacrifices 
it." (
<I>MK,</I>
 326). "The most wonderful elucidation of this state of 
mind 
<I>["Gesinnung"]</I>
 is proffered by the word "work," which, for him, 
in no way designates the action of sustaining a livelihood but, rather, 
only a creating in harmony with the interests of the people" (
<I>MK,</I>
326). Precisely this "correct understanding of the concept of work" is, 
however, what "the Jew" is charged with lacking. In contrast to "the 
Aryan," for whom work is sacrifice to the natural idea of the community of 
the people, "the Jew" does not work. He gives nothing back and fails to 
receive himself in return--but, since he lacks every ethnic, and thus 
ethic, "ties" 
<I>["Bindung"],</I>
 his egotistical work is uncreative and 
robbery. Hitler's anti-Semitism establishes itself here as an 
anti-Semitism of work, of self-engenderment, of the nature-spiritual 
circulation of the sacrifice to one's proper people. "The" Jew does not

"Being out of work," Heidegger says, "is therefore a spiritual 
<I>["seelische"]</I>
 disruption, because the lack of work leaves the 
<I>ekstasis</I>
 into things empty. 
<I>Ekstasis</I>
 is not a state of 
fitting in 
<I>("Eingef&uuml;gtsein").</I>
 Rather, it is an unfulfilled 
rapport with things in an enduring state of exposedness to beings," he 
claims in a fragmentary transcript of his Logic Lectures from the summer 
semester of 1934 (Martin Heidegger, 
<I>L&oacute;gica: Lecciones de M. Heidegger [semsetre verano 1934] en el legado de Helene Weiss,</I>
 ed. and 
trans. V&iacute;ctor Far&iacute;as [Madrid: Anthropos, 1991], 102; 
hereafter abbreviated 
<I>L</I>
). In this determination of work (naturally, 
given that this is based on a transcription, it should be taken with a 
grain of salt), there are three points worth noting:  Heidegger speaks 
here of a "
<I>spiritual</I>
 disruption"--in his existential-ontological 
deliberations on the concept of work, he thus does not hesitate to employ 
an anthropological and, more nearly, psychological concept of deficiency; 
 he determines unemployment 
<I>("Arbeitslosigkeit")</I>
 negatively as 
an "unfulfilled rapport with things," and characterizes them thus as a 
mere deficit of work;  while work, for its part, is determined as 
fulfillment of the thing-relation 
<I>("Dingbezug")</I>
 and, despite its 
"
<I>ekstatic</I>
 structure," as "fitted in" in beings. This is as much as 
to say that work should constitute just such a form of expropriation 
<I>("Ent&auml;u&szlig;erung")</I>
 by virtue of which Dasein fits itself 
into thingly being, accommodates itself to it and, at the same time, fills 
out its open site, its gap. The world of things is thus just as 
complementary as it itself, as reference and happening, is complemented by 
it. For Heidegger, work is thus the constitutive way by which Dasein 
arrives at its own consistency and the consistency of world: it is 
<I>consistation.</I>
 Accordingly, the pain that in Heidegger's late 
thought marks the proper experience in the ontological difference (cf. 
Martin Heidegger, "Die Sprache," in 
<I>Unterwegs zur Sprache</I>
), can 
here be characterized as only the deficit of just this experience, as the 
deficit of work: it is "an oblivious exposedness into beings, . . . pain" 
(

In his Logic Lectures, Heidegger's determination of work stands in the 
context of the determinationof "determination": work 
<I>is</I>
 the 
privileged determination of determination, its determinateness. To the 
question, What does determination mean? Heidegger sets forth its 
"threefold meaning in originary unity." He places stress on the first as 
"determination to" and thus as "carried-forward for the mission" and 
thereupon continues: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
Our determination is our determinateness, that is, the regulation and 
training of our entire comportment toward that which is our commission. 
That is work. The work of historical man is not just any occupation. Work 
is the mission that, at any given time, has become a determination. It 
gathers our deeds in the given historical moment and brings it about. Work 
is the presence of historical man. Historical presence = work. Work is 
determination and mission, future and pastness. . . . Work and the 
present, they show themselves in performance ["Vollzug"], in the Now 
["Augenblick"]. [L, 78-80] 
<!--_extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Of this manifold of the determinations of work, I underline only two 
aspects. On the one hand, work is located on themedian between 
pastand future, tradition and project, commission and mission, and 
thus exactly on that systematic site that in 
<I>Being and Time</I>
 is 
occupied by the Now--that is always the moment of decision for the (at any 
given time) proper possibilities of Dasein. And, on the other hand, just 
as this Now is the historical present, so work is pure "performance" 
<I>("Vollzug")</I>
 (that is, decision and, thereby, the determination of 
determination): it is the median of time and the median of history as pure 
perfomance. When Heidegger in the same context designates time as "the 
great and only junction 
<I>["Fuge"]</I>
 of our being as something 
historical," and when this junction is prescribed 
<I>("verf&uuml;gt")</I>
by work, then time is junction and enactment of work as a performance in 
the fullness of which nothing lacks and which itself, unlike in the 
"Dictum of Anaximander" (
<I>Spruch des Anaximander</I>
 from 1946) knows no 
gap 
<I>("Un-fuge"):</I>
 no gap, no void, no worklessness 
<I>("Arbeits-losigkeit"),</I>
 and no interruption of performance. 
<p>
After a dreadful discussion about the alliance of "blood" and "mood" 
<I>("Gebl&uuml;t und Gem&uuml;t"),</I>
 Heidegger prudently continues, 
concerning 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
a fundamental human disposition[:] . . . to this belongs the 
determinateness of our Dasein through work. Work = presence. The present 
is not what happens now, but is the present insofar as it transposes our 
Being into the appropriate liberation of beings themselves. As a worker, 
man is taken outside itself ["entr&uuml;ckt"] in the openness of beings. 
This ekstasis ["Entr&uuml;ckung"] belongs to the essence of our Being, 
namely as being ex-posed into the openness of beings. [L, 102] 
<!--_extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
In this further determination of the determination that is work, its 
character as dislocation (
<I>"Versetzung";</I>
 elsewhere it is called 
"ex-posedness" 
<I>["Ausgesetztheit"]</I>
) and 
<I>ekstasis</I>
 warrant 
emphasis as precisely that feature in which work is 
<I>open</I>
 to 
something other than proper Dasein or to this Dasein as a possible other. 
But this movement of opening, which even in this lecture Heidegger does 
not relinquish to the ideology of Nazism, is massively curtailed as soon 
as the reference to this other, to this openness, is defined as "a 
liberation of beings in a manner appropriate to work" 
<I>("werkgerechte Befreiung").</I>
 The "liberation"thus already stands under the 
guardianship of the work. The opening is already one of the modalities 
according to which Dasein as work closes ranks with itself. Only in this 
way does work = presence. Only in this way does "the making-present of 
beings," as Heidegger writes, happen in it. Only in this way doescoming-to-being 
<I>("Anwesen")</I>
 = making and, thereby, once more, 
does coming-into-being = auto-performance
<B>. </B>
No strike interrupts the 
essence of this work; no pain of unemployment darkens the joy of 
self-effectuation. "Therefore," Heidegger writes, "the question of the 
<I>joy of work</I>
 is important. Joy as a fundamental mood is the ground 
of the possibility of genuine work." (
<I>L,</I>
 102) With this postulate, 
Heidegger's fundamental ergontology succeeds not only in linking up with 
Henri de Man's psychology of labor, 
<I>The Struggle for the Joy of Work</I>
 , but also with that Nazi slogan that promises "Strength 
through joy" 
<I>(Kraft durch Freude).</I>

The concept "onto-typo-logy" used by Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe (see his 
"Typographie," in 
<I>Mimesis des Articulation</I>
 [Paris: 
Aubier-Flammerion, 1975]) does not adequately account for the 
J&uuml;ngerian construction. Lacoue-Labarthe orients himself on 
Heidegger's answer to J&uuml;nger in "Zur Seinsfrage." Lacoue-Labarthe 
paraphrases its deliberation and follows it in tracing J&uuml;nger's 
"type" 
<I>("Typus")</I>
 back to the platonic 
<I>eidos</I>
 and "idea." This 
last move enables him to situate the origin of J&uuml;nger's "type" in the 
"typos" of the 
<I>eidos</I>
 and "idea" and to infer the ontotypological 
constitution of ontology in general. Whatever this constitution may be, 
the "Being" of the "re" 
<I>("Gestalt")</I>
 is thought by J&uuml;nger, 
in the wake of Goethe's morphology, as "re." The "type" is merely its 
embodiment or representation. Thus I use here the concept "morphontology" 
or 
<I>ontomorphologie,</I>
 in order to designate J&uuml;nger's most 
fundamental notion.

In 1945, Hitler consciously and systematically practiced, as is well 
known, this politics of self-extermination. J&uuml;nger, in 1932, drew up 
the formula of its system in the opening pages of 
<I>The Worker.</I>
 He 
writes there of the "motor," the symbol of our times: "It is the audacious 
plaything of a breed of men that can blast itself into the air and still 
glimpse in this act confirmation of order" (
<I>A,</I>
 37). J&uuml;nger 
calls this "posture" 
<I>("Haltung"),</I>
 which is a "blast" 
<I>("Sprengung"),</I>
 "heroic realism." But just as J&uuml;nger's 
objectivity is that of the 
<I>universalia in re,</I>
 so is his "heroic 
realism" without risk, since he can always trust that, in the event of a 
loss of reality, he would still gain its concrete universal: a "nothing" 
that serves to confirm "Being."

This word formation, as one says rather appropriately in English, 
"doesn't quite work." It doesn't "function" properly, just as most of the

something to happen for precisely that reason. In Latin, the word

<I>Allabere,</I>

"I slide, swing, fall, sink," just as the homophone
