<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
You should be reading this with something in your hands besides a
journal. And something, really, besides a pencil or pen. Something like
an empty glass, a rubber band, a paper clip that you can rub between
your fingers, that you can twist and bend back and forth. For the idea
is to wonder whether--while concerning ourselves with one or another
crisis of the subject--we haven't also been in the midst of an effort to
think about the object, if not indeed to liberate material objects. The
comic version of this effort would resemble a scene from the <I>Mork and
Mindy</I> show: when asked what could have happened to all the sponges
in the kitchen, the alien (Robin Williams) proudly announces, "I took
them to the river and set them free."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A somewhat more serious version can be found in the work of Jean
Baudrillard, who denounces the way that the object, because it is
considered "only the alienated, accursed part of the subject," has
been rendered unintelligible, "shamed, obscene, passive." Undoing the
privilege of the subject is not for him a matter of attending to the
subject's fraught, fragile, and divisive constitution. It is a matter
of imagining how the "destiny of the subject passes into the object,"
of naming the object "sovereign," of celebrating the crystal's revenge,
indeed "crystal revenge."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 And yet, of course, the luminous transparency of the crystalline object,
 its auratic singularity, can only impoverish other objects, material
 objects, or material understood as itself an object--not shimmering,
 exquisite crystal, let us say, but glass that is nothing but glass. Is
 it not the very splendor of the object that allows objects to disappear
 so readily
 
 


 in Baudrillard's subsequent work, evaporating into one or
 another version of the hyperreal?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No less than the tradition he writes against, Baudrillard seems to suffer
from what Theodor Adorno called the familiar "allergies to entity," a
chief symptom of which is the failure to recognize that there can be no
"primeval history of the object," only a history "dealing with specific
objects." The passage into materialism, as Adorno came to describe it,
requires acknowledging "things" outside the subject/object trajectory,
which means thinking sensation in its distinction from cognition. For
the "dignity of physicality" is indissoluble in, and not exhausted by,
the subject/object relation, epistemologically or phenomenologically
understood.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Still, if "things" are indeed not exhausted by that relation, it is
 only in the subject/object nexus where they occur, or where they can be
 <I>narrated</I> as the <I>effect</I> (not the ground) of an interaction
 at once physical and psychological, at once intimate and alienating. To
 the degree that the "thing" registers the undignified mutability of
 objects, and thus the excess of the object (a capacity to be other
 than it is), the "thing" names a mutual mediation (and a slide between
 objective and subjective predication) that appears as the vivacity of
 the object's difference from itself. What happens, should we drop the
 crystal, should it shatter, and should we glance at the bits of glass
 that, though they are nothing but glass, captivate our attention? What
 happens when we deauraticize <I>the</I> object (that is identifiable
 only within a fundamentally static structure) and begin again with the
 vertiginous banality of things--with some sense of the curious thingness
 of those objects we incessantly if unconsciously touch, the objects we
 see without ever looking? What if we looked?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact, "things" seem to have achieved a new discursive visibility. From
the disciplines of anthropology and history, as from the interdiscipline
of "material culture studies," important anthologies summon us to
attend to things: <I>The Social Life of Things</I> , <I>Material
Cultures: Why Some Things Matter</I> , <I>History from Things</I>
, <I>The Sex of Things</I> . These volumes assume the task of
denaturalizing consumer practices, of tracing (both within and between
cultures) the <I>work</I> of exchange and consumption: the way economic
value is created in specific social formations, the way cultural values
become objectified in specific material forms, the way that people shape,
code, and recode the material object world, the way they make things
meaningful and valuable. Just as such analysis exposes the politics that
underwrite our most daily acts of exchange, as Arjun Appadurai would have
it, so too, in Victoria de Grazia's words, this type of analysis "responds
to the imperative to know about material needs, wants, and desires."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But is it <I>things</I> that these volumes constitute as the object of
their address? For the degree to which the essays trace generalizable
circuits of exchange and consumption is the degree to which they can
address <I>no thing at all,</I> but only objects, if you will allow me
to pursue my axiomatic distinction. The sort of objectification that
takes place during those operations that produce use value, sign value,
cultural capital will never produce a thing. Producing a thing--effecting
thingness--depends, instead, on a fetishistic overvaluation or
misappropriation, on an irregular if not

<B></B>


 unreasonable reobjectification
of the object that dislodges it from the circuits through which it is
what it typically is. Thingness is precipitated as a kind of misuse
value. By <I>misuse value</I> I mean to name the aspects of an
object--sensuous, aesthetic, semiotic--that become legible, audible,
palpable when the object is experienced in whatever time it takes (in
whatever time it is) for an object to become another.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This distinction brings a kind of instability into focus wherein the
thing becomes manifest between multiple objectifications. Within the
shimmering splinters of glass, glass can become something else. Or,
to offer another narrative example (of what can be exemplified only
syntactically, only in time): in the process of using a knife as a
screwdriver, of dislocating it from one routinized objectification and
deploying it otherwise, we have the chance (if just a chance) to sense
its presence (its thinness . . . its sharpness and flatness . . . the
peculiarity of its scalloped handle, slightly loose . . . its knifeness
and what exceeds that knifeness) as though for the first time. For the
first time, perhaps, we thus also sense the norms by which we customarily
deploy both knife and screwdriver. My concern, then, is not to unveil
the meaning of things in their proper thingness, nor to describe the
fate of pure objects abstracted from their use, and neither is it to
privilege the thing (<I>das Ding</I>) over things (<I>die Sachen</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 For the life of things made manifest in the time of misuse is, should we
 look, a secret in plain sight--not a life behind or beneath the object
 but a life that is its fluctuating shape and substance and surface, a
 life that the subject must catalyze but cannot contain.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My title, "the secret life of things," no doubt brings to mind a line
from William Wordsworth or Percy Shelley, or one of E. T. A. Hoffmann's
uncanny tales, or one of several surrealist images--if not Tristan Tzara's
"the knives are on their feet," then perhaps Louis Aragon's "bunch of keys
[humming] to themselves jingling a song of the good old days."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Though such animation is not my concern in the following pages, I will
 in fact be preoccupied by the 1920s, the decade when things emerge
 as the object of profound theoretical engagement in the work of Georg
 Luk&aacute;cs, Heidegger, and Walter Benjamin, and which is the decade
 after objects and things are newly engaged by (or <I>as</I>) the work
 of art for Pound, Marcel Duchamp, Williams, Gertrude Stein.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The record of Virginia Woolf's engagement with the relation between
objects and things appears in a very short story she titled "Solid
Objects." It is in fact a story not about solidity, but about the fluidity
of objects, about how they decompose and recompose themselves as the
object of a new fascination. It is about the materials that make up the
material object world, about the transvaluation of those materials into
less and more than their familiar properties. It is about dislocating
material--nothing but glass--from an instrumentalist teleology and into
an aesthetic scene, though not one authorized by the dictates of Pierre
Bourdieu's Distinction or Baudrillard's System of Objects, but content
instead with intensely private, inconspicuous display.
<B></B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf began to write the story in November 1918, at the close of World War
I, and she published it in <I>Athenaeum</I> in 1920. The story concerns
a man named John
who, discovering a smooth lump of glass on the beach, brings it home and
places it on the mantle, using it as a paperweight. The discovery incites
him to seek out other objects that remind "him of the lump of glass,"
anything "so long it [is] an object of some kind, more or less round
. . . anything--china, glass, amber, rock, marble," the paradigmatic shape
and size in fact bringing the specificity of the material into question.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 At first studying the objects displayed in the windows of curiosity
 shops, he becomes increasingly obsessed and finally roams London with "a
 bag and a long stick," ransacking "all deposits of earth," searching "all
 alleys and spaces between walls," in his search for discarded objects
 that might become for him "specimens" (<I>HH,</I> 85). As he discovers
 other remnants--pieces of broken china, a bit of iron--his collecting
 impulse becomes, from his friends' perspective, pathological. Before
 long he abandons the life he has led as a politician on "the brink of a
 brilliant career," a man standing for Parliament (<I>HH,</I> 82). Indeed,
 in most respects he abandons his life, "devot[ing] himself more and
 more resolutely to the search," suffering "fatigue and derision," but
 still "consumed by [the] ambition" to add to his little collection
 (<I>HH,</I> 85).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The story has hardly fascinated Woolf's readers, who have been far more
captivated by the life of the subject, the fate of individuality, and
the vicissitudes of consciousness in her fiction. A small, critical
consensus, however, reads "Solid Objects" as a cautionary tale warning
against aesthetic absorption at the expense of the practical, the ethical,
the political.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Woolf, let us say, managed not to succumb to what Clive Bell disparaged
 as his contemporaries' "metaphysical-moral doctrines concerning the
 cowiness of cows and the thing in itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 But her own boredom with politics-as-usual, what she called her "natural
 disposition to think Parliament ridiculous," would suggest that the
 moral of the story might not be read so unequivocally.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 She herself stopped accompanying her husband Leonard on his political
 campaigns in 1919. At the end of the war, she wrote of the war that
 "the whole thing [was] too remote and meaningless to come home to one
 either in action or in ceasing to act" (<I>D,</I> 215). She also was
 eager to eschew conversation about the "bitter, impatient, powerful"
 lower classes (<I>D,</I> 220). Such comments suggest that one might say
 of the story what Bell said of art more generally, that "no one could
 be much worse placed than the political moralist for seeing whatever
 there may be to be seen in what is, at once, strange and subtle."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What is strange and subtle in Woolf's story, however, is the way it
bears witness, however unconsciously, to the political economy of Great
Britain during and immediately after World War I. In other words, I want
to point out how John's encounter with these material fragments--a piece
of glass, of broken china, and of iron--is not just embedded within
a trajectory of English aesthetics (John Ruskin to Roger Fry) or a
genealogy of modernism (say T. E. Hulme's "poetics of sensual immediacy
and fragmentary vision"), but also embedded between the domestic crisis
of wartime 
<B></B>
scarcity in London and the postwar industrial crisis provoked
by the British commitment to free trade.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Though the fragments may thus be thought of as souvenirs of
the unreal city, their very collection erases that context from the
narrative as such.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 But elsewhere, Woolf makes it clear how the war impinged on the material
 practice of art. She writes to Vanessa Bell about the problem of securing
 her paint, "the difficulty about paints is that they're made with oil,
 'Now you may not know [a merchant has explained to Woolf] that every
 gun when it's first cast has to be dipped in a bath of oil.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 She records in her diary the physical threat to art posed by the raids
 on London, "The Academy is storing its precious pictures, only 18 in
 number, in some Tube. They are told to expect immense bombs at the
 end of the month, which will dig 20 feet deep, &amp; then explode"
 (<I>D,</I> 138). Yet "Solid Objects," without ever invoking the war,
 provides instead an account of the aesthetic--or an account of what
 we might call the relation between aesthetics and politics, between
 art and the economy--that is a history of the senses fundamentally
 altered by the facts of wartime scarcity and postwar depression. One
 might argue that the story's displacement of the psychological with
 the <I>materiological</I> is Woolf's uncharacteristic exploration
 of the antihumanist modernism advanced by Hulme. But her capacity to
 narrate a new subject/object dynamic seems catalyzed instead by the
 transgression of economic habits, both domestic and international--in
 a word, by the western world's misuse of material for martial ends, by
 the transposition of material into <I>mat&eacute;riel.</I>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As literary criticism wrestles itself out of the homogenizing habits of
new historicism and the heterogenizing habits of cultural studies, one
version of a new materialism asks how material culture impresses itself
on the literary imagination. Another asks how literature itself works to
imagine materiality; how it renders a life of things that is tangential to
our narratives of modern production, distribution, and consumption; how
it can contribute to a materialist phenomenology that does not bracket
history, but asks both <I>how,</I> in history (how, in one cultural
formation), human subjects and material objects constitute one another,
and <I>what</I> remains outside the regularities of that constitution
that can disrupt the cultural memory of modernity and modernism. If
Simmel was right to argue, circa 1900, that the increased access to
things that characterizes modernity results in the loss of the thingness
of things, then we should recognize how various aesthetic practices work
to compensate for that loss. Indeed, it would be perfectly reasonable to
account for the recent academic attention to objects (not to say things)
as a reaction against the declaration of--if not some compensatory
response to the fact of--the further disappearance of the object within
an increasingly mediated (indeed digitally mediated) universe.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's story might thus be read as moralizing against such materialist
fascinations, if it does not rather, as I'll suggest, investigate a
different kind of fascination, indeed a kind of fetishism that seems like
an alternative mode of inhabiting modern culture. By consecrating the
valueless material object, such fetishism confounds political economy's
account of value, alienates itself from any enlightenment horror of waste,
and settles happily into an unhuman (not antihumanist) history. "Solid
<B></B>
Objects" manages to revise the question of the object and the question
of things while clarifying the risk of that revision, which is always
a risk to what Woolf's story
narrates as the aesthetic subject. "One day," the narrator explains,
"starting from his rooms in the Temple to catch a train in order to
address his constituents, his eyes rested upon a remarkable object
lying half-hidden in one of those borders of grass which edge the bases
of vast legal buildings. . . . [He] drew the piece of [broken] china
within reach of his hands. As he seized hold of it he exclaimed in
triumph," missing his train (<I>HH,</I> 82-3). Such exhilaration,
staged in relation to the emblems of modernity (the train, the legal
buildings, parliamentary democracy, the commuter temporality) is
irreducible to consumer desire or the structure of cathexis described
by psychoanalysis; it instead testifies to the enigmatic excess that
characterizes the physical world, especially its bits and pieces, the
discarded remains of modern objects. Insofar as the aestheticization
of this refuse leaves John in a condition of social sclerosis, however,
"aesthetic autonomy" manifests itself here not as the object's distance
from consumer culture but as the utter isolation of the individual (the
aesthetic subject). Some other reading of the story might indeed argue
that John's obsession with inorganic objects is in fact inseparable from
what Freud described, in his own postwar text, as the drive toward the
inorganic that is the drive toward death.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
* * *

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Let me turn now to a clarifying disjuncture in William James's
psychology--clarifying because it temporalizes, <I>narrating</I>
the interaction between the somatic and the cognitive--to offer some
handle on the object/thing distinction. Working within and against
the associationist tradition, James points out, in his chapter on the
perception of space, how the coalescence of our sensations in and as a
thing depends on habit. This means that we grant to objects that we merely
see their full physicality because we are accustomed to doing so. Real
form, what Edmund Husserl would come to call the inauthentic image as
opposed to the authentic image we actually see, is <I>habitually</I>
conjured up. In his somewhat prescient understanding of mind as matter
(with which he works to refine the Humean position), James argues that
habitual objects "plough deep grooves in the nervous system," so that
there is a path of least resistance through which, for instance, our
sensations of grayness and thinness and length become the apperception
of a knife.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his chapter on the "perception of things," however, he tells the story
of what happens when our habits are broken, when for instance we look at
a landscape with our head upside down or when we turn a painting bottom
upward: "the colors grow richer and more varied, we don't understand the
meaning of the painting, but, to compensate for the loss, we feel more
freshly the value of the mere tints and shadings" (<I>P,</I> 727). James
understands perception and "naked sensation" as different cerebral
conditions that cannot take place at the same time, since sensations in
themselves do not add up (<I>P,</I> 727). One might say, rather, that we
need to understand two 
<B></B>
distinct, dynamic, intertwined materializations:
one where we seem to begin with sensations, which precipitate perception;
and one where the proximate sensuous
engagement lies between one and another perceptual horizon. The viewer's
perceptual "failure" (as in the case of nonrative painting)
prompts a different kind of attention; but, in the routine of daily
life, perception perpetually forecloses sensuous experience in order
to render the material world phenomenal, which means rendering it
inhabitable. What I want to underscore is how in James the difference
between the apperceptive constitution of the thing, in what I would call
its <I>objecthood,</I> and the experience of the thing, in what I would
call its <I>thinghood,</I> emerges in the moment (and no doubt only as
a moment) of reobjectification that is a kind of misuse--turning the
picture bottom up, standing on one's head. The point may be less that
"sensation is one thing and perception another," and more that the
experience of sensation depends on disorientation, both habit and its
disruption (<I>P,</I> 727).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the case of Woolf's story, the point is not that the familiar object
has been defamiliarized into unreconstituted fragments (which is to
say discrete, fragmented sensations), but rather that literal fragments
become objects without any of the coherence or familiarity we associate
with objects. Peripatetic though he is, John resembles less modernity's
fl&acirc;neur than the bricoleur, "speak[ing] not only <I>with</I> things
. . . but also through the medium of things," reordering debris the way
a kaleidoscope, to borrow L&eacute;vi-Strauss's re, transforms bits
of glass into a "new type of entity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
But if John perceives new structural patterns, along the way he manages
to experience texture and shape in such a way that materials themselves,
unchannelled through the habitual object, become the objects of his
fantasy. Familiar materials--glass, china, iron--are debanalized,
appearing all but magical: "it was impossible to say whether it had been
bottle, tumbler, or window-pane; it was nothing but glass; it was almost
a precious stone" (<I>HH,</I> 80). Not objects, but materials--"nothing
but glass"--have been released from any readiness-to-hand. Free from their
incorporation into the familiar object world, they seem to assume lives of
their own as John grants them a kind of agency. The piece of broken china
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
looked like a creature from another world--freakish and fantastic as
a harlequin. It seemed to be pirouetting through space, winking like
a fitful star. The contrast between the china so vivid and alert, and
the glass so mute and contemplative, fascinated him, and wondering and
amazed he asked himself how the two came to exist in the same world,
let alone to stand upon the same narrow strip of marble in the same
room. The question remained unanswered. [<I>HH,</I> 83]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By not answering the question, both John and the narratorial voice grant
the materials their sovereignty, but they do so not, as Baudrillard
would have it, from a state of abjection, but in a state of wonder.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's story might thus be located within a continuum of modernist
attention to materials, from, say, Otto Wagner's 1895 vision of a
future architecture dominated by "the prominent use of materials in
a pure state," to F. T. Marinetti's futurist cult of metals and Ernst
J&uuml;nger's "poems of steel," to Donald Judd's 1965 description of the
<B></B>
"aggressive" specificity of materials and the "objectivity" that inheres
in the "obdurate identity of a material."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 In closer proximity to Woolf, her friend Roger Fry, in
the manner of Ruskin, repeatedly argued on behalf of the aesthetic
importance of compositional substance, singling out the fate of china. He
objected to Wedgwood (by now the preferred cornerstone in accounts
of eighteenth-century consumer society) because it set "a standard of
mechanical perfection which to this day prevents the trade from accepting
any work in which the natural beauties of the material are not carefully
obliterated by mechanical means."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Whereas Fry's answer to the problem was replacing mechanical production
 with craftsmanship, "Solid Objects" answers the problem of mechanical
 perfection by introducing the imperfection wrought by accident--by
 engaging the shard. At times, Woolf clearly shares Fry's fundamental
 aesthetic judgment. In <I>Orlando,</I> the men of genius Orlando
 accompanies in the eighteenth century (Joseph Addison, Alexander Pope,
 Jonathan Swift) collect "little bits of coloured glass," demonstrating
 a kind of restrained appreciation for material that stands in contrast
 to the monumental accumulation of Victorian clutter--"crystal palaces,
 bassinettes, military helmets, memorial wreaths . . . telescopes, extinct
 monsters, globes, maps, elephants, and mathematical instruments"--a
 rubbish heap of Victorian history, a pile of "heterogeneous, ill-sorted
 objects" perceived by Orlando as a "garish erection."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 "Solid Objects," however, suggests that the residues of such clutter,
 the object decomposed into little bits, as it were, can still compel
 us in their rudimentary substantiality, conveying both the natural and
 unnatural beauties of material.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Writing in <I>Athenaeum</I> the year before Woolf's story appeared there,
Fry laments the fate of materials within the Victorian object. Describing
the inappropriate use of material to fashion all the Victorian
<I>objets</I> that "gratify fatuous curiosity," and appeal to "social
emotions" rather than "aesthetic feelings," he concludes that "the use
of material at this period seems to be the least discriminating, and the
sense of quality feebler, than at any previous period of world history."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The familiar Bloomsbury dismissal of Victoriana here achieves a
 materialist specificity inherited from the likes of William Morris,
 but Fry stops short of wondering what might in fact be learned about
 "social emotions" from the ill-suited use of materials. His role as
 artist and art critic no doubt prevented his taking an interest in the
 kind of disjuncture between material and form that captivated Benjamin
 as a legible sign of utopian longing. With a logic learned from <I>The
 Eighteenth Brumaire,</I> Benjamin imagines that the decorative use
 of iron, rather than its structural deployment, marks the way novelty
 first emerges in and depends on residual form, which is the way social
 dissatisfaction with the present expresses itself in a citational
 longing for the future, a longing that cites a past that is anterior
 to the recent past: "These tendencies direct the visual imagination,
 which has been activated by the new, back to the primeval past."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Whereas Ruskin believed the "constant use of cast-iron ornaments"
 marked the "degradation of our national feeling," Benjamin read it
 retrospectively as marking an otherwise unexpressed desire to abandon
 a degraded present.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
<B></B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If for Benjamin the point of considering such disjuncture is to imagine
how a collective unconscious "thinks" forward by thinking back to a
classless society, for Woolf
the point is more the way attention to the substance of iron, for
instance, can provide access to a "primeval history" that is no longer
anthropocentric. The story begins to answer the question of how we could
bring materials into history as something other than the history of their
use, in industry or art. When John, perpetually scouring the crannies of
London in his quest to add to his collection, finds a piece of iron under
a furze bush in Barnes Common, his sense of time becomes cosmological:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It was almost identical with the glass in shape, massy and globular, but
so cold and heavy, so black and metallic, that it was evidently alien to
the earth and had its origin in one of the dead stars or was itself the
cinder of the moon. It weighed his pocket down; it weighed the mantelpiece
down; it radiated cold. And yet the meteorite stood upon the same ledge
with the lump of glass and the star-shaped china. [<I>HH,</I> 84-5]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The passage is mobilized by a dialectic of proximity and distance,
familiarity and alterity, that is at once spatial and temporal. The
utterly ordinary, which is also otherworldly, can be pocketed and
domestically displayed without ever being domesticated. Woolf records
not only what it would feel like to desire material per se as a personal
possession, but also how such a possession might change the scale of
one's historical imagination, how the cosmological might insinuate
itself into the daily. To name the scrap of modern iron a "meteorite"
is to dislodge it from the homogeneous structure of time, and to say
not that the distant past lingers within the present, but to insist
that this past is present as a kind of surface with which we can make
intimate contact, as though touching one history in and as another.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 If the story's temporality seems somewhat abstract or confused--"Day
 after day passed. He was no longer young" (<I>HH,</I> 85)--this is
 because John's archeology of the modern, his engagement with material as
 an end (not a means), has dislodged him from the temporal dictates of
 modern life. The <I>vie priv&eacute;e</I> of things becomes something
 other than the history of the object's production and exchange, and
 something other than its representation in, or transformation into,
 the work of art.

With James's help, we can redescribe the modernity that Simmel
renders--where the ability to dominate things is coupled with the
inability to establish contact with things--as the intensification
of a basic perceptual process, or as a perceptual process that
has become a social logic. In the 1920s this sociopsychological,
sociosensual problematic achieved its full theorization. On the one
hand, Luk&aacute;cs asserts that reification "conceals above all the
immediate--qualitative and material--character of things as things." On
the other, Heidegger, without ever specifying Luk&aacute;cs, complains
that such arguments always fail to describe for us what "we are to
understand <I>positively</I> when we think of unreified <I>Being.</I>"
And Benjamin, in a much-quoted passage
<B></B>
 from <I>One Way Street</I>
(providing a non-Heideggerian response to such a complaint) describes
how children's engagement with the material world reveals the
capacity to transform things, bits of cultural detritus, into new
things--a kind of recycling that never replicates the world as it is,
but rather reminds us, in the mode of spontaneous collage, that things
might be other than they are.

"Any object," Woolf writes, "mixes itself so profoundly with the
stuff of thought that it loses its actual form and recomposes itself a
little differently in an ideal shape which haunts the brain" (<I>HH,</I>
82). This activity of recomposition, which moves John's encounter from the
sensuous and material to the phenomenal and the psychological, returns
to the material by granting him a different mode of engagement with the
city. That is, just as John mediates the transformation of the lump of
glass into a "precious gem," so too the glass transforms his relation to
urban space. It provokes him to walk through London with "his eyes upon
the ground," especially attracted to the alleys where "such objects often
occurred"--"thrown away, of no use to anybody, shapeless, discarded"
(<I>HH,</I> 82). To say that objects <I>occur</I> is to suggest that
objects have a temporality; they don't happen to be there so much as
they happen. And the way that they happen distorts John's pedestrian
quest to match the shape of the smooth lump of glass; instead, he seems
propelled only by a new responsiveness to form as such. The broken
piece of china "as nearly resembl[es] a starfish as anything--shaped,
or broken accidentally, into five irregular but unmistakable points"
(<I>HH,</I> 83). His new optical, tactile consciousness does not permit
him to leave a curious object behind; he misses a meeting in order
to secure the shard. John may exhibit the typical passions of the new
collector, but one can't quite say just what it is that he collects. And
he makes no effort to express himself in his exhibition; rather, the
lives of these things--the glass contemplative, the china vivid, fitful,
surreal--overwhelm his life.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his essay on surrealism, Benjamin confidently proclaims that the poet
too perceives the immense force, the revolutionary energy, that resides
within discarded artifacts, those "enslaved and enslaving objects." But
in the more telegraphic "Traumkitsch," where he imagines a history of
dreams, the unconscious seems severely limited; the dreams of today, he
writes, are a "short cut to the banal," in our dreams "there is a gray
layer of dust on things," and in dreams we touch objects "precisely where
they are most worn," where they are "eroded by habit." The dreamwork
fails to recapacitate us as children, who never (according to habit)
"take hold of a glass but [instead] reach right in."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 It is a kind of misapprehension, an untoward reobjectification, a kind
 of misuse that clears the dust away.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was with the "impulse of a child," Woolf writes, that John slipped
the lump of glass inside his pocket "promising it a life of warmth
and security" (<I>HH,</I> 81). When on the beach, and having left off
a political argument with his friend Charles ("Politics be damned!"),
John distracts himself by "burrow[ing] his fingers down, down into the
sand," his eyes becoming "clear transparent surface[s] . . . expressing
nothing but wonder, which the eyes of young children display" (<I>HH,</I>
80). Such rhetorical recourse to the child, rative or literal, also
helps Roger Fry in his essay on "The Artist's Vision" to taxonomize the
"economy" of the senses, as he called it, 
<B></B>
and above all to differentiate
between looking and mere seeing. Though it is children who genuinely
"look at things with some passion," the adult retains "something of
this unbiological, disinterested vision," the testimony to which he
finds in those collections of objects (like John's) that are otherwise
unremarkable but "which have some marked peculiarity of appearance that
catches his eye."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 This essay, also published in <I>Athenaeum</I> in 1919, provides the
 simplest theorization of what Woolf is up to in her story. It is as
 though Fry has translated James's psychological point (which originally
 stumbled onto the aesthetic, onto questions of landscape and painting)
 and transformed it into a point about the aesthetic and nonaesthetic
 subject. "We were given our eyes to see things, not to look at them,"
 a fact that he takes to be a biological necessity since the "very
 considerable ignorance of visual appearances" becomes a practical matter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 When Woolf writes about "The Cinema," which, according to the
 surrealists, disclosed in the photogenic object the fact that things
 have lives of their own, she describes its ability to provide audiences
 with a new field of sensation. She reiterates Fry's point, but she also
 nationalizes it, describing "the English unaesthetic eye" as "a simple
 mechanism which takes care that the body does not fall down coal-holes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the unhabituated child perpetually appears in contrast as the
engaged aesthetic subject (although Benjamin calls attention not to a
disinterested appreciation of the material world, but to an interested,
spontaneous reconration of that world), this is not a reinstallation
of the Wordsworthian subject, for whom nature and not the detritus of
culture exists as the fully engaging aesthetic object. Still, Woolf's
story, because the child appears only as a vehicle for describing John's
reactions, poses a complex of inescapable questions. Is John's response
childlike in the profundity of its willingness to see and to feel the
material world anew or is his behavior a lamentable, childish retreat? Is
this an inspired act of transgression or simply a regression? Is this
a regrettable withdrawal from politics or the recognition that politics
need to begin elsewhere, with some experience of the profound otherness
of the everyday?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The story's ambiguity has everything to do with the proximity or
specularity of, on the one hand, the life of things, and, on the other,
commodity culture as usual. For John is in what would be recognizable as
the throes of consumer desire--"the determination to possess objects that
even surpassed these tormented the young man"--were it to have appeared in
Emile Zola's <I>Au bonheur des dames</I> or Theodore Dreiser's <I>Sister
Carrie</I> (<I>HH,</I> 85). His desire anticipates a later moment in
the history of bourgeois consumerism where consumption and collection
seem increasingly conflated. Any newly purchased object, not just the
Hummel rine but also the bottle cap and the Beanie Baby, can be
declared by the manufacturer to be <I>collectible.</I> If, writing of
the early nineteenth-century interior, Benjamin could imagine that the
collector's responsibility was "the Sisyphean task of obliterating the
commodity-like characters of things," and of freeing things from "the
drudgery of being useful," in the late twentieth century the preservation
from this drudgery has been the means of increasing consumer desire.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So too, of course, the secret life of things--whether it is the
fitfulness of a piece of broken china, or knives standing on their
feet, or sponges swimming free at last on the river--might be declared
a literalization of our alienation as Simmel described it, where, "by
their independent, impersonal mobility," objects "complete the final
stage of their separation from people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 And yet, it is precisely by giving into--thinking or working
 through--reification and alienation, and by identifying a profounder
 separation (not of objects but of things), that Adorno came to
 re-identify ethical possibility: "If a man looks upon thingness
 as a radical evil . . . he tends to be hostile to otherness, to
 the alien thing that has lent its name to alienation, and not in
 vain" (<I>ND,</I> 191). For Simmel, the problem of modernity can be
 characterized by the fact that "objects and people have become separated
 from one another," that objects can no longer be "assimilated by the
 individual" (<I>PM,</I> 460). For Adorno, the problem has become the
 very will-to-assimilation. He designates the happiness of philosophy,
 over and against the "imperialism of annexing the alien," as residing "in
 the fact that the alien, in the proximity it is granted, remains what is
 distant and different" (<I>ND,</I> 191). Were we to grant "Solid Objects"
 a place between Simmel's sociology and Adorno's philosophy, we would read
 it as a narrative of things accumulated but not arranged, intimate but
 unassimilated, "extimate" in their simultaneous proximity and distance,
 accreted as vivacious fragments that belong to no whole. The ethics
 of the story thus reside in Woolf's depiction of an experience--of
 experience--that activates for the fragment a life of its own.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
* * *

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though "Solid Objects" narratively and, thus, ambivalently engages topics
conceptualized elsewhere, Woolf's diary during these years hardly records
any consistent concern for material objects. We read other diarists,
after all, to hear about things. She writes about reading and thinking
and talking and writing. Just as, in <I>Orlando,</I> the young nobleman's
"disease of reading" can temporarily turn all his riches--"carpets,
sofas, trappings, china, plate, cruets, chafing dishes and other movables
often of beaten gold"--into mist, so too in Woolf's own daily record, her
reading and writing tend to obscure any encounter with the physical world
(<I>O,</I> 75, 74). If she writes about objects, she tends to write about
them as signs, in the effort to determine how possessions characterize
those who possess them: "art lamps and iridescent plates," for instance,
seem to demonstrate the gentility of one "farmer husband" (<I>D,</I> 248).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In her stories, however, material objects seem a condition of
narratability. "Moments of Being" records the thoughts of a woman
in search of a lost pin, the finding of which puts a stop to the
story. "The New Dress" records the way social anxiety is most keenly
mediated by material possessions. The point of "The Lady in the Looking
Glass" is that possessions that apparently reveal a life in fact keep
it concealed from view. An extraordinary dangling modifier in the story
suddenly shifts the burden from the unnamed narrator to the possessions
themselves, as though they 
<B></B>
spent their time contemplating the woman who
possesses them: "Under the stress of thinking about Isabella, her room
became more shadowy and symbolic; the corners seemed darker, the legs
of chairs and tables more spindly and hieroglyphic."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 It is as though the object world, by concerning itself with human
 subjects, becomes both more and less legible, clearly significant but
 indecipherable.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though the novels never think through artifacts so exclusively, they
continue to foreground the way objects mediate human relations, including
the self's relation to itself. Orlando's past returns to her in the
twentieth century through her former possessions, housed in a museum. In
<I>Night and Day,</I> when Mrs. Hilbery exclaims "Dear things! Dear
chairs and tables! How like old friends they are," the dearness resides
in the family history that the objects express, in the objects' august
legibility, a result of the fact that "We live in things," as Mrs. Swithin
explains to the man who "fingers sensations," in <I>Between the Acts.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Those novels construct a universe where, as Benjamin would have it,
 interiors are legible in traces left by their occupants, and where
 collected objects contain for the collector elaborate narratives of
 their collection. In Woolf's version of the argument, within our houses,
 within our rooms, we are "surrounded by objects which perpetually express
 the oddity of our own temperaments and enforce the memories of our own
 experience." Thus a whole morning spent in Italy, the iron table and the
 breeze and the vines and the pillars, "rise up in a cloud from the china
 bowl on the mantelpiece," a bowl purchased during an Italian holiday.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the fragments collected in "Solid Objects"--which, the more one
reads Woolf, seems itself to be an unrepresentative fragment--have only a
fantasized and fantastic provenance: perhaps the lump of glass is a gem
"worn by a dark Princess," or perhaps it is from an Elizabethan treasure
chest (<I>HH,</I> 80-1). The fragments express the oddity of someone
else's temperament: John imagines that the shape of the china shard
depends on the "conjunction [of] a very high house, and a woman of such
reckless impulse and passionate prejudice that she flings her jar or pot
straight from the window without thought of who is below" (<I>HH,</I>
84). As compellingly as this scene may describe a woman's frustration
with the objects that materialize her domestic confinement, the scene
results from John's mere conjecture. In other words, the difference that
"Solid Objects" insists on is a difference that comes from dislodging
objects from a history of their proximity to subjects, from liberating
artifacts out of their status as determinate signs, from rendering a
life of things that is irreducible to the history of human subjects.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet the pathos of <I>Jacob's Room,</I> among other novels, depends
precisely on that reduction, on the symbolic and metonymic power of
objects. The novel displays the evanescence of the protagonist's life
as a relation to the material object world. Woolf's poetics of space is
in fact a poetics of the object. We first read about the boy climbing
on rock, "one of those tremendously solid brown, or rather black,
rocks which emerge from the sand like something primitive," and then
about him lost at the beach and "sobbing, but absent-mindedly" running
"farther and farther" to discover
<B></B>
 just what it is that he has glimpsed
"among the black sticks and straw."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Despite his family's insistence, he refuses to give up the sheep's
 skull, whitened by water and
wind; he sleeps with it at the foot of the bed. The boy's attachment to
the natural object that most readily suggests permanence, rock, becomes
instead an attachment to bone, the quintessential memento mori that
expresses the proximity between the animate and inanimate.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A child's fascination with the natural world--children collecting
beetles and butterflies in chapter two--devolves into more mundane
arrangements, such as Jacob's room at Cambridge, with its "round table
and two low chairs," with "yellow flags in a jar on the mantelpiece"
(<I>JR,</I> 38). The novel gradually taxonomizes the adult fascination
with objects. Consumer desire keeps Fanny captivated by "Evelina's shop
off Shaftsbury Avenue" where "the parts of a woman were shown separate,"
skirts and boas and hats and shoes displayed without the logic of the
ensemble (<I>JR,</I> 121). Indian philosophy prompts Jinny Carslake
to cherish "a little jeweler's box containing ordinary pebbles picked
off the road. But if you look at them steadily, she says, multiplicity
becomes unity" (<I>JR,</I> 131). A recognizably Romantic sensibility
compels Jacob himself to cherish the Acropolis. In the midst of these
competing modes of cathexis, the narrator offers a fully thematizing,
ambiguating account of the relation between things of the world (actions)
and things in the world (mere things) as Jacob begins to think seriously
about his future, about going into Parliament, perhaps, about the question
of the British Empire, the question of Home Rule in Ireland: "For he had
grown to be a man, and was about to be immersed in things--as indeed
the chambermaid, emptying his basin upstairs, fingering keys, studs,
pencils, and bottles of tabloids strewn on the dressing-table, was aware"
(<I>JR,</I> 139). Once immersed in mere things, Jacob is about to immerse
himself in things, as his new possessions testify. He is cut off from
aspiring to the political life and the sense of political economy that
John willfully abandons in "Solid Objects." The concluding tableau of
the novel, then, evolves less from the idea of absence (Jacob's death in
the war), and more from a lingering presence, all the unburied remains,
those possessions no longer possessed. A room lived in and permanently
left is not haunted, but uncanny: "One fibre in the wicker arm-chair
creaks, though no one sits there" (<I>JR,</I> 176). The overwhelming
question for those left is what to do with the objects that linger;
holding out a pair of Jacob's old shoes, his mother asks "What am I to
do with these?" (<I>JR,</I> 176). If, as Baudrillard would maintain, the
subject's destiny passes into the object, what is the object's destiny
beyond the life of the subject? What sort of obsolescence is this?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The affective power of the novel's close demonstrates the metonymic
potency of material objects, which is inseparable from their potency to
convey the realism of the novelistic universe, not just in the work of
Charles Dickens or Honor&eacute; de Balzac, say, but also in experimental
fiction. Woolf came to believe that the birth of the novel as we know
it, <I>Robinson Crusoe,</I> must be thought through the re of the
"large earthenware pot" that she posits as an emblem of Daniel Defoe's
authority, which is fiction's authority to overwhelm the reader with the
wholeness of an imagined world, and to
<B></B>
 interrupt romantic fantasy with
novelistic fact. "By believing fixedly in the solidity of the pot and
its earthiness, he has subdued every other element to his design; he has
roped the universe into a harmony."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 In the power of the earthenware pot as Woolf imagines it, which
 is Defoe's capacity to novelize the universe, there is something of
 Stevens's jar on a hill in Tennessee, transforming the landscape around
 it, if not something of Heidegger's jug, the thing that things the world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 When solid objects become the explicit object of Woolf's address,
 however, the coherence of the solid object that makes the world cohere
 gives way to the solidity of fragments; there is no earthenware pot,
 but simply "a piece of china of the most remarkable shape . . . shaped,
 or broken accidentally, into five irregular but unmistakable points"
 (<I>HH,</I> 83). Though the emphasis on the accidental shape of the
 china fragment might be said to ally the story with the dadaist and
 surrealist faith in the irrational and the contingent, the point is more
 that reevaluating the material world seems to depend on its re-use and
 on some violence that violates the coherence of the object. Whereas
 John imagines this violence as the act of an angry woman (hurling a
 "jar or a pot" out the window), the violence that the story nowhere
 imagines but everywhere intimates is the violence of war.

As John hunts in "the neighborhood of waste land where the household
refuse is thrown away," and then comes to "haunt the places which are most
prolific of broken china, such as pieces of waste land between railway
lines, sites of demolished houses, and commons in the neighborhood of
London," it is hard not to envision him as a character roaming the city
streets and rat's alley of <I>The Waste Land,</I> the poem the Woolfs
would publish two years later (<I>HH,</I> 82, 83-4; <A HREF="6.2brown_1.html"> 1</A>). But
such a convergence, itself part of a more widespread representation of

If war-traumatized London makes sense as the (underspecified) setting
for the story, that trauma would seem to be specifically material, not
spiritual. Though Woolf could dismiss the war as "remote and meaningless,"
she also lamented that "one has come to notice the war everywhere,"
meaning that "everything is skimped," that butcher shops are closed,
that cards are required for "most foods," that other shops display
"tins, or cardboard boxes" that are empty (<I>D,</I> 100).

 Given the facts of wartime scarcity, the point is less that her diaries
 seem so evacuated of material objects and more that the world they
 describe has been so evacuated: "If you see a plum, it is invariably a
 decoy plum" (<I>D,</I> 112). Though the accounts of the raids on London,
 the mattresses dragged to the cellar, are the more obvious reminder of
 the presence of the war in her diaries and letters, there is a subtler
 but ubiquitous sense
 
 <B></B>

 of how the things of the world, such as paper and
 paint, have become the materials of war. In this context, then, the
 intermittent material fascinations of her 1918 summer
 diary attain more significance: "I think it was on Friday that I was
 given my green glass jar by the chemist--for nothing! It's a jar I've
 always coveted; since glass is the best of all decorations, holding
 the light &amp; changing it" (<I>D,</I> 170).

If Woolf's pleasure in this green glass jar resurfaces in John's
pleasure in the green lump of glass found on the beach, it does so
embedded in a culture of scarcity that precipitates a different quality
of cathexis. Glass had become the focus of national concern as glass
manufacturers transformed major plants into munitions factories.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
Moreover, the arrested import of Jena glass from Germany and Austria

 As the <I>Geographic Journal</I> explained in its

 sands" would support domestic production needs. But if to the ministry
 it seemed as though
these sands had sufficient silica content and the right grain, in fact
the postwar search for the best sand led British crystal manufacturers
back to Fontainebleau and to Loch Aline, Scotland.

 The image of John "burrowing his fingers down, down, into the sand"
 and discovering there "a large irregular lump" of green glass might
 thus be read as an image less of discovery than of productivity, a
 production of glass out of the domestic glass sands of Britain and a
 recognition of its particular beauty. Still, it is not material as such
 (neither the sand nor the glass), but the whole process of retrieving
 and reanimating the ambiguous remnant that catalyzes John's fascination.

Between 1912 and 1930 Francis Bakley published some six books and dozens
of articles on English glass; in retrospect, this looks like an act of
mourning, composed as it was in the midst of general doubts about the
longevity of the English production. The problem was not simply that
glass manufacturers had been making light bulbs, rods, and tubes for
wartime industry, but also that free trade made cheap imports a perpetual
threat to the financial success of domestic stemware once the war was
over. The Society for Glass Technology was organized in 1916, as was a
Department of Glass Technology at Sheffield, in the specific effort to
sustain the nation's importance in the history of glass manufacture, but
by 1924, seventy percent of the British market was supplied by imports,
factories closed, and glassmakers were left unemployed in the face of
continental competition.

If the wartime and postwar history of glass in Britain can help to
reframe "Solid Objects" as a story about the modern fate of materials,
then the history of iron intensifies the same point. The history of iron
<I>and</I> glass, as instantiated by the Crystal Palace, chronicled the
serial and international prospects of modernity (<A HREF="6.2brown_2.html"> 2</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Still, the story of Great Britain's iron trade was perpetually felt
 as a national tragedy, a narrative of decline from the industrial
 revolution and the thriving Imperial economy. In standard histories,
 the vast iron and coal resources of England were understood as the
 necessary condition of the eighteenth-century Industrial Revolution. As
 Leonard Woolf revised this history, the industrial revolution and empire
 converged as an "intense preoccupation with material things," a demand
 for raw materials, coupled with production technologies, that resulted
 in "the whole world [being] ransacked for mines and metals," and in
 international competition for the control of resources.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The globalization that culminates in war, and in the compression of time
 and space that has been said to constitute modernity, originates with
 what we might call a passion for materials. When Virginia Woolf begins
 to write a story about accumulating materials in the month of the war's
 close, she thus writes an allegory of that war's origin, but an allegory
 with a difference--the difference marked by the bricoleur's confusion
 of ends and means, by an alternative economy where value results from
 a noninstrumental passion for things.

 control was removed in 1919; by 1921 the price of such rudimentary
 objects as nuts and bolts had risen to five times that before the war.

 When in his obsessive search John discovers "a very remarkable piece
 of iron" under a furze bush, he encounters the element that had become

All this is to say that if John's "serious ambitions" are met with a
"lack of understanding" that is repeated in the critical consensus about
the story, we might nonetheless begin to understand his behavior as an
alternative mode of experiencing scarcity (<I>HH,</I> 85). In Europe,
more so than in the U.S., the war intensified a Taylorist horror of
waste, not just of time but of substances. This was the war in which
all citizens were summoned to participate as national subjects, "each
one of us"--"you and each one of you."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 In their effort to involve civilians in the military project, governments
 took out ads and relied on posters as the new medium for communicating
 with the masses, for bringing the war into the civilian everyday
 (<A HREF="6.2brown_3.html"> 3</A>). Saving fat for use in explosives, collecting the metal needed
 for scrap in the making of bombs--these activities comprised a new kind
 of materialism, a requisite bricolage, a recognition that the materials
 of everyday objects could have another life (<A HREF="6.2brown_4.html">4</A>). As Aragon came to
 put it, "Aha! that tinkling silver-plating was false / The teaspoons
 are made of lead just like those bullets."

Indeed, if the engagement Woolf narrates in "Solid Objects" can be
understood as registering and aestheticizing, however inversely or
perversely, the newly stipulated attention to materials throughout Europe,
then the story can grant us a different access to familiar accounts of
modernism and the object. Whether one assumes that the readymade was meant
to attack the world of art, to foreground the role of the artist, or to
dislodge common objects from the tyranny of use, Duchamp first promoted
his readymades when the making of any common object--a urinal, a bottle
rack, a snow shovel--was threatened all over Europe by the requirements
of martial manufacturing. The various governmental demands to rethink
the material world, and to revise the notion of waste toward a notion of
recomposition, might lurk behind what Benjamin called the "materialistic,
anthropological inspiration" that provoked the surrealists to discover
some revolutionary potential in discarded
<B></B>
 objects.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 As for anthropological inspiration as such, we can describe the fetishism
 Woolf portrays as an alternative economy, an intensely private and
 privatizing reorientation
of value, that offers a specular image of the alternative economies
that anthropologists made visible in the 1920s. In <I>Argonauts of the
Pacific,</I> based on fieldwork done in New Guinea and North Melanesia
during the war, Bronislaw Malinowski introduces "law and order into what
seemed chaotic and freakish" by describing the function of apparently
meaningless objects in the Kula.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 When Marcel Mauss revises those conclusions to emphasize the
 irrationality of such practices, he deliberately juxtaposes "irrational
 expenditure" to the Western image of homo oeconomicus as "a calculating
 machine" devoted to "frigid utilitarian calculation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 Though Georges Bataille would go on to celebrate various modes
 of <I>d&eacute;pense</I> as such, Mauss's own ethical conclusions,
 argued in explicit relation to the European war, emphasize how a stable
 sociality, a kind of solidarity that depends on competition, can emerge
 out of the respect and reciprocity of "the gift." The intense isolation
 of the individual in "Solid Objects" would be anathema to Mauss. But
 Woolf's image of reappropriating, valorizing, and aestheticizing waste,
 no less than his image of wasting valuable property,
 
 <B></B>


 is underwritten
 by the sense that the economic reason of the West has been exhausted.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Which is to say that the history of objects as we know it (the history of
objects as we know them) will never challenge the Enlightenment's history
of itself. The challenge comes from the history of things, and from the
histories in them.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">

"Solid Objects" begins with a narratorial consciousness that registers, as
though through binoculars or through a zoom lens, a barely perceptible
detail that slowly comes into focus as two human bodies. Woolf thus
manages to record, in this gradually clarifying perception, something
like the momentary development of sensation into perception:

The only thing that moved upon the vast semicircle of the beach was
one small black dot. As it came nearer to the ribs and spine of the
stranded pilchard boat, it became apparent from a certain tenuity in
its blackness that this spot possessed four legs. . . . [The] mouths,
noses, chins, and check stockings of the two speakers became clearer and
clearer; the smoke of their pipes went up into the air; nothing was so
solid, so living, so hard, red, hirsute and virile as these two bodies
for miles and miles of sea and sandhill. [<I>HH,</I> 79]
<B></B>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These bodies, rendered as body parts and as parts that help designate
the form of the pilchard boat, achieve their solidity in the context of
the seascape. But once they settle
 into their wholeness (once they assume, let us say, the phantasmatic
 image of the coherent human body) the "only thing" that can mark such
 solidity is some other thing. As he burrows into the sand, John's fingers
 finally curl "round something hard--a full drop of solid matter," which
 turns out to be a "green tint," a lump of glass, smoothed by the water
 into a veritable green gem (<I>HH,</I> 80). "It pleased him; it puzzled
 him; it was so hard, so concentrated, so definite an object compared
 with the vague sea and the hazy shore" (<I>HH,</I> 81). The definiteness
 of the solid object seems rather to expose the vagueness of politics
 ("Politics be damned!"), pushing politics into the background, as
 objects sometimes do in Woolf's diary: "I have bought another glass jar
 for 2/-. These things are in the foreground. It is partly due to them
 . . . that I don't write first &amp; foremost of the German offer of
 peace" (<I>D,</I> 199). If we grant "Solid Objects" a (specifically)
 peripheral place in the British literature of World War I, and even
 grant Virginia Woolf's shortest fiction some relation to Leonard Woolf's
 tireless work on behalf of The League of Nations, then this story will
 assume a very different role--to demonstrate how utterly pedestrian
 passions can be understood as a longing for the fragments of the West
 not to be reassembled as they previously had been.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though the solidity of human bodies in the story gives way to the solidity
of glass, solidity as such certainly gives way to a kind of fluidity--"the
green thinned and thickened slightly as it was held against the sky or
against the body" (<I>HH,</I> 81)--just as it gives way to elaborate
fantasy: "Perhaps after all it was really a gem; something worn by a
dark Princess trailing her finger in the water as she sat in the stern
of the boat and listened to the slaves singing as they rowed her across
the Bay" (<I>HH,</I> 80-1). What prevents solidity from becoming the
point, what capacitates the imaginative encounter, is the incoherence of
the fragment. John does not quite succumb to what Simmel described as
the "the present vividly felt charm of the fragment" that distances us
"from things" because "reality is touched not with direct confidence but
with fingertips that are immediately withdrawn" (<I>PM,</I> 474). Rather,
John's tactile engagement gives him license to explore some other unhuman
reality: "John turned it in his hands; he held it to the light; he held
it so that its irregular mass blotted out the body and extended right arm
of his friend" (<I>HH,</I> 81). The fragment appears in "Solid Objects"
as the re of the material metonym whose metonymic function has been
arrested--the unconsummated metonym, as it were. The unconsummated metonym
is the re, or the conceptual image, that Woolf offers us to think
the object/thing dialectic, to think the world anew. John collects broken
parts that are not really parts <I>of</I> anything determinable: "it was
impossible to say whether it had been bottle, tumbler, or window-pane; it
was nothing but glass." His materialism, where parts are related not to
wholes but to other parts, enacts a kind of redemption that refuses the
(Heideggerian) temporality of recuperation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
John's fetishism does not depend on substitution, but merely dynamizes
the excess that characterizes any object, even the paper clip, the rubber
band, the empty 
<B></B>
glass. If the recent work on objects (consumer objects,
museal objects, ethnographic objects) "responds to the imperative to
know about material needs, wants, and
desires," then work on things should assume the task of discovering, in
the history of objects, material desires, or the desire for material,
that will forever be lost in the histories of consumer society or
ethnographies of cultural exchange. At the very close of the story,
John's friend Charles, depressed by the disarray of the room and utterly
confused by his friend, asks "What made you give it up," meaning to ask
just what prevented John from pursuing his political career. When John
answers "I've not given it up," he means that he has not abandoned his
search (<I>HH,</I> 85). He could hardly give it up because his passion
has become irrepressible. In addition, he refuses to feel guilt about his
new pleasure because rather than discovering one solid object or another,
he in fact discovers some other desire. The desire to historicize this
desire can not help limiting its potential to overcome affectively the
specificities of time and of place, its potential to sense multiple
histories materialized in (or by) the discarded remnant, the curious
remainder. The war precipitated a national fixation on materials
that enabled Woolf to imagine some more challenging, exhilarating
material fixations. But we repeat the error she remonstrates against if,
accumulating bits and pieces of this history, we believe that they form
the whole story.

much of my point. Pr&eacute;vert's empty matchboxes, threaded together by
displacing the drawer of one box into the cavity of the contiguous box,
ran in a line over the mantle and across a wall. As Lacan understands it,
the exhibit enables the matchboxes to transcend their status as objects,
to show "the Thing that subsists in a match box." This "arrangement
demonstrated that a match box isn't simply something that has a certain
utility . . . that the match box all by itself is a thing with all
its coherence of being" . This thingness, however, is precisely
not the Thing that ultimately concerns Lacan--the Thing that names the
unsymbolizable Real in its totality (as interiority and exteriority).

[Taking the side of things]). In "Plus-que-raisons" (1930 [More than

taking the side of ideas or things to be described, and taking the
side of words. Given the singular power of words, the absolute power
of the established order, only one attitude is possible: taking the
side of things all the way" (Ponge, <I>Nouveau recueil</I> [Paris:

"more real, or real with a different reality from that which we perceive
in daily life," but she goes on to imagine the surreal possibility that
the cinema will offer "abstractions," "visual emotions," some way of
visualizing "thought in its wildness" . In "Solid Objects" John's
tactile engagement with material is coupled with a new sensitivity
to abstract form: "he was often astonished, as he came to go into the

It would be possible to call attention to how Woolf's realist mode, with
its verisimilar rendering of decor, transforms into a modernist mode
where objects no longer have an identifiable relation to humans or to one
another. Such schematic narratives, however, as Bowlby suggests, erase
the very instability that characterizes Woolf's objectifications even as
fictional chronicler. In "Solid Objects," John's relation to the things
he collects seems more like the sort of relation described in Leonard
Woolf's novelistic account of Hambantota life in Ceylon, <I>The Village
in the Jungle</I> , where Silindu's profound intimacy with the
jungle provokes his isolation both from his fellow villagers and from
the British officials.

Writing to Lytton Strachey before his visit to Asheham, Woolf explains
that "you'll have to bring whatever cards for meat, sugar, butter you
possess as we are strictly rationed here," or, alternatively, "get your
cook at Belsize to get you a week's rations of butter, sugar and meat
which you pack in your bag and bring with you" 24 March 1918; 27 March
1918 (<I>L,</I> 227, 228).

Woolf's interest in glass extends from the material to the rhetorical. In
her <I>Diary,</I> she explains of <I>Electra</I> that "traditional plots
which have been made &amp; improved &amp; freed from superfluities by
the polish of innumerable actors &amp; authors &amp; critics" become
"like a lump of glass worn smooth in the sea" (<I>D,</I> 184). And when
Orlando is frustrated by the way familiar metaphors encumber any thought
or expression of love, Woolf uses the metaphor of the thing of glass,
"Every single thing, once he tried to dislodge it from its place in
his mind, he found thus cumbered with other matter like the lump of
glass which, after a year at the bottom of the sea, is grown about with
bones and dragon-flies, and coins and the tresses of drowned women"

would be to understand John himself as a militaristic re--increasingly

been transformed by war's engulfing transformation, by its capacity to
conscript even those who appear uninvolved.

Woolf narrativizes such a development in "The Mark on the Wall"; the
ambiguous, abstract mark turns out to be a snail. Insofar as the story
represents an attraction to "the impersonal world which is proof of some
existence other than ours," an attraction satisfied by the "solidity"
and "reality" of materials ("Wood is a pleasant thing to think about"),
"The Mark on the Wall" can be reasonably paired with "Solid Objects"
(<I>HH,</I> 45). But the latter utterly differentiates itself by fixating
on the fragment, the specifically cultural remainder that will never
assume coherence as a familiar object, animate or inanimate.
