<p id="lead">Gret Palucca's dancing was recognized for its optimism and lightness; Palucca's signature movements—airborne springs, deep lunges, and high leg extensions—impressed audiences with their athletic energy. One of Mary Wigman's first students, Palucca performed in numerous group choreographies created by the modern dance pioneer in the early 1920s, but split from her mentor in 1924 to found her own rival studio in Dresden and competed with Wigman for students and fame. Unlike Wigman, who was described by the bourgeois women's magazine <i>Die Dame (The Lady) </i>as a <i>tieftänzerin,</i> or low dancer, for her deeply spiritual and symbolic work based on movements along the floor, Palucca was termed by <i>Die Dame </i>as a <i>hochtänzerin,</i> or high dancer for her airborne movements.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  And in contrast to Wigman, whose choreographies created new directions in and considerations about modernist dance, Palucca did not speak of her own dances in theoretical terms. Rather, critics noted that Palucca's rhythmic, geometric, and exuberant dancing style suggested a balance of contrasts: strength and softness, pushing out and pulling in, innocence and seriousness.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Indeed, the impressive heights of Palucca's springs, combined with her youthfully pretty appearance, extensive tour schedule, and savvy self-promotion, made Palucca one of the most recognized dancers of Germany's Weimar Republic (1918–1933). Regularly featured in mainstream women's style magazines such as <i>Die Dame </i>and <i>Uhu (The Owl),</i> Palucca served as a model of the New Woman, the media icon of the fashionably emancipated woman, whose liberation was signified, in large part, through modern movement. At the same time, Palucca 

<b></b>

 cultivated connections with the avant-garde, especially with artists. Art and dance critic Will Grohmann introduced her to the cultural elite; a Piet Mondrian painting hung in her dance studio; Palucca purchased a Paul Klee painting as a birthday gift for her husband; and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner filled sketchbooks with drawings of her solo dance rehearsals.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  In other words, Palucca promoted herself as a mass-media star and an avant-garde performer. </p>

<p>Palucca brought her dancing style, popular culture fame, and art-world connections to her interactions with artists at the Bauhaus, an innovative school for art and design in Weimar Germany. A bastion of modernism, the Bauhaus endorsed artistic abstraction, in which identifiable, rative subject matter was minimized or even obliterated. Instead, Bauhaus modernism favored an emphasis on pictorial compositions of pure lines, blocks of color, and geometric shapes. Numerous modernist critics also envisioned modernism as a closed system of influence in which "art begat art" and developed without regard to external cultural forms, social issues, or political events. While such insistence on the removal of art from external forces would be impossible at the tumultuous Bauhaus, officially at least the Bauhaus asserted the primacy of modernism. Wassily Kandinsky, widely recognized as one of the first abstract painters, taught abstract art and theory to students and wrote theoretical treatises about abstract art during his tenure at the Bauhaus. "Dance Curves," an essay Kandinsky published in 1926 in which the artist created four abstract drawings influenced by four photographs of Palucca by Charlotte Rudolph, embodies the very issues of modernism promoted by the Bauhaus in the mid-1920s.  </p>

<p>Instead of sustaining this narrowly defined notion of modernism, however, I focus on the staunchly abstract artist Kandinsky, and in particular his essay "Dance Curves," in order to position a gender critique of modernism. The Kandinsky/Palucca drawings elucidate the fluidity of interchanges between the arts and modernism's openness to seeming antitheses in physical culture and women's culture, thereby contesting the binaries of high art/popular culture, masculine/feminine, and mind/body that have been asserted by numerous theorists and critics since the Enlightenment. I argue that "Dance Curves" reveals the diversity within modernism, of the interaction between these socially constructed binaries, and in particular of abstraction's relationship with gender, before the imposition of conventional hierarchies that have dominated art history since Clement Greenberg in the 1950s. </p>

<p>These binaries ran deep. Since the Enlightenment, Rene Descartes' formulation of a mind/body dichotomy has privileged the former over the latter, valuing language, writing, intellect, and the public sphere (historically associated with men) over physicality, dance, childbirth, and the home (historically associated with women). Though the definition of modernism (and its relevance for individual artists) has changed over time, modernist theory reached an apotheosis with Greenberg, whose ideas strongly informed American art, art history, and criticism from the 1950s into the 1970s. Under his tutelage American art history neglected interdisciplinary approaches to the arts and left movements preoccupied with non-painterly materials or ration out of the modernist canon. In prioritising style over subject matter and highlighting abstract rather 

<b></b>

 than rative artists, Greenberg argued for an abstract and autonomous art object, an autonomy based in the painting's emphasis on the canvas's own fundamental flatness that contested the notion—held since the Renaissance—that painting functioned as a window onto another world. For Greenberg, this form of autonomous avant-garde painting served to save culture from kitsch, a middlebrow mass culture created for bourgeois suburbanites in an increasingly capitalistic and regimented America. Though Greenberg did not discuss it in such explicit terms, the "kitsch" he most detested was coded as feminine, characterized by such sites and objects as suburban homes and melodramatic films.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Greenberg's theories, thus, insisted upon a high/low cultural divide between the arts based in part on an implied male/female binary. </p>

<p>"New art histories" since the 1970s, grounded in feminism and Marxism, have also made room for a more expansive notion of art history within visual culture; but there, too, scholars have nonetheless overlooked key aspects of this complex relationship.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In art historian Thomas Crow's analysis of modernism, modernist art engaged with and readily drew upon mass culture for subject matter, and modern art's shock effect for audiences derived in part from its disruption of assumed cultural hierarchies of "high art" and "mass culture." Envisioning a more complex dynamic between the avant-garde and mass culture, Crow interprets both cultural forms as influenced by one another, and describes how the utopian avant-garde quickly became a mainstream commodified package.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Crow's reevaluation of modernism, however, contains some glaring omissions: his emphasis on Marxist interpretations, however much they value labor and work, overlooks gender entirely; the subjects and audiences of kitsch and mass culture were historically overwhelmingly female, but Crow does not address how or why male artists appropriated objects and ideas associated with women.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  I would further argue that in Weimar German art milieus, including the Bauhaus, dance created little shock as artistic subject matter. Rather, there existed at the Bauhaus an easy mingling and mixing between art and dance. Visual artists' personal interests in dance, such as Kandinsky's, countered the modernist myth that high art developed separately from and remained uninfluenced by both popular culture and the performing arts. </p>

<p>The example of "Dance Curves" elucidates how the rigid binaries formulated by many modernists simply did not exist in practice. Mindful of her public image, Palucca presented herself as a modernist dancer concerned with abstraction, but combined with an image, on- and off- stage, that was simultaneously youthfully feminine, New Woman androgynous, and powerfully masculine. Using photographs of Palucca's performances of modernism and gender, Kandinsky freely explored her dancing as an expression of his theoretical principles based on abstraction. His very abstractions, however, revealed constructivism's relationship with masculinity and androgyny. Abstraction was (and is) not gender neutral, and in the 1920s it was infused by the complex debates about the New Woman, gender identity, and women's emancipation at the Bauhaus and beyond. <b></b></p>

<p>It should come as little surprise that Palucca would seek out Kandinsky and the Bauhaus. She and her husband, Fritz Bienert, used his impressive family connections as entrée to the innovative school; his sister, Ise, studied at the Bauhaus and provided her close friend Palucca with a distinct understanding of the institution; their mother, Ida, was widely recognized for her illustrious modern art collection, including extensive holdings of paintings by Bauhaus faculty. Palucca also solicited artists' advice, purchased their art, and taught Bauhaus art theory in her dance classes.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Moreover, Palucca visited the Bauhaus. First performing for students and faculty on March 18, 1925, and then on several other occasions in the late 1920s, she posed for photographs, socialized with the faculty, and partied with the students. Extant photographs portray warm friendships between Palucca and Bauhaus masters and students. In one example, Palucca, Kandinsky, and his wife Nina stand on the roof of the Kandinsky home and smile as they look into the distance. In another, Palucca stands in a line of six people, including Paul Klee and his wife Lily, and they humorously link their arms and raise their knees as if dancing in a revue kickline. Student photography showcases Palucca's liveliness and modern appearance, portraying her climbing onto and springing off the Bauhaus roofs.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  These visual cues imply that Palucca was personally close to the artists and welcomed into the institution. </p>

<p>The appearance of easy artistic closeness in these photographs, however, belies the tumultuousness felt throughout the institution, created by a set of diverse issues that influenced how Bauhaus artists interpreted Palucca's dancing. The timing of Palucca's first visit occurred in the middle of a major financial and political crisis at the school. A public institution, the Bauhaus relied on the state legislature for funding, and its increasingly politically right-leaning elected representatives pressured the progressive Weimar Bauhaus to close in 1925, within months of Palucca's visit, and relocate to the industrial city of Dessau. Klee, Kandinsky's closest colleague and friend at the Bauhaus, could not help but read Palucca's performance as one that momentarily unified an otherwise splintering Bauhaus community.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>   </p>

<p>On another front, contentiousness surrounded the issue of women's roles since the school's beginnings. Women actively participated in the school's vibrant daily life and were regularly photographed enjoying relaxing moments on the cafeteria terrace, but their matriculation was limited so as not to exceed the number of male students.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Once they became students at the Bauhaus, by edict of director Walter Gropius, women were encouraged to occupy separate studios from their male counterparts for the preliminary and form courses. And invariably funneled into the Weaving Workshop, the so-called Women's Class, many female Bauhaus students voiced enthusiasm for textile work and its appropriateness for women; nonetheless, these divisions reinforced gendered distinctions between the "men's work" which included sculpture and metal, and the "women's work" exclusively in textiles.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>   </p>

<p>By the time of Palucca's arrival, the official Bauhaus style had transformed from expressionism, an emotional art with its hand-drawn vibrating lines, to constructivism, 

<b></b>

  a clean precision style with non-sentimental, geometric, industrial forms. The 1923 Bauhaus exhibition's slogan, "Art and Technology: A New Unity," and the hire of constructivist photographer and leftist activist Laszló Moholy-Nagy, signaled and solidified these aesthetic shifts. Even expressionist advocate Kandinsky tilted his art in a harder-edged direction; the precise straight lines and perfected arches of Kandinsky's "Dance Curves" are products of his changed artistic slant, a style considerably different from that which he painted before World War I and described in his 1912 treatise, <i>Concerning the Spiritual in Art.</i><sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Bauhaus artists did respond favorably to Palucca's dancing and visits, but their reactions were complicated by these tense political, gender, and aesthetic dynamics. </p>

<p>Perhaps attuned to these myriad concerns, Palucca's first Bauhaus performance evening showcased her talents, but did so in a way that would have provided diverse points of identification, desire, and comfort for her audience. For one, Palucca danced to musical accompaniment. The titles of the works reveal aspects of their style: "Con Brio (Guarracha)" was a Latin-inspired dance, "Molto Allegro" was inspired by the structures and tempos of classical music, and other choreographies were performed to percussion instruments.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  She choreographed with music in mind, in contrast to other modernist dancers, such as Wigman, who performed to percussive sounds but considered such accompaniment a secondary (or even tertiary) factor in the overall performance. But while such attention to musical accompaniment might have been considered nontraditional in modernist dance circles, Kandinsky and Klee would have found it wholly valid, for her engagement with classical music and musical structures paralleled their own pictorial and theoretical explorations of music. Kandinsky concerns himself with sound and music throughout his 1926 treatise <i>Point and Line to Plane,</i> for example, envisioning points as notes on a sheet of music and geometric conrations within picture planes as "lyrical" and "harmonious."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Palucca also offered her Bauhaus audience multiple and varied performances of gender. Unlike her mentor Wigman, Palucca did not contest traditional structures of gendered spectatorship. She chose not to follow Wigman's example of masks and billowy costumes that obscured her body, but instead sported shorts and short skirts that revealed her toned legs. At a Bauhaus that encouraged women's artistic work as long as it was contained within gender-defined parameters, Palucca's ease with revealing her body reinforced dance's historical associations with the corporeal and femininity. A review of the dance evening in a local paper supports this perspective, and focuses on Palucca's attractiveness: "Wasn't it rhythmic gymnastics that the young, pretty artist with the fabulously trained body and bob hairstyle presented on stage?"<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Palucca's legs, visible in so many of Rudolph's photographs of the dancer, highlight the athleticism of her dancing and her corporeal presence. Only twenty-three years old, Palucca was easy on the eyes, yet her Bauhaus audience may have had differing perspectives on her performance; the male students and professors may have found her attractiveness desirable, whereas the female students may have envisioned Palucca as a living, breathing New Woman, a star with a style and lifestyle to which they too aspired. </p>

<p>However, Palucca's appeal vis-à-vis gender constituted more than youthful femininity. For one, Palucca danced solo, a decisive move that associated her with masculinity. 

<b></b>

 Given that Palucca had performed in Wigman's group choreographies and had trained her own students to perform in such formats, Palucca's choice is noteworthy. Male stars such as Vaslav Nijinsky became the focus of modern ballet narratives and utilized the space of the entire stage for themselves alone; others, like Rudolf von Laban, served as charismatic leaders of younger female students and devotees. This concept of the solo star as masculine stands in contrast to the performed "women's community" many envisioned in the group choreography.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  In addition, the "bob hairstyle" mentioned in the review refers to the <i>Bubikopf,</i> the cropped haircut widely recognized as the quintessence of the New Woman's androgyny. Here, however, Palucca's androgyny is expressed neither as liberation nor as transgressive social threat, but contained as an attractive style. </p>

<p>Palucca's own self-fashionings and self-proclamations as an emancipated woman were undercut by the behind-the-scenes machinations of her husband. Following the Weimar premiere, Fritz Bienert strategized how Bauhaus masters could lend their voices to the dancer's promotional materials. Active in steering her career, he expanded the Palucca dance-school brochure for 1926, <i>Palucca Tanz (Palucca Dance),</i> to include staged photographs of Palucca springing in soft-lit studio settings and excerpted quotations from glowing press reviews. Bienert also solicited statements by prominent intellectuals and artists, such as Kandinsky, Klee, and Moholy-Nagy, Bauhaus artists likely to make positive proclamations and analyses of his wife's work.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  The Palucca School's secretary sent out form letters to the artists, but whereas Klee returned a brief statement to the secretary, Bienert quickly took the reins of the Kandinsky essay.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Bienert encouraged the artist to turn his statement into a multi-page essay and loaned Kandinsky photographs by Rudolph upon which he based his four drawings. The completed version of "Dance Curves" was enclosed in a letter sent directly to Bienert and published six months later and verbatim in <i>Das Kunstblatt (The Art Paper), </i>one of the most illustrious cultural journals of the Weimar era.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Kandinsky also included Palucca in his Bauhaus theoretical treatise, <i>Point and Line to Plane, </i>completing the manuscript within weeks of submitting "Dance Curves."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  "Dance Curves" was also positioned as the first text the 1926 <i>Palucca Dance </i>brochure, in effect prioritizing Kandinsky's words and drawings over those of other artists and critics.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Much as "Dance Curves" suggests Beinert and Palucca's strategic maneuverings, it likewise elucidates Palucca's importance for Kandinsky as an artist. Her dancing put his pictorial theories into physical practice. Palucca's prettiness and musical accompaniment may have made her performance more approachable, but Kandinsky also seems to have envisioned something profound in her dancing forms. He chose to render her as an amalgamation of simple lines, a simplicity that at first obscures the complex correlations in the drawings and dances between abstraction, masculinity, and the modern woman of the 1920s.

<p>"Complete mastery is impossible without precision," Kandinsky declares at the beginning of the essay, implying that artistic achievement—for dancer and artist alike—is found in the harmony and balance of clear geometric relationships ("DC," 520). Working from still photographs, Kandinsky analyzes Palucca's dancing as compositional arrangements of clean, crisp lines within pictorial planes. At first glance, the title "Dance Curves" is ironic. Kandinsky's drawings are remarkably still for dance imagery, imagery that, given their subject matter, could appear more energetic; and Kandinsky employed straight or zig-zag lines far more often than curves and arcs. As for the photographs, they are all staged in soft-lit studio settings, with three of the four portraying the dancer still, in positions she could have held for an extended period of time. None of them portray Palucca performing her signature springs. The slight blurriness of each photograph creates an image of a softer (i.e. more feminine) Palucca; but the blur also implies that she had moved, as if these carefully orchestrated promotional photographs were in fact quick snapshots of a dynamically moving dancer. </p>

<p>The purpose of Kandinsky's drawings, the artist writes in "Dance Curves," is to examine "the simplicity of the overall form" of Palucca's precise poses and movements, and how "the structure is based upon form in the large" ("DC," 520). That is, Kandinsky focuses exclusively on the lines and curves that form the clear and fundamental basis of the dancing body's pose and movement; "dead material," such as costuming, obfuscates these fundamentals and is thus omitted. Often Kandinsky's drawings are recognizable as human res only when compared to the accompanying photographs, but Kandinsky is concerned with abstraction, not a pictorial representation of the human body. The drawings' lines, zig-zags, and curves imply warmth and coolness, direction and orientation, and tension and movement; the arrangement of these simple lines within these four picture planes creates complex relationships of drama and balance, relationships that served as the bases for both Kandinsky's art and Palucca's dancing. Palucca's balance of angularity versus smooth overlapping curves, for example, creates an asymmetrical harmony of weights and counterweights, in keeping with Kandinsky's theories. Kandinsky drew lines that converge and separate, evoking the "push-pull" dynamic found in Palucca's choreographies. </p>

<p>To turn to specific examples, two of the pairings are of generally vertical res composed of lines instead of curves (<a href="#1"> 1</a>,2,7,8). As Kandinsky writes in <i>Point and Line to Plane, </i>a line "is the trail left by the point in motion. Hence it comes about through movement—indeed, by destroying the ultimately self-contained repose of the point" ("PLP," 572). None of the lines in "Dance Curves" are straight vertical lines, a type of line that for Kandinsky "has a tendency to run straight to infinity," but the pairings here include a high concentration of vertically oriented diagonal lines. Because diagonal lines combine horizontality (i.e. cold) with verticality (i.e. warm), Kandinsky envisions diagonal lines as an "infinite cold-warm possibility of movement in its most concise form" ("PLP," 572, 574). Palucca's feet are firmly planted on the stage, such that she appears to barely move, but the "cold-warm" dynamic in the diagonals creates tension, or a "force inherent in an element." When Kandinsky combines that tension with the lines' direction, he delineates the fundamental components of movement ("PLP," 

<b></b>

 573). In other words, Palucca's own dancing re might appear barely to move in the photograph, but the diagonals in Kandinsky's drawings imply that it does.  </p>

<p>This implication of movement is extended and amplified in the zig-zags of res <a href="#7">7</a> and <a href="#8">8</a>, zig-zags which, for Kandinsky, take the "warm-cold" dynamic of the diagonal line and extend it on a larger scale, the result of which comes from "the pressure of two forces" ("PLP," 584). The drawing, according to Kandinsky's theories, also emphasizes warmth. The caption reads, in part, "Gradual development from below, with the angles becoming continually more acute" ("PLP," 523). For Kandinsky, the acute angle is a warm angle (in comparison to a right angle or an obtuse angle); moreover, the upper (or "above") section of the picture plane "conjures . . . a feeling of lightness, of emancipation, and ultimately of freedom" ("PLP," 588, 639). It is as if the zig-zagging lines become warmer and lighter as they move up the picture plane in <a href="#8">re 8</a>—a warmth and lightness that also coincides with Palucca's own dancing as one of lightness and optimism. </p>

<p>In the second pairing (<a href="#3">. 3</a>,4), the "curves" of "Dance Curves" are pictorial distillations of arcs created by modern dance, not the curves of the dancing female body. Without physicality or sensuality, the drawing—of three intersecting curves and two converging lines—suggests a human re arching her back only when compared to the photograph, but for Kandinsky, the curve expresses "the extreme pliability of the body" ("DC," 521). For Kandinsky, a curve is a "straight line in motion," created by sideways pressure on a straight line ("PLP," 596–7). The combination of curves and angles in <a href="#4">re 4</a>, however, create the tension Kandinsky strove for in his drawings. The curves oriented towards the vertical, such as the long central curve suggesting Palucca's supporting leg and torso, evoke warmth; the horizontally oriented curves, such as the uppermost curve implying Palucca's arms, indicate cold. Furthermore, the overall composition within the picture plane is weighted towards the left and the upper ("above") section of the picture plane; both of these areas, as with <a href="#8">re 8</a>, imply "lightness," "emancipation," and "freedom." The horizontal and vertical orientations, curves and sharp angles, and warm and cool connotations, create an image of motion and tension. </p>

<p>Palucca and Kandinsky shared a belief in a geometric foundation for an unemotional art. An example of Palucca in a lunge position articulates how her attention to geometric relationships extended into the smallest parts of her body (<a href="#5">. 5</a>, 6). It is the only Kandinsky drawing to include fingers, and in "Dance Curves" Kandinsky pays the dancer the highest compliment for her use of them: "Observe the exact positioning of the fingers as an example of precision in every last detail" ("DC," 522). Such praise of precision in dance res prominently in "<i>Point and Line to Plane,"</i> where Kandinsky writes: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In dance the whole body, in modern dance every finger, draws lines with a very precise expression. The "modern" dancer moves across the stage in exact lines, which he incorporates as an essential element into the composition of his dance (Sacharaov). Apart from which, the dancer's entire body, right down to the fingertips, is at every moment a continuous linear composition (Palucca).</p>

<p class="continued">

 Comprised of diagonal lines and curves, the fingers echo the curves of her head and neck and the strong diagonal of her arm. The finger positioning's clean precision, however, negates a central purpose of the hand in early twentieth-century Germanic visual culture as an expressive tool. In expressionist art and film, hands were to inspire a viewer to sympathetically identify with an individual's angst. In Austrian Egon Schiele's self portraits, for example, his fingers frame his eyes and face, focusing a viewer's attention on his performed tortured emotional state. Here, instead, the stylized hand suggests Palucca's divergence from Wigman's spiritual dances, and Kandinsky's own shifts away from expressionism, both towards a precise, angular, Bauhaus style. </p>

<p>Beyond the fingers, the lunge in <a href="#6">re 6</a> picks up the theme of tension suggested by the other drawings in distinct ways. In Rudolph's photograph (<a href="#5"> 5</a>), the supporting leg in Palucca's lunge is clearly at a right angle; in Kandinsky's drawing, it is at a slightly acute angle, with the knee slightly extended over the foot. These seemingly minor distinctions are important to how these "bodies" are perceived. For Kandinsky, the right angle is the coldest geometric form, for "it divides a square surface relentlessly into four parts" ("PLP," 587). Kandinsky adds some warmth to what would otherwise seem utterly cold to him. In addition, the torso and head's strong upward lunge orientation towards the upper left, like the other drawings, adds to "a feeling of lightness," but that upward orientation is mitigated by the strong downward thrust of the arm and leg. This added emphasis on the lower (or "below") portion of the picture plane signifies for Kandinsky "density, weight, bondage" ("PLP," 640). The strong force of the lines in Kandinsky's drawings, in fact, balances out the composition through an asymmetrical harmony, contrasting the lighter, softer vertical curves of the torso against the forceful lines of the lunging legs and arm.  </p>

<p>Despite Kandinsky's clear praise of the precise geometry of Palucca's positioning in the Rudolph photographs, the text of "Dance Curves" suggests that Kandinsky approaches Palucca's actual dancing unemotionally, even clinically. Nowhere in "Dance Curves" does the artist write of intuitive aspects of the dance, musical accompaniment, spectatorial reception, or of his personal friendship with the dancer. Kandinsky also does not indicate that he saw Palucca perform live; the text and drawings of "Dance Curves" are based entirely on the Rudolph photographs, as if seeing her perform—and experiencing her physical presence—was unimportant to his current analysis. Palucca's name is mentioned only twice in the essay proper, as "Palucca's dances" and "Palucca's art," and then as labels leading the captions underneath each of the four pictures. I emphasize these rare (and, frankly, tangential) usages of Palucca's name in the text to illustrate the emotionally distant tenor of "Dance Curves." The tone is also ironic given the artist's relationship with the dancer. Bienert actively sought to bring Palucca and Kandinsky together for the <i>Palucca Dance </i>brochure, but the dancer and artist had been well acquainted for at least a year before her Weimar premiere. Kandinsky also helped Palucca to expand her social and cultural circle, and according to Palucca's reminiscences, she and Kandinsky shared a warm, father-daughter relationship.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  In other words, the distant tenor in "Dance Curves" was not a reflection of their relationship, but instead conveyed an attitude appropriate for the art of constructivism.<b></b> </p>

<p>
 Central to constructivism is its emphasis on technology, and throughout "Dance Curves" Kandinsky writes of the technological means for depicting dance. Kandinsky writes, "first and foremost, the precise structuring of individual moments . . . can be captured by instantaneous photography," as if his own working processes require the mediation of technology ("DC," 520). At the same time, Kandinsky saw photography as fundamentally limited, "show[ing] stiff, abruptly cut-off forms," that cannot capture the movement of dance (or as Kandinsky phrases it, the "development of the form"). Instead, Kandinsky advocates the filming of dance "by slow-motion photography," but for the purposes of permitting a fuller "precise examination of this precise dancing" ("DC," 522). In basing his drawings so exclusively on technological reproductions rather than the live experiences of performance, Kandinsky describes Palucca's dancing as if it were two dimensional, comprised of "simple curve[s]," "parallel lines," and "right angles" ("DC," 520, 522). In the process, I would argue, Kandinsky overlooks the impact of a live dance performance and the technologies of the stage (such as lighting) that could contribute to the dance's effects on the spectator. </p>

<p>Further, the language of abstraction Kandinsky employed was not gender-neutral; his sketches and words were coded as masculine. More specifically, the constructivist style of "Dance Curves" has historically been aligned with masculinity, hard edges, industry, and the inorganic, in contrast to the socially constructed stereotypes of female sentimentality, decoration, and nature. As Jenny Anger details, Western art history has prioritized the "nonornamental" since Immanuel Kant; within the context of the Bauhaus, artists such as Klee worked to expunge the decorative (and, hence, the feminine) from their work and persona, but not without complications.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Kandinsky, too, feared that his paintings might be interpreted as decoration. From the beginnings of his explorations in abstraction, Rose-Carol Washton Long writes, the artist added suggestions of res, mountains, and churches in his paintings, so that a viewer would be drawn to the painting by identifying objects within the work, and thus understand Kandinsky's meanings. Pure abstraction, much as Kandinsky advocated it, could easily slide into decoration.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Washton-Long does not describe Kandinsky's concern about perceptions of the decorative in terms of gender, but I would argue that, given the gendered implications of the decorative in the 1910s cultural context, Kandinsky would likely have known of their connotations—and sought to avoid them. I would further argue that Kandinsky's foray into pure abstraction in the 1920s was possible within a constructivist aesthetic, precisely because of the style's strong associations with masculinity. Constructivism, in other words, shielded Kandinsky from the threat of the decorative and the feminine. </p>

<p>Kandinsky and Klee were not alone at the Bauhaus; rather, the fear of the decorative, expressed in part through the assertion of constructivist style, was firmly entrenched at the school. For example, Bauhaus faculty employed the terms "constructive" and "decorative" at pivotal moments in the students' careers. Toward the end of the Preliminary Course (the foundation course for design and color theory), Bauhaus faculty evaluated student work, and from those assessments the instructors decreed which workshops (metal, sculpture, bookbinding, weaving, etc.) best suited the student's style 

<b></b>

 and interests. Though the students submitted fairly similar work—much of it was of grids—the male students' work was overwhelmingly deemed "constructive," while the female students' art was described as "decorative."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Such clear associations between style and gender at the Bauhaus not only determined the students' future studies at the institution, but illustrated how fundamentally the Bauhaus faculty associated constructivism with masculinity. </p>

<p>What, then, does this masculine, constructivist style imply for Kandinsky's drawings of a woman dancer? Reading the images through Bauhaus gender politics, Kandinsky's drawings could be interpreted as an erasure of femininity, an attempt to purify art in a way that obliterates the female body entirely, especially its womanly curves, and to expel traditional associations with femininity such as nature and the domestic sphere from his art. "Dance Curves" gives Palucca a constructivist makeover, using words and drawings to, in effect, graft masculinity onto Palucca. The seeming neutrality of "Dance Curves" imposes a masculine gender onto Palucca that was not, biologically, her own. </p>

<p>Kandinsky's geometric style in "Dance Curves," however, need not be interpreted as a resistance to or rejection of Palucca's personal or dance style. Earlier in this article, I discussed how the artist and dancer shared—and agreed upon—principles of abstraction and geometric simplicity. As part of her projected persona for the press, Palucca assumed the look of the modern European New Woman, and a significant component of the New Woman's style was her androgyny, even her assumption of a masculine stance in her solo dancing. Kandinsky's drawings, stylistically coded as masculine, are in fact in keeping with Weimar descriptions of the New Woman as garçonne. Moreover, Kandinsky's compositions in "Dance Curves" favored the uppermost part of the picture plane, an area Kandinsky himself associated with "emancipation" and "freedom;" in a socio-political context, Kandinsky's words could certainly imply women's liberation. Similarly, the "density" and "weight" in <a href="#6">re 6</a> could be interpreted as masculine attributes. Palucca's androgyne appearance was often lauded by the press, as the "pretty woman with the bob haircut" and even the "young boy's face."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The angularity of her <i>Bubikopf</i> worked against the curves of the human body, but its cropped cut symbolized the New Woman's androgyny and coincided with the angularity of Kandinsky's abstracted drawings. Moreover, the sleek and modern constructivist style associates the androgynous dancing re with newness, cosmopolitanism, and urban technological innovation, which were associated with the New Woman; all of these attributes stood in contrast to contemporaneous discourses of traditional femininity. In other words, Kandinsky's abstracted dance depictions can, in fact, be read as an evocation of the cosmopolitan New Woman. </p>

<p>In addition, many New Women took on the style of constructivism for themselves, envisioning its utilization as a form of gender equality. As Briony Fer writes of Soviet Constructivism, while the "social usage [of constructivism] implied a male type—the engineer, the bourgeois specialist, the technical expert involved in industry," women employed the constructivist style to free themselves from both the traditional role of the artist as well as the constraints of gender stereotypes particular to them as women artists. Theory and practice, however, differed. Men and women might have drawn 

<b></b>

 similarly exacting lines with rulers and protractors, but unlike their male counterparts, women constructivists frequently worked in textiles. This crucial difference, among others, "brought issues of sexual difference into play."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Innovations in artistic style and concepts could not overcome the gender inequities living women experienced on a daily basis, but modernism was a utopian enterprise, and thus high potential existed for constructivism to express gender equality. </p>

<p>To return to my point at the beginning of this article, artistic style is not gender neutral. Though many artists do not consciously articulate the implications of their style choices beyond formal attributes, the art they create participates in discourses on identity and forms a visual vocabulary that codes res and environments with particular gendered, ethnic, and national attributes. Kandinsky's "Dance Curves," idealistic in its pursuit of forms, shapes, lines, and curves in their most pure and "precise" states, found them in photographs of the dancer Palucca. For Kandinsky, the result was not a total disregard of the body or the feminine, but a precarious balance between them and modernism, and a recasting of the feminine into an abstracted, masculinized androgyny. His art works through contemporaneous Weimar debates about women's liberation that, in surprising ways, pays respect to Palucca's dancing style. </p>

<p>Palucca's legacy at the Bauhaus continued in the hire of one of her former pupils, Karla Grosch, as a women's gymnastics instructor. Grosch's physical culture was pure Bauhaus, with women leaping on the Bauhaus modernist roof, and bending their bodies in perfect arches. Taking lessons from Palucca's springs and Kandinsky's "Dance Curves," gymnastics brought together the Bauhaus community's myriad hopes and needs; further, it demonstrated the centrality of the body in discourses on modernism. </p>
