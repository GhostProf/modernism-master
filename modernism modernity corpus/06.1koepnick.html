Only a few weeks before the German capitulation, Joseph Goebbels
used the premiere of the feature film <I>Kolberg</I> in April 1945
as an opportunity to hammer home the credo of his unique approach to
politics once more.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 "Gentlemen, in one hundred years' time
they will be showing a fine color film of the terrible days we are
living through. Wouldn't you like to play a part in that film? Hold
out now, so that 100 years hence the audience will not hoot and whistle
when you appear on screen."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Informed by Walter Benjamin's
famous thesis that "the logical result of Fascism is the introduction
of aesthetics into political life," generations of critics have read
remarks such as these as self-explanatory testimonies to the Nazis'
theatrical blurring of boundaries between reality and fiction, appearance
and essence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Aesthetic resources, following such readings,
transformed the Nazi state into a Wagnerian total work of art, a carefully
choreographed spectacle of ethereal bodies and geometrical shapes. Nazi
art not only helped posit a deceptive identity of art and life, image
and original, but also glorified gestures of surrender and idealized
rations of death. Nazi aesthetics taught us how to hold out--manly
and heroically--in the face of total destruction. It reshaped common
ideas of beauty in order to render aesthetic pleasure a direct extension
of political terror: a form of violence in the service of future warfare.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Nazi rule and society, as seen from the perspective of contemporary
historiography, were of course much less homogenous

<B></B>

than Benjamin's
aestheticization thesis would suggest. Not all the pleasures and aesthetic
materials that circulated under fascism took the form of masochistic
feasts of submission, and we therefore--as so many historians have pointed
out--can no longer take for granted the fact that popular attitudes
towards the Third Reich coincided with what we see in historical images
of cheering crowds, images dexterously designed and mass circulated by
Goebbels's media industry. More recent research, which has mapped the
topographies of popular culture during the National Socialist period,
instead suggests that large sections of the population led a double life:
delivering vows of political loyalty in public rituals <I>and</I> pursuing
apolitical leisure activities in the niches of private life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

Contrary to the regime's rhetoric of political coordination and total
mobilization, the Third Reich not only promised new career opportunities
but also new tactics of diversion and commodity consumption. Apart
from short periods of political euphoria, the allure of racing cars,
radios, Coca-Cola, swing, and Hollywood-style comedies--rather than the
choreography of Riefenstahl's spectacles--provided the stuff dreams were
made of. Instead of bracketing Nazi mass culture as kitschy or trivial,
we need to face and think through the fact that the popular, as Eric
Rentschler argues, "played a prominent and ubiquitous role in everyday
life, in cinemas, radio programs, dance halls, advertisements, tourist
offerings, and the latest consumer items."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Very well aware of the fact that over-politicization might quickly
lead to apathy, the Nazi government endorsed seemingly unpolitical
spaces of private commodity consumption so as to reinforce political
conformity. At variance with the strict demands of ideological
correctness, American-style consumerism in Nazi society delineated an
ideal stage for what Theodor W. Adorno in his analysis of American mass
culture considered pseudo-individualization--the "halo of free choice" on
the basis of standardization itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Unlike the homogenizing
rituals on the Nuremberg rally grounds, the commodity spectacles of
Nazi mass culture entertained the individual with the utopian illusion
that certain spaces remained beyond control, beyond politics, beyond
the effects of coordination. By satisfying the popular demand for
material and cultural commodity items, the agents of power were able to
undermine articulations of solidarity that had the capicity to contest
Nazi politics. The cult of private consumption impaired alternative
definitions of German identity and solidarity coupled to notions of
individual autonomy and emancipation. While hoping to remake the Third
Reich as a national family, the Nazi culture industry domesticated
un-German sights and sounds in order to set individuals apart against
one another and thus to produce lonely crowds.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 It allowed
for private consumption, but only to deflect the formation of counter
publics, to arrest and rechannel the popular's "ineradicable drive
towards collectivity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's famous catchphrase of fascism as the aestheticization of
politics has often led to definitions of Nazi aesthetics which are
formulated exclusively in terms of Leni Riefenstahl's mass rituals or
Albert Speer's architectural appeals to timeless dignity and monumental
symmetry. Benjamin, we should recall, argues that fascist aestheticization
describes a form of domination by means of which a post-liberal

<B></B>

state
symbolically hopes to settle social and economic struggles while it
simultaneously promotes the charismatic image of strong and unified
political action.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The fascist assault on the procedural
complexity and normative substance of twentieth-century politics coincides
with a peculiar way of tapping the dialectics of modern culture and
mechanical reproduction. Aesthetic conrations in fascism reckon
with distinctly modern structures of experience: the masses' hunger for
distraction and scopic pleasure. More precisely, it is by recycling within
the boundaries of postauratic culture the affective registers of auratic
art that fascism hopes to recenter the workings of a differentiated,
secularized, and bureaucratic state and to give political operations
the reenchanted look of willful and resolute action. Under facism, the
aesthetic is charged with the task of emancipating the public image of
political decision-making from the putatively emasculating effects of
self-sufficient economic, military, or administrative imperatives.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet we misunderstand Benjamin's argument if we consider fascist
aestheticization simply as a shrewd strategy of wrapping alluring
veneers around bad realities. While the function of the aesthetic in
fascism clearly halts a revolutionary turn of society and abets the
further diffusion of political power into increasingly independent
and competing but fascist agencies of domination, at the same time
it actively reshapes individual and collective modes of reception and
channels disparate hopes for charismatic redemption into the uniform
gestalt of collective mobilization. Fascism gives expression to the
seeds of utopian desires. It appropriates certain properties of social
and cultural modernity in order to reconstruct the modern state as a
phantasmagoria of power and community, as a shifting series of deceptive
appearances that change the very parameters according to which people
perceive the real. By doing so in effect it changes reality itself. The
aesthetic moment in fascism does not just target the preservation of
past dependencies. Instead it reconres existing social spaces and
perceptions in a way that both preres and culminates in warfare, for
imperial warfare presents fascism's ultimate answer to the pathological
elements inherent in the dialectics of capitalist modernization. The
fascist spectacle pictures violence and warfare as the climax of an
alternative modernity, one in which selective components of social,
cultural, and technological modernization eclipse the normative substance
of political modernity, i.e., any reasonable claim for equality, justice,
freedom, and any concomitant acts of recognition across existing lines
of ethnic, social, or gender difference.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Contrary to some of Benjamin's premises, recent scholarship on everyday
practices under Nazi rule suggests that to think of the Nazi spectacle
solely as a technology of seamless unification misses the point. In effect
the Nazis followed two different but overlapping strategies. In their
pursuit of a homogenous community of the folk, the Nazis made numerous
concessions to the popular demand for the warmth of private life and
pleasure in a modern media society, even when such concessions, as David
Bathrick has argued, often "left the government caught in ludicrous
forms of self-redress and strategic withdrawal before the commodity
fetish."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 But simultaneously the Nazi government clearly
hoped that the depoliticized practices of cultural

<B></B>

consumption
could be aligned with their larger political agendas. In this view,
the spectacle of modern consumer culture would break the bonds of old
solidarities and prepare the atomized individual for the auratic shapes
of mass politics, for mass rituals that promised a utopian unification
of modern culture. Nazi cultural politics and spectacle, in other words,
relied on both at once, on the charismatic power of public mass events
and the lures of privatized consumption, on the mass-mediated staging
of political rituals as much as on the appeals of an American-style
leisure culture, on total mobilization as much as on the atomizing
pleasures of imaginary escape. Guy Debord's famous aphorism holds true
of Nazi society as well: "The spectacle is nothing more than the common
language of this separation. What binds the spectators together is no
more than an irreversible relation at the very center which maintains
their isolation. The spectacle reunites the separate, but reunites it
<I>as separate</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To the extent to which it brings into focus the relative heterogeneity
of politically domesticated pleasures in Nazi Germany, more recent
historical research asks us to rethink a number of aspects of Benjamin's
aestheticization thesis. Benjamin's theory is helpful to explicate the
unifying powers of the Nazi spectacle, but it seems to ignore cultural
technologies of atomization as well as the nexus of domination and private
commodity consumption during the National Socialist period. Explaining
fascist aesthetics as a monolithic space of false reconciliation, as
a postauratic renewal of aura, Benjamin did not yet address the ways
in which mass culture and the popular in Nazi Germany openly avowed
postauratic diversions, shaped new attitudes toward beauty and pleasure,
and in so doing provided a government willing to permit ideologically
incorrect distractions with diffuse loyalty.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Furthermore, in spite of Benjamin's emphatic notion of individual
and collective experience, what remained absent in his analysis of
fascist aestheticization is any sense of how Hitler's subjects explored
the landscapes of political culture and transformed them into their
life-scapes. While it would be foolish to tax Benjamin's fragmentary
remarks on fascism with all of these omissions, it is equally important to
understand that Benjamin--confined to the condition of exile--primarily
deciphered the politics of fascist culture from "above." With highly
limited data at his disposal, he was unable to examine in further detail
how Hitler's subjects inhabited both the political spectacle and the
symbolic materials of a modern leisure and media society in order to
take position and construct their identities, however precarious and
inconsistent.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet to point with historical hindsight towards some of these blind spots
in Benjamin's critique of German National Socialism and Italian fascism is
to consider, mistakenly, the epilogue of Benjamin's 1935/36 artwork essay
as his last word about the aestheticization of politics. As I will argue
in the following pages, Benjamin's unfinished <I>Arcades Project</I> in
fact provides an intriguing framework in order to theorize the nexus of
domination <I>and</I> commodity consumption, power <I>and</I> leisure,
homogenization <I>and</I> fragmentation, and thus may help supplement
what seems strangely absent in the artwork essay. In order to probe
the compatibility of

<B></B>

Benjamin's aestheticization thesis with the
results of contemporary research, this essay shall reconsider Benjamin's
notion of aestheticization in light of the <I>Arcades Project</I> so as to
emphasize the role of private consumption under fascism, of <I>spectacular
atomization rather than all-inclusive coordination</I>. According
to this expanded version of Benjamin's aestheticization thesis,
fascism constitutes a phase of capitalist modernization in which the
political dimension itself becomes a market item, a target of the
kind of commodification and mass consumption Benjamin so intriguingly
analyzed in the <I>Arcades Project</I>. As it embraces the mechanisms
of an American-style culture industry, fascism not only accelerates
the fragmentation of traditional environments, it also grafts onto acts
of political representation the logic of nineteenth century commodity
fetishism. Politics, I conclude, becomes aesthetic in fascism because
fascism explicitly utilizes the charismatic promise of Great Politics
into a viable consumer good, a carefully designed and marketed product
that appeals to dormant desires of modern consumers and window shoppers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Peter Labanyi has argued that Nazism--as a highly incoherent political
ideology--relied on advanced marketing strategies to sell itself as "a
multi-purpose ideological commodity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 It put principles of
modern advertising in the service of the production of mass loyalty and
political consumer satisfaction. It was only because Nazism managed to
package itself as offering something to everyone that it was able to gain
mass support. German fascism confiscated the aesthetic dimension, the
domains of pleasure, desire, and representation, in order to massage
the masses and bridge the gap between ideological use-values and
exchange-values, between real and imaginary needs. Circulated as one of
many other objects of popular desire, the politics of fascism should
thus ultimately be understood as a form of commodity aesthetics: "An
ideological product--the F&uuml;hrer, folk community, or whatever--is
supplied with a brand name and a trade-mark--the swastika--and a
product-image is carefully designed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reread in light of the <I>Arcades Project</I>, Benjamin's aestheticization
thesis helps elucidate this broader understanding of the Nazi interfaces
between power, pleasure, and the popular. It allows us to interpret
fascism as the incorporation of militant and ultranationalist agendas
into the operations of a modern culture industry, and to define fascist
aesthetics as a historically unique endeavor of breaking older bonds of
solidarity while simultaneously rendering modern consumerism, including
the consumption of charismatic politics, a privileged ticket to national
rebirth.

Ever since the 1930s German intellectuals have mostly seen the role of
National Socialist ideology as a substitute for authentic meaning. Nazi
ideology, according to this view, fabricated fake dreams in the service of
disabling a critical understanding of social realities; it disseminated
powerful delusions that sweetened domination. But National Socialist
ideology, as Michael Geyer has argued correctly, did not simply aim at
a change of discourse or a remaking of symbolic expression. Rather,
its

<B></B>

specific character consisted in what might be understood as
its progressive concreteness. "This is what the German intelligentsia
disliked about it. It was not words, symbols, and discourses. Ideology
was contained in the material practice of politics in the Third Reich. In
fact, it increasingly became politics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 National Socialist
ideology was not dedicated merely to transring social realities;
it radically altered and restructured existing social relations. If
National Socialism was able to muster mass support, it did so mostly
because it responded to real needs and desires, because it understood how
to build individual wish fantasies and diffuse utopias into the material
architectures of public and private life. Not only sex, romance, glamor
or exotic lures, but the political itself became the stuff of the popular
imagination. Ideological politics provided the masses with the powerful
experience of a new national family, yet at the same time--in pursuing its
core agendas--it "broke families apart, alienated young women from older
ones, children from parents, and reshaped the relation between men and
women--as far as it could. It poisoned the life in villages and houses,
broke apart friendships and associates."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 To the extent
that it rebuilt reality as dream (and nightmare), ideological politics
in Nazi Germany became an exercise in a kind of radical materialism:
it changed the world by reinterpreting it. National Socialist ideology
"spoke" to sentient bodies rather than minds. Reckoning with the people's
mimetic faculty--their ability to imitate the other, to bridge rather
than collapse differences between subject and object, and to produce
resemblances; their desire to connect with or be transformed by the
other so as to develop sympathetic, noncoercive relationships between
nonidentical particulars-- Nazi cultural politics engineered emotions
and domesticated perception in order to recast the nation's political
body.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's nineteenth century Paris--the capital of high
capitalism--anticipates the cunning ways in which Nazi politics
embodied ideology in plastic forms. As a heaven of consumption,
fashion, and conspicuous luxury, the Paris of the <I>Arcades
Project</I> signifies a modern-day Babylon where people--unable to
structure their social relationships--happily surrender to the magic of
objects-turned-commodities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Like Nazi Germany, Benjamin's
Paris is a dreamed one: everyday phenomena bear the signatures of
collective wish fantasies and age-old utopias. As they constitute
themselves as modern masses in front of the spectacular displays of new
department stores, shopping arcades, and world fairs, customers and window
shoppers find ancient myths embodied in the very gestalt of the latest
lures and inventions. Just as importantly, however, nineteenth century
commodity culture also preres the logic of fragmentation that is at
the core of Nazi ideological politics. The progressive commodification
of objects and human relationships makes Paris into a latter-day
Babel. The commodity form destroys traditional notions of unity and
organic totality; it devalues objects and meanings, strikes experience
with a shock of petrification, and thus separates from one another the
speechless individuals of the crowd. Far from solely yielding a totalizing
spectacle of frenzied but coordinated mass desires, nineteenth century
commodity culture recycles the allegorical regimes of the seventeenth
century, including the Baroque's melancholia, forlornness, and mortifying
secularization:

<B></B>

"The emblems recur as commodities."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

"The devaluation of the world of objects in allegory is outdone within
the world of objects itself by the commodity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These strange and subterraneous links between high capitalism and
National Socialism on the one hand, and between the seventeenth and the
nineteenth century on the other, between allegory, commodity form, and
social fragmentation, clearly beg for further explanation as Benjamin
seems to amalgamate his no doubt unconventional reading of Marx with his
no less idiosyncratic Baroque studies of the 1920s. Babel and Babylon
alike, nineteenth century commodity culture--so much seems clear at the
outset--casts into embodied form what in the context of Benjamin's earlier
Baroque studies was understood as reflex and refraction of a melancholic
gaze, as a re of the poet's artistic inventory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Far
from simply rejecting nineteenth-century commodification and reification,
Benjamin embraces it as part of the progressive deauraticization of the
world. The emergence of the commodity form represents a historical phase
in which objects are yanked out of their habitual contexts and delivered
to the demands of distracted consumers. Like seventeenth century allegory
or twentieth century montage cinema, the commodity destroys both the
representation and the experience of organic totality and meaningful
unity. It shatters an object's aura, transforms the world of objects
into a petrified landscape that may cater to the specifically modern
urge to get hold of objects at very close range. Nineteenth-century
capitalist modernization, therefore, administers within the sphere of
economic production what mechanical reproducibility does to cultural
artifacts: it obliterates an object's here and now by transforming this
object into a commodity wandering across traditional boundaries between
private and public spaces, the local and the global; it empowers the human
collective to appropriate things according to their always peculiar needs,
desires, and experiences. In contrast to the falsifying transration of
classical symbolism and auratic art, the commodity potentially undermines
any cult of beauty and rative transcendence as it extinguishes all
appearances of harmonious, timeless perfection. The commodity form is
both vehicle and expression of the disintegrated character of modern
life. It bears testimony to the fundamental untruth of a society struck
by the logic of alienation and fragmentation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And yet this testimony is far from complete or successful, for capitalism
is at pains to mask the very fact that objects are commodities. Capitalism
hides what is allegorical about the commodity form under the veil of
spectacular displays and symbolic arrangements. It grafts onto the
commodity's postauratic character the autographs of auratic art. "Ever
more callously," Benjamin argues, "the object world of man assumes
the expression of the commodity. At the same time advertising seeks
to veil the commodity character of things . . . This attempt has its
equivalent in the simultaneous attempt of the bourgeoisie to personify the
commodity (<I>vermenschichen</I>): to give the commodity, like a person,
housing. This then was the promise of the <I>etuis</I> (small box), the
covers, the sheaths with which the bourgeois household effects of the time
were being covered."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Nineteenth-century capitalism cannot
admit its own truth. It recodes the petrified outlook of commodities as
phantasmagorias, as animated, self-sustaining entities. It glorifies
the exhibition values of marketable goods

<B></B>

in order to undermine
their allegorical thrust, their potential to introduce a new chapter
within the development of the human senses and the relation of the human
collective to the world of objects. Nineteenth-century capitalism, in
sum, sells allegories as symbols, disempowerment as empowerment, and in
so doing it cunningly engenders a state of fragmentation underneath a
magic label of unified meaning and symbolic totality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's remarks about the enigmas of the commodity form have
continuously provided material for heated discussions. Not surprisingly,
the question as to the relation between Benjamin's critique of capitalism
and Marx's notion of commodity fetishism, between Benjamin's and Marx's
different conceptions of use value and exchange value, has red
prominently in these debates. In the final analysis, however, as
Heinz-Dieter Kittsteiner rightly argues, Benjamin's assumptions about
the extinction of use values and the concomitant concealment of the
commodity form in high capitalism has very little to do with Marx. Unlike
Benjamin, Marx "never simply extinguished 'use value'; rather, he always,
and for good reason, held fast to the unity of use value and exchange
value."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 From the perspective of a classical Marxist,
Benjamin's postulates about the commodity form and the eclipse of use
value remain undialectical: "To the extent that such allusions appear
in Benjamin, they are based not on a well-grounded knowledge of Marx
but on the widespread schematics of a rather conservative critique of
civilization which became amalgamated in the 1920s and 1930s with the
position of the 'Left.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Be that as it may, rather than once
again pondering the authenticity of Benjamin's Marxism, it will prove
much more fruitful to follow the links Benjamin's work indicates between
the aborted allegories of capitalist modernization and the emergence
of what one might call with Andreas Huyssen the great divide of modern
culture, the split between the commodified realms of mass culture and
diversion on the one hand and the terrains of enigmatic modernism on
the other.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's phantasmagorias of capitalist modernization provide
the cultural material around which the modern mass constitutes and
experiences itself as mass: "With the establishment of the department
stores, consumers began for the first time in history to feel like
a mass. (Previously, only privation had taught them to feel this
way.) Thus the circus-like or exhibitory aspect of trade increased to a
quite extraordinary extent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 What Benjamin understands as
the glorification of exchange values in capitalism coincides with the
emergence of cultural practices that are deeply enmeshed in commodity
consumption and industrial standardization, practices which no longer
have anything in common with older forms of popular or folk art. Popular
culture in the strict sense originated as the quasi-organic expression of
distinct social communities. Existing in the plural alone, it reflected
the always particular and contingent values, traditions, institutions, and
lifeworlds of well-defined social bodies. As remystified disenchantment,
Benjamin's fetishized commodities, by way of contrast, appeal to each and
every cultural constituency regardless of their social and historical
specificity. Nineteenth century capitalism, on the one hand, atomizes
traditional communities and lifeworlds into isolated private individuals
and

<B></B>

market competitors. On the other hand, however, it wraps
commodities into a magic aura in order to appeal to archaic utopias
of homogenous meaning and collectivity amidst the heteronomy of the
market. Phantasmagorias embody collective wish and power fantasies. They
soothe the minds of lonely crowds while entertaining the amorphous mass
with the illusion that meaningful experiences are still possible in
spite of the fragmenting force of capitalist modernization. Instead
of understanding Benjamin's phantasmagorias solely in terms of
manipulation, diversion, or degradation, as empty distraction or mere
false consciousness, we must therefore conceive of them as predecessors
of the works of twentieth-century mass culture: as transformational
works on social anxieties and political fantasies that--in Fredric
Jameson's words--"have as their underlying impulse--albeit in what is
often distorted and repressed unconscious form--our deepest fantasies
about the nature of social life, both as we live now, and as we feel in
our bones it ought rather to be lived."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Nineteenth-century
phantasmagorias, like the products of the twentieth-century culture
industries, entertain relations of repression with fundamental anxieties,
concerns, and hopes, even if in most cases such fissures are resolved
into imaginary resolutions and illusions of existing social harmony. As it
conceals the allegorical thrust and reason of the commodity form, modern
consumer society engenders modes of mass cultural entertainment in which
repression and wish-fulfillment, fantasy and symbolic containment, join
together in the unity of a single mechanism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If nineteenth-century commodity capitalism, by simultaneously producing
and concealing allegorical experiences, designates the origin
of modern mass culture, it is at same time also the hidden force
behind the emergence of aesthetic modernism in the works of Charles
Baudelaire. Baudelaire revalorizes the Baroque's allegorical gaze--the
"armature of the modern"--because it allows him to outfetishize the
fetishes of consumer capitalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 "The allegorical mode of
seeing which shaped style in the 17th Century no longer did so in the
19th. Baudelaire was isolated; as an allegorist his isolation was in
certain respects that of a straggler."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 With the help of
allegory, Baudelaire lays bare the allegorical reason behind the shining
wrappers of commodity displays. He makes the commodity's synthetic
aura the object of allegorical devaluation, and reveals the commodity
as commodity, reveals what is allegorical about the commodity form
itself. Writing poetry for an age no longer concentrated enough to read
poetry, Baudelaire's modernism responds to similar experiences, anxieties,
and concerns that structure the outlook of the nineteenth-century popular
dimension. In contrast to mass culture's imaginary resolutions, however,
Baudelaire invents compensatory structures that are meant to speak the
truth about the commodity and work through the loss of organic totality
under the reign of capitalist modernization. Baudelaire's aesthetic
modernism is modern mass culture's other side. Both emerge against the
background of one and the same condition, namely capitalism's need to
conceal the allegorical thrust of the commodity form, but both suggest
mutually exclusive strategies of translating the experience of modernity
into symbolic expressions. Whereas industrial mass culture casts anxiety
into exhilarating fantasies of harmony, Baudelaire's modernism maps
modern life as fundamentally

<B></B>

fragmented and petrified and, in so
doing, uncovers the melancholy, boredom, and isolation that prevails
behind the scenes of enthused consumerism. Deeply connected to the
poet's allegorical intention, Baudelaire's spleen "is that feeling which
corresponds to catastrophe in permanence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But what, then, does Nazi aestheticization and consumer culture have to
do with Baudelaire's modernism, the allegory of the commodity form, and
the dialectics of modernism and mass culture? How does fascism inherit
what Benjamin considers the legacy of the nineteenth century?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to answer these questions, let me recapitulate the argument
thus far. Benjamin suggests that the formation of the modern masses
vis-&agrave;-vis nineteenth-century commodity fetishism not only
coincides with a progressive mechanism of atomization and privatization,
it also results in the division of modern culture into two dialectically
opposed tracks of cultural and aesthetic modernization: high modernism and
popular mass diversion. High modernism articulates what is glossed over in
commodified mass culture; it reminds us of the despair and fragmentation
that is at the bottom of the experience of capitalist modernity. Adorno
and Horkheimer, in their seminal analysis of industrial culture, believed
that the American culture industry sought to paper over the peculiar
dialectics of modern culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Hollywood during the classical
studio era did not eclipse Schoenberg or Beckett, but it tried to adorn
mass cultural products with the charm of autonomous art and thus forge
into a false and ruthless unity what no longer could add up to a whole. If
we continue Benjamin's unfinished line of argumentation, we will come to
the conclusion that Nazi culture in fact itself by far outdid Hollywood's
technologies of power not only in its mass spectacles at Nuremberg, but
also in the context of its own American-style culture industry. National
Socialism curtailed the expressive registers of aesthetic modernism and
autonomous art, while it at the same time--domesticating the popular
imagination--sought to engender mass culture from above, to ensure
something was provided for all and that none could escape.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Benjamin calls the aestheticization of politics, then, signifies
fascism's peculiar way of resolving the antinomies of modern culture. Not
only did German fascism reckon with the fact that a full-fledged
politicization of public life would render this empty and provoke the
retreat into non-political apathy. Nazi Germany in fact transformed the
political itself into an item of mass consumption, a commodity concealing
its status as a commodity (and allegory), a symbolic spectacle meant to
produce lonely crowds and unite the masses as separate. Detlev Peuckert
has argued that even the regime's own symbols such as the Wireless
Set and the Volkswagen "served in practice to promote individualism in
leisure and transport, albeit in the standardised form determined by the
needs of mass consumption in a modern industrial society."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

Understood in light of Benjamin's account of modern consumer capitalism,
such strategies of aestheticization--far from simply signifying seductive
mechanisms of social homogenization--must be conceptualized as techniques
of power that sought to confiscate the popular imagination within the
domains of a homemade culture industry in order to unbind traditional
bonds of solidarity, to engender isolation,

<B></B>

to entertain relations
of repressions with fundamental anxieties and utopias, and to provide
compensatory structures of symbolic integration. Though Benjamin himself
did not explicitly fuse his remarks about commodity capitalism with his
theory of fascism, his work suggests that perhaps not Hollywood, which
even during the studio era was much more heterogenous than Adorno and
Horkheimer believed, but the union of politics and commodity consumption
in Nazi Germany was the most pertinent historical manifestation of the
system of the culture industry as well as its various mechanisms of
producing loneliness and mass consent through pseudo-individualization.

"The purpose of the Fascist formula, the ritual discipline, the uniforms,
and the whole apparatus, which is at first sight irrational, is to allow
mimetic behavior. The carefully thought out symbols (which are proper
to every counterrevolutionary movement), the skulls and disguises, the
barbaric drum beats, the monotonous repetitions of words and gestures,
are simply the organized imitation of magic practices, the mimesis of
mimesis."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 According to Benjamin's confreres Adorno and
Horkheimer, fascist aestheticization mimics mimetic behavior because
fascism wants to enlist a rebellion against domination as a useful tool
of domination itself. Fascism opens up symbolic spaces in which suppressed
nature--sentience, spontaneity, and the desire to imitate and connect with
the other--may articulate itself only to succumb even more effectively to
the mechanisms of disciplining and suppression. Benjamin's valorization
of allegory as an armature of modernity results from his hope not to do
away with the magic of mimesis altogether but to find antidotes to this
political organization and manipulation of "primitivist" residues. In
Benjamin's view, allegory undercuts the possibility of seizing nature
and what seems forbidden or repressed in actual life for projects of
domination. Anti-mimetic in character, allegory allows us to experience
the world as one in which the realms of nature and of human affairs are
radically separate. As a discontinuous structure of representation,
allegory sharpens our awareness for the constructedness of meanings,
institutions, and values; it disrupts symbolic totalizations within
the public sphere that try to imitate and organize mimetic urges, to
naturalize meaning and history, and thus to engage in a fateful mimesis
of mimesis.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's theory about the imbrication of allegory and commodity form
urges us to reconsider what for many contemporary scholars marks the
striking gap between ideology and practice during the Nazi period. Read
in light of the <I>Arcades Project</I>, Benjamin's remarks about the
aestheticization of politics in fascism suggest that the spectacular
stage-managing of Nazi ideology and the vicissitudes of Nazi leisure
culture form the verso and recto of the same sign of capitalist
modernization. Instead of seeing Riefenstahl's political choreography
and Nazi consumerism as signs of a split consciousness of Nazi society,
Benjamin's formula of aestheticization emphasizes

<B></B>

that both aspects
are implicated in larger processes of commodification, processes which
increasingly render consumerism the primary tool and ideology of social
integration. The public spectacle and the cult of private consumption
alike eclipse what is potentially emancipatory about the deauraticization
and disenchantment of the world in modernity. Both result in a regressive
mimesis of mimesis. Both remystify and retotalize the world while turning
individuals into atomized consumers and pleasure-seeking monads.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What makes fascism so abominable, then, is the fact that it aspired
to subsume everything under the logic of a modern culture industry,
hoping to crush the emancipatory substance of modern life through modern
technologies themselves. Fascism constituted a dictatorship <I>over</I>

 Through
styling, packaging, and advertising, Nazi power invested its products--its

fascism as that final state of capitalism in which the political itself

 Under the condition of fascism even the politician
needs to go to the market, not simply in order to find customers but in
order to sell himself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ian Kershaw has demonstrated the extent to which this logic of Nazi
commodity aesthetics was projected even onto the person of Adolf Hitler
himself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Often at odds with the rising disdain for the
Nazi party, Hitler's popularity particularly during the prewar years
resulted mostly from a masterly achievement of image building. The
making of Hitler skillfully catered to anxieties, desires, and values
which "conditioned the acceptance of a 'Superman' image of political
leadership."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Constantly refashioned according to the
shifting needs and fortunes of the Nazi movement and state, Hitler's
image was to promote the highly desirable commodity of autonomous
politics. It was mass circulated as panacea for diffuse hopes to
recenter the state, to reassert the sovereignty of the political
vis-&agrave;-vis the progressive pluralization of power in modernity,
and to replace the putatively effeminate structures of procedural
politics with masculine action. Accordingly, Hitler was stylized into
a symbol of the nation. Goebbels's ministry of illusion manufactured
Hitler into a ruthless, resolute, and uncompromising yet simultaneously
self-sacrificial, modest, and righteous individual in whose appearance
the people and the nation could find their identity. Hitler's star persona
incarnated a triumph of Germanic male virtues over the feminized order of
the Weimar period and its parliamentary system. Similar to the dreams of
nineteenth century political romanticism, Nazi propaganda marketed Hitler
as a site at which the existential affairs of the German nation and its
individuals were at stake.

<B></B>

But unlike the romantic theory of the
state, the body of the leader was not solely designed for the purpose of
giving a metaphorical expression to transcendental values, for making
the unspeakable visible.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Instead, though Nazi propaganda
advertised Hitler as an extraordinary intervention into the weary domains
of everyday routines, it at the same time surrounded his appearance with
a pathos of human, "earthly" qualities. The remarkable catalogue of human
virtues--Hitler's toughness, severity, determination, loneliness, sadness,
and care for the nation--"was set alongside the political genius of the
F&uuml;hrer as a human counterpart to the image of the lofty, distant
statesman. It amounted to almost a mirror of contemporary bourgeois
values--characteristics with which almost everyone could find some
point of association."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Making Hitler human by packaging the
commodity into an affective coat, Nazi politics and mass culture sought
to ensure that something was provided for everyone's peculiar needs.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Once established as a mass cultural icon, the image of Hitler catered to
popular desires for a strong and uncompromising state authority, for a
ruthless reconstruction and preservation of law and order. Hitler's star
image suggested the posture of a magnetic leader resolutely upholding
the autonomy of the political and in fact advancing resoluteness to
the primary value of political action. With the Hitler myth as its
flagship, Nazi politics was dressed as a realm in which--in Alfred
Baeumler's words--"action means 'setting off in a direction,' 'taking
sides,' by virtue of a mandate of destiny, by virtue of 'one's own
right.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Increasingly isolating Hitler from the growing
unpopularity of the Nazi party, the Hitler myth thus packaged the
F&uuml;hrer as the prime creator and architect of national reassertion
and economic recovery: a leader who was remorselessly devoted to act
against the nation's inner and outer enemies; a military genius who
outwitted the foe with brilliant strategies; a humble servant of the
folk putting aside all particular, material, and private interest for
the sake of the nation--in sum, an alluring alternative to the allegedly
monotonous, sterile, self-centered, and unsensual routines of procedural
politics and liberal-democratic will-formation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It has often been noted that, in couching Hitler's persona in an aura of
heroic leadership and political redemption, Nazi propaganda established
Hitler as a representative of what Max Weber only a few decades earlier
had theorized under the rubric of charismatic authority. Charisma
in Weber's conceptual framework denoted the aura of self-appointed
leaders who appeal to their followers by virtue of their "supernatural,
superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

Charisma, literally meaning the "gift of grace," interrupts the profane
continuum of history; it discontinues exhausted value orders and habitual
modes of thinking, fleshes out pristine semantic reference points, infuses
fresh meaning and vitality into history, and thus restores authentic
creativity, sensual pleasure, and intellectual integrity. According to
Weber, charismatic authority results as much from the actual qualities
of a political leader as from the peculiar ways in which his followers
perceive his performance. Charisma is a social product.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>

Like Benjamin's category of aura, Weber's charisma describes a relation
of subject and object, a mode of experience rather than an empirical
fact.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nazi propaganda elevated charisma to Hitler's universally recognizable
trade-mark. It advertised charismatic experiences as the most captivating
appeal of the product "Hitler." To the extent to which the Nazi movement
lost momentum, the Nazi culture industry was therefore forced ever-more
aggressively to fend off what--according to Weber--constitutes the
dialectics of charismatic authority: charisma's ineluctable routinization
and self-consumption. In order to warrant Hitler's aura of exceptionality,
mass cultural representations progressively severed Hitler's persona
from reality and the orders of the day. Ironically, however, the myth of
Hitler thus experienced a curious return of the repressed: the spiraling
idolization removed him from any possible enactment of what his image was
meant to promote, namely existential resolution and manly action. Like
the Hollywood star cult, the Hitler myth instead "surrounded Hitler
with toadies, flatterers, and sycophants, shielding him from rational
criticism and genuine debate, and bolstered increasing detachment from
reality . . . His own person gradually became inseparable from the
myth."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hitler's charisma and the popularity of the Hitler myth was surely
by no means complete or unified. Hitler's image required continuous
realignment in order to maintain its impact on a progressively
disillusioned population. But what is striking are the parallels
between the making of Hitler into a multi-purpose vehicle of symbolic
integration on the one hand, and Benjamin's analysis of the integrative
appeal and power of commodity fetishism on the other. Benjamin invites
us to understand the fabrication of the Hitler myth as the most
extreme chapter within modernity's transmogrification of commodities
into phantasmagorias. Accordingly, fascism surrounded its ideological
good, namely autonomous politics and the promise of a resolute rebirth
of the nation, with the affective wrapping "Hitler," thereby hoping
to appeal to diverse consumer desires and to constitute the masses as
masses. Pumping Hitler's far from monosemic image through the circuits of
a state-controlled culture industry, fascism furthermore constantly tried
to humanize and sentimentalize its ideological commodity, transform it
into a spectacular symbol of national and individual rejuvenation, and
thus eclipse the supreme commodity's commodity form. "Hitler," then,
like the texts of modern mass culture, was a transformational work on
social anxieties and diffuse utopias of successful collectivity. His
image allowed for a playing out of fantasies as much as for their
symbolic containment. To understand Hitler solely as an agent of
ideological mobilization and mass politicization therefore would
clearly underestimate his role and effectiveness. Understood as a
multi-valent object of consumption, "Hitler" inhabited a key position
within the popular imagination. Like the Hollywood movie star,
the image of the F&uuml;hrer represented "the focal point at which
identical reactions of countless citizens intersect." Hitler was a
function of the Nazi propaganda machine, "not so much a father-re
as a collective and overexaggerated projection of the powerless ego of
each individual."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 In conjunction with countless other and
often conspicuously unpolitical products delivered by the Nazi leisure
industry, the charismatic commodity "Hitler" helped atomize consumers
into self-entertaining monads while simultaneously elevating consumerism
to the most effective engine of mass loyalty and social integration. Nazi

<B></B>

aesthetics designed "Hitler" as a cultural icon that could be read
and appropriated in many ways. Similar to the standardized texts and
objects of modern mass culture, the unique brand-name "Hitler" appealed
to diverse needs, desires, and wish-fantasies; its success resulted from
the fact that consumers were able to incorporate the fetish "Hitler" in
far from univocal ways into the realm of everyday practices.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Contemporary cultural criticism, informed by the work of British
culturalists, is quick to assign subversive meanings to such heterogenous
appropriations of mass cultural symbols. Polemically challenging older
accounts of the culture industry as a crucible of conformity, this new
generation of cultural critics emphasizes how the consumers of mass
culture creatively reshape popular artifacts and images according to
their own needs. John Fiske does not hesitate to understand the mass
cultural consumer and reader as a "poacher, encroaching on the terrain
of the cultural landowner (or textowner) and 'stealing' what he or
she wants without being caught and subjected to the laws of the land
(rule of the text)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Nazi mass culture and the fetishism
surrounding the commodity of resolute politics reveal some crucial blind
spots built into such positive notions of cultural poaching. For, as I
argue, Nazi Germany clearly anticipated what contemporary audiences might
have seen and today's revisionists celebrate as enactments of plurality
and resistance. A counterpart to a highly politicized public sphere, the
Nazi culture industry and its circuits of commodity consumption reckoned
with cultural poachers. Whether it delivered Volkswagen, Hollywood-style
comedies, or the image of Hitler, Nazi mass culture invited people to
appropriate according to desire, to consume the illusion that within
Nazi Germany certain spaces could remain free of politics and ideological
imperatives. It enticed poachers to poach and provided local sources of
individualization and empowerment, only to strengthen--to extend Fiske's
metaphor--the laws that regulated the distribution of land outside the
distraction factories. The cultural poachers of the Nazi era transformed
cultural poaching into a pleasurable experience of consumption itself,
a commodity. Instead of consuming illegitimate meanings, they ended up
being consumed by the very objects of their pleasure.

Realigned, then, in light of both recent research on Nazi everyday culture
and Benjamin's own studies of modern consumer capitalism, Benjamin's
aestheticization thesis reads quite differently compared to what
generations of Benjamin scholars have suggested. Neither does Benjamin's
catchword of fascist aestheticization simply signify the ornamentalization
of the masses &agrave; la Riefenstahl, i.e., a choreography of public
life meant to provide phony scenarios of affective integration within a
highly conflict-ridden society. Nor does it solely denote a quasi-Romantic
reduction of procedural politics to aspects of sensual perception, to
a stimulation of the imagination, to sights and sounds that discipline
the masses' desire for distraction. Rather, Benjamin defines fascism as
a catastrophic phase of capitalist modernization in which the logic of
political action and representation themselves become subsumed

<B></B>

under
the laws of commodification and commodity fetishism. Fascism aestheticizes
politics because it transforms its ideological core--the promise of a
strong, autonomous, and resolute state--into an eminently marketable
object of mass consumption, a multi-purpose commodity circulated by a
peculiarly modern and Fordist culture industry.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's expanded formula has the advantage of calling into question
popular myths of Hitler's Germany as a fully coordinated spectacle
of seduction and manipulation. Addressing the conflicting vectors of
public and private, homogenization and atomization, Benjamin underlines
how the role of the aesthetic under fascism was not simply to offer
symbolic placentas, deceive the masses, and freeze possible unrest, but
rather that it was a sinister means of resolving in a unique fashion the
dialectics of modern culture. Aesthetic politics shaped fundamentally
new social realities, it reconstructed the nation through imperial and
genocidal warfare.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But in understanding fascist aestheticization in the above terms as an
integral step within a process of capitalist modernization that links
the Wilhelminian Reich, the Weimar Republic, the Third Reich, and in
fact postwar Germany, the Benjaminian concept also seems to support
a normalizing or even trivializing view of the National Socialist
period. While it may appear already perverse to interpret Hitler's role
in recourse to a larger theory of commodity fetishism, it may be seen
as even more troublesome to reconstruct arenas of (consumer) agency and
multiplicity in Nazi everyday culture and to understand fascism as only
one among several paths of social modernization. How modern, then, we
should ask ourselves, is Nazi consumer culture, and in what ways does
fascism's modernity compromise the entire project of modernity? To what
degree does the expanded notion of fascist aestheticization propose a
universalizing model which levels necessary historical distinctions and
substantive meanings? And how can we argue with or beyond Benjamin for
an interpretation of fascist aestheticization in the above sense that
recognizes the historical uniqueness of fascism and resists contemporary
hopes to normalize the most gruesome chapter of German history?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Any attempt to answer these questions constructively requires
a preliminary clarification of what entrenched concepts such as
normalization, historicization, and trivialization actually mean. Products
of the 1986 historians' debate on the one hand
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 and of
post-unification battles over the putative need to repunctuate German
national history on the other, catchwords such as normalization and
historicization have more often clouded than illuminated the task of
contemporary German historiography and the critical recognition of the
legacy of fascism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Launched as a debate over the putative
need to revaluate the meaning of the fascist past and to redefine the
parameters of German national identity, the historians' debate and its
post-unification follow-ups provided a variety of conservative historians
with a platform to reconsider the National Socialist period within the
context of European totalitarianism, i.e., to understand the Holocaust
as one among other comparable expressions of barbarism during the 1930s
and 1940s. For historians related to the so-called Bavaria Project and
dedicated to researching everyday practices during the Third Reich,
the

<B></B>

notion of historicization primarily entailed the suggestion
to subject Nazism to the same methods of scholarly rigor as any other
period--even if it implied that in portraying the patterns of normality
and continuity underneath Nazi barbarism Nazism itself might fade away
from the picture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Although fundamentally different in intent
and nature, both strategies of historicization often resulted in a similar
normalization of the German past, that is to say, in an effort--deliberate
or not--to consolidate things German after unification, to reinterpret
Nazi culture as an integral chapter within the larger narratives of
European modernization, and to excise the memory of Auschwitz from the
inventories of collective identity today.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is important to note that this contemporary drive to reevaluate
the Third Reich and free German nationalism from the shadows of fascism
coincides with belated German struggles over the meaning of postmodernity
and a vociferous critique of the overall project of modernity. Although it
is important to explore patterns of social change that form a continuum
from the Weimar period to the Federal Republic, it is disturbing to see
that scholarly research about the ways in which Nazi culture continued or
even accelerated various trajectories of modernization often serves as a
screen for undifferentiated attacks on the entire modern condition. The
right-wing position of the Berlin historian Rainer Zitelmann, arguing
that Hitler Germany demonstrated "the other, the totalitarian side
of modernity," is a good case in point here.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 While he
rightly draws our attention to the modernizing function of Nazi Germany
within the arenas of technology, mass culture, welfare policy, and
social mobility, Zitelmann at the same time wants to blame all ills of
Nazism on modernity. In order to do so, he categorically purges the
notion of modernity from any reference to the normative substance of
post-Enlightenment politics--the ideas of emancipation, equality, and
justice. Firmly standing on his postmodern vista, Zitelmann vigorously
denies that the concept of modernity should or could include any
consideration of peculiarly modern political achievements such as the
practice of a participatory and constitutional democracy, or the vision
of unconstrained collective will-formation. Rather, what Zitelmann
understands as modernity amounts to a regime of symbolic totalizations,
a theology of progress: modernization aims at an ever-increasing
annihilation of difference and a formal rationalization of power
and social management. It therefore does not come as a surprise that
his analysis of the modernizing functions of Nazism collapses into a
fundamental critique of modernity, one which in many respects repeats the
conceptual pitfalls of Horkheimer and Adorno's universalizing critique
of reason. To the extent to which he renders fascism as one among other
equally possible concretizations of modernity, Zitelmann ends up leveling
all meaningful political distinctions. Arguing with postmodern hindsight
that emancipation, humanity, and democracy can be just as modern as
terror, dictatorship, and inhumanity, Zitelmann resorts to the very kind
of totalization that he denounces as the alleged core of modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Any examination of Nazi aesthetics and everyday practice today must
face the fact that the acts and consequences of Nazi culture have to be
critically integrated into the cultural history and collective memory of
German identity, and above all in their

<B></B>

postunification forms. "The
discrete treatment of Nazi culture as separate from Weimar on the one
hand and postwar culture on the other will no longer do."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>

The decisive challenge, however, is to accomplish this integration of the
Nazi past without trivializing the Holocaust, to critically recognize
the kind of continuities that link the Third Reich to nineteenth- and
twentieth-century developments without normalizing the darkest chapter
of German history. In mapping the question of fascism directly onto
larger debates about the conration of modernity and postmodernity,
Zitelmann simultaneously solicits and undercuts a critical reevaluation
of the modernizing effects of Nazi culture: already safely displaced by
Zitelmann's own regime of postmodern reason, the actual culprit behind
Nazi terror--modernity--emerges as an inhabitant of a galaxy far,
far away.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Detlev Peuckert's calibration of Nazi culture, everyday practices,
and social modernization suggests a much more viable model. For
Peuckert, the normality of cultural practices during the Third Reich,
i.e., what ties fascism to the Weimar or postwar era respectively,
is rooted in a theory of an asymmetrical, pathological, and hence
<I>fundamentally unfinished</I> unfolding of the diverse tracks of
nineteenth- and twentieth-century modernization. Similar to Zitelmann,
Peuckert argues that the modernity of Nazi everyday culture--leisure
activity, private consumption, and nonpolitical pleasure--does not
constitute a counterpoint to the barbarism of Nazism but a framework
within which criminality became possible. Unlike Zitelmann, however,
Peuckert points out that this barbarism was not one normal outcome
of modernization <I>per se</I>, but rather the unique result from a
strategic prioritization of technological, social, and economic over
political, legal, and moral modernity. What links Nazi culture to both
the Weimar and the postwar era are not individual achievements within
the arenas of social policy, technological progress, or social mobility
so much as the ways in which Nazi Germany succeeded in destroying
prevalent bonds of solidarity and produced coherence primarily through
bureaucratic procedures, institutions of incorporation, and the charms
of modern mass consumption. Nazi culture sold images of homogenization
and communality, yet in fact produced lonely, separated individuals. "If
the Third Reich could boast any achievement, it was the destruction of
public contexts and responsibilities and the dislocation of social forms
of life, even in traditional environments which provided some measure
of refuge and scope for resistance. Private spheres of behaviour were
impoverished and isolated, relapsing into a self-serving individualism
devoid of all potentially dangerous social connections and meanings. The
<I>Volksgemeinschaft</I> that had been so noisily trumpeted and so
harshly enforced became, in the end, an atomised society."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>

Culture under fascism, then, constitutes an extreme case within a twisted
process of modernization. It evidences the extent to which normal daily
obsessions, leisure activities, and commodity consumption can consume
such energy that they result in fundamental indifference to barbarism,
and thereby provide indirect, but highly effective sources of political
support.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even in his most pessimistic moments, Benjamin lends powerful arguments to
support a view of the "modernity" of fascist culture as differentiated
as Peuckert's.

<B></B>

Surely, Benjamin's account about the location
of culture in fascism, like Zitelmann's, at first seems to level all
meaningful distinctions between prefascist and fascist modernity. What
Benjamin calls the aestheticization of politics--the interlocked
aesthetics of stage-managed political action and American-style
mass consumption--directly appropriates elements pertinent to the
overall process of capitalist modernization ever since the middle
of the nineteenth century. Yet Benjamin's apocalyptic epithet about
Baudelaire's Paris and the logic of commodity consumption equally holds
true for the examination of fascist culture as well: "That things 'just
go on' <I>is</I> the catastrophe. It is not that which is approaching
but that which is. Strindberg's thought: Hell is not something which
lies ahead of us,--but <I>this life here</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 A closer
inspection reveals that in the context of what I have suggested above as
Benjamin's expanded formula of fascist aestheticization, catastrophic
modernism in fact undergoes an additional turn towards a qualitatively
different stage, a turn that constitutes the diabolical uniqueness
of fascist culture. For fascist aesthetics, according to Benjamin,
secretly seeks to transform hell itself into a commodity, an item of
pleasurable, albeit self-destructive mass consumption. Although the
Nazis in 1939 clearly failed to repeat the spontaneous enthusiam of
1914, imperial warfare in Benjamin's analysis res as the logical
outcome of the prewar spectacles; only war can finally uphold the kind
of repression that is at the heart of the aestheticizing celebration of
order, dynamism, power, and community. If nineteenth-century capitalism
entertained the masses with phantasmagorias of utopian collectivity and
mythic totality, fascism, in contrast, captures the minds and emotions of
the masses by appealing to diffuse popular desires for resolute politics
and national rebirth. In order to do so, it does not even hesitate to
render warfare a utopian panacea for all ills of modern culture, a most
enticing commodity powerful enough to suture atomized individuals into
a virtual community of seemingly equal window-shoppers and consumers:
"Mankind, which in Homer's time was an object of contemplation for the
Olympian gods, now is one for itself. Its self-alienation has reached
such a degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic
pleasure of first order."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However "theological" and overdetermined in character, Benjamin's
thesis that the roots of fascism are related to fundamental asymmetries
of capitalist modernization ought to remind us that contrary to what
historians such as Zitelmann suggest there is nothing genuinely "normal"
about Nazi culture after all. Fascism does not simply do what the
allegedly totalitarian dimension of modernity wanted all along. Rather,
fascism brings to a climactic conclusion progressively radical
attempts to contain the liberating aspects of modern disenchantment and
deauraticization, their power to disrupt symbolic totalization and impede
any regressive mimesis of mimesis. In doing so, fascism ironically allows
us to distinguish for the first time between what was utopian and what
catastrophic about the overall process of modernization. Though rightly
arguing against a discrete treatment of fascism, Benjamin's remarks
about the nexus of fascism and modern experience therefore do not yield
a universalizing conception void of any historical specificity. Nor do
they allow us retrospectively to normalize the National Socialist period

nation or the larger European
or Anglo-American context of modernization. What to many of today's
historians appears "normal" in Nazi culture, in the eyes of Benjamin in
fact participates intimately in technologies of power and legitimation
that make strategic use of distinct pathologies of modernization. Even if
we consider the fact that Nazi cinema, for instance, directly adopted the
grammar of contemporary Hollywood films, Hollywood's generic conventions,
modes of spectatorship, and the star system, we would misjudge the
function of Nazi mass culture if we rendered it compatible with other
nationally specific cristallizations of nonpolitical diversion. Nazi
leisure culture, in other words, does not form an odd counterpoint to
the politicization of the public sphere and the stage-managing of the
political. Rather, both the political spectacle and the private cult
of pleasure-seeking formulate fascism's peculiar and combined answer to
the dialectics of modern culture. Instead of theorizing the relation of
ideology and leisure in Nazism in terms of a split consciousness, as a
hiatus between ideological imperatives and everyday practices, Benjamin
suggests that political spectacle and everyday consumption are integral
moments of an attempt to enlist the auratic logic of commodity fetishism
for the projects of ideological politics and thus to restrain modernity's
allegorical sparks of liberation. Fascism, for Benjamin, plays out all
relevant political questions within the field of commodity consumption
while it at the same time masks the respective commodities' commodity
form, reenchants the disenchanted, and thus wraps capitalism, modernity,
and alienated labor in the symbolic cocoon of an organic, anticapitalist
community. What Benjamin calls fascist aestheticization denotes a
historically specific regime of production, representation, and cultural
consumption in which political leadership and war can be advertised,
packaged, and consumed like mass-produced <I>Volkswagen</I> cars.

This essay was written as a critical response to the exhibit "Art
and Power: Europe under the Dictators 1930-1945"--sponsored
by the European Council, curated by the London Hayward Gallery, and
installed in London (26 October 1995-21 January 1996), Barcelona (26
February-6 May 1996), and Berlin (11 June-20 August 1996). A
longer version of this paper will appear in  <I>Walter Benjamin and the
Aesthetics of Power</I> (forthcoming, Nebraska University Press). A
highly controversial spectacle, "Art and Power" sought to recall the
interfaces between totalitarian power and modern culture between 1930
and 1945 in a broader European context. Its point of departure was the
monumental mise-en-sc&egrave;ne of the 1937 World Fair in Paris, a
mega-spectacle itself, used particularly by the regimes of Germany,
the Soviet Union, Italy, and Spain to showcase their respective
appropriations of modern culture. "Art and Power" construed its
notion of fascist aesthetics--understood as part of a larger European
formation of totalitarian modernism during the interwar years--against
the backdrop of the desirability of an innocent and timeless realm of the
beautiful. The exhibit defined fascist aesthetics via stylistic criteria
such as monumentalist gesture, symmetrical indulgence, heroic posture,
futuristic coolness; it mapped the politics of art as a relatively
coherent system of representation rather than a crucible of cultural
practices, affective agendas, and contingent appropriations. Reducing
the iconographic language of art to a direct expression of power,
totalitarian modernism--the exhibit suggested--systematically taps the
erosion of boundaries between art and life prered in the agendas
of the historical avant-gardes; totalitarian regimes can effectively
politicize art only because modern art itself seems to have lost faith in
preserving its autonomy. Significantly, in all of its four major sections
the exhibit also brought to view the work of artists who tried to resist
the stylistic vocabulary of totalitarian modernism by insisting on
anti-realist and anti-monumentalist, on non-heroic and abstract idioms
of representation. A selection of Rodtschenkos, Fontanas, Beckmanns,
Kollwitzes, and Schlemmers was meant to document the existence of an
expressive inventory that defied the appropriation of art as a vehicle
of totalitarian self-aggrandizement, a beleaguered island of modernist
experimentation amidst the violent storms of what is presented as the
full and perverse unfolding of the hopes of the avant-garde.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Art and Power" blamed art for ending up as an organ of totalitarian
mass deception. It is not difficult to see, however, that the exhibit's
alternative between the iconographies of totalitarian and of enigmatic
modernism oversimplified the politics of cultural expressions during
the 1930s and 1940s. "Art and Power" completely missed the fact that
the disintegration of aesthetic autonomy was not just the product
of an inner-aesthetic or stylistic development, but a reflex of the
comprehensive redefinition of cultural spaces taking place ever since
the middle of the nineteenth century, a response to the ever-increasing
commodification of aesthetic expressions as much as to the emergence
of mass cultural practices and new and technologically mediated forms
of diversion. It is precisely this reductionist reading of totalitarian
modernism and fascist aesthetics as merely a chapter of art history that
linked the exhibit to the kind of revisionist projects of normalization
popular ever since the so-called German historians' debate of the
1980s. "Art and Power" interpreted fascist aesthetics as an integral
and quite normal expression of a broader European phenomenon. More
importantly, instead of thinking through the more complex force field
of art, power, and mass culture, of social and cultural modernization,
of culture and genocide, the exhibit's merely stylistic concept of
Nazi aesthetics and totalitarian modernism invited the viewer simply
to invert--and thus reaffirm rather than explode--the very categories
according to which Nazi ideology itself sought to classify the value of
art: "Art and Power" granted Hitler and Goebbels a posthumous victory as
it reconstructed the past according to the Nazis' self-perceptions. An
integral part of a shared European catastrophe, the concept of Nazi
aesthetics thus replayed in reverse the taxonomies that informed Nazi
ideology itself instead of yielding new insights into the sources and
structures of domination during the 1930s.
