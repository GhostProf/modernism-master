<p class="noIndent">
This essay, excerpted from a larger study of queer optimism, extends a delineation, if not exegesis, of the myriad smiles found in the poetry of Hart Crane. The sheer multitude of Crane's poetic smiles is only slightly less extraordinary than the fact that these smiles have hitherto been so cursorily (if not dismissively) broached by an otherwise sophisticated and burgeoning tradition of Crane scholarship. Extant critical engagements of Crane's smiles have seemed cursory to the extent that they have seldom taken Crane's smiles <i>as such</i>, but have instead swiftly co-opted them into either neutralizing temporal registers (the nostalgically preterite or untenably futural), or apposite (but by no means equivalent) affective categories. Exemplary of such co-optation is Eric Sundquist's conflation of smiles and smirks, although the smirk appears in only one of Crane's poems: "Lodged throughout Crane's poetry in enigmatic postures of martyred comedy, the 'smirk' or 'smile' . . . has always the questionable status which Freud assigns to the joke. . . . "<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Although smiles are indeed "lodged," enigmatically, "throughout Crane's poetry," Sundquist's analysis is misleading, if not apprehensive, in its dependence on an equivalence between smiling and smirking&#x02014;an equivalence that Crane's poetry, taken on its own terms, cannot support. Exemplary also is Sundquist's presumption that a Cranian smile, when not smirking, is the screen for a more interesting or authentic emotional state: "What is concealed by these smiling fa&#x000E7;ades is a prophetic suffering. . . . "<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Why presume the indistinguishability of smiles and smirks? Why presume that a smile not only is a fa&#x000E7;ade, but a fa&#x000E7;ade for suffering? What does it say about Crane scholarship, and criticism more generally, that a smile, critically speaking, so seldom is allowed to be a smile? As such questions suggest, my subject in this essay is not only Crane's poetry, but also the specific manner in which this poetry has been understood and misunderstood. If this essay arises out of an interest in queer optimism, it likewise arises in a frustration with the sorts of critical pessimisms that would disallow a smile's being taken seriously&#x02014;without its renomination as smirk or fa&#x000E7;ade, without its imbrication with some more authentic mode of suffering. More simply put: I wish to take Crane's smiles seriously.
</p>

<p>
To the extent that I imagine this essay as an exercise in queer optimism, I should at the outset clarify that my interest lies primarily in how Crane's poetry has been received by queer criticism. Crane's profound importance to such criticism might register, in shorthand, in the fact that two of Crane's earliest and most innovative queer readers, Tim Dean and Lee Edelman, have since become important and prolific contributors to the field of queer theory. That Sundquist's ostensibly non-queer scholarship would be susceptible to the same limitations as queer Crane criticism (and, I elsewhere argue, queer theory more generally) importantly indicates that a resistance to something like Crane's smiles&#x02014;or a critical suspicion of something like optimism&#x02014;is not a uniquely queer blind-spot. The resonances between queer and non-queer responses to Crane's smiles would be all but irrelevant, were I not myself committed, in the end, to positing a particular intervention in queer theory. For instance, queer theory's fetishization of self-shattering, inaugurated in Leo Bersani's 1987 essay "Is the Rectum a Grave?," has inspired if not monopolized most queer readings of Crane. Such readings take Crane's biographical suicide, or notorious poetic failure, or no less notorious textual difficulty, as paradigmatic of queer self-dissolution. This essay seeks to extricate Crane from narratives of <i>jouissance</i> and self-destruction. As I will argue in a subsequent section of this essay, the non-acknowledgement of Crane's smiles within Crane criticism significantly dovetails with a similar non-acknowledgement in the work of Bersani and Michel Foucault. Crane's smiles provide not only a problematic that the work of Bersani or Foucault cannot sufficiently address, but also a site from which to elaborate upon and supplement an already available queer vocabulary. This is not at all to say that I'm using Crane as the occasion for making a purely theoretical argument. Rather, I hope to recover in Crane what criticism thus far has overlooked. Such a recovery, as I imagine it, would involve a differently conceived optimism, the consequences and possibilities of which would extend beyond the purview of queer theory and speak to any person who, like myself, might be inclined to imagine smiles, or optimism, as sites of critical interest&#x02014;as opposed to sites of suspicion, conversion, or outright eschewal.
</p>

<p>
As the following section will make clear, optimism is not only my term, but Crane's. While it is indubitably counter-intuitive to apprehend optimism in the poetics of a suicidal alcoholic, Crane specifically invokes optimism in his correspondence, nearly as incessantly as his poems invoke smiles. Again, like Crane's smiles, this optimism has not yet been given due critical attention. Optimism, like smiles, seems to elicit a kind 

<b></b>

of critical nervousness, literalized in Christopher Nealon's account of Crane in <i>Foundlings: Lesbian and Gay Historical Emotion Before Stonewall</i>. Nealon's book, which dexterously situates Crane's difficult poetry alongside the differently difficult genres of physique magazines and lesbian pulp fiction, further intimates Crane's importance for conceptions of history or personality beyond Crane's own immediate modernist context. My reservations with Nealon's analysis are local, as are my reservations with Sundquist's: this is to say that my engagement with these and other scholars does not question their diverse interests and contributions to their respective fields. Having said that, Nealon's treatment of Crane's optimism&#x02014;which, as the next section addresses, Crane himself cultivated in response to the pessimism he perceived in the work of T. S. Eliot&#x02014;seems heuristically limited, analogous to Sundquist's foreclosure of smiles as a priori smirked, or fa&#x000E7;ade. Following an analysis of the final section of T. S. Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i>, Nealon writes thus: " . . . Eliot's poem handily illuminates some key differences between his poetic grasp of history and Crane's&#x02014;and not the reductive difference between some poetic 'pessimism' of Eliot's and Crane's 'optimism,' however Crane himself might have imagined the difference that way."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Nealon's framing of optimism and pessimism in quotation marks might simply denote that optimism and pessimism are Crane's particular terms&#x02014;as indeed they are. The work of the quotation marks would seem nearly superfluous, however, since Nealon immediately explains that these are the terms in which Crane "imagine[s] the difference" between Eliot's poetics and his own. Emphatically signaling the extent to which Crane's terms are not Nealon's own, Nealon's quotation marks function as scare-quotes. In this regard, the quotation marks reenact the a priori reductiveness, for Nealon, of Crane's terms&#x02014;qualified in the manner other scholars might qualify "reality" or "natural" as dubious if not ideologically suspect. Because Nealon is able to find a difference between Eliot and Crane putatively more interesting than the one Crane himself articulates, he seems willing gingerly to allow Crane his insistence on optimism. But admitting Crane's optimism seems a strange critical move, not incommensurate, for instance, with admitting Eliot's anti-Semitism. Nealon's accommodation of Crane's optimism amounts to a polite ignorance of it. Scare-quotes recapitulate, consolidate, an imputed reductiveness that goes without saying. This essay suspends this presumption of reductiveness; frees optimism from scare-quotes; investigates how Crane's sense of optimism bears on his poetry's intense proliferation of intensely unfamiliar smiles.

Affirming Certain Things
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In letters coterminous with much of the <i>White Buildings</i> poems, Crane describes his poetic project as a departure from the pessimism of T. S. Eliot. In the context of his poetry's difficulties, Crane's epistolary descriptions of his poetic optimism are tantalizingly intelligible. In a 1922 letter to Allen Tate, Crane writes that "one <i>does</i> have joys" (emphasis in original) and that "the vocabulary of damnations and prostrations has been developed at the expense of these other moods . . . so that it is hard to dance in proper measure."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In a letter written to Gorham Munson in January 1923, Crane 

<b></b>

identifies this vocabulary of "prostrations" as T. S. Eliot's. "I take Eliot as a point of departure," Crane writes, "toward an almost complete reverse of direction. His pessimism is amply justified, in his own case. But I would apply as much of his erudition and technique as I can absorb and assemble toward a more positive, or (if [I] must put it so in a sceptical [sic] age) ecstatic goal. . . . All I know through very much suffering and dullness (sometimes I seem to twinge more all the time) is that it interests me to still affirm certain things" (<i>LHC</i>, 114&#x02013;5 [5 January 1923]).
</p>

<p>
Crane's letter to Munson designates at least two important components of this "complete reverse" of Eliot's pessimism. Crane's positive, here, denotes not only the positive outlook of more familiar conceptions of optimism ("one <i>does</i> have joys"), but more peculiarly implies the imbrication of this recognition of happiness with a commitment to recognition more generally. The positive of Crane's anti-pessimism invokes not only the smiles of positive affect, but a stranger smile of positivity, if positivity is taken to signal a certain receptivity to fact. Crane's positive predisposes him "to still affirm certain things." The litany of smiles in Crane's poetry indicates an affirmation of joy, but also an affirmation that smiles <i>are </i>"certain things." The smiles of Crane's poetry resemble the smile of the Cheshire cat, which outlasts the cat, and seems not only to have its own autonomy, but ontologically to constitute the cat itself. Crane's poetic project, then, involves not only a recuperation of optimism (i.e. the idea that optimism, as much as Eliotic pessimism, could yield, say, truth or beauty), but a recuperation of the unequivocal objectness of the positive.
</p>

<p>
Positive, for Crane, is not equivalent to ecstatic. Ecstasy might describe the first component of Crane's project ("one does have joys"), but not the second. Ecstasy, like <i>jouissance</i> or masochism, teeters between joy and pain; ecstasy lets pessimists eat their pain-cake and have it, too. Crane's positive, on the other hand, is non-ecstatic, which is to say unequivocal. <i>The fact of having joys, within this poetics, is inextricable from the joy of having facts ("to still affirm certain things").</i> Ecstasy, in Crane's letter, amounts not to the apotheosis of positive feeling, but the mistranslation of positive feeling for an age whose skepticism would distrust that feeling's self-commitment.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Crane's attempt to save joy (and no less radically, to save affirmation) from the demands of skepticism instances one of the most singularly important and as yet unacknowledged contributions made by Crane, to both poetry <i>and </i>criticism. To look ahead to this essay's own horizon, Crane's is an attempt I not only trace, but attempt to extend, as both vocabulary and possible practice.
</p>

<p>
About halfway through Hart Crane's 1926 book of poems, <i>White Buildings</i>, and without recognizable reason, Crane's poems begin registering the peculiar affective fact of a smile. "Possessions" ends with the line "All but bright stones wherein our smiling plays."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>   The first stanza of "Lachrymae Christi" ends with the "sluice" of "one unyielding smile" (<i>CP</i>, 19), and the poem itself ends with "Thy/Unmangled target smile" (<i>CP</i>, 20). The speaker of the next poem asks of another re, "Why are you back here&#x02014;smiling an iron coffin" (<i>CP</i>, 21)? And the speaker of the next poem, "The Wine Menagerie," directs the reader to "[r]egard the forceps of the smile that takes her (<i>CP</i>, 23)," and later, invokes a time when "my blood dreams a receptive smile . . . " 

<b></b>

(<i>CP</i>, 24). The smiles of <i>White Buildings</i> continue, from "this much-exacting fragment smile" ("Recitative," <i>CP</i>, 25) to "stenographic smiles" ("For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen," <i>CP</i>, 26), the "counted smile of hours and days" ("Voyages IV," <i>CP</i>, 37), "[o]ne frozen trackless smile" ("Voyages V," <i>CP</i>, 38), and "[t]hat smile unsearchable repose" ("Voyages VI," <i>CP</i>, 39). This proliferation of smiles demands to be read, if only because such repetitions suggest a trace of intention, an entry into meaning, within poems which otherwise seem ruthlessly opaque. With each poem read, and each smile added to the collection, it seems all the more evident that Crane is up to something.
</p>

<p>
The unequivocality of these smiles results in their seeming ponderously nonmetaphorical, in a poetics that seems nothing if not metaphorical. Following Lee Edelman, we could say that Crane's metaphoricity is more precisely catachrestic, and that catachresis in Crane often operates at the level of the adjective.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  For instance, Crane writes of "tendoned loam," ("Lachrymae Christi," <i>CP</i>, 20) and "inventive dust" ("For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen," <i>CP</i>, 27). Loam and dust are resuscitated through adjectives that pull their respective nouns toward some new form. In the case of the former, loam acquires the taut architecture of a body; in the latter, dust acquires the potential inventiveness to become nearly anything. The adjectives appended to Crane's smiles, as already listed, include "unyielding," "unmangled," "frozen" and "trackless." Whereas loam and dust are adjectivally torqued into alterior shapes, smiles are adjectivally stabilized. Adjectives do not transform smiles into something else, or even describe their particularity, so much as insist (strangely, tautologically) upon a certain unbudgeability. This unbudgeability is itself catachrestic in an emblematically Cranian way, insofar as smiles, ordinarily, are definitionally short-lived. In any given situation, a smile becomes less convincing, the longer it is held.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Real smiles, ordinarily, are quick glimmers. Not in Crane. Ironically, the Cheshire-positivity of Crane's smiles makes them difficult to hold onto, even as they aspire, in their resilience, toward being held.
</p>

<p>
The relation between the optimism adduced in Crane's letters and the smiles littered through Crane's poetry is hardly self-evident. While it is uncontroversial to imagine optimism and smiles as situated in each other's vicinity, to extrapolate from vicinity any account of causality (e.g. one smiles if one is happy, one is happy if one is optimistic) or synecdochal identity (smiles in Crane's poetry signal condensed shorthand for optimism) presumes from the get-go that we know how Crane's smiles and optimism operate when in fact the poems present a version of smiling that is anything but familiar. For instance: ordinarily, a smile exists within a slender window of opportunity&#x02014;because a smile is short-lived, it most often comes on the immediate heels of what it is a response to. Or failing that, a smile comes on the heels if not of the event, then the recollection of the event.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Many of Crane's smiles, by contrast, follow no such logic.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Such a logic seems inapplicable to Crane's poetics in part because the event, as a component of his lyric poems, is so much subordinated to the exigencies of his thick, catachrestic style. Crane's style <i>is </i>the event, and in this regard, if smiles indicate an affective response, they are responses not to what the poems describe, but to the poems' style as such. Affect, within Crane's writing, is no more beholden to protocols of intelligibility than is, for instance, speaker or narrative. These smiles are confusing, 

<b></b>

then, because they are at least nominally identifiable even as their contexts are not. And furthermore, their adjectival modifiers don't specify the qualities of the smiles, but rather specify non-fungible duration, before the poetry has disclosed what the smiles are non-fungible or durable in relation to. Take, for example, the first stanzas of "Lachrymae Christi:"
</p>

Joseph Riddel's influential essay, "Hart Crane's Poetics of Failure" usefully illustrates how such smiles have otherwise been read. "Lachrymae Christi," Riddel notes, "moves from smile to smile through the agony of sacrifice and tears, and ends in the ecstatic moment of anticipated self-transcendence."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Indeed, the poem <i>does </i>move from smile to smile. Its last stanza reads, 
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

Thy face <br />
From charred and riven stakes, O <br />
Dionysus, Thy  <br />
Unmangled target smile.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p>
For Riddel, Crane's poetry is bound between the insufficiency of words that could never rise beyond their worldly limits, and the impossibility of words that could do his poetic vision justice. As such, Riddel converts (I would venture <i>yields </i>and <i>mangles) </i>this poem's smiles into respective instantiations of the insufficient and the impossible. This conversion effectively wipes the smiles from the poem's face. The first smile ("its one unyielding smile"), Riddel claims, "is the blank expressionlessness of a sterile world . . . " ("PF," 487).For Riddel, that is, "unyielding" is equivalent to a sort of obdurateness that disqualifies the smile from expression. To imagine the sterile world as blankly expressionless is to perform a personification devised to shut itself down.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, Riddel nullifies the second smile ("Thy/ unmangled target smile") by deferring it as "a vision of wholeness anticipated in the moment of fragmentation . . . " ("PF," 487). More emphatically, Riddel later claims that the "smile of Dionysus . . . is not an achieved and communicated vision in the poem; it is the ecstasy of anticipated 

<b></b>

fulfillment" ("PF," 491). In claiming this unmangled smile as "anticipated," Riddel defers it to some unspecified future. The smile can't be reached, in part, because Riddel's Crane can't reach it without sacrificing himself on the altars of that "vision of wholeness" ("PF," 487).<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  To reach wholeness, one first has to endure obliteration. Riddel directs his reader to "the crucial passage from <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>," which would underwrite this necessity of deontologization: " . . . [T]ragic myth, through the re of the hero [i.e. the poet] delivers us from our avid thirst for earthly satisfaction and reminds us of another existence and a higher delight. For this delight the hero readies himself, not through his victories but through his undoing" ("PF," 477). Crane's Dionysus, however, is not necessarily identical to the Dionysus of <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>. The passage that Riddel quotes from Nietzsche concludes that "[b]y virtue of this noble deception [of tragedy] it is now able to move its limbs freely in dithyrambic dance and to yield without reserve to an orgiastic abandon. . . . "<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Orgiastic abandon or, as Crane writes in his letter to Allen Tate, "dance in proper measure"? Riddel's argument for "Lachrymae Christi's" ecstasy depends on the poem's smiles being read in dialectical opposition, the terms of which, while readily importable from Nietzsche, seem less than immediate in the poem itself. I want to stump here for the possibility of smiles being purposively unyielding/unmangleable, but also for the extent to which Crane himself seems interested in a reiterative, accumulative network of smiles, not only in this poem, but in the poems of <i>White Buildings</i> by which it is bordered. Read serially, the smiles of <i>White Buildings</i> not only ask not to be discounted or transformed, but ask, with all the contested eloquence of a writer wanting to counter Eliot's pessimistic project, what it would mean to take smiles seriously as both unyielding rhetorical and affective phenomena. This isn't to say that Crane necessarily knew how to answer his own question. Riddel, in only a slightly different context, cedes as much: "Crane's poems do often achieve a constellated structure of recurrent images&#x02014;the curve and circle imagery of <i>The Bridge</i> for example&#x02014;but what kind of vision these manifest patterns represent is, to say the least, ambiguous. Surely it is more something desired than something possessed and known . . . "("PF," 476).
</p>

<p>
To return to "Lachrymae Christi," the poem's title connotes both the tears Jesus weeps upon being crucified, and a brand of sweet wine named Lachrymae Christi. Getting drunk and getting crucified are two ways of imagining a body in throes (though it may be useful to recall that intoxication as often conjures the idiom of being plastered as it does being sloshed, or smashed; and that being plastered isn't necessarily the precondition to being smashed, but its own state). Also, moonlight, here, is conceived as the solvent benzine, as though to become visible under the moon were to become susceptible to erasure. The poem's last lines&#x02014;"Thy face/ From charred and riven stakes, O/ Dionysus, Thy/ unmangled target smile"&#x02014;clinch the reading of the poem offered by Thomas Yingling, which (in concert with Riddel's reading) argues that "the dismembered body is for Crane the eroticized body carried to its logical extreme . . . But perhaps we ought to take the poem's closing image as a re for textuality itself, one that suggests the importance of a dismembered text."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Perhaps we ought to recall, however, that we are met in these lines not by a dismembered body, but by a disembodied face. And that the face signals not the dissolution of Dionysiac frenzy but rather a counterintuitively non-bachannalian "unmangled[ness]." This unmangleability forms a frame with the first stanza's "unyielding." The poem counters its dismantling energies with an intense valuation of the non-dismantleable. Benzine, after all, might be capable of dissolving other solutions, but solvency is itself comprised of bonds between carbon and hydrogen. The CH groups of benzine (and of the Cheshire cat) reappear in the CH of "lachrymae" and "christi," as well as the first stanza's "machinery," the last stanza's "charred," and elsewhere through the poem ("chant," "chime," "unstenched"). The proliferation of CHs posits an elemental integrity that is inextricable from a poem otherwise read solely for its thematization of breakage. Inside the machinery of the poem is a tacit insolubility, whose initials, as though held up to a mirror, are the initials of Crane himself. Along these lines, the poem's smiles not only evince the intransigence of the CH, but are registers of intransigence. Smiling, in this poem and others, does not describe delight, or for that matter any other affect, but rather describes durability itself.

The Smile of Prufrock
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Crane's first book experiments with a smile's durability at the expense of the personal relations that might produce it. These experiments are a direct response to the more personalized, but (or "and therefore") degradable smiles that surprisingly litter T. S. Eliot's first book of poems. <i>Prufrock and Other Observations</i>  contains twelve poems, and these poems invoke nine smiles. Eliot's smiles designate possibilities that have been either foreclosed, or almost eschatologically deferred, and as such their mode is emphatically subjunctive. Eliot's poem, "Portrait of a Lady" ends with the question "And should I have the right to smile?" which reiterates both Prufrock's question "Would it have been worthwhile,/ To have bitten off the matter with a smile," and the futural formulation of the book's last poem, "La ia che Piange:"
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

So I would have had him leave, <br />
So I would have had her stand and grieve, <br />
So he would have left <br />
As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised, <br />

I should find  <br />
Some way incomparably light and deft, <br />
Some way we both should understand, <br />
Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The stanza's anaphoric "so" posits the first set of actions as causal (I have him leave so that she grieves) or analogous (just as I have him leave, I have her grieve) without specifying a preference for either. Similarly, the next anaphoric "as" describes a relation between events that is neither precisely narrative nor analogous (do soul and mind 

<b></b>

leave the body at the same time, or in the same way?). This collapse of modes converts romantic (i.e. causal/narrative) crisis into a series of poetic (i.e. analogous) relations&#x02014;a conversion apparent even in the imposition within the scene of this orchestrating "I," who arranges the other two res (him and her) as an author arranges characters. 
</p>

<p>
From this series of postulations (I would have done this, and this, he would have done that) in the past, the stanza switches registers not to what the poem's "I" <i>should have</i> done, or what he does, but to what he "should" do. That is, the second half of the stanza doesn't provide an alternative to the sets of possibilities already adduced (which is how a "should" following a "would" might ordinarily be understood), but seems rather to introduce a distinctly separate, if obliquely related, system of contingency. The stanza's system of subjunctives delineates a temporal zone of contingent past and contingent future that skips over anything like a present. In this crowd of persons that could (but don't necessarily) leave, and should (but don't necessarily) come together, the smile and the handshake govern as liminal res that constantly write themselves to the point of being unwritten.
</p>

<p>
The formulation beginning "So I would have had him leave . . . " worries the relation between persons by suspending accounts of how personal motivations are related (narratively/causally, analogously/synchronically). The stanza's last lines, on the other hand, question neither the temporal nor the rhetorical conditions of persons and their actions, but rather the terms of the very moment of interpersonal connection. (Even as "the very moment" is to be understood as qualified by the force of "should"&#x02014;this is not a moment that is happening, but that might happen, were it not for any number of unspecified intervening factors.) Taken on their own, the "smile and shake of the hand" would in fact seem to designate simple ways of understanding&#x02014;one thinks, for instance, of all the smiling and handshaking Eliot must have executed in 1917, the year both of his book publication and the beginning of his career at Lloyd's Bank. The "way" understanding is demonstrated, however, is as dangerous as it is simple. The smile and handshake form a contract between persons ("let's shake on it"), which their ascribed faithlessness would seem to void. And yet are both persons privy to the smile's faithlessness, or is faithlessness the prerogative only of the poem's "I"? It is unclear within the stanza to whom "we both" even refers (e.g. two people, or three?), or to what understanding they are coming, or to what end this understanding is staked. What difference would it make, for example, if "I should find" or not find this way of marking mutual recognition? Eliot's smile is the simultaneous beginning and end of loyalty, emerging as reparation after the leave-taking of a lover ("As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised"), when in fact reparation counts only as the grounds for future betrayal, governed by contingencies which seem not to matter, in part because the terms of understanding are so jeopardized from the start.
</p>

<p>
Within this epistemological muddle, the questions of "Prufrock" and "Portrait of a Lady" resonate darkly. <i>Would it have been worth while to have bitten off the matter with a smile? Should I have the right to smile?</i> Even if the former Prufrockian smile weren't faithless, but productive of an engagement with the world that wasn't undermining, the question of worth would be unanswerable if not irrelevant, because 

<b></b>

this sort of engagement remains suspended as an unexecutable possibility. Or rather, Prufrock's evaluation of action's worth displaces the more operative question as to whether Prufrock could actually have engaged the world in such a way (he cannot), and so the smile is not Prufrock's (nor even a retroactively projected version of Prufrock), but belongs more precisely to a person that Prufrock cannot imagine, let alone emulate. Eliot's "Portrait of a Lady," on the other hand, mobilizes smiles not as visible traces of the unenvisionable, but as the enigmatic sign of the confusion of understanding, misunderstanding, and complacent ignorance. In its second section, the poem's titular lady observes a decidedly non-Prufrockian interlocutor:

Like the faithless smile of "La ia che Piange," the smile of the cruel youth simultaneously affirms and undermines relation, by making a contract out of misrecognition. Smiling, the lady's companion makes good on the lady's charge (that youth is cruel), while turning not-seeing into its own (if not only) form of understanding. And in leaving unchallenged whether he in fact sees or doesn't see, the youth and his smile make indistinguishable the surfacial distinction between understanding and not caring. Thus, if the poem's final question, "should I have the right to smile" (<i>TSE:CP</i>, 12) lexically echoes Prufrock's, it nevertheless conjures not an unimaginable agency which might produce engagement (were agency itself less unimaginable), but rather a fantasy of ceding engagement. The right to smile, as smiling is defined by the poem, would amount to the right to contractual faithlessness&#x02014;the right not only to "not knowing what to feel or if I understand" (<i>TSE:CP</i>, 12), but more emphatically, the right not to care whether one knows or feels at all. Smiling, here, functions less as a register of affect, than as a substitute for affect.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The stakes of Eliot's smiles involve an agreement against having stakes. Thus the smile that ends the poem "Morning at the Window" can hover and vanish without even seeming like lost possibility. Within Eliot's poetry, the smile as often as not designates the abdication of possibility (hence the uninterest, in "La ia che Piange," in distinguishing one form of contingency from another):

Insofar as Eliot's smiles seem related to each other if only by their consistent ironizing of what a smile could/should mean, their iterations within the book acquire the energy of a compulsion to repeat.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In a poetry which (even at this early stage) privileges an ethics of impersonality, it isn't surprising that affect, and registers of affect, would be controverted as untrustable. This untrustability, of course, itself depends on affect being intelligible as operative within the domain of the personal. And indeed, within Eliot, it is. Smiles belong to persons who misemploy them for depersonalizing/estranging ventures; or emphatically don't belong to but are longed for by persons who would use smiles correctly if they weren't ontologically unviable; or don't belong, as in the stranger of "Morning at the Window," in ways that suggest the shedding of old skin, that in the velocity of the urban street a smile and its repertoires (ironic or non-ironic) would be obsolescent if not already obsolete.
</p>

<p>
As we have already seen, the smiles of <i>White Buildings</i> are more often than not deracinated from the axis of the personal, neither belonging nor not belonging to an individual, but rather cropping up, as it were, within the materials of the poem. Whereas the smiles of Eliot are scrutable throughout (if only as undoing the sorts of things of which a smile might otherwise be imagined capable), the smiles of Crane are emphatically not scrutable. Rather than adhere to persons, the smiles more often than not are asked to be read as commensurate with terms with which smiles seem initially non-coincident. For all their proliferation, Eliot's smiles don't add up&#x02014;because they are either too deferred or too disintegrated to be counted. Crane's smiles, by contrast, accumulate, take up space. And not just any space, but the space of rejected writing, writing explicitly used up to the extent that the event it commemorates is over. Such a space is conjured at the opening of Crane's great 1923 poem, "For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen:"

The <i>heft</i> of the stenographic smiles&#x02014;the way in which even <i>shorthand</i> could litter streetcurbs&#x02014;angles toward the insistence with which Crane associates smiling with a weird form of solidity. As though durability as such weren't enough, the remaindered smiles that the poems precipitate are imagined as non-fluid.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  This oscillation within Crane's poetry between fluid and non-fluid (resonant enough in Crane's book-titles, <i>White Buildings, The Bridge, Key West, </i>which respectively signal the architecturally non-fluid, the architecture across water, the geography of water and island) is reflected in Crane criticism, whose trope of choice in describing fluidities in Crane's poetry is booze. R. P. Blackmur paradigmatically characterizes the language of "Lachrymae 

<b></b>

Christi" as "in the flux of intoxicated sense."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  He describes its principle of association (which Crane would later himself denominate the logic of metaphor) as "resembl[ing] the notion of wine . . . the notion of extra-logical, intoxicated metamorphosis of the senses [which both] controls and innervates Crane's whole sensibility" ("NT," 59&#x02013;60). To discuss Crane's poems as though liquor were both origin and constitutive energy conjures an especial problematic of intentional fallacy, in claiming that poetic meaning lies beyond the purview of the poem proper, but that meaning as such would speak in the slurs of a "rum-scallion" (<i>OML</i>, 226).<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The conjoining in Crane (or at least in Crane criticism) of poetry and alcohol suggests one of Crane's consanguinities (to use one of Crane's words) with Whitman. Leaving booze and flux (of Crane, of Whitman) aside, there nonetheless exist moments in Crane in which the argot of flux seems acutely inapplicable. This is much less to say that flux isn't ubiquitous as a style throughout Crane's writing (it is), than that the poetry reacts against itself in decisive moments, and that the flotsam of these non-fluid formulations has a particular quality, and in especial relation to the lyric tide on which it washes up.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Before further engaging what strike me as unusually unfluid Cranian formulations, I want to specify the sort of poetic fluidity that seems most characteristically Cranian. First, though not necessarily most importantly, this fluidity is commensurate with what in Crane's writing is most unintelligible. Or rather, this fluidity marks the threshold beyond which Crane's most challenging formulations become jettisonable in their inscrutability. Past this point, the challenges of poetry whose meaning is always on the move (which is to say, elsewhere) seem nearly indistinguishable from those of poetry that won't budge. This radical opacity seems, in its inaccessibility, to force novel ways of engagement. If meaning, per se, can't be gleaned from these "new thresholds" of imperviousness, then how, meaning aside, do the formulations recall earlier formulations? What are the sounds of these words, and what is the ambiance of these sounds? This is to imply, at the risk of seeming tautological, that what seems to have become non-fluid in its impenetrability is itself a sort of liquid&#x02014;at least insofar as the cues solicited by these tough coinings would seem to recalibrate the hermeneutic project of understanding Crane as a sort of (Kristevan) semiotic. Being before language (Kristeva) and being after (Crane, with his rococo of Elizabethan jazz-age bricolage) amount to uncannily similar scenarios.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The almost (al)chemical shifts of state in Crane's poetry (Blackmur's "intoxicated metamorphoses") are a function, I've suggested, of what Crane calls his poetry's "logic of metaphor." John Irwin adroitly glosses Crane's formulations as being productive of "a continuing metaphor in which the tenor is taken for granted on the level of surface form while a series of vehicles drawn from different image networks are allowed to interact in order to create progressively more complex names [in the instance of 'Voyages'] for love."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  This sort of continuing metaphor "creates a medium that holds words in suspension, allowing them to interact in ways more complex and more numerous than any normal, unviolated structure . . . " ("HCLM," 215). In Irwin's reading, Crane's "adagios of islands" thus serves as exemplar of the logic of metaphor at work, and a re for the logic of metaphor itself, in which islands of lexical meaning could rise (or 

<b></b>

in the case of "Atlantis," sink) within "the ocean of love" ("HCLM," 214). The ocean of love, in this instance, would re the inscrutable-as-liquid, that which escapes logical explanation because it is beyond it, or that out of which explanations arise.
</p>

<p>
The logic of metaphor, as it is understood by both Crane and critics such as Irwin, enacts what might be imagined as a rhetoric of desire. Desire, that is, glossed as a fundamental relation to absence. One desires what one lacks, what one isn't, and along these lines, Crane's metaphorical vehicles persistently reach toward a tenor they can only begin to imagine. The logic of metaphor, thus formulated, requires of its readers a hermeneutic position that is also, acutely, an eroticized position: desire, here, calibrated to the level of rhetoric, of occluded, even botched, syntax: not only are Crane's poems about love (he describes, for instance, "Voyages" as a love poem for welkin-eyed sailor Emil Opffer), but they construct for the reader a structure whose inhabiting renders reading and desiring coincident practices. Along these lines, Crane's poetry, at its most fluid (which is to say, at its most characteristically difficult and analytic), not only seems to affirm conceptions of desire as elsewherebut also creates within itself a disciplining space in which "the ideal reader" would likewise construe the project of satisfaction as a practice of cultivating, even enjoying, deferral.
</p>

<p>
In his essay "General Aims and Theories," Crane singles out "Possessions" as a poem that cannot be technically explained, that must rely on its organic impacton the imagination to communicate its meaning: "In manipulating the more imponderable phenomena of psychic motives, pure emotional crystallizations, etc., I have had to rely even more on these dynamics of inferential mention, and I am doubtless still very unconscious of having committed myself to what seems nothing but obscurities to some minds. A poem like 'Possessions' really cannot be technically explained . . . ."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  While Crane himself thus notes "Possessions" as exemplary of a poem that demands for entry an emotional, as opposed to logical, mode of reading&#x02014;and thus, exemplary of a poem that would perform the sort of absented metaphorical tenor characteristic of what I imagine as Cranian reading-as-erotic-project, "Possessions" seems striking less for its hermeneutic difficulty than for its own internal reaction to that particular sort of difficulty. Within a poetics that construes desire as a rhetorical problem, that invokes emotion as the means, as much as the object of understanding, "Possessions" reformulates desire not only as an analytic of presence, rather than absence, but furthermore conceives its erotic immanence as extravagantly intractable. "Possessions," that is, revises the poetry's more pervasive notion of desire as a movement toward something else&#x02014;and even more egregiously, revises the notion of desire as self-shattering&#x02014;in imagining a presence-of-desire around which the poem's more equivocal terms and formulations circulate. This revision of desire itself depends on the poem's beguiling final line's "bright stones wherein our smiling plays."

&#x02014;Crane, "Possessions" (<i>CP</i>, 18, cited in full)
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p>
While the syntactical and conceptual logistics of Crane's poem, "Possessions," remain perennially mystifying to Crane's readers, there nonetheless seems a sort of consensus among critics as to what the poem is about&#x02014;as though designating the subject of the poem, somehow, could organize or even decode local opacities which, taken on their own, or even collectively, remain insoluble. Critics as various as R. W. B. Lewis, Warner Berthoff, and Robert Martin agree that "Possessions" is about cruising.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Methodologically, such readings depend on a sort of excavatory hunch whereby the cruise at hand fundamentally is Hart's own, and whereby the poem's difficulty arises as a form, on Crane's part, of self-censorship. Such a hunch implies that Crane strategically mystifies the experience within the poem, so as to make it available only to those readers already in the know.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Such a reading grossly simplifies the subtleties of interaction/non-interaction glossed in the deceptively sleek denomination of cruising (cruiseboats, cruisemissiles; or more complicatingly, albeit no less etymologically related, the "crux" of crucifixion). Also, this reading implies, unhelpfully, that difficulty within the poem is something like phobic, self-proscribing response, additive to experience rather than constitutive of it; 

<b></b>

or constitutive not of the experience, but of its recounting. My reading of Crane's poem means to suggest that cruising is more complicated than the likes of Lewis, Berthoff, or Martin let on&#x02014;which is to say more interesting&#x02014;and that difficulty within the poem is thus as fundamental to its cruisy subject as to its style.
</p>

<p>
I mean here to address Blackmur's contention that Crane's poetry exonerates itself of referential obligation. "In a lesser poetry of the same order, and in poetry of different orders, words may only indicate or refer to or substitute for the feelings; then we have the poetry of vicarious statement, which takes the place of, often to the highest purpose, the actual complete presentation, such as we have here. Here there is nothing for the words to take the place of; they are their own life, and have an organic continuity, not with the poet's mind nor with the experience they represent, but with themselves"("NT," 57&#x02013;8). Blackmur's divorcing of words from what words might take the place of, however, becomes increasingly difficult to imagine in the context of cruising, which, like Crane's poetry, depends on so ornate and palimpsestic a semiotic. Cruising, understood as the elaborate choreography by which two strangers end up in relation, provides a somatic, interpersonal correlative to Crane's logic of metaphor. The intersection of erotic and poetic practice might be heard in Crane's exposition of the latter in a 1926 letter written to Harriet Monroe, if one substitutes "cruising" for terms such as "language," and "cruiser" for "reader" (even as a cruiser is nothing if not a reader, par excellence):

It implies (this <i>inflection</i> of language) a previous or prepared receptivity to its stimulus on the part of the reader. The reader's sensibility simply responds by identifying this inflection of experience with some event in his own history or perceptions&#x02014;or rejects it altogether. The logic of metaphor is so organically entrenched in pure sensibility that it can't be thoroughly traced or explained outside of historical sciences, like philology or anthropology. This "pseudo-statement," as I. A. Richards calls it in an admirable essay touching our contentions in last July's <i>Criterion</i>, demands completely other faculties of recognition than the pure rationalistic associations permit . . .

Cruising, like Crane's difficult poetics, is a pseudo-statement, the reception of which depends on the supply not of any clear explication but of "emotional connectives." And "Possessions," as Crane notes in his essay "General Aims and Theories," is exemplary of his difficult poems. That is, "Possessions" is both a poem about cruising, and an instantiation of a poetics nearly analogous to it. 
</p>

<p>
There are many smiles involved in cruising. First would be the smile across the room, or across the street. This, as a smile, is the drop of a fishing-line, the letter addressed to whomever receives it. This first smile communicates the cruiser's interest and availability; ideally, this smile meets with a smile that communicates a specular interest on the part of the other. If smile #1 is not met by smile #2, smile #1 may as well not have occurred. It is a tree falling in a forest without audience, and for it to be recognized without reciprocation amounts usually to embarrassment, but not to resignation of 

<b></b>

the smiling game. If smile #1 is reciprocated/reflected back by smile #2, then smiling escalates and intensifies. Faciality initially packaged as politesse&#x02014;in those opening cruising gambits, it is crucial that interest, if not reciprocated, can slink back into polite friendliness, in case lack of interest adheres also, say, to homophobic recoil&#x02014;ups its ante with cocked eyebrows and lambent lips. These smiles are a kind of bidder's stick, a silent opera of evaluation and contingent commitment, until the auction's deal is sealed. Cruising ceases to be cruising when smiles and their gestural extensions cede to words. Once two people are talking, the cruise qua cruise is complete.
</p>

<p>
"Possessions" suggests the stratagems of a cruise in its capacity to cover its own tracks. Erotic innuendo, intense volley of ocular exchange, depends on the initial registration of a glance; what Crane, in his letter to Harriet Monroe, calls "emotional connectives." Failing these connectives, Crane cedes, the poem will remain closed to its reader. The text can't guarantee its being understood (any more than Crane, walking the dark docks, can guarantee a hookup) so much as guarantee its ever (potentially occluded) availability. The poem signals this perpetual availability in its opening imperative, "Witness now this trust!" What trust? What is one witnessing? The object of the reader's gaze, at this point, seems less clear than the terms under which this gaze operates. First, witnessing presupposes a relation that is at least minimally dialectical&#x02014;to bear witness requires at least he who sees, and what/who is seen. Second, witnessing presumes (for its Austinian felicitousness) the synchronicity of the act of witnessing and the event that is witnessed. It is the fact that the witness sees (as opposed to remembers or retroactively elucidates) that authorizes what has been witnessed. Each time a reader turns to "Possessions," he is bearing witness before knowing what he is seeing. As witness, he authorizes ("this trust!") before he understands. The poem might "be" about a cruise. More eerily, the poem picks up the reader faster than "this trust" becomes a tryst. Faster, indeed, than "witness now" melts into "white as snow."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  The "he" that transforms "witness" into "w(h)it(e)ness" is both the subject and the object of Crane's cruise.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  He energizes the poem by being both simultaneously possessed and eluded.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to this flickering "he," the smiles of the poem's final line seem acutely immanent. Such is the effect of their being bound to "bright stones," although how the stones and smiles are related remains unclear. "Wherein," as a preposition, would seem to describe relation, but what does it mean to imagine an inside to a rock? (This is a question to which Crane will return, three years later, in "Island Quarry.") Are we talking geodes? Or a sort of stony crypt? Or might "wherein" refer not to a literal interiority, but to a stone's reflective surface, as when one speaks of objects "in" a mirror? Regardless, these particular scenarios seem to indicate a realm in which smiles are preserved at the expense of being removed. But then how can smiles in individual stones play? Does each smile live in its own stone? Are stones shared? Are the stones bright because illuminated by the smile, like a face's blush? Do smiles play with each other, or by themselves? Is playing an active enterprise, as in games, or an incessant reeling, like the play of a radio? The poem's cryptic final line mobilizes these problems of relationality, interiority, and agency, which smiling occasions, even if not critically engages.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
These smiles, clearly enough, are no longer the smiles of a cruise, cruisily as this poem begins. They obliquely conjure a much stranger terrain. Most readings of "Possessions" claim that its concluding vision is one of ecstasy. Tim Dean, for example, writes that these last lines "go beyond sex to a different kind of intensity," red as "ecstatic transcendence."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup> Such a reading is dissatisfying in part because ecstasy would by definition so exceed description that locating it in Crane's poetry practically amounts to giving up on trying to describe it. I don't yet know how to describe this poem's final smiling, or to what such smiling might refer. I venture that both the smiling and the stones that keep them are obliquely borne of "the pure possession" (if not, more simply, the objects to be possessed). Further, I venture that Crane has this "pure possession" in mind when, in "General Aims and Theories," he writes of those "pure emotional crystallizations" which his poetry seeks to "manipulate." Manipulation itself suggests the fact of holding something, "ready to hand," as though emotions were something that could be held. Manipulation, in this context, as much suggests that emotions could be handled, as that they could be altered. Hence Crane's insistence on "pure emotional crystallizations," an exquisite sort of petrifaction surely of a piece with the poem's own "pure possession." Rather than ecstasy, these last lines ruminate a non-ecstatic ardor as permanent (if not as clear) as crystal.
</p>

<p>
As I suggested at this essay's outset, for all that the practices of queer theory have opened and illuminated Crane's difficulty, the singular difficulty of smiles like those of "Possessions" corresponds to a blind spot within most psychoanalytically inflected queer repertoires. As an illustration of the quandary posed to queer theory by something like Crane's smiles, I turn now to a different text, which relates an uncannily similar scene: "People can tolerate two homosexuals they see leaving together, but if the next day they're smiling, holding hands, and tenderly embracing one another, then they can't be forgiven. It is not the departure for pleasure that is intolerable, it is waking up happy."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  The observation is Foucault's, made in the late 1980s in the gay French magazine <i>Mec</i>. It makes its way into English, and therefore, into the annals of American queer theory, via Leo Bersani, who cites the observation in his book, <i>Homos</i>. The smiles of Foucault's hypothetical happy gay men prove as mysteriously untenable for Bersani as Crane's smiles do for critics such as Riddel and Dean. "There may be nothing to say," Bersani writes, "about these gays holding hands after a night of erotic play . . . " (<i>H</i>, 78). There <i>is </i>something to say, however, for both Bersani <i>and </i>Foucault, if only on a different register. By "nothing to say," Bersani doesn't mean nothing, per se, but nothing other than what initially is communicated. "Don't, Foucault warns us, read <i>their </i>tenderness as the exhausted aftermath of cocksucking that would 'really' be a disguised devouring of the mother's breast, or a fucking that would 'really' be the heterosexual repossession of a lost phallic woman . . . " (<i>H</i>, 78). Don't, that is, presume metaphoricity where meaning is unequivocally literal. As in Crane's poetry, which reiterates smiles as the privileged site at which meaning doesn't waver, Bersani and Foucault exempt gay tenderness ("two homosexuals . . . smiling") from the equivocations of (metaphorical) psychoanalytic interpretation. For both Bersani and Crane, the smile monkey-wrenches poetic practice.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Just as Riddel reads the opening smile of "Lachrymae Christi" as expressionless, Bersani reads Foucault's smiles as blanks. "No, those homosexuals gaily embracing as they go to breakfast in the Castro or somewhere off Christopher Street are blankly, superficially, radically, threateningly happy. 'There is,' Foucault says, 'no anxiety, there is no fantasy behind happiness' . . . " (<i>H</i>, 79). The redundancy of a smile's instancing nothing but a smile seems as discomfiting here as the redundancy of a <i>gay gay</i>. If there were not anxiety behind happiness, readings such as these wouldn't be so quick to equate happiness with nothing. "[W]ith no fantasies to fantasize about, the silenced interpreter becomes the intolerant homophobe" (<i>H</i>, 79). By "silenced interpreter," Foucault refers to the average Joe on the street who can't abide that gays are happy. From a different vantage, however, Foucault and Bersani are silenced interpreters, too. The homophobia of such a silenced interpreter poses a threat to the scene's gay couple, but it is not threatening, per se, to Bersani's theorizing of it. More simply put, the subject of homophobia is the site, in Bersani's account, of neither nonplussedness nor intimidation, but of the mental agility and brilliance characteristic of Bersani's writing from the outset. At the same time, however, Bersani's project seems least sure-footed (which is to say, admittedly, seems least sure <i>to me</i>) in its engagement with the threatening blanks of gay happiness, as such.
</p>

<p>
Happiness, within Bersani's analysis, is asymptotic. Claiming to "want to return to those two happy men and, without wishing to explain or interpret their happiness, at least conjecture about how they spent the night" (<i>H</i>, 80), Bersani nonetheless does not return to those two happy men, per se. He skips past them, past the morning street, to an anterior cruise and its consequent sex. <i>(It is not the departure for pleasure that is intolerable, it is waking up happy.)</i> Bersani wants, maybe, to return to the smiles, wants, even "to be one of those happy gays [himself]" (<i>H</i>, 79), but within his account, he cannot. He may not want to explain or interpret happiness (although the question remains <i>why</i> happiness remains exempt from interpretation), but in fact he <i>does. </i>What is conjecture, after all, if not an attempt at explanation or interpretation?

After further digression, Bersani returns, in a way, to Foucault's smiles. "Indeed, Foucault's thought is all the more appealing, to me, in that his utopian visions never include the pastoral promise&#x02014;so fashionable in utopian vision in recent years&#x02014;of predominantly caring and nurturing human intimacies. There are of course those two hauntingly happy and tender men . . . " (<i>H</i>, 83). Published in 1995, I wonder to what "fashionable utopias," and "recent years" Bersani refers, because queer theory's most fashionable strain much more plausibly involves the <i>exclusion </i>of nurturing human intimacy. Even as Bersani wants "happy and tender men" to exist unproblematically without fantasy, they return, within Bersani's essay, as what analysis cannot make sense of. Such is the force of "there are of course," which performs diffidence even as the reintroduction of these gay gays seriously challenges both Bersani's and Foucault's accounts of homosexual threat. If these gay men, for Bersani, are no longer "blankly" happy, it is because Bersani has alarmingly upped his adverbial ante. Now, the gay men are "hauntingly" happy. (As though a happy homo were a dead homo. As though not having an unconscious were equivalent to <i>being </i>an unconscious.) The durability 

<b></b>

of Crane's smiles emerges in Bersani as the spectral smile that won't go away. It seems Bersani cannot look at the happy men without inadvertently conjuring their own retroactivity. We have moved from a happiness that is blank (which can tell us nothing beyond the tautological) to a happiness that is haunted (which might speak, but only, as it were, from the other side of the grave). And this movement, in a way, aligns Bersani with his own opposition:

In fact, no one can stop looking. But we might wonder if AIDS, in addition to transforming gay men into infinitely fascinating taboos, has also made it <i>less dangerous </i>to look.

The heightened visibility conferred on gay men by AIDS is the visibility of imminent death, of a promised invisibility.

Smiles, within this optic, are both doomed and indefatigable. If the smiles of a cruise are singular in their capacity to undo themselves, the smiles of "Possessions" (and the smiles which hauntingly possess Bersani) are singular in the intensity with which they are both ever-present and undone.

Whereas Bersani under-reads the smiles of Foucault's anecdotal gay men, Crane, in "Possessions," literally encrypts smiles, as though to save them from being read at all. This is not to say that the smiles of "Possessions" are constitutively unreadable. Similarly, to note their encryption is not, in the manner of Antigone, to ascribe to these smiles a living death. Crane gives no indication that these smiles could or would ever fade out: interminability (if not utter deracination from chronology) most saliently is conjured in Crane's designation not of a single smile, or even several smiles, but of "smiling," (in fact, "<i>our</i> smiling"). A noun (such as a smile, potentially subject to narratives of ephemerality) becomes a gerund, "smiling," which (as a verbal noun) isn't in Crane's poem subject to an extrinsic temporality so much as definitionally, autonomously temporal. "Gerund," after all, etymologically denotes a carrying on, which is precisely what these smiles do&#x02014;whether read, misread, or unread altogether. That this smiling might be <i>potentially </i>intelligible without being immanently so frustrates the poem's titular interest in possessability. What does it mean to have something without access to (which is to say, understanding of) it? In this manner, Crane's "bright stones" resemble D. W. Winnicott's transitional object, imagined as a "first possession" intermediately existing "between the subjective and that which is objectively perceived."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  This intermediate area (Crane's simultaneously compelling and occluding "wherein") "is an area," writes Winnicott, "that is not challenged, because no claim is made on its behalf except that it shall exist as a resting-place for the individual engaged in the perpetual human task of keeping inner and outer reality separate yet interrelated."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Three years after writing "Possessions," Crane returns to the problematic of happiness and stone in "Island Quarry." If the earlier poem posits the dilemma of smiling to be had if one could have it, this dilemma is itself an effect of the poem's titular parameters: the vicissitudes of possessability define the terms by which satisfaction might be gained, lost, or pined. "Island Quarry," on the other hand, reconres happiness not in terms of an object, a stone that could be held; rather, this later poem converts the hermetic emblems of "Possessions" into their own geography. The earlier poem's bright stones seemed either identical to, extensions of, or revisions of the "fixed stone of lust" which earlier circulates through the poem. "Island Quarry" by contrast reverts to a scene anterior to possessability, before stone could circulate at all. Another way of understanding the difference between the two poems would be this: if "Possessions" conceives of happiness as Winnicottian intermediate object somewhere between the outside world and the self, "Island Quarry" allegorizes happiness <i>as </i>outside world (however complicated a term "outside" is in the context of the exaggerated external and internal valences of a quarry). Translating happiness from object into geography would itself suggest one poetic tactic by which happiness could be explored (the way a geography might be explored). Provocatively, Crane's geography of happiness involves not some rainbowed waterfall or bower of bliss (as such allegorical terrains might otherwise be conceived), but a mountain quarry. "Island Quarry" thus further extends Crane's distinction between "positive" and "ecstatic." Whatever happiness might be found on or in this mountain, it is not obliterative, in the manner of ecstasy. Contrary to any Bersanian conflation of happiness with pleasure, pleasure with sexual pleasure, sexual pleasure with <i>jouissance</i>, <i>jouissance</i> with a sort of death (etc.), Crane produces a radically opposite account, where happiness is not only divorced from narratives of evanescence or self-dissolution, but bound to opposite possibilities of geological force:

The closest the poem comes to a circulatable stone is the opening spondee of "square sheets." With damning bluntness, however, these sheets are discarded as "flat prison 

<b></b>

slabs." The metaphor by which these stone sheets also connote sheets of both bed and book is knowingly heavy-handed (heavy, say, as marble), and echoes the stained page of "Possessions" whose stain is either semen or ink. The bed and the book are discarded if not as penitentiary, then potentially so. Discarded by extension are the particular relations to these objects that make of them potential prisons. It isn't that the marble couldn't be quarried toward other ends&#x02014;the limitation is not of material, but of vision. Whereas "Possessions" begins with "Witness now" (as though the poem at its opaque outset were wedded to the <i>act </i>of seeing more than the object of vision), "Island Quarry" begins with "they saw." The latter formulation seems at once more despairing and more hopeful than the injunction to witness. Despairing, if one takes "sawing" as a petrification of seeing. Even as <i>this </i>sort of stoniness is discarded, however, the poem queries the possibility of relations to stones that aren't incarcerative. "Island Quarry" doesn't imagine an anterior to the square sheets (such a claim misrepresents Crane's poem as nostalgic) so much as an alternative to them. Within the poem's system, how one might otherwise see the quarry is coextensive with what the marble might otherwise be sawed into. Vision and practice aren't merely at odds; hence the promissory formulation of "I'll see to it." To see that something gets done might be the same as doing it oneself, or the supervision of someone else doing it. 
</p>

<p>
"Island Quarry" continues as an ocular experiment within the terrain of durable stone. Vision is directed and redirected by a scramble of ever-widening prepositional locales&#x02014;at the quarry, at the bend in the road, around the roots of the mountain (as though the mountain were a tree, or tooth), where the road would seem to ply below the stone. Here, vision is shaken, and loses is orientative faculties. Where the straight road "seems" to ply below the stone, perspective, as ocular practice, replaces a vision organized by known hierarchies. From the poem's vantage, the sea is towering, and not the mountain. This perspectived landscape allows the counterintuitive misalignment of objects, the underwriting/justifying of a composition that would otherwise seem illogical. Perspective, then, is a description of counterintuitive relationality, or the moment at which relation answers to a phenomenological power higher than the intuitive.
</p>

<p>
Tricks of perspective save the quarry's stone from being seen as merely slabs. As though perspective weren't disorienting enough, the poem further undermines ordinary vision by dimming its lights (twice, the poem mentions it is dusk). The eyes which walk "the straight road" toward thunder are asked to differentiate between this silvering road which leads "on into marble" and the "goat path quivering to the right." The quivering goat path might sound like the way for Crane, but it isn't. "Tears and sleep" suggests another shitty night, not incommensurate with the rage and partial appetite penultimate in "Possessions." The road into marble, on the other hand, does not weep. This negatively-defined alternative to tears is informed by the eyes, "hard and glad," that view it. Gladness, that is, might be not only the eyes' predisposition, but their choice. This conjunction of hardness and gladness seems intuitive enough for a poet taken by the vagaries of his and other erections. Still, the gladness of being (staying) hard risks falling out of the poem. Edward Brunner and Allen Grossman, for instance, argue that "Island Quarry" entails a choice not between dissatisfaction and gladness, but between 

<b></b>

reason and sentiment. Brunner writes that the speaker "has had enough of vulnerability, and he is drawn instead to . . . the firm 'marble that does not weep,' that is inexpressive."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Grossman describes the eyes as foregoing "the wavering path of sentiment . . . putting an end to the monumental craving."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Brunner's elision of gladness in favor of a reading privileging inexpressivity recalls Riddel's misattribution of inexpressivity to the opening smile of "Lachrymae Christi." The blind-spot that precludes Brunner's ability to envision the simultaneity of "hard" and "glad" depends upon the presumption that gladness could be simultaneous only with frenzy, or even with the tears which the poem's eyes pass over. To choose the "straight path" ends up seeming queerer than choosing the bent road curving up the mountainside. So difficult is it for the poem (and us) to imagine this strange alignment of stubborn gladness (i.e. a stubbornness other than stoicism, or reason, or cadaverous non-expression) that the poem can commit to its choice, but cannot further imagine what this choice would look like.
</p>

<p>
Choice is difficult to conceive in "Island Quarry" because agency itself has become diffuse. There is no subject of the poem who could choose durability for himself, as though durability were an object to be acquired or ethic to be cultivated. The closest thing the poem has to a subject is the set of eyes which saw the marble, and walked the straight road, and did not take the quivering path. The precedent for Crane's strange subjectal dusk-vision, of course, is Emerson:

Emerson is as meticulous in describing the whereabouts of his ocular transformation as is Crane. He is crossing a bare common, he is standing on bare ground. Crane's eyes&#x02014;Crane's dissipated person&#x02014;is at the quarry out of which comes the square sheets (of prisons, of poems), and the quarry, at this magic hour, is floating as though attendant to some new set of laws. Whereas Emerson's "I" is glad to the brink of fear, Crane's eyes are glad without brink whatsoever. Crane's brinklessness, in fact, might be the more fearful proposition.

</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
There is among Crane's critics an acquiescence if not a tacit consensus that "The Broken Tower" was Crane's last poem. In a 1959 essay titled (straightforwardly enough) "Hart Crane's Last Poem," Marius Bewley opines that "[t]here is a literary superstition to the effect that the last work of a good artist is likely to show a deeper insight or wisdom, a last gathering of forces, as death comes on."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  The deeper insight which the "The Broken Tower" purveys has, invariably, to do with its brokenness. For Joseph 

<b></b>

Riddel, brokenness describes the insolvent suicidal poet who can't help but write a poem that performs his own inability: "Hart Crane's last poem, 'The Broken Tower,' is so confused with the sensational events of his last days that it is hard to consider the poem apart from the man. On the whole, it seems wise not to try to, for this is a poem which dramatizes, once and for all in our time, the pathetic gesture of a man dying into his work" ("PF," 473). Revamping not the fact of failure, but its theoretical fruction and the aura around it, Tim Dean more recently notes "that Crane identifies neither with mother nor father, but with <i>the brokenness of relation itself</i>. This symbolic identification not with any positive entity but with an absence, a rupture, is suggested in Crane's final poem, 'The Broken Tower'" (emphasis in original).<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Likewise, Lee Edelman writes that in "'The Broken Tower,' [his] final poem . . . [Crane] identifies his poetry as a 'long-scattered score/ Of broken intervals' in a stanza that refuses to evade the necessary and generative violence that marks the origin and originality of his work" (<i>TS</i>, 268).
</p>

<p>
These Cranians expound the "deeper insight" of breakage, even as such critical recursions produce a sort of monolithic reading of Crane opposite to the violence and pathos and ruptures on which such analysis seemingly depends. In disavowing Crane's identification with any "positive entity," Dean's championing of the negative takes up a suspicious amount of space; and Edelman's detection in Crane of a "poetics that embraces the necessity of discontinuity" (<i>TS</i>, 269) seems, in its emphatic return throughout Edelman's study, similarly, uncannily continuous (which is to say, divergent from Edelman's commitment to the necessarily discontinuous). Recuperating the negative into something resembling a positive which itself goes unquestioned, however, forces Crane and his poetry (not to mention the persons and practices for whom Crane and his poetry always potentially, imminently stand in) into an impossible corner in which the positive/non-broken/continuous is without explanation verboten, even as the negative/broken/discontinuous acquires (if only covertly) the former's putatively hegemonic tendencies.
</p>

<p>
Contrary to such readings, and as evinced in poems such as "Possessions" and "Island Quarry," Crane's poetry attempts a sustained broaching of "positive entities," where the positive signals persuasiveness and value in its own right. (We will not know the full implications of what Edelman terms Crane's "ideology of rupture" or "poetics of negativity" [<i>TS</i>, 13] until Crane's poetics of positivity has itself been done justice.) This latter poetics would accommodate cohesion, and consistency, and non-dissolution, as well as non-<i>jouissant</i> joy which needn't have traveled through the circuitries of pain at all, to count not only as joyful, but as critically and/or poetically interesting. This poetics comprises a critical gap, which in part explains why "The Broken Tower" would remain unchallenged as Crane's final poem. Although few critics are as forthright as Bewley in admitting to the superstitions of finality, the last poem of a poet nonetheless records a sort of poetic last will and testament&#x02014;or in the case of a poet who kills himself, a suicide note.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Without necessarily wanting to vitiate the "last poem's" fetishistic magic, I want to posit an alternate ending to Crane's life and career, in "The Circumstance," a poem which extends the work of "Possessions" and "Island Quarry" in a last investigation into 

<b></b>

the mysteries not of dissolution, but of a curious, oracular permanence. (Whether the persuasiveness of finality is "legitimately" intrinsic to the text itself, or a theater borne from the text's readers, strikes me as tangential to the questions I am raising.) "The Broken Tower" was finished in March 1932, and may in fact be Crane's last <i>published </i>poem, but in April of that year, perhaps just days before drowning in the sea, Crane was writing "The Circumstance:"

In his analysis of "The Broken Tower," R. W. B. Lewis rues that "the voice of vision and of love" would be so definitionally short-lived, that "the vision begotten out of the almost intractable materials so desperately yet necessarily chosen had never endured for more than 'an instant.'"<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Plangently, his next paragraph begins, "Doubts and queries persist yet a little longer . . . " ("PHC," 417).<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
"The Circumstance," however, provides a model for a voice of love that lasts longer than an instant&#x02014;in Xochipilli, the Aztec god of flowers, love, games, beauty, song and dance, to whom the poem is dedicated. The poem, in fact, seems dedicated not to the god, per se, but to a statue of the god. Or rather, the qualities of the statue&#x02014;specifically, its non-<i>ekphrastic</i> stoniness&#x02014;are as reverenced as the qualities of deity that the statue represents: "A god of flowers in statued Stone . . . of love&#x02014;/ . . . stronger than death smiles in flowering stone . . . " Crane may be referring to an important sixteenth-century Xochipilli statue, exhumed from the side of the Mexican volcano, Popocatapel. 

<b></b>

As such, Crane's poem channels Emily Dickinson, who famously mobilizes Popocatapel as an emblem of igneousness:

<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
For Dickinson, Popacatapel exists as a recent discovery, which reaches Amherst as news. Crane, on the other hand, is living in Mexico on a Guggenheim fellowship; what Dickinson can only imagine as volcanic analogue to a person, Crane inhabits first-hand. Crane lives Dickinson's metaphor.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Part of the energy of "The Circumstance," advertent or inadvertent, derives from its animation not only of Aztec artifact, but of Dickinson's textualized volcano. Indeed, Crane's poem resonates with Dickinson's iambic trimeters (in turn a borrowing of hymn meter): "If you could buy the stones,/Display the stumbling bones/ . . . As they did&#x02014;and have done . . . " Is this metrical affinity to be taken as an echo of Dickinson, or a ventriloquizing, or a sort of curatorship? Are Crane's trimeters an extension or an imitation of the past? <i>As they did and have done. . . . </i>
</p>

<p>
The poem's insistence upon this metrical unit <i>(your unsuspecting shins . . . subtract and concentrate)</i> denatures the poem's movement; unlike "Possessions," "Island Quarry," or any number of Crane lyrics, "The Circumstance" does not follow the rhythm of thought or utterance, but rather takes the shape of an archive. Each iambic grouping has the quality of a shard, akin to the Aztec artifacts Crane digs up in Mexico.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  In contrast to these pieces, the poem's subject and dedicatee is a stone idol, imagined as intact. In this respect, "The Circumstance" is a different sort of encomium than, say, Shakespeare's sonnets. Both Shakespeare and Crane praise the durability of art, but the former imagines his sonnet as exemplary of that aesthetics impervious to temporality.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  By contrast, Crane calls attention to the reliquary quality of his own writing. Along these lines, Grossman aptly notes that "Crane invests the present not with the intelligibility, but with the unreachability of the past, and the past with the urgency of the present" ("HC&amp;P," 100&#x02013;1).
</p>

<p>
Insofar as "The Circumstance" reveres the "god of flowers in statued stone," it is not for the god's unity, but for its local, composite surfaces. The reliquary (a Cornell box, or Crane poem) imagines a space in which breakage is not privileged over wholeness, nor, however, vice versa: what is broken itself becomes an object of devotion, its own inviolable entity. The reliquary's logic, even in its nonsecular forms, would seem premised on a kind of belief different, say, from that of crucifixion (in whose ecstatic penetrations we find a model for Bersani's theorizations of sexuality). A logic, rather, premised on primordial petrifaction, as though there were no Xochipilli on which the 

<b></b>

statue were based, but in fact the statue were the god. Crane's poetic is difficult, here (not because metaphorical vehicles reach toward unavailable tenors, but) because it replaces synecdoche with a drastic literalism. The end of synecdoche is red by the death smiles in flowering stone, where the smile isn't synecdochal for a larger happiness, <i>and for this reason</i> cannot be taken for granted. "Eliot and others have announced that happiness and beauty dwell only in memory," Crane writes. "I call for a positive attitude!" (<i>LHC</i>, 117, 20 January 1923). Crane's positive attitude, what I call his optimism, involves a smile that outlasts its moment, to the point (stronger than death) of forsaking memory.
</p>

<p>
Indubitably, there remains much to be said about the relation between Crane's serial smiles and the optimism that Crane, more generally, seeks to imagine (if not against, then) beyond the pessimism of Eliot. Likewise there remains more to be said about the relation between the pessimism of Eliot and the theoretical optics through which Crane, more and less recently, has been read. More specifically, I think Eliot's dictum of poetic impersonality bears an important and as yet under-examined relation to modes of queer theory which have proved so productive and illuminating not only within a general field of literary investigation, but within the specific field of Crane criticism. Namely, that the poetics delineated by Eliot anticipates certain psychoanalytically informed strands of queer theory that are aligned with (if not founded on) a suspicion of ontological permanence.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  If the smiles of <i>White Buildings </i>have proved difficult to see, let alone adequately theorize, this lacuna seems itself an effect of the potential inflexibilities of a queer theory unable to see beyond its original commitments. I offer this essay as an echo of Crane's call "for a positive attitude." To this end, I offer it as a challenge for new ways of theorizing optimism, and by extension, as a challenge for queer theory to do justice to something as strange as Crane's smiles, to something as unthinkable as a non-ecstatic joy: a durable, serial joy whose durability serves not as grounds for suspicion, but the ground on which new, as yet unimaginably generous forms of queer theory might build.

Crane's fastidious differentiation between "positive" and "ecstatic" seems all the more salubrious in a critical climate that uncritically presumes Crane as an avatar of the ecstatic.

The ubiquity in queer Crane readings of such pronouncements both incites my own interest in imagining a non-ecstatic Crane, and suggests that the skeptical age invoked by Crane might presciently describe not only the time of Crane's writing, but the time of our own.

Catachresis, sometimes more loosely defined as a mixed metaphor, describes (from Quintilian, Puttenham, and on) "the practice of adapting the nearest available term to describe something for which no actual term exists." Metaphor, for Quintilian, involves <i>translatio</i>; catachresis, <i>abusio</i>.

For instance, Edelman's mobilizing of catachresis not just as a queer trope, but as a trope for a particular queer sensibility seems evident in his writing that "catachresis . . . as a verbal abuse . . . has the air of something dangerous and disreputable" (Lee Edelman, <i>Transmemberment of Song: Hart Crane's Anatomies of Rhetoric and Desire</i> [Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1987], 12, henceforth abbreviated <i>TS</i>). For more on catachresis, see Quintilian, <i>Institutio oratoria</i>, or more recently Patricia Parker, "Metaphor and Catachresis," in <i>Ends of Rhetoric: History Theory, Practice</i>, ed. John Bender and David Wellbery (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1990).

"Expressions of long duration&#x02014;certainly ten seconds or more, and usually 5 seconds&#x02014;are likely to be false. Most felt expressions don't last that long. Unless someone is having a peak experience, at the height of ecstasy, in a roaring rage, or at the bottom of depression, genuine emotional expressions don't remain on the face for more than a few seconds. Even in those extreme states expressions rarely last so long; instead, there are many shorter expressions. The long expressions are usually emblems or mock expressions" (Paul Ekman, <i>Telling Lies</i> [New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1992], 147). Ekman's work, motivated by thinkers such as Erving Goffman and Silvan Tomkins, extends the nineteenth-century observations of Guillaume-Benjamin Duchenne du Bologne's <i>Mechanisme de la Physionomie Humaine</i>. Darwin, also following Duchenne, likewise notes that indelible smiles might be a sign of idiocy. "There is another large class of idiots who are persistently joyous and benign, and who are constantly laughing and smiling. Their countenances often exhibit a stereotyped smile . . . " (Charles Darwin, <i>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</i> [Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1965], 197.)

To further hypothesize the relation between Crane's serialized smiles and his professions of affirmation, I would recall the very extent to which optimism, fundamentally, hinges on the futural mode. Optimism might designate that the future will be beneficent (in a Leibnizian theosophic register), but might also, more loosely, designate the contiguity of the future with the present; that is, that there will be a future which I, in my present form, will find recognizable. Further, that I shall be recognizable to myself, as will my feelings, as will my perceptions. Optimism, in this sense, would seem less an outlook, and less an affective position, than an epistemological ground, governed, in the case of Crane, by the lyric possibilities borne of seriality. Seriality, that is, would become the means within lyric poetry by which the experience of durability is imagined, if not obtained. I thank Irene Tucker for helping me (at least begin to) think through these complicated relations, to which I return in the larger project of which this essay comprises one part.

I mean, here, to distinguish the repetitiveness of Eliot's smiles from the repetitiveness of Crane's. The latter repetitiveness, I am arguing, is essentially accretive, whereas (consonant with a psychoanalytic logic of repetition), the former is compulsively (if ambivalently) undermining. As a more explicitly psychoanalytic formulation of what I ascribe to Eliot, consider Cathy Caruth's helpful observation (in a different context) that "[t]he accident is thus not a reality that can simply be known once and for all, but an encounter with the real that must take place each time anew in the accident of where the words happen to fall" (<i>Unclaimed Experience: Trauma, Narrative, and History</i> [Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996], 107).

One finds ample ambient support for this alcohol-criticism in Crane's own correspondence, for instance in the following June 1922 excerpt from a letter to Gorham Munson: "I feel an enormous power in me&#x02014;that seems almost supernatural . . . I can say this now with perfect equanimity because I am notoriously drunk and the Victrola is still going with that glorious 'Bolero'" (<i>O My Land, My Friends: The Selected Letters of Hart Crane</i>, ed. Langdon Hammer and Brom Weber [New York: Four Walls Eight Windows, 1997], 92, henceforth abbreviated <i>OML</i>). In his important essay "Danced Undone: Performances of Exhaustion and Resignation in Crane's Lyrics," John Vincent notes that for Riddel, exhaustion (as particularization of Crane's brand of failure) "happens to rather than is performed in Crane's poems" (Vincent, <i>Queer Lyrics: Difficulty and Closure in American Poetry</i> [New York: Palgrave, 2002], 130). Intoxication, following a Blackmurian trajectory, happens to and is performed in Crane's poems. Or rather, performance within Crane's poems implicitly (or as in the case of Blackmur, explicitly) is imagined as under the influence. Thus, Vincent's lucid analysis of exhaustion within Crane as phenomenological experience of interpersonal boundary nonetheless depends on the rush (the lush?) that speeds against boundary, and which sometimes breaks through. Exhaustion, then, becomes an affective ring of what is left after "self-shattering"  or "breach"  or outward radiation of waves" . Exhaustion is related to intoxication (alcoholic, anal, syntactical, or some composite of the three) as its endgame, and intoxication itself presumes a certain sort of flux, within Crane's poetry, as definitionally operative.

While Vincent's interest in exhaustion might seem like a comparable site of poetic inertia, his is a sort of "I'm too tired to move," which smacks of (drips with, smells like) the movement that has precipitated it (see Vincent's reading of Portapovitch's ballet shoes, <i>Queer Lyrics</i>, 122&#x02013;5); the formulations that interest me are extrinsic from the narrative of dissipation altogether. It is not, to recall a temporality described by Renu Bora, that one asks what made these formulations immobile; they could, it seems, exist in no other way.

See Tim Dean, "Hart Crane's Poetics of Privacy," <i>American Literary History</i> 8:1 (Spring 1996): "Crane's expectation that 'the audience for [his] work will always be quite small' . . . has been taken to support this interpretation insofar as the poet's audience is restricted to those with the capacity (derived from gay experience) to understand the connotations of Crane's 'homosexual code.' Indeed, 'The Tunnel' section of <i>The Bridge</i> invokes such a code in the form of the 'tearoom' sign of a lighted match, by which gay men secretly make themselves known to each other even today" .

This whiteness resonates with the "white wind" that ends the poem, as well as with the "white paraphrase" that ends the poem just preceding "Possessions," as well as with the adverbial "whitely" of "Lachrymae Christi," the poem that follows. These whitenesses in turn inform the book's title, <i>White Buildings</i>, the collective whiteness of which pays homage to the monstrous whitenesses of Melville and Poe. Doing justice to the relation between Crane's whiteness and theirs would require more space than this footnote.

Allen Grossman, for instance, honors the sonorities of this suicidal pathos. "The four-line poem called 'The Return' . . . was in effect a final communication, a suicide note. On one of the four manuscript pages relating to 'The Return' Hart Crane's mother, Grace Hart Crane, searching like so many others for the 'cause' of her son's death, notes (the annotation, now erased, is still sufficiently legible) that she found a version of this poem in his suitcase&#x02014;on top&#x02014;and asks whether it bears any 'significance to his death'" ("HC&amp;P," 87).

There is, more generally, an eerie blur in Crane's life between the literal and the rative, belied in the preponderance in his biography of allegorical names. His own name, Hart; his mother, Grace; the lifesaver candy invented by his father, a man whose poet-son drowns; a hometown named

Chagrin Falls, outside of Cleveland, a name shared by a metaphysical poet singled out for his (proto-Cranian) baroque extravagance, etc. (In fact, Clevelandism is nearly synonymous with catachresis, Crane's signature mode.

Such suspicions stem in part from the lessons of Foucault, for whom identity is inextricable from the taxonomic, and taxonomy inextricable from the oppressive. Within Crane criticism, this suspicion informs the work of many of Crane's most committed recent queer readers. For instance, Tim Dean claims that "Crane's poetic language does not aim to produce a homosexual self or subject-effect; on the contrary, it aims for an experience whose intensity shatters any self" ("Hart Crane's Death Drive," 3). Michael Trask suggests the extent to which non-permanence pertains not only to the suspicion of self-consistency, but likewise to the suspicion of consistency more generally: "Matter is conceived as dynamic and substitutive in the same way that those who labor on this matter are understood to be portable and disposable" ("Hart Crane's Epic of Anonymity," in <i>Cruising Modernism: Class and Sexuality in American Literature and Social Thought</i> [Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2003], 141). While shattering and disposability are hardly equivalent, both phenomena (in regard to persons, interpersonal relations, and objects) insist upon a liquidation of the unequivocal. This undermining of stability and concomitant privileging of instability&#x02014;to the point where equivocation could be imagined as the foundation of an ethics&#x02014;amounts, in Foucault's words, to a "hyper- and pessimistic activism" ("On the Genealogy of Ethics: An Overview of Work in Progress," in <i>The Foucault Reader</i>, ed. Paul Rabinow [New York: Pantheon Books, 1984], 343). Pessimism, in this case, denotes what Eve Sedgwick illuminates as an abiding paranoia that systems of care or versions of therapy are in fact extensions of coercion. (I'm thinking specifically here of Sedgwick's "Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading," in <i>Novel Gazing</i>, ed. Sedgwick [Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1997].) It is within these interstices that Crane's optimism seems in conversation not only with Eliot's pessimism, but proleptically, with that of Foucault and those who have followed this particular Foucaultian gambit. I do not mean to discount the contributions that the likes of Dean or Trask have made to either queer theory or Crane criticism, so much as to complicate and add to vocabularies and practices already at hand.
