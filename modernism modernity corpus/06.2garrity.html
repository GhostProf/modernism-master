One of the most startling aspects of the 1936 essay "Bloomsbury" by
British modernist Mary Butts is that the piece was originally rejected
on the grounds that the Group was not widely known in England.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 This perspective seems hardly credible today, particularly since the
 inception of the Group's popularity can be traced to 1920, when the term
 Bloomsbury began to circulate in newspapers and take on a life of its
 own. While Butts makes no reference to Bloomsbury's appearance in mass
 circulation periodicals during this decade, her prescient analysis of
 the Group speaks directly to the concerns of this essay--Bloomsbury's
 complicity in its own commodification through its glitzy appearances
 in British <I>Vogue.</I> Although Butts does not intentionally set
 out to investigate the Group's role as a mass-market phenomenon, her
 language inadvertently exposes Bloomsbury's status as a modernist
 spectacle capable of posing for <I>Vogue</I> and resolutely tied to
 market concerns. The words that Butts utilizes to discuss the Group's
 ideological positions--"synthetic" ("B," 37), "papier-mach&eacute;"
 ("B," 36), "copies" ("B," 37),"<I>essential</I> fake" ("B," 42)--stem
 from her conviction that Bloomsbury scorned a belief in "the absolute"
 and instead embraced a relativist perspective, deifing the simulacrum:
 "things made of one substance pretending to be things made out of
 another" ("B," 36). While Butts here reveals her own conservatism by
 fetishizing the alleged authenticity of the modernist product, her use
 of the language of artifice and her view that the Group was a "pretty
 wide corporation" that vigorously

<B></B>

sought to "impress itself upon the public mind" simultaneously introduce
the idea of reproducibility, a concept that is central to Bloomsbury's
position vis-&agrave;-vis <I>Vogue</I> ("B," 38). The Group authorized
the magazine to circulate its fashionable lifestyle in the commercial
marketplace by allowing its "beliefs and opinions [to] filter down
. . . to the mass of the people" ("B," 41). Although Butts condemned
the Group's modernist assumption that "you could make poetry out of
anything," it is precisely this blurring of the boundary between high
and low that enabled Bloomsbury to wage a successful self-promotional
campaign in <I>Vogue</I> ("B," 41). The magazine capitalized on the view
that "as individuals they have justified their fame" by reproducing and
circulating Bloomsbury's individual style to a mass audience, marketing
the Group's artistic products as commodities for selective consumption
("B," 38).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite the lingering view of the Bloomsbury Group as signifiers of high
culture's "intellectual elite"--an association premised upon an elision
of the marketplace--their splashy appearance in <I>Vogue</I> documents
that Bloomsbury was not isolated from the mass culture of the 1920s. My
observations are based upon archival research at Colindale, the British
Newspaper Library, where I looked at all of the issues of <I>Vogue</I>
between the years 1916 (when the magazine was launched in England) and
1941 (the year that Virginia Woolf died). I found that during the 1920s
the magazine was a fascinating cultural hybrid, juxtaposing articles
on fashion, homemaking, and cosmetics with a huge range of cultural
materials that we would today classify as "high brow." In particular, the
magazine was a veritable homage to the world of Bloomsbury, publishing
book and cultural reviews by, and about, a diverse range of critics and
artists associated with the Group: Virginia and Leonard Woolf, Clive and
Vanessa Bell, Vita Sackville West, Harold Nicolson, Roger Fry, Duncan
Grant, David Garnett, the Sitwells, G. E. Moore, Ottoline Morrell,
E. M. Forster, Desmond Mac Carthy, Raymond Mortimer, and John Maynard
Keynes. Although the magazine also ran articles by and about other
modernists such as James Joyce, D. H. Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield,
and Sylvia Townsend Warner, Bloomsbury was the key vehicle through which
the magazine attempted to disseminate cultural elitism to its affluent
readership. This essay analyzes how Bloomsbury, in particular the male
members of the Group, functioned as champions of English high culture to
<I>Vogue</I>'s elite female audience; it also seeks to demonstrate how
the dual ideologies of nationalism and imperialism intersect with the
magazine's popularization of British high culture and marginalization
of women's claims to modernity. <I>Vogue</I> in the 1920s invoked
imperial rhetoric and the language of avant-garde taste, simultaneously
capitalizing on the expansion of leisure industries in Britain (such
as the cinema, the wireless, organized sport, and escapist reading) in
order to commodify aesthetic value through "the mass popularization of
defiantly elite art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Most of the work that has been published on Bloomsbury as a "mass-market
 phenomenon" has focused on the period since the 1960s; <I>Vogue</I>
 provides evidence that the "Bloomsbury industry" can be traced to the
 years of high modernist production.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Recognizing that the Group was a marketable commodity, <I>Vogue</I>
 exploited Bloomsbury's intellectual, upper-class position by showcasing
 the

<B></B>

influence of their cultural views and the imposition of their taste
upon England's "national life"; as Jennifer Wicke succinctly puts it
"lifestyle is what Bloomsbury was selling."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My focus here will be on the representation of Bloomsbury's appearance, as
"personalities" as well as contributors, to British <I>Vogue</I>'s glossy
pages in order to trace this curious intersection between high and mass
culture that the popularization of modernism and the commercialization
of the Group underscores. This juxtaposition of high and low culture
invites us to explore some of the historical and material conditions
of the emergence of modernism, particularly in terms of its frequently
assumed antagonism to mass culture, allowing us to ask, How do various
social and market forces help to shape our perception of Bloomsbury,
and what roles do gender and Englishness play in this equation? In his
essay "Mass Culture as Woman: Modernism's Other," Andreas Huyssen has
begun to help us answer such a question by charting the male modernist
association of mass culture with the feminine and high culture with the
masculine. Although this paradigm has been extremely useful, it neglects
to take into account the ambivalent position of the woman writer for whom
the lure of mass culture was arguably a more complex, if not strictly
enabling, historical development, emerging simultaneously with greater
economic independence, more educational opportunities, and greater access
to the public sphere for women--to name only the most obvious examples.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 These structural changes in the material conditions of women's lives
 following World War I coincided in the 1920s with the emergence of
 a new female audience for mass-market entertainment such as films,
 best-selling novels, and popular magazines, all of which reflected a
 preoccupation with the modern woman. Margaret Beetham observes that
 the periodical, in particular, was at the center of an industry that
 gave employment to increasing numbers of women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Huyssen's essay, furthermore, does not address modernist women's relation
 to modernity, nor does it consider the position of the male modernist
 who does not repudiate mass cultural materials. Within the last decade,
 several critics have challenged the tenacious myth that modernist
 writers scorned popular appeal, refused to advertise themselves, and
 sought refuge from the commercial sphere.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 This recent proliferation of work demonstrates that, far from being
 opposed to the economy of production and consumption, canonical
 modernists such as Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, Henry James, Joyce and
 Lawrence were thoroughly preoccupied with marketplace concerns.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The evidence that male modernists self-consciously utilized and
 transformed the meaning of popular elements in their work does not prove
 that modernism was coopted by commercialism, but it does illustrate the
 limits of the argument that modernist writers were only contemptuous of
 popular forms. Such examples also clearly problematize the unequivocal
 gendering of mass culture as feminine, suggesting that what is needed
 is not only another way to talk about the canonical status of a male
 writer like Joyce

<B></B>

but also a new means of theorizing the ideological complicities between
modernism and popular or mass culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fredric Jameson's influential formulation of the interrelationship
between modernist high art and mass culture shifts the perspective away
from the conventional opposition in terms that transgress the putative
associations between mass culture and femininity, high culture and the
masculine. Jameson's reconceptualization of the binary system of value
does not address the issue of gender, but his argument that modernism
and mass culture represent "dialectically interdependent phenomena"
has important implications for feminist analyses of modernist cultural
artifacts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 His view that all cultural creation in capitalist society is divided
 against itself, pitting work that is presumed to be timeless, unique,
 and of high aesthetic value against the degraded status of mass produced
 objects, is particularly useful in the interpretation of a text like
 <I>Vogue,</I> which juxtaposes literary reviews of high modernist work
 by authors such as Stein, Eliot, Pound, Joyce, and Woolf with ads for
 commodities such as corsets, chin straps, and antiperspirants. While
 <I>Vogue</I> does not in every case praise the modernist emphasis on
 narrative complexity and obscurity--Mary MacCarthy, in a 1929 review,
 denounces Joyce's <I>Anna Livia Plurabelle</I> as "a little book of
 experimental nonsense"--for the most part the magazine is overwhelmingly
 promodernist throughout the 1920s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Jameson's contention that modernism's most fundamental feature is its
 "hostility to the market" is complicated by the fact that many modernist
 writers and artists, both men and women, willingly participated in the
 selling of high culture to <I>Vogue</I>'s elite female audience.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 In many ways, <I>Vogue</I>'s strategy of "marketing modernity" in the
 1920s resembles that of another Cond&eacute; Nast publication, <I>Vanity
 Fair,</I> which was similarly invested in "popularizing an aesthetic
 based largely on a demonstrated scorn for popular appeal."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Although <I>Vogue</I> is dependent upon the commercialism of the
 marketplace in order to survive, its editorial content repeatedly
 reflects an antagonism towards mass cultural markers such as
 accessibility and universal appeal. We see a prime example of this
 resistance to absorption by the mainstream in an editorial by Aldous
 Huxley, the magazine's cultural critic, called "The Perversion of
 Values," an invective against modern culture. Huxley argues that the
 "acceptable standards" have been perverted by those who "call things
 by the wrong names, labeling 'high' what should rightly be low, and
 'low' what ought to be high." This attack on society's democratizing
 impulses and misguided inversion of values speaks to the magazine's
 tacit objective--to rectify this inverted falsification of standards by
 isolating and elevating what Huxley calls "the old hierarchy," and what
 <I>Vogue</I> envisions as an affirmation of British aristocratic values.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 The magazine achieves this stabilization of "what ought to be high"
 throughout the 1920s by carving out a privileged cultural domain
 for modernist writers, artists, and their aesthetic principles. It
 accomplishes this, however, without publishing any modernist fiction
 itself, because during this time the space devoted to magazine fiction
 was in inverse proportion to the class of readers. Only less tony
 publications printed fiction regularly; <I>Vogue</I> published no
 modernist stories for its upper-class readers, though an occasional
 poem by H. D. or Edith Sitwell did appear.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although <I>Vogue</I> specifically targeted a cultivated upper-class
readership (Cond&eacute; Nast is well-known in magazine marketing history
for being one of the earliest pioneers of niche marketing) it would be
inaccurate to assume that the magazine is therefore not a product of
mass culture. Although <I>Vogue</I> never sold as many copies as some
other mass circulation women's magazines, it consistently led all of
its competitors in advertising revenue throughout the 1920s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Consistent with the unreliability of statistics for British magazines
 during this period, Caroline Seebohm documents the magazine's circulation
 in 1928 as 138,783 (<I>MV,</I> 282), and 141,424 (<I>MV,</I> 79). Either
 way, what is conveyed is that--in contrast to the little magazines
 of the period, which nurtured literary modernism but whose numbers
 ranged only from a couple hundred to a high of several thousand
 subscribers--<I>Vogue</I>'s circulation res and revenues clearly
 situate the periodical as a formidable market force.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 With five international editions by the mid-1920s--American, French,
 British, Spanish, and German--the magazine was actively disseminating
 its most fundamental objective on a global scale: "[to] conspire not
 only to get all [its] readers from the one particular class to which
 the magazine is dedicated, <I>but rigorously to exclude all others.</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 However, as Nast envisioned it, <I>Vogue</I> would appeal not
only to readers who were exceedingly wealthy but also to those who
actively aspired to be members of the upper class.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Linking the new consumerist orientation of readers to the notion of
 imperialist expansion, <I>Vogue</I>'s masthead in the period between
 the wars proclaimed, "VOGUE KNOWS NO FRONTIERS" (<I>MV,</I> 142). By
 cultivating an international market of "women of breeding," <I>Vogue</I>
 sought to disseminate a model of femininity in which appearance and taste
 were central. If, as Melba Cuddy-Keane argues, we define mass culture
 as a broad communicative system that posits a single speaking voice and
 a single audience that seeks to elicit and produce a uniform response,
 it becomes possible to read <I>Vogue</I> as a mass cultural product even
 though the magazine explicitly resisted the tactics of universal appeal.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The magazine, then, helps us to see how modernism was popularly read and
 legitimated, for this convergence of mass culture and modernist cultural
 production allows us to explore what Jameson calls the "conditions of
 possibility," the social and historical circumstances that enabled the
 phenomenon of the "great moderns."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Neither Jameson nor Huyssen, however, addresses the role that nationalism
plays in the construction of high or mass culture, nor do they discuss
how this collaboration intersects with the representation of gender. John
MacKenzie illustrates the degree to which popular cultural elements
such as advertising and the cinema continued to be suffused with the
ideology of imperialism, even though the idea of official propaganda
had to a certain extent been discredited in England after World War I.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> participated in the dissemination of a British world view
 espousing cultural and racial superiority by dividing the globe into
 "civilized" and "uncivilized" regions; several issues, for example,
 feature articles on exotic getaways to colonial outposts. Another crucial
 way that the magazine communicated the idea of national pride was through
 the representation of Woolf as a great writer and the celebration of
 Bloomsbury as upholders of England's cultural endowment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 The magazine's showcasing of

<B></B>

the Bloomsbury Group, I want to suggest, must be read in relation to what
MacKenzie argues is the pervasiveness of imperialism as an ideological
feature, a constituent part of modern British culture. <I>Vogue</I>
is steeped in the discourse of a popularly sanctioned nationalism
whose populism nevertheless undergirds class and national hierarchies
and that shapes the representations of those who participate and are
depicted in the magazine. The periodical, in this sense, can be read as a
representative, ethnographic document illustrating the various ways empire
is a widely-marketed cultural feature, inseparable from its depiction of
gendered and class-specific subjects. In order to clarify the nature of
Bloomsbury's presence in <I>Vogue</I> as an index to its relation to mass
culture, we must consider the Group's investment in nationalist rhetoric
that is inevitably inflected by gender. For Bloomsbury, mass culture
is enmeshed in a colonial imagination capable of equating conceptions
of lower classes and lower races, both of which are linked in complex
ways with femininity. Male Bloomsbury collaborates with <I>Vogue</I>
on a range of related constructions of Englishness, civilization, and
femininity, demonstrating how the Group's articulation of modernity
ultimately fails, as Julie Taddeo has recognized, to incorporate new
ideas about and attitudes toward women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Any discussion of Bloomsbury and mass culture must take into account not
 only the Group's Anglocentrism, but their relation to the structural
 gender asymmetry that informs a publication like <I>Vogue.</I> My
 argument is situated, then, within a cultural paradox: Bloomsbury was a
 modernist elite and officially anti-imperialist, and yet also involved in
 British popular culture and colonialist rhetoric. <I>Vogue</I> documents
 this phenomenon and provides a compelling example of how high culture
 utilizes mass cultural forms to disseminate its values.

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This essay seeks to assess the scope of the ideological contradiction
that Bloomsbury's appearance represents. As the magazine asked about
modernity, do "Feminism, Jazz, Prohibition, Cubism, The League of Nations,
Motorcycles, and other enthusiasms" point to cultural disaster or advance?
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 But before looking closely at these different ideological agendas,
 I first want to give a general sense of what kind of a periodical
 <I>Vogue</I> was and to consider to whom the magazine appealed and
 how femininity was represented to assess better what Bloomsbury's
 participation in this particular commodity form suggests about British
 high culture in the 1920s. The impetus behind the specific marketing
 and publicity structures employed by British <I>Vogue</I> during this
 period was the magazine's "Bloomsbury-ish editor," Dorothy Todd, a woman
 of distinctly literary, rather than fashionable, leanings (<I>MV,</I>
 204). From 1922-1926 Todd commissioned several modernist writers and
 artists to contribute to the magazine in an effort to elevate its status
 and expand its scope beyond fashion and beauty. Todd was eventually
 fired from her editorship in 1926 because she failed to make the magazine
 sufficiently profitable to its American owners, but during her

<B></B>

tenure she succeeded in securing an impressive array of contributors,
among them Virginia Woolf, who published five articles in <I>Vogue</I>
between 1924 and 1926, as well as several members of Bloomsbury. Although
the magazine's profits did flag under Todd's "literary regime,"
evidence suggests that another factor contributing to the opposition
to her leadership was homophobia (<I>MV,</I> 125). The morally rigorous
American editor of <I>Vogue,</I> Edna Woolman Chase, strongly disapproved
of "Miss Todd's personal proclivities, which were overtly homosexual"
(<I>MV,</I> 125). While there is no record of Bloomsbury's response
to Todd's lesbianism, we do have ample evidence of Woolf's hostility
toward the editor in her diaries and letters from this period. Woolf's
repeated references to Todd mark her as lower-class despite the fact
that the <I>Vogue</I> establishment regarded her as "too highbrow," and
she often moved in the same social circles as Bloomsbury--a culture that
was congenial to homosexuality (<I>MV,</I> 127).
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 If we consider Todd's lesbianism alongside Bloomsbury's embrace of
 bi-
and homosexuality, what is striking about their collaboration
 on <I>Vogue</I> is their silent collusion in the promotion of a
 heteronormative agenda. Whenever members of the Group are represented,
 their captions carry the words "wife" or "husband of" to ensure readers
 of their heterosexuality. Certainly nothing that evinced a homoerotic
 sensibility (e.g. Duncan Grant's virile male bodies, Lytton Strachey's
 writings) ever made it onto <I>Vogue</I>'s pages, which were silent on
 the issue of Bloomsbury's self-perceived sexual radicalism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the magazine depicts no trace of Bloomsbury's or Todd's
homosexuality, there is evidence to suggest that the Group was more
emotionally invested in her leadership than Woolf's caustic remarks would
allow. Vita Sackville West records Bloomsbury's protest to Todd's firing,
writing to Harold Nicolson, "We sat in the meadow [of the Woolf's house
in Rodmell] and discussed the future of Miss Todd. . . . This affair has
assumed in Bloomsbury the proportions of a political rupture" (<I>MV,</I>
127-8). While on the one hand this crushing response to the demise
of the Bloomsbury dynasty in <I>Vogue</I> may be said to illustrate the
limits of the Group's vision of political rupture, it also demonstrates
their commitment to Todd's high cultural agenda. Bloomsbury colluded with
Todd to attract an avant-garde readership, yet the magazine was still a
market-driven commodity that explicitly catered to an exclusive English
audience. As Cynthia White observes, <I>Vogue</I> "appeal[ed] to those
with extravagant tastes and ample resources"; its pages were flanked by
sumptuous advertisements featuring a glittering array of luxury goods
beyond the reach of all but the most affluent.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Despite the general postwar decline in the dominance of "high society"
 publications and the rise of a group of magazines catering to the middle
 and lower-middle classes, <I>Vogue</I> was completely unaffected by
 this profound shift in the women's press.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Although as an artist Woolf politically opposed the literary class
 system, neither she nor other Bloomsbury writers were frequent
 contributors to these new mass-market women's weeklies, which featured
 pulp fiction, horoscopes, advice and gossip pages, true-to-life stories,
 and fortune-telling columns. In contrast to such staples, <I>Vogue</I>
 offered elements that would appeal to the desires of an upper-class

<B></B>

British "lady," for whom aristocratic leisure and the embellishment of
the heterosexual body were central concerns.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although <I>Vogue</I> at times celebrates the modern woman's greater
possibilities, publishing an anonymous editorial on "Women and Education"
that urges readers to make endowments to women's colleges, the magazine
more often invokes antiquated models of femininity. <I>Vogue</I>
acknowledges "these times of 'equal pay for equal work,'" but it bemoans
the fact that "household science [has] lost its prestige," and longs
for the traditional man who will be "the protector and provider" for
his spouse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 An article on "Modern Womanhood" informs women that if they "wish
 to be adored, they must return to the tricks and manners they have
 abandoned," namely, "the flutters, the vapour . . . a tremulous lip,"
 any device that might restore men's "former prestige" and make them
 "feel more masculine." The magazine celebrates artifice as an essential
 accessory for the modern woman, but it utilizes the rhetoric of progress
 (one caption reads, "A Career for Women: Being Beautiful") to instill
 this idea in its readers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Thus the article "Woman Decides to Support Herself" is not about
 economic freedom, but corsets; the headline "Woman Claims a Masculine
 Prerogative" leads into an article on stylish women and walking sticks,
 not professionalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 An editorial by Huxley on "The Battle of the Sexes" conveys the cultural
 anxiety surrounding the disruption of established attitudes about
 femininity by critiquing the modern woman who, having secured the vote,
 now recklessly seeks to "refute all the old traditions." Huxley denounces
 this "excessive ardour" as a feverish form of "feminine patriotism,"
 claiming that it reflects women's recourse to "their lower selves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> does not unequivocally support a reactionary perspective
 on sex roles--indeed, it publishes Dorothy Richardson's meditation on
 men's disconcertion with the modern woman, "Women and the Future," in
 1924--but it does participate in a broad apprehensiveness regarding
 women's cultural transformation by producing a model of femininity that
 is both restrictive and progressive. In either case, its representation
 of women is ultimately nonthreatening to men. <I>Vogue</I> reflects
 the contradictory meanings of the female body in the 1920s at the
 same time that it popularizes an aristocratic model of femininity
 that assumes an identification between femininity and Englishness. In
 "The Quintessence of the Exquisite" (early July 1921), the magazine
 celebrates Englishwomen as the "justification of our civilization,"
 making explicit the relationship between middle-class femininity and
 national identity. The magazine's representation of Bloomsbury women
 perfectly corresponds to this equation of femininity with civilization, a
 conjunction that is consistent with the magazine's use of nationalist and
 racist rhetoric to construct women as the moral centers of the nation,
 "vital to the very existence of the race."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Several different articles in the 1920s anticipate the concerns of
the Englishwoman who wants to voyage to the colonies, but fears the
barbarism of the non-European world. <I>Vogue</I> participates in the
construction, as well as the displacement, of this fear. An editorial,
"My Cook Was an African," warns readers that servants in tropical Africa
sooner or later take to drink, but the magazine also works to reassure

<B></B>

women of "the essential Negro cheerfulness" of the native population.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 One article in particular, on Jamaica, argues for the prudence of
 the Englishwoman's wariness, "where the veneer of civilization lies
 thickest . . . you may encounter the real Unknown, bottled-up, seething,
 dangerously suppressed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 The magazine cannibalizes native cultures for the English observer,
 inscribing the civilized/primitive dichotomy, but it also works to
 allay the tourist's fears by reassuring her that there are pockets of
 civilization everywhere. An article on travel in India foregrounds
 the excellence of Indian servants, and another on safaris in Kenya
 cheerfully reports that "facilities for hairdressing in Nairobi are
 just as up to date and good as in London."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> reassures travelers that they will never be far from other
 Englishwomen of their social class--in Egypt they can be received by
 the wife of the British High Commissioner, in Kenya by the wife of the
 Commander of the Colony--nor need they be out of the cultural loop: a
 subscription to the Anglo-weekly, <I>The Sphinx,</I> will keep them
 posted of all "civilized" activities in Cairo. By advising readers
 on what to expect ("native boys cannot press pleats") the magazine
 constructs an image of the Englishwoman that asserts her ascendancy
 in a normative hierarchy, equating her with moral superiority, racial
 supremacy, and progressive ideals.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 One editorial in particular, on travel in Java, illustrates the
 insidiousness of the magazine's sacralization of the Englishwoman.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 The author here argues that the "antiquated ideas" of "the brown women
 of Java" would surely "make a few of their white sisters scream with
 horror," namely, "that a woman's chief role in the world is to perpetuate
 the human race." The writer, a woman, recalls photographing a group of
 "four brown and smiling little Eves" who happily display their nakedness
 to the camera. The ideological effect of the essay is to present the
 Javanese women as exotic contrasts to the world of the photographer
 whose technology captures their backward quaintness. The essay ends
 with a reassertion of the British author's moral superiority: "Happy
 unsophisticated country!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 What this and other articles repeatedly demonstrate is the veracity of
 Raymond Mortimer's assertion, uttered within the context of a review
 of Eliza Fay's <I>Original Letters from India (1779-1815),</I>
 that the "indominatable spirit of such Englishwomen has done much to
 make our Empire what it is."

<I>Vogue</I> provides us with an invaluable example of mass culture's role
in producing British high culture at the same time that it illustrates how
the denunciation of low culture is a prerequisite for the establishment
of such claims. For example, given <I>Vogue</I>'s frequent contempt for
best-selling authors, it is arguably significant that when Woolf was
showcased by the magazine in the mid-1920s, she was still an emerging
highbrow writer. Even though <I>Vogue</I> helped to construct Woolf as
a literary icon, it is an important feature of her desirability that
during this time she was not yet the best-selling author whose face
would grace the American cover of <I>Time</I> magazine in 1937. Aldous
Huxley's editorials frequently convey <I>Vogue</I>'s resistance to
popular "prejudice," and its desire to cast itself as an exemplar of
elite opinion. Writing for the magazine in late September 1924, Huxley
attempts to unravel the "mystery of the best-seller" by arguing that
the popular writer harbors "just the right

<B></B>

sort of vulgar mind" and adequate talent to produce books that are devoid
of intellect but overflowing with emotion and the "primary instincts,"
namely, "reproduction, self preservation, and gregariousness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Disdain for the unmediated body is another index of <I>Vogue</I>'s
 high cultural tastes; the magazine is reticent on such bodily female
 matters as menstruation, contraception, pregnancy, and menopause, and
 instead focuses on the female body as a vehicle for inner and outer
 transcendence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Contradictory messages to women are characteristic of the magazine, which
 operates simultaneously on literal and imaginative planes, addressing
 itself both to blue-bloods with a disposable income and to those who
 are only able to reimagine themselves as select members of a genteel
 class. Another article by Huxley, on "The Vulgarity of Modern Life,"
 crystallizes this double movement; here the author argues that "some
 human beings are naturally superior to others," but he qualifies his
 preference for "natural aristocrats" by claiming that their pre-eminence
 is not based upon birth or wealth, but rather on some elusive quality
 he terms "vitality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Huxley's remarks speak to the magazine's interest in cultivating a reader
 base that privileges refinement, whatever its actual income, while
 the language he invokes--"natural hierarchy," "essentially vulgar,"
 "natural commoners"--works to stabilize the dichotomy he seeks to
 deconstruct. Although several of <I>Vogue</I>'s articles convey the
 view that an abstract love of gracious living (not dependent upon
 income) is one form of indulgence, the magazine's preoccupation with
 the upper crust is based upon the necessity of the reader's literal
 consumption. The ads for indulgences such as the Elizabeth Arden salon,
 Parisian cosmetics, Rolls-Royces, and exotic vacations all confirm that
 <I>Vogue</I>'s target audience is people with money.

Huxley's discussion of "natural aristocrats" intertwines British
upper-class values with an idea of high culture, a move that is
recapitulated and amplified in <I>Vogue</I>'s representation of the
Bloomsbury Group. Bloomsbury's contributions to the magazine illustrate
the degree to which the male members of the Group, as transmitters of
high culture, are complicit in the magazine's dissemination of Englishness
and the marginalization of femininity. While there is still considerable
debate regarding the status and social significance of Bloomsbury, Raymond
Williams's contention that the group was at once against the "dominant
ideas and values" of the English upper class and "still willingly, in
all immediate ways, part of it" is evidenced by the group's appearance
in <I>Vogue.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Jennifer Wicke's interpretation of Bloomsbury as an "experiment in
 coterie consumption" is useful here since her analysis speaks both to
 the group's consumption of artistic products as well as "the marketing
 and consumption of their [own] art . . . and lifestyle."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Roger Fry's establishment of the Omega Workshop, an artists'
 collective that produced decorative objects, illustrates this point,
 but Bloomsbury's public display in <I>Vogue</I>--and its advertising of
 Omega products in the magazine's pages--are perhaps the best examples
 of what Wicke suggests

<B></B>

are their calculated self-promotion and exposure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Omega's bold colors and dynamic designs that invoked the style of
 Matisse and Kandinsky were a jarring intrusion upon <I>Vogue</I>'s
 representation of English prettiness and harmony, but despite Fry's
 desire to revolutionize English interiors, the decorations were primarily
 purchased by a select and relatively wealthy group of patrons. Often
 flanked by Omega products, members of Bloomsbury on several different
 occasions allowed their private world to be commercialized: an early
 July, 1923 article on the home of Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville
 West features a photograph of the couple among their sixteenth-century
 English antiques; the November 1924 issue treats readers to a photo
 spread of the interior of "Mrs. Woolf's house in Tavistock square,"
 featuring elaborate designs by Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell. Another
 layout, early March 1925, highlights the "Cambridge Rooms of Maynard
 Keynes," the influential Bloomsbury economist who believed in the
 Arnoldian doctrine of high culture, again spotlighting Grant's and
 Bell's decorative artwork.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> reproduced two of the eight life-size allegorical res
 (symbolic of the Arts and Sciences) that circled Keynes's room at
 King's College, referring to Grant's and Bell's execution as "the most
 successful that has been carried out in England during this century."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 In contrast to the pervasive critical disaffection for English art
 during this period, <I>Vogue</I> consistently upheld the value of what
 Patrick Brantlinger calls Bloomsbury's "aesthetic ethics or ethical
 aestheticism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to these photo spreads, <I>Vogue</I> gave ample space to
Bloomsbury's written work; Vita Sackville West was a regular contributor,
publishing several essays on contemporary writers such as D. H. Lawrence
and Elizabeth Bowen. In an article entitled "What Do Women Want From
Books?" Sackville West concludes that women are "born romantics" who lack
"that peculiarly male instinct for the classical tradition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Although, like other <I>Vogue</I> critics, Sackville West refuses to
 equate women's cultural production as equal to that of male artists,
 maintaining that women's emotive literary work "should be better
 corseted," she still functions as a popularizer of high modernism for
 her lay audience, effectively supplying <I>Vogue</I> consumers with
 the basics in literary criticism, "The story must no longer be like a
 picture in a frame, neat, complete, self-sufficient, entire; it must
 be a broken thing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 At the same time that she is an enthusiastic advocate of literary
 modernism, popularizing the idea that hierarchical cultural boundaries
 must be maintained, she herself visually functions as a signifier of
 aristocratic culture. The late July 1927 issue features a photograph
 of Sackville West's regal profile, celebrating her recent award of the
 Hawthornden Prize for her long poem, "The Land." Elsewhere, within the
 context of an article that showcases media-constructed taste--"Some of
 the Most Interesting Books of the Day" (early October 1923)--the magazine
 reproduces a painting by the late William Strang that captures Sackville
 West's striking stature and celebrates her unique ability to capture "the
 spirit of place" in her fiction. Vita's "place," of course, was Knole and
 Sissinghurst, a fact that <I>Vogue</I> later exploits when it publishes
 her article on "The Edwardians Below Stairs." This examination of the

<B></B>

utility of household servants concludes, "The house held them bound
within a small patriotism . . . the whole system was feudal. . . . But
it brought also its pride, its piety, its fulfilment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 This sense of national entitlement and class privilege recalls
 Clive Bell's remarks in <I>Civilization</I> that some people are
 "willing servants," ready to "make sacrifices for an ideal," and it
 also dovetails with <I>Vogue</I>'s assertion that "luxury is the toy
 of the modern Englishwoman."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 By utilizing Bloomsbury as the face of refinement and good taste, the
 magazine capitalizes on the Arnoldian idea that culture is the best that
 has been thought and said. Toward this end, <I>Vogue</I> published art
 and cultural criticism by Roger Fry, Leonard and Virginia Woolf, and
 Clive Bell (plus critiques of their publications), as well as reviews of
 books by Lytton Strachey, E. M. Forster, and David Garnett. Like Vita
 Sackville West, several of these Bloomsberries also were featured as
 celebrity tastemakers, allowing their photographs to be mass-marketed
 to <I>Vogue</I>'s readership.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Although, like Virginia Woolf, the Bloomsbury Group appeared several
 times in the magazine throughout the 1920s, <I>Vogue</I> illustrates
 the degree to which gender is a determining factor in the construction
 and circulation of one's mass-produced image.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While one might argue that Bloomsbury's contributions to the magazine
reflect a democratic impulse, particularly in view of the male fear
that participating in mass culture is a form of emasculation, this
reading does not take into account the publication's class bias, or how
male contributors such as Fry and Bell typically serve as authorities
on femininity. This gender asymmetry was a factor in the composition
of Bloomsbury from the beginning and is also a reaction against the
pervasive assumption that "the feminine" was a pejorative category in
art criticism during this period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Although much modernist art criticism regarded Fry's Omega products
 as purely decorative and therefore denigrated them as effeminate, in
 <I>Vogue</I> the critic and his objects commanded a level of attention
 that suggested English art was fueled by a masculine ethos.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 The clearest example of the institutionalization of male ascendancy in
 <I>Vogue</I>'s pages is the treatment of women artists, particularly
 Vanessa Bell.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Fry celebrates Bell in the February 1926 issue, placing her "in the
 front rank of British painters of today," but his praise is launched
 by reference to those skeptics who believe that women are "incapable
 of first rate creative work in the visual arts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> singles out Bell and Grant as "the two most brilliant"
 artists of the period, but their work is subjected to differential
 assessments; only the evaluation of Bell is informed by a larger
 gender-biased discourse about the inferiority of women painters.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Fry's essay is a direct attempt to debunk this myth, but the assertion
 of binary conrations of value reappear in articles such as Augustus
 John's "The Woman Artist," where he applauds female painters who produce
 "honestly feminine" work, not surprisingly, because they threaten
 "no encroachment on man's domain."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> singles out Vanessa Bell and Marie Laurencin as the most
 important female artists of the day, undoubtedly because both women's
 work conforms to "feminine" expectations; the magazine reproduces none
 of Bell's abstract work and instead displays paintings that are of
 maternal and domestic subjects. Fry acknowledges Bell's

<B></B>

double marginality, arguing that her success is all the more remarkable,
given the modernist devaluation of English art, because she is "not only
a woman, but an Englishwoman."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Clive Bell echoes this pronouncement, identifying his wife as the only
 woman among the seven most important contemporary English painters
 (Grant and Fry being two others) who are forging an "unmistakably
 British . . . national tradition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What emerges, as one considers the range of Bloomsbury's contributions
to <I>Vogue,</I> in addition to the obvious incestuousness of their
self-promotion, is the concerted, if unconscious, effort to put forth
the view detected by the reviewer of Leonard Woolf's <I>Hunting the
Highbrow:</I> that "the White Hope of England" is the "intellectual
highbrow."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 While Leonard Woolf himself does not utilize this precise phrase, the
 racialized characterization of the highbrow (and the assumption of a male
 subject) speaks to the spirit of his volume and, more generally, captures
 the magazine's representation of the Bloomsbury Group as champions
 and exemplars of "civilized" English thought and living. In <I>Hunting
 the Highbrow,</I> Woolf aligns himself with his wife's antipublicity,
 antibestseller bias, arguing that "the highbrow is genuinely attracted
 by elements in literature . . . which may conveniently be called
 aesthetic, and which are not primarily interesting or attractive to
 the great public."
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Also like Virginia, he utilizes the language of reproduction to
 characterize the excesses of the lower class. In contrast to the
 lowbrow whose senses predominate and who produces book after book
 that is "comprehensible [and] entertaining" to the "majority of their
 fellow-countrymen," Woolf claims that the highbrow is characterized
 by his self-control and literary moderation, "the highbrow is a very
 slow-breeding animal; he is rarely prolific; he is often in favour
 of and practices birth control; and there are not very many of him
 who are actually writing books in any generation. The problems of
 over-population do not, therefore, apply to highbrow literature"
 (<I>HH,</I> 25). Woolf is convinced that if only "men would allow
 intellect and reason rather than passion" to regulate their bodies,
 "sordid ugliness and misery would disappear from society" (<I>HH,</I>
 50). In an interesting juxtaposition, the same <I>Vogue</I> review of
 <I>Hunting the Highbrow</I> contains a discussion of Robert Graves's
 volume, <I>Impenetrability,</I> an impassioned defense of the English
 language and English ways of thought. Yet unlike Woolf, who advocates
 for the surveillance of popular tastes, Graves argues against the
 recently formed "Society for Pure English" on the grounds that it is the
 "literary equivalent of political Fascism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 Graves's claim that "at no period have the cultured classes been able
 to force the habit of tidiness on the nation as whole" (<I>I,</I> 31)
 contrasts with Woolf's proposal, which favors the dissemination of the
 English highbrow's standard of "aesthetic merit" (<I>HH,</I> 29). It thus
 makes sense that an earlier review by Leonard Woolf provides <I>Vogue</I>
 readers the literary equivalent of what he terms "caviare [for] the
 twentieth century": a fresh translation of Plato's <I>Symposium,</I> a
 volume of religious meditations by Francis Bacon, and a new edition of
 James Boswell's letters. Undaunted by the fact that these books are not
 likely to be on the shelves of many <I>Vogue</I> readers, Woolf tracks
 the concept of the "civilized" and urges consumers to partake in the
 "delicious meal" that these volumes offer.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During this interwar period in England, <I>Vogue</I> did indeed seek to
enforce "the habit of tidiness on the nation" through its dissemination,
to borrow Deirdre Lynch's phrase, of "domestic nationality," the view
that the home was a reflection of "little England."
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> readers would recognize this aestheticization of the private
 sphere in terms of the love and acquisition of English <I>things</I>
 such as servants, domestic comfort, luxury objects, manicured gardens,
 and access to national culture and celebrities. Clive Bell's reference
 to the consolidation of a "national tradition" asserts the importance
 of promoting Englishness, an objective consistent with <I>Vogue</I>'s
 mission and particularly evidenced by the magazine's elevation of
 Bloomsbury as a nationally intelligible referent of high culture. One
 anonymous 1922 editorial in particular anticipates Q. D. Leavis's attack
 on mass cultural pursuits in <I>Fiction and the Reading Public</I>
 . The <I>Vogue</I> editorialist bemoans the democratization of
 public opinion, attributing what he calls the "tyranny of the masses"
 to the rise of newspapers, telephones, and the cinema, all of which
 allegedly have contributed to a general mediocrity and "uniformity
 of opinion" that is ruining the nation. In contrast, this reviewer
 asserts, "the English aristocrat [is] the apostle of personal liberty,
 the sworn enemy to popular prejudice" (Early November 1922). <I>Vogue</I>
 invites us to read Bloomsbury, prime upholders of individual liberty and
 antipopular sentiment, as the heirs of this aristocratic tradition. If
 Aldous Huxley could caution against the dangers of a "consciously
 cultivated nationalism" in its pages, the magazine could nonetheless
 capitalize on Bloomsbury's role as promulgators of national culture to
 individual consumers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 In an editorial on "What the English Read," <I>Vogue</I> singles
 out several members of Bloomsbury (namely Forster, Woolf, Garnett,
 Nicolson, and Strachey) as the "minute number of the elite" who exhibit
 "the finest and most exacting taste in the world." Unconcerned about
 its universalizing claims, the magazine declares that their "influences
 have been very marked, not only in England," but around the globe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I>'s perception, as well as construction, of the hegemonic
 influence of the Group explains why, in April 1941, long after
 Dorothy Todd's editorship at <I>Vogue</I> had ended, the magazine ran
 a photograph of Woolf's "bomb-spliced home [with] Duncan Grant's and
 Vanessa Bell's murals on public view"; the accompanying article bemoans
 the wartime destruction of these "national treasures," suggesting that
 with the bombing of the author's private home civilization itself is
 being threatened.

This allusion to "civilization" raises an important issue, particularly
within the context of Raymond Williams's contention that Bloomsbury was
founded on a belief in the sovereignty of the "civilized individual"
and an aversion to "public show" (<I>BF,</I> 165).
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 Williams recognizes Bloomsbury's political engagement and involvement,
 but he argues that the group's "social conscience, in the end, is
 to protect the private consciousness" (<I>BF,</I> 167). A remark by
 Duncan Grant helps us to understand how the group may have reconciled
 its cultivation of private conscience with its compromised

<B></B>

participation in the Englishness of the <I>Vogue</I> agenda. In response
to those who opposed the Group's participation in the magazine, Grant
maintained "if Bloomsbury has real pearls, they can be scattered anywhere
without harm."
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 This statement speaks to the Group's investment in a kind of cultural
 paternalism that inculcates its value of private sensibility on a
 national level through the venue of a lady's magazine. Bloomsbury
 achieved this through its ideological dissociation between the public and
 private sphere. For example, the Group's hostility to both militarism
 and imperialism did not prevent their association with a magazine
 that, in 1924, devoted several pages in two separate issues to the
 propagandistic British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, which reproduced in
 miniature the entire resources of the British empire and was intended
 to foster inter-Imperial trade, open new markets for British products,
 and demonstrate to the people of Britain their almost illimitable
 possibilities overseas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> ran many photographs of this colossal 220-acre colonial
 spectacle--visited by over 26 million people--displaying the Exhibition's
 palaces of Industry, Architecture, and Engineering, and showcasing the
 pavilions, among others, of Burma, Nigeria, India, and Hong Kong. Several
 ethnographic exhibits of "primitive peoples" provided visitors with
 distractions, such as the recreation of a scene from "native African life
 . . . in the Gold Coast," which appeared "strange to European eyes,"
 or the West African tableaux that featured a reproduction of reclining
 "natives at home" armed with "primitive weapons."
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 Some displays actually housed indigenous peoples; as Brian Street
 observes, the exhibition was understood to have pedagogical value
 for the English visitor, contrasting a modern, civilized self with a
 non-European, primitive Other.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I>'s text reveals that visitors to Wembley could tour the
 "dominions" by sampling "native dishes" in the Exhibition's many
 restaurants: one could lunch in South Africa, take tea in India, and
 dine in New Zealand, Australia, or Canada.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Virginia Woolf visited the Exhibition with Leonard and even published,
though notably <I>not</I> in <I>Vogue,</I> a critical essay that imagined
its fantastic destruction, so it is important to clarify that appearing
in the magazine does not necessarily imply that one condones or endorses
its content.
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 One doubts, for example, that Woolf was consulted in 1927 when the
 magazine quoted from <I>To the Lighthouse</I> in an article on "Cooking
 Within the Empire," using Mrs. Ramsay's French stew, improbably, to
 argue that English cooks should internationalize their kitchens by
 using colonial products.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 Appearing in <I>Vogue</I> may not have constituted a clear endorsement of
 the Empire, but it did put its contributors in a politically precarious
 position, particularly given the Anglocentric nature of Bloomsbury and
 its commitment to creating, in Leonard Woolf's words, a new world based
 upon "rational" and "civilized" relations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Although Leonard himself spent seven years as a district administrator
 in Ceylon (1904-11), he went on to produce three important
 anti-imperialist tracts during the 1920s; when <I>Vogue</I> singled
 him out for its "Hall of Fame" in late January 1924, it did so in part
 because of his "vast knowledge of imperial politics," though no mention
 was made of his stocks and shares in "imperial ventures."
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>
 This kind of contradiction

<B></B>

is thrown into relief by <I>Vogue,</I> which documents the fact that
despite Bloomsbury's general anti-imperialism the Group was ultimately
unfazed by its association with a magazine that consistently represented
the British Empire as the best form of internationalism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Vogue</I>'s profiling of Wembley's exoticism is only the most striking
example of the magazine's imperial content and its representation of
the English encounter with, and appropriation of, the Other. The 1920s
was a decade in which <I>Vogue</I> high society embraced a range of
non-European materials; the Russian ballet was a tremendous influence
in the world of fashion and design; Englishwomen adopted the Oriental
look, wearing Turkish trousers, Egyptian turbans, and Japanese kimonos.
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>
 Everything Black was "the rage," from Josephine Baker--whom the magazine
 celebrated as "a woman possessed, a savage intoxiated with tom-toms"--to
 black and white interiors, Babangi masks, African bangles to the elbows,
 and "all-coloured revues."
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I>'s obsession with ethnographic objects extends to the
 joys of consumer tourism; several articles urge readers to vacation
 among "simple, primitive" African cultures and to visit the "barbaric
 splendors" of the Orient.
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
The lure of trips to colonial posts held particular appeal for the
English, for as <I>Vogue</I> put it in an article on South Africa, the
"prophecies of the early colonists have been more than fulfilled."
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 The travel articles never mention race or indigenous populations, unless
 it is to stress their exoticism or mark their nonhumanness, and instead
 the magazine spotlights England's tremendous "civilizing" achievements
 abroad. One woman offers an account of the difficulty of being the mother
 of a debutante in an outpost of empire, assuring readers that there will
 be British ladies "of social standing" to help "guide their daughters
 through their first season." Elsewhere, a woman on an expedition to
 Kurdistan advises English visitors to avoid the "smelly and dirty"
 Kurdish harems, while another, upon learning that girls are put into the
 harem at age twelve, erupts: "Such is the perversity of the Orient!" As
 Inderpal Grewel has argued, Englishwomen during this period tended to
 respond to the harem as a space of not only confinement but inferiority.
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>
 This perspective is consistently upheld by <I>Vogue</I>'s representation
 of colonial women; the colonies are imaginatively possible as tourist
 attractions only because England had made them habitable. One essay on
 South Africa, in particular, clearly demonstrates this view. The author
 asserts that "no where have the more liberal principles of British
 Imperialism been so strikingly manifested" than South Africa, boasting
 that over 800 million pounds of gold and diamonds have been mined, but
 no mention is made of the exploited indigenous manual labor.
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>
 Throughout <I>Vogue</I>'s pages, the advertisements echo these
 achievements of empire, promoting the power and influence of Britain
 through the fetishization of national commodities: consumers can book
 flights on "Imperial Airways," purchase portable typewriters known as
 "The Imperial Good Companion" (its parts "made entirely in England"),
 and drive an expensive Empire Car. As one jingoistic ad for petroleum
 succinctly puts it, British products are "a guarantee of quality" so
 "Buy British!"

magazine's representation of Bloomsbury situates the Group at the center
of this ideological juncture, demonstrating both their fascination
with primitivism and orientalism as art modes, and their contempt
for non-Western opinions and values. A range of examples documents
Bloomsbury's relation to exoticism. <I>Vogue</I> celebrates "the influence

 Clive Bell, like Huxley, puts out a "plea for No More Jazz" on the

 In the 1920s Woolf recorded her attendance at "the Niggers' show in
 Chelsea," an exhibition of "obscene" sculpture from the Ivory Coast
 and the Congo that generated much interest and controversy (<I>D,</I>

 <I>Vogue,</I> but his influence, as well as his ambivalence toward
 African objects, permeates the magazine's pages.
<SUP><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></SUP>
 Like other modernists, Fry's praise for the primitive was couched in
 assumptions about the superiority of western culture; his view that
 African art is the product of peoples but not "culture in our sense of

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Cumulatively, what Bloomsbury's appearance in <I>Vogue</I> illustrates
is an engagement with "primitive" materials, an intermittent disdain
for non-European peoples, and an investment in marketing culture and
"civilized living" to a certain class of English individuals. Despite
Clive Bell's stated contempt for unabashed consumerism,

<B></B>

the congruence between his tracts on civilization and <I>Vogue</I>'s own
commercial objectives is striking. In <I>Civilization: An Essay,</I>
Bell links consumerism with degradation, seeing the two as deplorable
markers of a lower-class mentality. In contrast to those who embody a
"will to civilization," the average British working class man obsesses
about commodities, a result not of economic need but of his ignoble
character and lack of ambition (<I>C,</I> 262).
<SUP><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></SUP>
 Startling about this assessment is not only Bell's classism but
 also his blindness to his own commodification by <I>Vogue.</I> One
 of the magazine's objectives under Todd's leadership was to keep
 its mass upper-class audience up to date on cultural events; more
 than any other Bloomsberry, Clive Bell serves as the cheerleader and
 translator of avant-garde aesthetics for a popular audience. Revered
 by the magazine as a cultural celebrity--the late October 1924 issue
 celebrates him as "the most remarkable" art critic in Europe--Bell's
 reviews elevate <I>Vogue</I>'s market savvy by packaging and urging
 the consumption of high art: French paintings at the Tate; designs by
 English Post-Impressionists at London Galleries; shows by Picasso,
 Cezanne, Braque, Matisse, and Seurat; and surrealist, futurist, and
 dadaist exhibitions. Throughout the 1920s he functions as a curator of
 and guide to modernist art, representing radical modernity in easily
 consumable bites.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Speaking broadly, both Bell and British <I>Vogue</I> concur that
civilization consists in self-expression, good manners, leisure,
a discriminating taste for beauty, an appreciation of the arts,
and a dislike of vulgarity. Significantly, both assume that strict
social stratification between the classes is needed to secure England's
civilization. The first of Bell's two books on civilization, <I>On British
Freedom,</I> was reviewed by <I>Vogue</I> in the early October 1923 issue,
when the author was praised as "a champion of our decaying liberties."
<SUP><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></SUP>
 Bell's hierarchical theory of civilization stipulates that "no one
 . . . can become highly civilized without a fair measure of material
 security" (<I>C,</I> 209), and the only way to ensure this security is
 through a service class that will maintain "the existence of a leisured
 class" (<I>C,</I> 210).
<SUP><a NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">99</a></SUP>
 According to Bell, civilization is by nature an "artificial" construct
 (<I>C,</I> 173), <I>requiring</I> the existence of a "civilizing elite"
 because "only a leisured class will produce a highly civilized" society
 (<I>C,</I> 217). While I do not mean to suggest that Bell's controversial
 theory of civilization is representative either of Bloomsbury's views
 as a whole or Woolf's in particular, one might argue that his vision
 of an insulated, "highly civilized . . . nucleus" (<I>C,</I> 260) of
 economically privileged individuals who create civility by, literally,
 "forming groups" (<I>C,</I> 171) sounds a lot like Bloomsbury.
<SUP><a NAME="REF100" HREF="#FOOT100">100</a></SUP>
 Bell's theory is popularly disseminated by <I>Vogue</I> both through its
 pervasive assumption that its readers constitute a civilizing elite and
 its message that to be completely civilized one must, as Bell puts it,
 possess a "taste for excellence," "be free from material cares," and
 accumulate "some of the superfluities of life" (<I>C,</I> 208, 209, 211).
<SUP><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></SUP>
 An editorial by Aldous Huxley on "The Dangers of Work" alludes to
 Bell's theory by passionately arguing for the virtues of a leisured
 class. Huxley here proposes that the dignity of labor is considerably
 overrated; he provides a corrective to this model by urging the English
 public to reinstate an "ideal leisured society" that will "cultivate
 the graces of the spirit" and protect culture "from the

<B></B>

effects of popular prejudice." Like Bell, Huxley believes that leisure
enables people to cultivate "good taste and an open mind," and also like
Bell, he naturalizes the hierarchy by stipulating that certain people
have a "hereditary right" to their leisure-class status.
<SUP><a NAME="REF102" HREF="#FOOT102">102</a></SUP>
 It is crucial to recognize that Bell's theory of civilization does not
 define itself in terms of the formation of a nation-state but rather
 through the influence and dissemination of the individual mind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></SUP>
 This focus on "private consciousness" recalls Williams's observation
 that Bloomsbury's ideological commitment was to "the supreme value of
 the civilized <I>individual</I> whose pluralization, as more and more
 civilized individuals, was . . . the only acceptable social direction"
 ("BF," 165). Williams's word here, "pluralization," unintentionally
 alludes to a crucial aspect of the Group's appearance in <I>Vogue</I>:
 the multiplication of a culturally produced image of, to use Bell's
 phrase, "highly civilized men and women" distributed through newsstands
 and into people's homes through mass circulation (<I>C,</I> 172). Like
 Bloomsbury, the magazine understood itself to be a civilizing agent, "a
 living force in all of the civilized corners of the world" (<I>MV,</I>
 142).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Neither Bell nor Williams adequately theorizes the gendered aspect of
Bloomsbury's social vision, leaving unexamined what the central term,
civilization, might mean for women in the Group.
<SUP><a NAME="REF104" HREF="#FOOT104">104</a></SUP>
 Although Woolf was privately critical of Bell's views in her diary,
 her letters to him reveal a very different response, referring to
 <I>Civilization</I> as "brilliant, witty and suggestive . . . full of
 really new and original things" (<I>L,</I> 3:438). Woolf's evaluation of
 Bell's theory is characterized by ambivalence, a response reflected in
 her remark about women's relation to civilization in <I>A Room of One's
 Own,</I> where she refers to women's split-consciousness as occupying
 a position precariously both in and outside of culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF105" HREF="#FOOT105">105</a></SUP>
 As Brian Shaeffer recognizes, the widest rift between Bell and Woolf is
 over the role of women in civilization. Bell writes that he "has heard
 ladies say that the measure of a people's civility is the position it
 accords to women," but his tract is an extended argument against this
 position (<I>C,</I> 24). He sees women as a "means to civility," not
 its objective, an antifeminist premise that Woolf clearly would have
 repudiated (<I>C,</I> 238). Like Bell, and Bloomsbury in general, Woolf
 subscribed to the notion that "civilization is more of an individual
 than a collective phenomenon," but her feminist critique of empire
 ultimately positions women as the only truly "civilized" subjects.
<SUP><a NAME="REF106" HREF="#FOOT106">106</a></SUP>
 In contrast, Bell's view that women execute a purely utilitarian cultural
 function suggests that the only authentically "civilized" subject is
 male, a perspective that corresponds to Huxley's critique of "women
 of leisure" in his <I>Vogue</I> essay, "The Dangers of Work." There,
 Huxley nostalgically bemoans the days when "there were still men of
 leisure" in society, arguing that "man's real place is in the home
 . . . [where he can] exercise his native powers of abstraction." The
 assumption here, of course, is that women have passion only for the
 concrete, the immediate, and the practical, a view that the magazine
 upholds through its refusal to level all differences between the sexes
 and its submission of women's artistic production to masculine standards
 of value. <I>Vogue</I> illustrates the degree to which popular markers
 of femininity inform the commodification

<B></B>

 of the female artist, and it amply demonstrates the complicities
 between Anglo-modernist practice, mass consumption, and the rhetoric
 of Englishness.

Raymond Williams's contention that Bloomsbury represented the development
of "a new style" is a specific reference to the Group's embrace of
frankness, sexual tolerance, and intellectual honesty, in short, classic
Enlightenment values ("BF," 165). But the phrase also describes how
Bloomsbury, as disseminators of English style, left a profound mark on
<I>Vogue</I> throughout the 1920s. The magazine celebrates liberty, the
sworn enemy to popular prejudice, as a referent for English high culture,
revealing that the Group's celebration of the modern, civilized individual
is not separate from the contaminants of capitalism, imperialism, and
privileged consumption. <I>Vogue</I> provides us with a prime cultural
artifact that documents how, despite Bloomsbury's political involvement
and altruistic sympathies with the working class, their real affiliation
was with members of their own class. One detail in particular documents
this vividly. By sheer chance, Woolf's appearance in the May 1926 issue
coincides with the General Strike in England; not coincidental, however,
is that the magazine makes no reference to this ten-day conflict or
to the ruthless government suppression that ended it. Bloomsbury was
certainly not as apolitical as <I>Vogue</I> on the issue of the Strike,
but Woolf's comment regarding the return of "social normality" at its
conclusion captures the Group's understanding of civility: "We're going
to have a strike dinner and drink champagne with Clive, the Frys, and
other spirits" (<I>L,</I> 3:262).
<SUP><a NAME="REF107" HREF="#FOOT107">107</a></SUP>
 Bloomsbury's appearance in <I>Vogue</I> provides a frame for this
 champagne moment, conveying the degree to which the Group's political
 sympathies are always class inflected and inevitably mediated through the
 pleasures of consumption and individual refinement. Bloomsbury may never
 have acknowledged that it marketed "civilized" living, but <I>Vogue</I>
 testifies to this fact, illustrating the Group's complicity in the
 popular transmission of British high culture. As Mary Butts so astutely
 put it over sixty years ago, "Civilization is their business" ("B," 44).

meticulously researched book documents the fact that, unlike in the United
States where circulation res and advertising revenues were readily
available during the early decades of this century, such information was
extremely scarce in the United Kingdom. He does provide some statistical
res for <I>Vogue:</I> the total net paid circulation of the magazine
in 1930 was 133,931 while that of <I>Better Homes and Gardens</I> was
1,390,660; but that year the former took in $3,012,593 from advertisers,
while the latter took almost half a million dollars less, $2,515,353
(153-4). Although the Audit Bureau of Circulation was established
in Britain in 1931, long after it was accepted in North America, only a
few magazines submitted to the independent audit during the 1930s. Reed
points out that only in the 1950s and 1960s are British circulation
res completely reliable. In writing about the years 1921-1940, he
recounts that publishers were very "coy about publishing their advertising
rates, let alone their audited circulations. Readership surveys seem
to have been regarded as arcane and an unnecessary luxury" . This
view is substantiated by Caroline Seebohm, who recounts that in 1920

Nast's view that cross-identification would compel readership was not

the large majority of readers of popular women's magazines during this

they enjoyed were predominantly "middle-class publications." What this

"Women and Education," <I>Vogue,</I> early February 1921. This editorial
anticipates Woolf's own concern for women's intellectual freedom in <I>A
Room of One's Own</I> and was timed to coincide with an announcement
that the Queen would accept an honorary degree at Oxford. <I>Vogue</I>
writes, "The women's part of the university will never possess the spirit
which alone justifies Oxford's existence, until it has acquired the same
freedom, intellectual as well as social, which characterizes the men's
part." It was only in 1919 that the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act
was passed, admitting women to many professions, such as the bar. The
editorial on education is one of the few that unambiguously praises
women's progress in the 1920s. This decade, after all, gave women
their sexual freedom through the work of Marie Stopes and her birth
control clinics and political freedom through the vote. No article on
Stopes's efforts was ever published, nor did the magazine document how
the vote put five million more women in a position to help elect the
second Labour government, which fought unemployment. For <I>Vogue</I>,

the example of <I>Vogue</I>'s linkage of women's freedom to consumption
pervades women's advertising. The recent Kenneth Cole campaign is but
one demonstration of this; in the company's spring 1998 catalogue, an
ad for leather purses carries the caption: "We the people . . . know
it's a woman's right to choose. After all, she's the one carrying it."

The language here is from an ad for a diuretic tonic, Kruschen Habit,
marketed to women as a product that would benefit not only themselves,
but posterity; beneath a full-page drawing of a mother and her child,
the caption reads, "On the safeguarding of women's health depends the
future of our race." This advertisement ran in the late March 1918 issue
of <I>Vogue</I> and is consistent with the magazine's rhetoric elsewhere
during the war years that equated women's health with the well-being of
England. While the rhetoric of nationalism is most blatantly invoked
during this period to sell women on both the idea of rationing (the
lead for a fashion article is "Why It Is Most Patriotic to Affect the
Slim Silhouette") and the concept of economy (one editorial announces
"The Newest National Sport, Is Called Conservation"), <I>Vogue</I>
inculcates the virtues of national pride well beyond the war years.

There is, of course, a large population of those known as "coloured"
people as distinguished from the negro. These are mulattoes, or
half-breeds, and all who have obviously some white blood in them. They
regard themselves as superior to the pure black and large numbers of them
are eager to prove that they are pure white, in spite of very visible
evidence to the contrary. Under English rule, which is that usually given
to a Crown Colony, they are, take it all round, very fairly contented, in
spite of a rebellion or two last century in which a very limited number
were engaged.

This editorial illustrates the centrality of the photographic image
in the construction of a civilized self. The author recalls wandering
through magnificent botanical gardens, and recounts this dialogue:
"Someone said, 'I imagine the garden of Eden was like this,' and
another said, 'Eve will not be very difficult to find. Prepare your
cameras.' He went up to a group of pretty girls, spoke to them in Malay,
and gave them ten cents each. They straight-away slipped out of their
sarongs and four brown and smiling little Eves stood in the sunshine
amid the flowers!" (Princess Achille Murat, "A Fortnight in Java," 3
April 1929) A policeman then intrudes upon the scene, but rather than
interrupt this exploitative moment, the group "gave him fifty cents and
asked him to prevent people from stepping between our cameras and the
garden of Eden, which he complied with." Ellen Strain, "Exotic Bodies,
Distant Landscapes: Touristic Viewing and Popularized Anthropology
in the Nineteenth Century," <I>Wide Angle</I> 18, no. 2 (April 1996):
70-100, discusses photography's touristic implications, arguing
that the western possession of technology helped distinguish the leisured
tourist from the commodified Other.

Bridget Elliott and Jo-Ann Wallace, <I>Women Artists and Writers:

contains a press photograph of Vanessa Bell wearing an Omega dress of her
own design (plate 55). Bell anticipated that her designs for the Omega
Workshop would be a "great success," but this dressmaking scheme never
materialized; see <I>Selected Letters of Vanessa Bell,</I> ed. Regina
Marler (New York: Pantheon, 1993), 174. Woolf's shocked response to
her sister's Omega dresses perhaps gives some indication of why the
venture was never a success: "My God! What colours you are responsible
for! Karin's clothes almost wrenched my eyes from the sockets--a skirt
barred with reds and yellows of the vilest kind, and a pea green blouse
on top, with a gaudy handkerchief on her head, supposed to be the very
boldest taste. I shall retire into dove colour and old lavender, with a
lace collar, and lawn wristlets" (<I>Letters 2</I>:111). Despite this
evidence of Bell's interest in the marketplace, like her sister, she
exhibits considerable professional anxiety about public recognition and
retains a belief in the public/private split. Her confession to Duncan
Grant--"It's awful selling pictures <I>in person</I>"--situates her in a
position analogous to Woolf's own, that is, interested in making money
but repulsed by the publicness of that exchange (<I>Letters of Vanessa

in maintaining a sexual boundary, making the claim that only male poets

"exception" to this rule, rather than an occasion to interrogate the
premise of her argument. Similarly, in Herbert Farjeon, "The Mystery
of the Woman Playwright," <I>Vogue,</I> 5 March 1930, the notion that
female authorship is inherently limited remains unquestioned: "Why is
it that women (speaking generally rather than particularly) cannot write
plays? . . . What bluestocking even with a room of her own in Blooomsbury
can claim to have achieved in drama anything approaching the position
of Virginia Woolf?" Throughout <I>Vogue</I>'s pages, Woolf is celebrated

"men have mechanics" while women have only "machinations." Elsewhere,
however, the magazine repeatedly appeals to women's interest in machinery;
<I>Vogue</I> is packed with ads for refrigerators and electrical lights,
as well as articles on airplane travel and automobile ownership. In
general, the magazine eroticizes women's relationship to technology
whenever possible. Thus, for example, an article on the woman driver's
point of view features a secret car compartment that opens to reveal
a powder-puff, mirror, and cigarette case, with the following copy:
"the only thing nowadays that may cause the slightest perplexity to the
woman motorist . . . is the question of lubrication" ("Round and About,"

Among the women featured on the magazine's "Women of Distinction"
page (early October 1924) are H. D., Stein, and Rebecca West, none of
whom, like Woolf elsewhere, returns the camera's gaze. In contrast,
a 1923 photograph of D. H. Lawrence--in a suit and tie, arms folded,
gazing seriously into the viewer's eyes--exemplifies the magazine's
representation of the male artist as a re of authority. This is
consistent with the magazine's photographic representation of the male
members of Bloomsbury. An unsigned essay on new books, published in early
October 1923, features a photograph of Clive Bell, wearing a hat, gloves,
overcoat, and walking stick, staring directly into the camera. Beneath
his image is a photo of David Garnett, similarly suited and also gazing

"The Feminine in Art," early March 1922, which makes the case that
"typically feminine" paintings are delicate, in good taste, and reflect
a feeling for that which is small, immediate, and domestic. In other

Augustus John, "The Woman Artist," <I>Vogue,</I> 18 April 1928. Given
<I>Vogue</I>'s anxiety about women's professionalism, it makes sense
that the magazine would only select paintings by both Bell and Marie
Laurencin that reflected a "feminine" perspective. It is certainly
true that a large number of Bell's paintings are of mothers, children,
and domestic objects, and Laurencin herself identified her style as
quintessentially feminine. The magazine echoes this sentiment, putting
Laurencin's drawings on its covers in the 1920s and gushing about her
work: "So feminine, so personal is she that we cannot help thinking of
her as the sister of Sappho" (Polly Flinders, "Marie Laurencin: A Graceful
and Melancholy Temperament Reflected in Pictures of Young Girls, Nymphs,
Nosegays, and Wild Animals," <I>Vogue,</I> late January 1925). Despite
this surprising allusion, there is no overt or subtle reference to
homoeroticism in the evaluation of either woman's paintings. Despite
Fry's critique of the double standard, he still attends to "the woman's
point of view" in Bell's work. For a discussion of the work of women
artists and modernism, see Gil Perry, <I>Women Artists and the Parisian

Street does not write explicitly about the British Empire Exhibition
at Wembley, but his discussion of the Japan-British Exhibition of 1910
elucidates the ways in which the exhibition, and the photographic images
and postcards that accompanied it, "[are] to be understood within this
construction of a modern, civilized self in contrast with a primitive
'Other'" (Brian Street, "British Popular Anthropology: Exhibiting
and Photographing the Other," in <I>Anthropology and Photography
1860-1920</I>, ed. Elizabeth Edwards [New Haven: Yale University
Press, 1992], 126). Street argues that these "ethnographic shows were
seen not simply as 'entertainment' but as having educational value:
through them British society learnt about the 'other' peoples of the
earth. Members of 'savage' countries were taken to England and other
European societies in remarkable numbers to be viewed as specimens or
zoo-like exhibits, to satisfy curiosity and to reinforce the confidence
of the public in their own 'progress'" . Geoffrey Hewlett reveals
that several exhibits housed not reproductions but indigenous peoples,
such as the British Guiana and West Indies display that featured "natives
. . . working at various crafts," or the "spectacular" India Pavilion,
in which "Tibetan dancers gave a continuous performance" (Hewlett, <I>A

Wembley extended over fifteen miles of roadways with names chosen by
Rudyard Kipling; the exhibition grounds also featured art galleries, a
small basilica, an amusement park, and even a scenic railway. John Allwood
provides some interesting details about Britain's self-promotion at
Wembley, pointing out that one of the most widely remembered exhibits was
a giant statue in the Canadian Pavilion of the Prince of Wales, President
of the Exhibition, made entirely of butter--a colonial product. He also
reveals that the official symbol for the exhibition, a lion whose design
reflected the current preoccupation with "things Egyptian," was widely
critiqued on the grounds that it was "very un-English and, therefore,
exceedingly disturbing" (Allwood, <I>The Great Exhibitions,</I> 129).

The Woolfs visited the British Empire Exhibition on 29 May 1924; see
<I>The Diary of Virginia Woolf, 1920-1924</I>, ed. Anne Olivier Bell
(London: The Hogarth Press, 1978), 2:305. Woolf's essay, "Thunder at
Wembley," was first published on 28 June 1924. In this piece Woolf pits
nature against the presumed culture of Wembley, imagining its destruction
at the hands of "some malignant power" that arises, undetected, out
of the sky, and ends with a conflagration: "Colonies are perishing
and dispersing in spray of inconceivable beauty and terror. . . . Ash
and violet are the colours of its decay. . . . Humanity is rushing to
destruction, but humanity is accepting its doom. . . . The empire is
perishing; the bands are playing; the Exhibition is in ruins" (Woolf,
"Thunder at Wembley," <I>The Essays of Virginia Woolf,</I> ed. Andrew
McNeillie [London: The Hogarth Press, 1994], 3:413). We can situate
Woolf's essay within the larger context of what John M. MacKenzie
describes as the intellectual elite's hostility toward Wembley: "The
exhibition was derided by intellectuals, who formed the WGTW, Won't Go to
Wembley, Society" (<I>Imperialism and Popular Culture</I>, 8). An example
of this critique in <I>Vogue</I> is an article by Osbert Sitwell, which
denounces the Exhibition on the grounds that it eclipses Britain's role
in the "smothering" of native cultures. However, the proliferation of
visual images of England's imperial strength is so overwhelming that his
comment is ultimately ineffectual. Even Sitwell acknowledges that there
are multiple "pleasures to be found" among the displays, where a variety
of manufactured goods derived from colonial raw materials were for sale
(Osbert Sitwell, "The Empire Exhibition," <I>Vogue,</I> late June 1924).

"The Truth about Jazz," <I>Vogue,</I> late August 1926. Only a few
articles in the 1920s highlight black performers, and in each case
the representation is rife with racial stereotypes. "The Negro de Nos
Jours," <I>Vogue,</I> late February 1925, contains several caricatures
of men and women performing the Charleston; the text reads, in part:
"In the 18th century we made money out of negroes. In the 20th they make
money out of us. We used to send them missionaries, now we send them
telegrams." The article, "Enter, The New Negro, a Distinctive Type,"
<I>Vogue,</I> late April 1925, asserts that "the Negro . . . no longer
has to be either a Pullman car porter, or over-fond of watermelons, in
order to be a successful type on our stage." In "The Truth About Jazz,"
jazz is revealed to be a "return to Nature," but not "the elegiac Nature
of . . . our eighteenth century ancestors," but "Nature red in tooth
and claw, the Nature of the jungle and the swamp" where the "penalty for
a moment's negligence" is death. For a discussion of Josephine Baker's
performance that foregrounds her self-conscious manipulation of cultural
tropes, see Wendy Martin, "Remembering the Jungle: Josephine Baker and

Marianna Torgovnick, <I>Gone Primitive: Savage Intellects, Modern
Lives</I> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990), 85-104,
devotes a chapter to Roger Fry's politics and aesthetics. Torgovnick
argues that reading Fry on the primitive is "like witnessing a tug of
war: on the one side . . . is the innovative Fry, free of contemporary
prejudices; on the other side . . . a Fry who thinks and speaks in the
rhetoric of colonialism" . Despite Fry's limitations, as Torgovnick
points out, he was the premier art theorist in Britain and virtually
the first who was willing to follow the French avant-garde in treating
African objects as art. Christopher Reed, <I>A Roger Fry Reader</I>
(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 232-45, offers a
fresh interpretation of Fry and discusses the critic's relation to
the primitive. Although <I>Vogue</I> neglects Fry's essays on African
art, it does celebrate Carl Einstein's <I>Negerplastik</I> as the
definitive book on "negro sculpture," applauding the text for being the
first to discuss at length the importance of African art even though
"its intrinsic value is still less appreciated in England" than on the
continent. See Einstein's appearance in "The Hall of Fame," <I>Vogue,</I>
late December 1925.

with an occasional reading of Miss Corelli and Michael Arlen . . . and

I focus on Bell's remarks in <I>Civilization</I> because he is more
direct in his assessment of the problems with civilization here. In his
dedicatory preface to Woolf--his "dearest Virginia"--Bell situates the
book in relation to <I>On British Freedom,</I> seeing the two as one
conceptual piece; indeed, the conclusion of <I>On British Freedom</I>
reverberates throughout the introduction to <I>Civilization.</I> Bell
actually calls laborers "slaves," then qualifies his statement by
saying--"people, I mean, who give some part of their surplus time and
energy to the support of others" (<I>C,</I> 209-10).

It is only when there come together enough civilized individuals
to form a nucleus from which light can radiate, and sweetness
ooze, that a civilization becomes possible. The disseminators of
civilization are therefore highly civilized men and women forming groups
sufficiently influential to affect larger groups, and ultimately whole
communities. . . . A civilizing nucleus becomes civilizing when it
is sufficiently numerous and powerful to colour the mass. [<I>C,</I>

For a discussion of Woolf's views on civilization, see Shaffer,
"Civilization in Bloomsbury," 73-87. Shaffer discusses Bell's
theory of civilization and its relation to Bloomsbury; he also details
Woolf's ambivalence towards Bell's controversial ideas. Although Woolf was
privately critical of Bell's book, it is interesting to note the parallel
between his reference to fifth-century Athens as "civilization . . . at
its best" (<I>C,</I> 152), and her comments that, "Roger [Fry] is the
only civilized man I have ever met. . . . If Bloomsbury had produced only
Roger, it would be on a par with Athens at its prime" (<I>L,</I> 3:566).

Bell argues that in order to maintain this nucleus of civilized
individuals, society must support "inequality as a means to a good," but
he goes on to stipulate that money alone is not an adequate determinant
of who should comprise the leisured class (<I>C,</I> 214). For Bell,
what is required in addition to material security and leisure is the
"will to civilization," or, as he puts it, "the desire for pleasure
refined and intellectualized" (<I>C,</I> 256).

It is in the mind of man that we must seek the cause and origin of
civilization. Not laws nor customs nor morals nor institutions nor
mechanical contrivances, as we discovered from a glance at savage
communities and the British colonies, can create it: such things cannot
make civilization because they are made by men. It is the mind, the
individual mind, which conceives, creates, and carries it out. It is the
influence of a number of minds, thinking and feeling sympathetically,
which fashions, unconsciously and unintentionally as a rule, societies
and ages. [<I>C,</I> 172]
