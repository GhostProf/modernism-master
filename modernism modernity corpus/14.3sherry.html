<p id="lead">"Authenticity" picks up meanings that range from originality to legitimacy, from a sense of generative or instigating force to a quality of genuineness. With those associations, we agreed in the seminar, the term reveals its usefulness, arguably its necessity, to the discourses and polemics that attend the development of any new group, especially a group putatively identified with "making it new." Even if the "authentic" cannot be attached as a value to any one aesthetic object or property, it became clear in our conversations that the concept of the "authentic" has functioned irresistibly—sometimes naïvely, sometimes preemptively, sometimes ironically—in a good deal of the writings associated with modernism. </p>

<p>I'd like to turn this consideration toward an inquiry into the relation between the "authentic" (so claimed) in modernism and a sense of <i>time</i>. It became clear from our discussion that the modernist claim on the New was bound up inextricably with its sense of Now. This relation is sometimes one of opposition, where the "authentic" needs to be rescued from the duplications of modern mass culture. No less often, though, there is a synergistic linkage: the quality of the "authentic" or "genuine" or "original" represents the pressure of the "contemporary," it speaks with a feeling for this certain "moment," it registers one special "period" with some accountability to the standard of the reliable witness. A timely representation of the modern: this is the understanding of the identity and importance of modernism that most of us try to implement as teachers and scholars.  </p>

<p>A number of us try accordingly to frame the time of modernism. In the work I've done over the last twenty years, for 

<b></b>

 representative instance, I can see a trajectory, really a motive design, that has been leading me back to something like a moment of historical origin. This work goes in historical reverse, beginning with the two <i>Dictionary of Literary Biography</i> volumes I edited on then (1984–85) contemporary British and Irish poets, which led to a book on the contemporary British poet Geoffrey Hill, which tried to establish a context for this work in later modernist, or neo-modernist, poetics; then a book on Pound and Lewis and the politics of their aesthetics, which concentrated mainly on the late 1920s and early 1930s; then a book on the major work of 1922, Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>; then a long stretch of work on the literary and political culture of the Great War of 1914–1918, which resulted in a book on that event as a shaping occasion of the work of Woolf, Eliot, Pound, Stein, and Ford, and a Cambridge Companion I edited on the literature of the war. Currently I'm working on a book that takes modernism back into the 1890s, a study more or less of modernism and decadence. If I keep going like this, eventually I'll be working on modernism and Stonehenge. </p>

<p>Even if we understand "origin" as just the farthest horizon we can see, not an originating site, we seem to be reaching toward an historical point at which we can know (what we call) "modernism" as a unique or definite thing, as something different from what had gone before. And while the watershed fallacy is something we expose week by week in teaching a survey course, where we have to invent a crisis or shake-up to expedite our consideration of the "unique intensity" of every period or micro-period, I think it can be fairly said that the major modernist writers of the 1910s and 1920s were animated powerfully by this sense of <i>difference</i> between their own moment and what had gone before, taking "what had gone before" as representative of traditions and conventions which various modernists for various reasons wished to overthrow or reorient. If "modern" derives etymologically from <i>hodie</i>, "today" or "this day" in Latin, then modern<i>ism</i>, as the "ism" of "today" (my spell-check keeps trying to turn "todayism" into "toadyism"), is a feeling that involves a sense of the special present, a radical Now, some imaginative understanding of <i>this moment</i> being unlike the preceding one, or indeed any other. How to be the valid—authentic—witness to this condition? A negotiation for this quality of timely authenticity is undertaken in a revealing way at a particular moment in the history of high modernism. I'd like to frame an analysis of this episode with a more wide-ranging consideration of an identifiably modernist experience—and construction—of time. </p>

<p>A special time consciousness haunts modernism in the form of a preoccupation with the unique interval of the decade, first the 1910s, then the 1920s. The most conspicuous and now controversial sign of this preoccupation has been that often quoted and randomly floating signifier "The Men of 1914," which centered the decade in the moment coinciding with the outbreak of the war and took that watershed event as the marker of a special time consciousness that is owned preemptively by males. Now, a good deal of scholarly work has been undertaken in the last twenty-five years or so to revise our understanding of the chronology of modernism and to expand its census of representative members, including a good number of women writers previously unacknowledged or underappreciated. Raymond Williams among others has encouraged 

<b></b>

 us to see how arbitrary and tendentious has been the effort in the academic study of modernism to limit its representatives to the pyrotechnical poetics of res like Pound and Eliot, Yeats and Joyce, taking these artists as though spontaneously born in the decades they claim as their sites of originating "authenticity." Williams, substituting in his own way a "gradualist" for a "catastrophist" model of cultural history, argues that the major formal innovations of the period could not have occurred without the lessons and models of a realism and naturalism extending well back into the nineteenth century; once this background and resource is acknowledged, a far broader array of literary attitudes and practices may be brought helpfully under the heading of "modernism."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Marianne DeKoven extends this sensibility in questioning a closely focused periodization as a category of understanding and analysis of modernism, demonstrating alternate and complementary points of origin, if you like, "authenticating sites," in a number of female writers—Gilman, Stein, Chopin—that establish the charter documents of modernism in a trans-decade, trans-Atlantic and bi-gendered poetics.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  The long view of literary history that these critics enjoy of course allows for inclusions and continuities in the record that the original protagonists might be expected not to see, even to overlook, in their struggle for self-definition in the close confines of the moment, where attitudes that appear to us now as variations on a single theme might appear to them as divergences and exceptions. And so, in our understanding of the artists' ambition to claim a "special-time consciousness" as the authenticating condition of their group sensibility, it is worth looking back to the decades in which "the decade" served the purposes of these early twentieth-century time keepers of modernism, acknowledging the ten-year measure as arbitrary but the need as legitimate. </p>

<p>The decade is a bracketing unit, and the sense of a parenthesis, of time contained and defined as special and so limited but also overshadowed and even fated by its imminent end, starts to characterize the historical feeling and the feeling of history in the world of Anglo-America between the wars. This time consciousness is fostered in some significant part by the presentiment in the 1920s that Europe wasn't really done with war, that it was only waiting between wars (this foreboding shows across the spectrum of modernist authors, from Virginia Woolf to David Jones to Wyndham Lewis, to take the widest variety of sensibility possible). At such moments of high tension, this sense of time-in-crisis, of history coming to critical mass, reverts to the "last days" mythology that Frank Kermode identifies in the apocalyptic subcultures of medieval Christendom and traces through <i>The Sense of an Ending</i> as the radical template of our experience of time in literary fiction.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  And always this sense of time-in-crisis, of the surcharged Now, imparts to the literature of its moment the aura of the extreme, the special, the new and unduplicated, i.e. the authentic. </p>

<p>It is the decade that seems to provide the frame within which this feeling of the special present can be experienced, so to speak, most authentically. The ten-year period allows at once for locality and expansiveness, being short enough to have a particular feeling attached to it and long enough for this feeling to acquire a form of consciousness, a history and even a memory, when, of course, by the laws of the contemporary, which are also the laws of the authentic, which disallows self-imitation, it is outgrown—even 

<b></b>

 if it is outgrown unwillingly, with resistance. But the use of the decade as the mark of one's own group's special identity was of course anticipated by writers in the British 1890s, a nucleus of authors who were, arguably, the first to think of themselves as a group in terms of a local, delimited moment of history.  </p>

<p>The 1890s marker for these authors is not a retrospective arrangement on the part of twentieth-century cultural historians; the decade was already and first of all the primary frame of identity and unity among res as different otherwise as Beardsley and Beerbohm and Wilde. One of the early scholarly works on the decade (written by a near contemporary), Holbrook Jackson's <i>The Eighteen Nineties</i> , documents the time consciousness, the period-feeling, in the major players' representation of themselves individually and as a group.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  This group feeling was fostered in one especially forceful way by the assignably "tragic" quality of the artists of this generation—the early deaths, the premature demises, have the power of abrupt finales and so provide a way (in historical retrospect) of sealing the period off; there seems to have been no "petering out" of that fated decade.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Yet this is also a powerfully present sentiment for the players in the 1890s. Living in the last decade of the last century before the last century of the millennium, these authors were dominated powerfully by this sense of an ending; this feeling was echoed and reinforced in Britain with the re of the aging, long-dying queen, muse and icon for the aging, long-dying empire. Coming into their first maturity in the moment when history is winding down: here is the counter-rhythm special to this decade and generation. This paradox, this conceit of growing up already and quickly dying, becomes the wit and darkening jest of this decade's brief generation. Already in 1896, in his preposterously posthumously titled <i>The Works of Max Beerbohm</i>, the author, then 24 years old, signs off on the last page of the volume, in his aptly titled "Diminuendo." Citing the short but florid history of <i>The Yellow Book</i>, modeling his artistic character on the febrile exhaustion of his friend Beardsley, the emergent author retreats from literature at the very height of his first trajectory—on this last page of his first book: "Once . . . I wrote a little for a Yellow Quarterly and had that <i>succes de fiasco </i>which is always given to young writers of talent. But the stress of creation soon overwhelmed me. . . . I shall write no more. Already I feel myself a trifle outmoded. I belong to the Beardsley period."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  </p>

<p>If the fellow travelers in the unique and original moment of modernism are going to find a set of companion talents, then, it is in the 1890s cenacle. But, if they're claiming to be unique and original, they might well be inclined to push away such affiliation, both as a threat to their own originality and as a reminder of the transient character of any work that claims its own time as its authorizing basis—to push it away, that is, as a memento mori. There are other points of contact and resistance, especially in a male modernism typified by Eliot and Pound, who, as Cassandra Laity has pointed out, differ significantly and revealingly from res of female modernism such as H. D. In Laity's analysis, the feminine sensibility typified by H. D. extends and refines the trends of female narcissism, androgyny, homoeroticism and gender-role reversal that had entered the literary imagination through a pan-European decadence and that survived well into the English 1890s, most particularly in Swinburne; whereas a 

<b></b>

 masculinist modernism opposes these proclivities in ways that suggest their underlying anxieties about gender identity and sexual orientation.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The "effeminacy" typified so conspicuously in Wilde offers the most sharply marked target for these concerns, which, of course, emerge as concerns mainly or only because of an affinity that is intimated already and beforehand (these concerns certainly emerged without Pound becoming a public moralist of any conventional stripe and long before Eliot ascended the altar of Anglo-Catholicism). Gender identity provides just one center of attention in which the resemblance of the later decade's sensibility to the earlier one is confirmed even—or especially—in being contested. </p>

<p>I offer the modernists' relationship to the 1890s, or, rather, the modernists' negotiation of their relationship to that earlier decade, as one of the most interesting and revealing locales in the process and struggle of modernist identity formation. It is a likeness at once claimed and disclaimed; the identification is occasionally affirmed directly but more often, and more revealingly, affirmed when it is resisted. Some of the modernists obviously live out the span of the literary history and so embody the problematic of generational identity: Yeats, for primary instance. Eliot, to put the problematic in another way, produces a fascinatingly contradictory record of his own relation to the earlier decade. In "Tradition and the Practice of Poetry<i>" </i>, he maintains that there was no sufficient critical mass of 1890s verse in the first years of the century to influence him in any significant or measurable way. Similarly, in the mid-1920s he writes a letter to Pound disclaiming any formative connection between his verse and that of Swinburne, a poet of <i>decade</i>nce who reverts ever to membership in the 1890s <i>decade</i> (these emphases point up the stuff, not of etymological connection, since the two roots have the different meanings of "fall" and "ten," but of the verbal play that Eliot and Pound both make of the sound-alike formations, clearly linking the two references). Nonetheless, he writes two essays on the work of Swinburne, which are passionate in their discriminations, and he returns elliptically but insistently to the poetry of John Davidson, Ernest Dowson, Lionel Johnson, Arthur Symons, and Yeats to some degree, as the poets first doing in England the specific sort of thing he (and Pound) would later be trying to do.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Yet the poet whose self-assigned role as exemplar and chronicler of his own brand of modernism is the one who provides the most revealing record of this negotiation—Pound. </p>

<p>Consider the first number of the <i>Egoist</i>, 1 January 1914. Pound has just wrested control of the magazine (formerly the <i>New Freewoman</i>) from Dora Marsden and is using it to introduce to literary London the upstart but already institutionalized energy of his group. This is a moment that reads now, and then, as a prime time of the new movement's "authenticity." If the term suggests in this context both originality or firstness and a legitimate and so recognized and even established character, Pound's claim on these qualities is obviously complicated by the prior history of the 1890s group—at once the model and the nemesis of his own generation's "unique" identity. And so the somewhat strenuous exertions as he devises this parallel manqué in the lead editorial. Here Pound elaborates this contrast between his group and the young men of the earlier decade: 
<b></b></p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"A generation came down to London resolved to speak as they wrote." For all that disastrous decade men spoke with the balanced sentence. There was great awe in the world.</p>
<p>And then there came to London a generation that tries to write as it speaks—and these young men are termed petulant—a praise by faint condemnation?<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The echoing is designed obviously to intensify the sense of difference within the similarity between the 1890s and the 1910s. This difference is more willed and rhetorical than substantial or imaginative, however. Especially revealing here is the taunt Pound uses, ostensibly to assert the convention-dismaying freshness of his generation, as he contrasts their (supposed) poetics of live speech with the (reputed) artifice of the English fin de siècle: "And in the face of this are we in the heat of our declining youth expected to stretch the one word <i>merde </i>over eighteen elaborate paragraphs?" ("FP," 9–10). If this sounds like the rutting season of a young modernism sowing its vocal oats, celebrating its original "voice," it is necessary to note that Pound's fellow revelers are in fact cavorting in "the heat of our <i>declining youth.</i>" They are conforming to the model laid down by 1890s writers, who used the re of the brief candle, of an autumnal dawn, of an early but brief excellence already consumed in the moment of its first flush, as their own signature image. </p>

<p>Pound's echoing suggests a somewhat incriminating inconsistency. His originality is in fact derivative; the resemblance reveals the underlying connection and indebtedness to the 1890s. This connection, however, suggests to me something more than, or different from, inconsistency. I think it bespeaks instead an enabling, indeed a strengthening, paradox. Consider the following complication, from the same piece: "We have attained to a weariness more highly energised than the weariness of the glorious nineties, or at least more obviously volcanic" (ibid.). This re of a <i>more</i> highly energized weariness represents not just a super conceit; it encodes a desire in Pound and for his companion talents to surpass the conceit—it is as though, by stepping up the energy level, he could outrun the riddle, or outdo the oppositional logic of that paradox, and claim just the vital, "volcanic" side. That is his motive meaning, I think. Yet the very 1890s curve on the sentence holds his sense to its own elegant antithesis: it is the weariness itself that is energized, intensified, not done away with; this is the old fin de siècle paradox, affirmed and strengthened even as it is fought against. Inscribing the struggle for difference within similarity, even an admitted similarity, Pound expresses, wittingly or not, the pathos of this campaign for the individual voice, the new and unique personality, the original, the authentic. </p>

<p>Even if there is no such thing as "first," even if Roland Barthes's sardonic testimony to derivativeness, "We are a quotation," is true as well as eloquent, we may ask how the special terms of the 1890s identity hover over and haunt the campaign Pound waged for the singularity or "authenticity" of his generation. Not just as the adjacent or proximate generation, the decade of the 1890s may offer the time-determined character of its identity as a special condition of its "authenticity," and, by repercussion, of an especially modernist "authenticity." This doom of youth may be written as the birthright, or, if you like, the birth-wrong, that Pound is ever contesting and always 

<b></b>

 affirming in his embattled exchange between his decade and the earlier one. And of course the re of the "volcano" anticipates the advent of <i>Blast</i>, the journal of London modernism in its nascent day, a birth that is virtually simultaneous, however, with its demise. A movement that takes its own moment as its establishing, empowering occasion—the special present, as enshrined in the metric of the decade; the radical Now, as intensifying as it is—may be inscribed with the impermanence that is its very condition of existence. There are of course other factors to be taken into account in addressing this quality of "authenticity," but, among a number of modernists' claims to this quality, the time-element may go to some of the fundamental issues and problems, which are revealing as stress points in the ongoing project of self-definition. And so we may ask: is there something overshadowed and fated, something irresistibly temporary, about the "authenticity" of a specifically modernist product, given the temporality, the timeliness, of its specifying identity?  </p>
