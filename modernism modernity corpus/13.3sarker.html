<p id="lead">This collection bears witness to the role of the nation-state as the crucible for modernism and modernity emerging from the late-nineteenth into the twentieth century. The essays bring alive the emotional resonance of nationalism for hierarchically racialized and sexualized subjects at (neo)colonial centers and margins. Indeed, in the last turn-of-the-century's battle of modernities, the nation-state was the universal model under dispute among socialist, anarchist, and capitalist philosophies for colonial as well as anticolonial subjecthood, as it is at this turn into the twenty-first century. In this context, anti/post-colonial literature aspires to be or becomes national literature even as it problematizes the concept of nation. Until as recently as 2002, the issue of nation-state identity in modernist literary studies had been rendered in one of two ways: either largely implicit or absent from discussions of Anglo-American and Western European authors, or the only focus in overdetermined approaches to Latin American, Asian or African authors. Since 2003, however, as  itself evinces, more essays inquire into various nationalisms&#x2014;Black, Jewish, Irish, Yugoslav, mestizo Latin American, Scottish, Italian&#x2014;all premised on nation-state identities. This material environment for what Simon Gikandi describes in the preface as the production of "linguistic gestures" thus situates "modernist" and "postcolonial" not only in terms of literary genres but also in their common basis in modernities of conflicting conrations.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> While modernists often used the term "international" to project their own image of the world, this special issue's focus on "transnationalisms" strives to reflect "ours."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 

<b></b>

Both terms&#x2014;"international" and "transnational"&#x2014;spur their/our desires to juxtapose, if not inevitably to compare, ideas and identities in and across spaces and times. </p>

<p>The essays in this issue thus seek to reposition their author-subjects through and then beyond the materiality of citizenship and prescribed identities toward connection with the other. Such repositionings inevitably raise critical questions: if hegemonic forms of internationalism only serve to aggrandize the imperial self, does transnational criticism desire to draw a correlation between modernist writing and particularized (liberatory) conceptions of transnationalism? Did the modernists, like us, wish to expose the contingency of nation? As many of these essays suggest, the literary genre (the novel and the poem) is not just the container of this desire but its very shape. Genre becomes desire for the subject in and beyond the boundary of the nation, in and beyond the limits of historical period. </p>

<p>This issue displays modernisms in our image&#x2026;always, partially.  </p>

<p>Reading and writing after these essays allows me to pursue the paths of these desires.  </p>

<p>Trans/nationalism&#x2014;the concept as vehicle&#x2014;challenges critics to stretch formerly construed geographies and critical histories for understanding past modernisms. In the resulting implicit or explicit comparisons that transnationalism also urges, we witness simultaneities that are multiple, unequal, and contradictory. </p>

<p>One of the simultaneities emerging strongly from this group of essays is that, within the particular conditions of late-nineteenth century to mid-twentieth century cultural politics, a sense of nationalism is concurrent with supranational linkages.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  As the essays in this collection demonstrate&#x2014;Jessica Berman's, Jahan Ramazani's, and Urmila Seshagiri's, for example&#x2014;many modernist authors see nation as contingent upon a sense of belonging and renounce it often because of the shape that nationalist leaders give it. At the same time, while modernist authors supersede national boundaries, they believe in the cultural uniqueness of their respective nations. Trans/nationalism takes the simultaneous and contradictory forms we see across the essays in this issue, for example, in Virginia Woolf's or in C.L.R. James's pan-Africanism. In <i>Three Guineas</i>, Woolf does not renounce her claim to England even as she denounces a masculinist, jingoist Englishness. In "Revolution and the Negro," James celebrates the contributions of Negroes to dominant nations while calling on them to t slavery across nation-state boundaries.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  If, as I suggested above, nationalism is the vessel for modernism and modernity, transnationalism is the hinge between postcolonialism and postmodernity. In this context, can we understand "trans" also as "post"? Does the modernist authors' transgression of national boundaries indicate that they also imagine spaces and times beyond nation itself? As this collection of essays demonstrates, given their particular longing for cultural community as well as resistance to nation as defined by political and cultural hegemonies, trans is only partially post.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Times and spaces not only intersect but are also interpreted and organized variously by subscribers to modernity, including our modernist authors. Nation-states are one manifestation of an organization of times and spaces in which modernist subjects (willing, ambivalent, and resistant) are differently subaltern.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Munoo in Anand's <i>Coolie</i> and Stephen in Joyce's <i>The Portrait</i> are not only na&#x00EF;ve subjects but also native subjects who are positioned unequally both within and across nations; the drawing of comparisons particularly accentuates this, for example, in Jessica Berman's, Laura Doyle's, and Jahan Ramazani's essays. As Susan Friedman indicates, modernists are indeed nonsynchronous; the essays show, however, that this is true both across eras as well as within them. Thus, across this issue, contiguities drawn between James Joyce and Mulk Raj Anand; Jean Rhys and her contemporaries; Lorna Goodison and Edward Kamau Brathwaite as peers of T. S. Eliot, W. B. Yeats, and Ezra Pound; and Nancy Cunard and W. E. B. Du Bois appear differently and unevenly resistant to nation. While the essays individually ascribe a resistant consciousness to the minoritized, they also collectively display dissimilar native-ness in their experience of nation. </p>

<p>These essays further reveal that while transnationalism allows a certain fluidity of exchange and borrowing, and colonial power tilts the balance, another view of the global transnational emerges through the gaze of the native. If "Anand's use of Joycean techniques" serves to highlight the "political implications of <i>Portrait</i>," does comparison only confirm the axes of power? If one looks more closely, however, Anand's juxtaposition of Iqbal and Joyce could indicate something about Anand's own "global" view that reflects back differently than the dominant one, nationalist or colonial. This global view opposes the "parochial," not to transcend the latter but to link it to others in a similar stand against colonialism. Could this motivation to connect the parochial/local to the global also be the basis of solidarity, for example, in the pan-African movement?  </p>

<p>This uneven graph of native-ness emerging from the essays does not allow the contradictory status of indigeneity to be flattened out transnationally. As the essays remind us, modernity invents and defines native-ness to relegate to a constructed and constantly interpreted past. Yet, native-ness is also the confirmation of nation-statehood and modernity itself. Western primitivism in cosmopolitan modernist practices remains incommensurable with emerging nationalist deployment of the notion of the native. For the former, it manifests as an adoption of forms and persona within an economically powerful and culturally experimental environment, such as in Surrealism. For the latter, it emerges as a confirmation of economically and culturally conservative agendas that solidify the uniqueness of one nation-state against another. In other words, the backdrop to the modernist authors showcased in this issue spells a hegemonic transnationalism against their own progressive version in which the "native" is presented differently. </p>

<p>I want to pursue, finally, this issue's depictions of how genre creates subject and how the subject writes a resisting genre. For both the modernist authors and for us, 

<b></b>

in this issue, the genre becomes the very manifestation of desire, not just a container for it. Genre (the modernist novel, the modernist poem) incarnates the actual as well as the imagined nation, its community, and from them both, its readership. The tradition of the Bildungsroman, for example, depends on historicity (the weight and the implications of history), an inescapable awareness for a modernist subject and a subject of modernity. The "failure of the Bildungsroman" discussed here by Jessica Berman's "Comparative Colonialisms: Joyce, Anand, and the Question of Engagement" is less about antidevelopment than about the (im)possibility of self-development as a paradigm. Even as <i>Coolie</i> attempts the impossibility of the biography, this novel is also expressive of the desire to re-do the nation in one's own image. According to traditionalist or conservative practitioners of the genre, marriage was the culmination of the romance novel, civilized maturity the end of the Bildungsroman, and closure the motivation for the poem. The suspension of such ends discussed here in the works of Joyce and Anand (Berman), Rhys (Seshagiri), Brathwaite and Goodison (Ramazani), and Salih (Friedman) spells this ambivalence about historicity. Some anticolonial subjects are (dis)obedient to the meaning of the model for self-development within the nation, as the essays show. They testify to the strength and weakness of the correlation between biographical and national-historical time, demonstrating the same logic by which Fredric Jameson sees the third world novel as an allegory of the nation.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> </p>

<p>Although, as the essays note, modernist disruptions of genre reflect the problematics of posing a totalized modernist subject, the essays demonstrate our persistent desire for a subject, a "visionary" in the form of Jean Rhys, Nancy Cunard, Mulk Raj Anand, or Lorna Goodison, who consciously imagines intellectual and emotional connections beyond the mundane surface of life. At the same time, we must keep in mind that these writers negotiated contradictory ideological frameworks, conventional norms, notions of cultural authenticities, and ideas of hierarchy complicating the landscape of uneven desires exhibited by our modernist protagonists for creating as well as surpassing various identities. A specific point of complexity emerges, for example, in the difference and overlap between "western" and "black" for Nancy Cunard, as we see in Laura Winkiel's essay, or between "race" and "culture" for Jean Rhys, as we see in Urmila Seshagiri's analysis.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  As Laura Doyle comments in her essay on the sexually transgressive in Virginia Woolf's and Nella Larsen's works, her chosen authors remain unevenly "interested" in race or in expressing their "genuine" selves. </p>

<p>Such contradictory modernist subjects, differently native and variously attached to race, culture, and sexuality, face dilemmas about democracy and citizenship for some modernist authors . . . and so do we. These dilemmas are bound up often with the issue of patronage that quite frequently encouraged racial/cultural difference as the path to equality as a citizen&#x2014;Cornelia Sorabji by powerful Englishwomen like Lady Cornelia Ford, Mulk Raj Anand by E. M. Forster, Rabindranath Tagore by T. S. Eliot, Jean Rhys by Madox Ford.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  As Laura Winkiel suggests in this issue, European modernity is not antithetical to black transnationalism; it is a strategic move on the part of various authors like Nancy Cunard and W. E. B. du Bois to advocate for both rights within imperial contexts as well as for national identity. For us, perspectives toward the centers 

<b></b>

and margins shift, marked by our desires. In this issue, Jahan Ramazani's "Modernist Bricolage, Postcolonial Hybridity: Yeats, Eliot, Pound and Postcolonial Poetry" situates colonized poets on one side of authenticity, observing that they incorporated images through violent force and experiential learning, and euromodernists on the other side, remarking that they selected "a mere aspect" occasionally for affect only. Yet the essay evinces ambivalence about whether Eliot, Yeats, and Pound can take part in the "celebration of transregional inheritance" enjoyed by African, Asian, and Caribbean poets. Seshagiri positions Rhys on one side of the modernist/postcolonial binary while Doyle places them on the same. Berman reads Joyce as anxious postcolonial who, like Anand, cannot pose neat endings, while Seshagiri reads Rhys as opposing modernist subscribers to formal experimentation, including James Joyce.  </p>

<p>This disturbance in our landscapes of modernism(s) is actually a logical extension of this collection's efforts to track the conrations of transnational modernities. Consequently also, this issue makes a bold move in re-shaping the times and spaces associated traditionally with modernism(s).  </p>

<p>Spatial terms such as "global" and "planetary" qualify transnationalism to expand the territories of modernisms. In terms of time, their new periodizations and challenges to traditional boundaries become as integral to aesthetics as the material of modernisms analyzed by the authors in this issue. Just as Bildung provides an architecture of the subject/nation, periodization becomes an architecture of eras. In this collection, there is a recurrent assumption that modernist subjects enter modernity as members of independent nation-states. If modernity and colonialism are simultaneous, colonial subjects are already to be counted among the architects of modernity. Susan Friedman echoes Dilip Gaonkar's concern about the inclusion of "people everywhere." Yet, if we agree with Jean-Francois Lyotard that postmodernity is nascent in modernity and that the two are simultaneous in the "post,"could the 1940s&#x2013;1960s (that this issue attempts to include) be termed "transmodernities"?<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The metamorphosis from rigidly structured bureaucratic Fordist organizations of the 1930s&#x2013;1950s to post Cold-War, post-Fordist weblike economic structures and political dynamics conres us as postmodern-aware subjects. For us, the concept of "transnational" does not cancel out a contemplation of modernisms and modernities even as we remain alert to the fundamental shifts in form and vocabulary. </p>

<p>Imagine this issue as a box with "This Side Up" etched on it. The sign refers to both periodization and the situational logic of this piece. I present this afterword as the bottom of this issue and the top of future ones that continue to address the concepts connected in this one, as preface to another conversation.

<div class="fn">
<p><a name="FOOT1" href="#REF1">1</a>. Literary studies, as distinct from developmental studies, international relations studies, or other inter/disciplines, has developed a specific vocabulary in relation to modernity, modernism, and colonialism. Most discourses related to state, policy, or economics imply that "modernity" is ongoing and "nation" has permanently supplanted "colony" and "empire." "(Post)modern" is largely associated with or used in social and cultural analyses. Feminist analyses in all these fields have attempted to bridge these differences in vocabulary.  </p>
</div>	<!--CLOSE fn-->






<div class="fn">
<p><a name="FOOT2" href="#REF2">2</a>. The word "transnational" has gradually gained currency since post-Fordist revolutions in organizational structures, from nations to corporations, taking place in the 1970s. Policy studies, trade/commercial companies, international relations, development discourse, and non-governmental organizations have all adopted the word for various agendas. Feminist and grassroots vocabularies, across these fields as well as separately from them, have been the main vehicles for conveying it into literary and other cultural spheres. </p>
