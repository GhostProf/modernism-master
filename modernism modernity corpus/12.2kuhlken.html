1. Expressing Speed
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In <i>Under the Volcano</i>, Geoffrey Firmin, a former British consul, despairs over a failed marriage in the bars of Quauhnahuac, Mexico. On this day his former wife, Yvonne, returns to save him, hoping to lure him away from Mexico to an Elysian cabin. Stagnant failures of the past coalesce with apocalyptic visions when the narrative engine of a lifetime comes to a halt and all the boxcars of a lifetime collide with the present.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  The Consul is physically killed by an Indian's runaway horse that is frightened by the storm, so the express train is only the rative cause of his death. On the Day of the Dead, November 2, 1938, from seven <small class="caps">A.M.</small> to seven <small class="caps">P.M.</small>, a lifetime is contained in a day that speeds towards death in a stream-of-consciousness narrative with the accelerating structure of an express train. Typographically, we are on a swift course winding through the Mexican terrain. From the rative broken track ending Chapter 1 to its continuation in Chapter 2, <i>Under the Volcano</i> makes it clear we have boarded a speeding narrative that conveys death:

<b></b>

</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
As a noun, "express" can refer to hyper-chronology, an excess of minutes, a zeal for adventure, a speeding train, or an alcoholic's disease; as a verb, "express" is to communicate, love, and forgive.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The linear track from the first chapter in 1939 carries the express train into 1938 of the second chapter, traveling backwards into the black tunnel&#x02014;or black hole&#x02014;of the past for a final, fleeting act of forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
Upon her arrival in Mexico, Yvonne asks the taxi driver, "But why, Fernando, why should a corpse be transported by express, do you suppose?" Then she reconsiders, "&#x02014;on the other hand, damn it, Fernando, why shouldn't it? Why shouldn't a corpse be transported by express?" (<i>UV</i>, 44). Fernando reasons: "Absolutamente necesario" (<i>UV</i>, 44). Why is death in a hurry? Why should time speed for a corpse that has vacated time rather than setting a slower pace that would prolong its passage and sustain its longevity? Speeding trains also convey death in Charles Dickens' serial novel, <i>Dombey &amp; Son</i>  and in Alfred Hitchcock's film, <i>The Lady Vanishes</i> <sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> . Dickens' novel prophesies that industrialized, express time will cause vertigo that leads to death and in Hitchcock's film, the train's velocity is indicative of the vulnerable psychological state of a rushed passenger&#x02014;such as a spy or a woman separated from her fianc&#x000E9;&#x02014;who currently lacks the ability to rest securely at home and must keep moving.
</p>

<p>
The path of life is charted as though on train tracks, relentlessly moving to its final depot despite our itinerary. The train is not only speeding but it is also heading to a destination unstoppably. If a mountain stands in its way, it passes through a dark tunnel. But in <i>Under the Volcano</i>, the express is subterranean&#x02014;never appearing on stage. With only a few references, the trace of the railroad tracks is faint, even imperceptible; after all, in Quauhnahuac, "there was little to suggest any train ever arrived at this station, let alone left it" (<i>UV</i>, 8). Lowry does not show us the train or its course, but he announces its passage. To consider this image is to interpret the force of speed and read its movement.
</p>

<p>
Etymologically, "locomotive" comes from <i>locus</i> ("place") and <i>motivus</i> ("causing motion"). As a noun, a locomotive is a self-propelled vehicle for pushing or pulling cars along tracks; a driving or pulling force; an impetus. As an adjective, "locomotive" pertains to the power of progressive motion, or the ability to move independently from place to place, apparently without a conductor or author; yet a locomotive's movement is determined by the railroad track's successive, linear structure. Paradoxically, in <i>Under the Volcano</i>, the trochal or wheel-like revolutions of speed are read and paced according to the chronology of the narrative track.
</p>

<p>
Prominent events of the three main characters' lives are memorialized on the Day of the Dead as a swan song for Yvonne and Geoffrey Firmin. Express adventures whisk Hugh across the globe; out of his zealous need to communicate and be admired, travel becomes the impersonal escape from his vulnerability and fear of being common. Express idealism conjures Yvonne's starry vision of her dream home with the 

<b></b>

Consul; in an instant, her tendency towards catasterism transforms quotidian reality into superstardom. Express alcoholism speeds the Consul to his own submersion at the bar where the drinks cannot come quickly enough. The downward-destined Consul drinks in steady tempo to ease his plummet into the liquid abyss, engulfing him like a geyser at the earth's core. He drinks to stay sober. An idealist who is dissatisfied with easy answers, he has lost his faith in himself, others, and God. He bides his time until he expires downward into the mire, drinking because he cannot plunge into a pool and drench his soul in waters of vitality on the earth's surface. Like Charon's boat carrying souls to Hades, the express train transports a corpse in Chapter 2, ushering the reader to a speedy death. When express alcoholism reaches the station in Chapter 12, the corpse has been delivered by day's end when the unidentified corpse becomes recognizable as the Consul's.
</p>

<p>
As Lowry's text explores the basin of a volcano, the possibility of a sudden eruption is imagined, as is the struggle to convey words that will restore a broken marriage&#x02014;the express expressions that should be exchanged quickly to defeat the prevailing silence. <i>Under the Volcano</i> may summarize Lowry's deepest feelings about his life in the context of the Spanish Civil War and Second World War. In Chapter 12, his reflections are narrowed down to a single chapter; condensed in time, history is abridged and the pace quickens. Subjective and historical material fuels the novel's velocity; the speed of a lifetime and history become tangible mental processes in the image of an express train. All the strands of the book gather in the presence of all-time and in the wake of apocalypse. In the twelfth chapter, in the twelfth hour of the day, the Consul is murdered when the express train reaches its destination.
</p>

<p>
The rush of events attains the speed of light and is no longer traceable; the narrative ends when the pace of a lifetime measured by the clock reaches vertigo and outruns grammatical conveyance. Motifs lie in wait as the chapter opens, dammed and damned by the Consul's obsessive order at the bar, "Mescal." The silence is filled with the tempo of waiting: "the ticking of his watch, his heart, his conscience, a clock somewhere" (<i>UV</i>, 349). The mescal creates rivulets in the suspended moment and the hallucination seeps in. Once the dam breaks, the Consul is drowned by the surging flood of images from the Day of the Dead&#x02014;<i>Las Manos de Orlac</i>, the volcanoes Popocatepetl and Ixtaccihuatl, the Ferris wheel, skeletons, the express train&#x02014;that merge with those from a lifetime&#x02014;the tequila bottle, Atlantis, St. Catherine, angels, Dante, Yvonne.
</p>

<p>
With reference to Chapter 12, Lowry proudly notes it "is definitely the best of the lot," and he adds,
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I am [ . . . ] inordinately proud of this chapter. The feeling you are supposed to get . . . is an almost Biblical one [ . . . ] All the strands of the book, political, esoteric, tragic, comical, religious, and whatnot are here gathered together and in the Farolito in Pari&#x000E1;n we are standing amid the confusion of tongues of Biblical prophecy.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

The number twelve is essential in conveying Lowry's vision. Twelve is the number of the waking hours of a day and the number of months in a year, both patterns occurring

<b></b>

in <i>Under the Volcano</i> set on the Day of the Dead with a one-year interval between Chapters 1 and 2. Ultimately, a confluence occurs at the bend of silence in the culminating Chapter 12 when the stream of consciousness floods life before the moment of death.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

2. The Moving Image: From the Big Bang to the Big Crunch
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Critics have understood the novel through its trochal structure, and even Lowry admits that he attempted to design a circular novel, but the image of the express train has been overlooked as <i>Under the Volcano's</i> interpretive key. Like the view from a speeding train, the stream of consciousness technique presents existence as a temporal blur of the living (the bartenders, revelers dressed as skeletons on the Day of the Dead, and the Consul's brother, Hugh) and the dead (his ex-wife who is as symbolically dead to him as the dormant volcanoes). Despite recurrent images in the fluid stream of consciousness narrative improvised like a jazz performance, the novel proceeds from a beginning through the middle to an end in Aristotelian form. The straight arrow of its course makes its primary concern speed, rather than the architecture of time and space so graphically depicted in Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>.
</p>

<p>
In 1951, Lowry wrote to a young novelist remarking on the difficulty of following Dante's direct path to paradise led by Virgil: "For no wonder Dante found the straight way was lost. There is no straight way. There is no path, unless metamorphosed. Dante's wood was an abyss [ . . . ] And I ain't no Virgil" (<i>SL</i>, 253). Having given himself fully to the moment, the Consul experiences the eternal time of Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> with its map charting the eternal vertical horizon from the inferno to paradise, instead of making a terrestrial pilgrimage on a horizontal plane moving from the past into the future. The Consul sits on a rushing train of time, contemplating the whirl of events encircling his compartment, expecting that at the speed of light, he would encounter the brilliant realm of Dante's paradise.
</p>

<p>
However, a simultaneity of past, present, and future would be meaningless. Time requires a readable order of events structuring the narrative. Stephen Hawking's <i>A Brief History of Time</i> envisions the universe arising from a black hole and collapsing into one&#x02014;the birth and death of time with an instantaneous initial bang and an equally rapid final crunch.
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
According to the general theory of relativity, there must have been a state of infinite density in the past, the big bang, which would have been an effective beginning of time. Similarly, if the whole universe recollapsed, there must be another state of infinite density in the future, the big crunch, which would be an end of time.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Like Hawking's brief history of scientific time, Lowry's Chapter 12 of <i>Under the Volcano</i> is "a brief history of fictive time" in which all the novel's themes converge into another hole&#x02014;the funnel of a volcano&#x02014;where the Consul feels himself racing into the abyss. Stephen Hawking mentions the "arrow of time that we observe," a symbol that not 

<b></b>

only indicates a straight path but also blinding speed (<i>ABHOT</i>, 190). Like partakers of literary time, Hawking, the scientist, is awed by the rush of time. An arrow is directive and determined to reach its aim, even when it points into a black hole or a black tunnel. The direction of time's arrow is crucial to destiny. In the barroom of the Farolito, the Consul mentally climbs the sheer height of the volcano with his gaze, then falls to the abysmal bottom of the ravine (<i>UV</i>, 351).
</p>

<p>
The key to understanding Lowry's text comes through the image and Gilles Deleuze offers a useful hermeneutic and rationale for considering Lowry's poetic image of speed. In a two-volume series, <i>Cinema 1: The Movement-Image</i> and <i>Cinema 2: The Time-Image</i>, Deleuze cites the Second World War as a break between the classical cinematic image based on <i>movement</i> and the post-war image based on <i>time</i>. Lowry wrote <i>Under the Volcano</i> between the two world wars, which is the period when Deleuze believes the brain became cinematic. The textual express train parallels the movement-image as it races towards its final depot in the apocalyptic Chapter 12 when all threads of the narrative converge, as well as the time-image as the train attempts to meet its scheduled arrival. Lowry's narrative express train occupies the very gap between Deleuze's movement- and time-images; the novel forms a suspension bridge for the moving blur of Lowry's locomotive like the dash on a tombstone between life and death.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Movement and time are the locomotive and its track.
</p>

<p>
Deleuze's cinematic model is defined by the use of associative images, the rhythm of the noncommensurable and irrational, and a preoccupation with movement; qualities that allow us to read <i>Under the Volcano</i> as though turning the pages of a flipbook, visualizing linguistic signs as images in the act of reading. Early cinema relies on moving images that indirectly create filmic time through narrative, subordinating editing to the story which <i>Under the Volcano</i> accomplishes; modern cinema reverses this paradigm, which Lowry also paradoxically achieves through his unlinked images including <i>Las Manos de Orlac</i> and autonomous scenes like the characters' backstories which are important in themselves.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Lowry also experiments with the noncommensurable onslaught of independent, apocalyptic images that are relinked through irrational cuts, rather than through clear association; Deleuze calls this direct presentation of time a "chronic non-chronological time which produces movements" (<i>TI</i>, 129). Like a passenger on an express train, after the Second World War, a direct time image is conveyed by time, wholly dependent on the vehicle, bypassing stops and proceeding with "voluntarily involuntary" movements; the direct time image is a passive being, swept through time, submissive to its destination.
</p>

<p>
Neither the movement- nor the time-image has to predominate in a binary paradigm. Rather, a system of relationships between movement and temporal elements can be formed out of which the variable present flows. The rush of the locomotive defies standard time, becoming a postmodern time-image of associative rather than successive connections; however, it also needs its track which signifies the static movement-image of classical cinema that relies on a predictable, navigable course. Because it is not simply one type of image, Lowry's express train allows an approach with the creative freedom to ask "What is there to see in the image?" instead of "What are we 

<b></b>

going to see in the next image?" (<i>TI</i>, 272). Lowry's will to art reveals unknown aspects of the time-image in the express train, but does not abandon the rail. Just as the novel occupies the gap between Deleuze's two volumes, the narrative is never located in the present, but in the representative network of tensions&#x02014;a blur between the Big Bang and the Big Crunch.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
<i>Under the Volcano</i>'s accelerating structure takes the locomotive of classical cinema, in which the engine pulls the train, and lays the track in a tunnel of nonlinear time with a vertigo of images and a circular track that begins and ends at the same depot: the Consul is dead in Chapter 1 in 1939, and he dies in Chapter 12 in 1938. The beginning, middle, and end of the track presupposes linearity, but the passengers on board Lowry's narrative look out the window to discover nonlinear time. This simultaneous movement- and time-image is a phenomenon of imaginative literature, metaphysics, and life, but not of the empirical sciences that stipulate a successive past-present-future. Velocity is always variable and relative, and the relationships between speeds "can only appear in a creation of the image" that cannot be seen in the object and cannot be reduced to the present.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Art has the power to capture velocity&#x02014;coexisting in different durations&#x02014;in the image.

3. The Trochal Design is on Track
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Ronald G. Walker's study, "'The Weight of the Past:' Toward a Chronology of <i>Under the Volcano</i>," finds the Ariadne thread of chronology and reconstitutes the novel's narrative structure in a chart. Events in the present unfold chronologically, repeatedly interrupted by departures into anterior time from 1900 to 1939.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  And yet Lowry consciously attempted to avoid chronology, insisting in an often-quoted letter:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The book should be seen as essentially trochal. I repeat, the form of it is a wheel, so that, when you get to the end, if you have read carefully, you should want to turn your eyes back to the beginning again [ . . . ] For the book was so designed, counterdesigned and interwelded that it could be read an indefinite number of times and still not have yielded all its meaning or its drama or its poetry.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">

(<i>SL</i>, 86)
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
The structure compels the reader to return to the first chapter set in 1939 and begin re-reading at the text's completion set in 1938. The Consul's life represents a timeline culminating on the Day of the Dead, 1938, but with every new reading his death is re-read, re-considered, and re-enacted in the first chapter. The reader experiences the dizzying effect of an engine chasing its caboose.
</p>

<p>
But how is it possible for <i>Under the Volcano</i> to be both nonlinear according to Walker's critical study and trochal according to the novelist? If we accept that the image of the express train accurately signifies the structure, then it reconciles the two. The train's measurable course has a beginning, middle, and is deprived of reincarnation with the finality of its ending.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  In contrast to the Aristotelian denouement of a movement-image, the uninterrupted, trochal cycle of birth, death and rebirth invokes the 

<b></b>

Buddhist concept of "samsara," reinforced by the nine references to the Ferris wheel.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The track preres a narratable lifetime, helping us grasp our place on earth, one that rotates daily and circles the sun annually on its trajectory; Walker's chronological narrative track is the movement-image, but Lowry lays its rails on the solar system with its whirlpool of reincarnate revolutions.
</p>

<p>
The Consul embodies the novel's tension of movement and time. From his stationary point of view, the Consul is the narrative's relaxed passenger seated at the bar in the face of the intensifying plot. Even in a drunken stupor, the Consul is an image of movement (drinking successively) as well as of time (having hallucinatory visions of history and myth, the past and eternity).<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The express train on its straight track&#x02014;the movement-image of successive railroad ties and the time-image of speed itself&#x02014;is crossing the bridge between Deleuze's movement- and time-image. The tension of the textual locomotive&#x02014;and the source of its re-readability&#x02014;comes from the relentless, unbridled power of the engine that spins the wheels relentlessly and the restraint of this invincible force by the guiding rails. One does not exist without the other: the linear movement-image of the track and the circular time-image of the wheel. Without the symbiosis, the speeding locomotive would be wrecked, just as Dante would have been lost in the inferno without Virgil as his guide. Even Quauhnahuac itself becomes an image of the express train on its course&#x02014;located as a point on a circle, the globe-girdling 19<sup>th</sup> parallel&#x02014;but also as a point on a line between two mountain chains.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The paradox that the novel is both linear and circular dominates all the facets of <i>Under the Volcano</i>, and this apparent contradiction makes either the timeline or wheel alone an inadequate representation of a mythical narrative with a sequence of events that is repeatedly interrupted by departures into anterior and posterior time, but has a clear beginning, middle, and end.

4. Sir Sanford Fleming Tames Equus Time
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Attempting to estimate the time of arrival of the express train carrying the corpse, characters obsessively check clocks in the Farolito, the bar where the Consul has his last drink. Desperate to become synchronized with his environment, the Consul sees the clock on the prison archway pointing to 6 <small class="caps">P.M.</small> and makes a mental note to order his next drink, tabulating the minutes and hours between drinks as though awaiting the corpse's arrival by express. Time feels insufferably slow for the Consul, but a novel depends on a character's willingness to suffer standardized clock time. Lowry may have known or intuited that trains may be the perfect symbol for relentless time since the time we observe in the twenty-first century began with nineteenth-century trains.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Time Lord: Sir Sanford Fleming and the Creation of Standard Time,</i> Clark Blaise traces standard time to its Victorian origin when organic faith clashed with mechanical science. Temporal position based on solar approximation resulted in temporal nightmares when the train accelerated pace to such an extent that passengers had to frequently reset clocks. Before Sir Sanford Fleming, engineer-in-chief of surveys for the 

<b></b>

Canadian Pacific Railways, standardized time zones in the late nineteenth century, time had been reckoned in a natural world by the biblically-sanctioned solar noon; maintained by the fixed laws of nature overseen by God; and determined by municipalities based on the sun's local position. Solar time allows every town to be its own Greenwich as the sun speeds along at 12 <sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> /2 miles a minute, with a new solar second every 1,000 feet of the earth's 24,000-mile circumference (<i>TLSSF</i>, 37, 84). The modern age could not calculate this multiplicity of local times quickly enough. In the world of travel and commerce, standardization ended the temporal nightmare&#x02014;for making appointments and meeting deadlines&#x02014;reducing the number of time standards in the world "from infinity to twenty-four" (<i>TLSSF,</i> 160).
</p>

<p>
Pre-industrial cultures know the wheels of cosmic time: daily rhythms of sunrise and sunset, the moon's monthly cycle, and the earth's annual orbit around the sun causing the four seasons. In his brief 1936 essay, "Time and the Machine," Aldous Huxley observes that pre-industrial people never forgot "the majestic movement of cosmic time," whereas industrialized people have "lost the old awareness of time in its larger divisions."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Although paradoxically aware of the smallest constituents of time, "We have a new consciousness; but it has been purchased at the expense of the old consciousness" (<i>TATM</i>, 300). The Consul experiences both cosmic time and mechanized time on his final day&#x02014;a train ride into a black hole. The invisible wheels sustaining the solar system are reduced to <i>Under the Volcano's</i> locomotive wheels racing along a pitiless course toward death. Since the invention of the first steam engine, industrialization has been accelerating. The machinery of industrial time whirls on rapidly in the modern factory, and twenty-first century digital time leaves all gears behind and travels at the speed of light in waves that arrive instantly.
</p>

<p>
Blaise suggests that the two types of time&#x02014;natural and rational&#x02014;should have two names, like "horse" and "equus": analogous to time, "horse" describes the civil, domesticated standard version that is hard-working and obedient, the type we can control and describe, while "equus" is the untamed, mysterious phenomenon of the Big Bang, the one nature withholds (<i>TLSSF</i>, 14). Sir Sanford Fleming initiated modernism's temporal revolution in a demystified "Big Bang" that remapped, and recast, the globe. Modern time was created in 1876 when Fleming missed a train, so the frustrated engineer began devising standard time, dividing the world into 24 time zones (one zone for every thousand miles of the earth's 24,000 mile circumference) in an attempt to accommodate technological speed. (<a href="#1"> 1</a>)
</p>

<p>
These vertical lines dividing the globe would allow us to travel by gaps with an adjustment of the clock, rather than by minutes. To avoid the irregular sunrise and sunset and the shadowless, sun-dial moment when the sun stands directly overhead, standard time begins at midnight.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Blaise traces the pre-condition for the modern stream of consciousness novel, like the new consciousness Huxley defines, to the standardization of time.
</p>

<p>
The train made time in its own image. Huxley proclaims: "In inventing the locomotive, Watt and Stevenson were part inventors of time" (<i>TATM</i>, 299). Consciousness of minutes and seconds became acute when machines set the pace in factories and 

<b></b>

railways. "Our awareness of time has reached such a pitch of intensity that we suffer acutely whenever our travels take us into some corner of the world where people are not interested in minutes and seconds," (<i>TATM</i>, 299). In an express age, the goal is power, which increases speed and decreases time. (Elapsed time equals the distance divided by the rate of speed, and the rate is affected by increases in power.) The steam engine's velocity exceeded the usefulness of the horse, sail, and eventually, the sun (<i>TLSSF,</i> 24). The sun is too slow a metronome for the Industrial Revolution's velocity with its trains and telegraphs. Accelerated time leaves not only the horse and sail, but also the human laborer behind. The speed of time has increased, requiring adjustment to new velocities and the equal distribution of municipalities; nature is replaced with reason; and religion with humanism (<i>TLSSF,</i> 77). Technology replaces God and rapid progress governs trade and justice; velocity itself becomes the goal.

5. Fascist Time
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In <i>Cinema 2: The Time-Image</i>, Deleuze suggests a preference for a model like solar time that requires imaginative, heterogeneous readings without becoming a clockwork automaton, like the commercial film or novel that is deficient in thought, "a business, a pornography, a Hitlerism"; the cinema Deleuze envisions will serve the brain so that it has a direct experience of time (not movement) since "it is the time-image which calls on an original regime of images and signs, before electronics spoils it or, in contrast, relaunches it" (<i>TI</i>, 267). Lowry directly experiences this primordial consciousness in <i>Under the Volcano.</i> When the Indian is murdered by the Fascists in <i>Under the Volcano</i>, his horse becomes a frantic symbol of the apocalypse; the Consul unties the horse, stolen 

<b></b>

by the corrupt police, and it tramples Yvonne to death. The horse is from a past epoch when the couple shared time. Perhaps only their reconciliation&#x02014;and a return to the time of the natural, passionate, domesticated horse&#x02014;would prevent their deaths.
</p>

<p>
Yvonne and the Consul cannot keep up with the velocity caused by the upheaval of their conjugal relationship. In the rush of events from the past, present, and future, the couple fails to find a moment of rest together, so a once-synchronized couple is split, alienated from natural time, and destined to die in two time zones. Curiously, the former husband and wife die at the same time in the same city&#x02014;an image of simultaneous differences. Despite this synchronicity, their perceptions are in different dimensions in alternate lifetimes because time is relative. The couple reaches a fork where two time zones originate: an express train advances carrying a corpse on one; on the other a rider-less horse, frightened by the storm, stampedes through the forest. Had Yvonne and Geoffrey Firmin compromised in order to embrace the synergy of inter-dependent time, they might have survived the day through awakened time&#x02014;a standard that would have unified their weaknesses into a strength. On Fleming's train Yvonne and Geoffrey would share one, inseparable time. Horses keep pace with the sun. The medieval morality drama's protagonist, Everyman, makes a final, contemplative walk to his reckoning at a pace that is far too leisurely for the twentieth century; in the nineteenth century, Everyman would be steamrolled by the train.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
From Chicago to a nearby city in the east, a few minutes by car, we jump an hour. This infiltrates our internal chronology and it becomes forgivable to jump from A to Z without the intermediary steps: we may feel fragmented in the rush, transitioning from train station to train station, from the past to a present hundreds of miles away. We too rarely travel with the meditative second hand of footsteps. What happens when someone maintains alignment with the local sun in municipal time&#x02014;microscopically-attuned to place&#x02014;while the synchronized time of a zone causes a macrocosmic displacement? We learn the answer by reading about the disoriented Consul. Seated at the barstool in the Farolito, the Consul's conception of time is analogous to living simultaneously in two time zones. But like the two volcanoes and its valley, there is a yawning gap between the man he thought he would be and the man he is.
</p>

<p>
Fleming inherited the Victorian's solar time, and the twentieth century inherited Fleming's railway time. Likewise, the digital twenty-first century uses an outmoded time that is inherited, unchanged from the age of the train and telegraph, but requires a new model since it has already pulled ahead of its progenitor in the accelerating race to the end of time, its final depot when eternity begins. Perhaps it will be a globalized time reflective of time's absolute unity, like international Zulu time used by the airline industry. With an exponentially accelerating rate of progress, the future time could never be the intensely personal experience of the retired Consul. Speed finds its timeline as the steam engine finds its rails.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In a culture of wakened time, the speed that light travels in .000000003335640952 of a second is a metre, a unit of standard measure for the velocity of the industrialized world with progressive frequency. But as technology caught up to the speed of light, human experience was left behind; an intuitive sense of pacing and an inner rhythm in sync with the sun, seasons, horse, and 

<b></b>

sail was forever changed once time had to keep up with the speeding telegraph and railway. Time calculates duration according to its superhuman velocity. Stopping time would mean stopping a speeding train at the unbreakable barrier of the speed of light, which is the speed of time.

6. Vanishing Time
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
As Lowry began writing <i>Under the Volcano</i>, Alfred Hitchock's <i>The Lady Vanishes</i>  was released. The film is set in a day, sharing the 24-hour, diurnal period of <i>Under the Volcano</i>. Even more concretely than in Lowry's metaphoric, express narrative, the majority of Hitchcock's film is visibly set on board a speeding train.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  The train's reckless speed and the inescapable sense of containment guarantees a relentless rush of adrenalin. The train is a stage on which characters perform without the props of daily life in an unlocatable metropolis where life and death situations force international people to act on their firmest convictions, either as a collective or in self-interest. In the film, an avalanche causes stranded international travelers to confront one another in the fictive country of Mandrinka somewhere in Eastern Europe. The prologue is set in a crowded hotel (the twenty minutes of diegetic time which is actually overnight in narrative time) before the train's departure the next morning and arrival at its destination before the day's end, like the express train's symbolic arrival at twilight in the final lines of <i>Under the Volcano</i>. The unspecified hours of departure and arrival reflect the tenuous circumstances surrounding the ominous trip. The avalanche cancels the train's initial schedule, and since part of the train is hijacked, it arrives late. It is the site of deception, abduction, and ts; it is uncoupled and ambushed in a shootout. Hitchcock's train is not the ominous express speeding beneath the surface of <i>Under the Volcano</i> without any obstruction. Despite setbacks, the express carrying its corpse does complete its trip&#x02014;with fatalities.
</p>

<p>
The screenplay is based on a novel, <i>The Wheels Spin</i>, and the train wheels shown in close-up suggest the determination of Fortune's wheel as well as samsara&#x02014;the cycle of reincarnation before release into nirvana&#x02014;or the Ferris wheel of <i>Under the Volcano</i>, as well as the hands of a clock rapidly spiraling across its face as time runs out. Hitchcock uses train wheels to signify the urgency of a deadline as time runs rampant, but will soon expire; the train's velocity reinforces the vertigo experienced by two passengers suffering from physical trama. The speeding train overpowers the protagonist, Iris, who takes a nap, feeling dizzy from an actual blow to her head; the train also facilitates the drugging and kidnapping of Miss Froy, a British spy. The train persists, while Iris and Miss Froy are abducted from the present; when the travelers come to a halt as a result of unconsciousness or sedation, time outdistances them. In the 1938 film, the two women reconnect with the present, consistent with the successive movement-image predominant at the time; however, in the 1947 novel, Geoffrey and Yvonne Firmin are tragically abandoned and forced out of mortal time, like disjointed time-images that have fallen into another dimension, and are not retrieved merely to complete narrative chronology. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Hitchcock constructs speed. Without a master shot objectively grounded outside of the train, we rely on its self-referential, subjective temporality. Time may be speeding, but in art it speeds at the director's pace as perceived by the viewer. When the camera shoots the train from its interior, the train with Hitchcock as its conductor, becomes its own Greenwich. While the opening credits show a master shot of the snow-covered Mandrinkan valley, the railroad tracks are not visible. The camera pans along the model set of a village, past a train depot where two idle trains sit, and continues to pan into the hotel window. The stranded passengers seem to have no way out from beneath the looming mountains, as though "under the volcano" and, like the Consul, they are looking for an escape.
</p>

<p>
Only once do we see a master shot of a real train crossing a bridge high above a valley, and it is one-third of the way into the film immediately after Iris and Miss Froy have breakfast and just before Miss Froy is abducted. The shot functions as the literal bridge between peace and crisis; the shot of the moving train announces the quickening pace. After the master shot of the train crossing the bridge, the clickety-clack grows louder and a sequence suggests delirium by atomizing the train, as if mechanized speed thrusts Iris into delirium. During her blackout, we see a medium shot of the engine, the wheels spinning, telephone wires passing by, the wheels again, the phone lines, the train tracks; as the whistle screams, Iris wakes to discover Miss Froy's disappearance. Conspirators planted on the train dismiss her suspicions as hallucinations; the high-speed train ride makes Iris susceptible to believing she is traumatized, processing data too slowly, and therefore mistaken.
</p>

<p>
According to Blaise's study tracing the standardization of time to the railroads, the speed of the train causes the inner clock of the human psyche to become unbalanced, causing travelers like Iris and Miss Froy&#x02014;or unsettled wanderers whisked into an express narrative like Yvonne and Geoffrey Firmin&#x02014;to suffer the effects of combat. Nineteenth-century psychiatrists reported nausea, hysteria, and a disorientation that could lead to madness among train passengers. Traveling 500% faster than the fastest stagecoach, perceived distances shrank by a factor of five, "which is a formula for social hysteria" (<i>TLSSF,</i> 139&#x02013;40). The litany of symptoms describes post-traumatic shock: anxiety, sleeplessness, headache, loss of appetite, generalized dread (<i>TLSSF,</i> 138, 141). Blaise diagnoses: "Locomotion is the life-force, and it is death; it is fate itself" (<i>TLSSF,</i> 141). To counter the disorientating fragmentation of a blurred foreground, travelers developed "panoramic vision"; a long-distance perspective focused on a faraway steeple or tree. No longer swaying to the natural stride of the horse on a leisurely stagecoach, travelers had to become defensive to protect their health against the temporal onslaught.
</p>

<p>
Like the Consul, Yvonne, and Hugh, all the characters in Hitchcock's film are affected or exposed by the dissociation from their habitual, grounded sense of time. Although Iris suffers from a physical blow to the head, her dizziness on the train recalls early psychiatry's association of train travel with trauma. Hitchcock's 1938 film was made when the cinematic movement-image predominated, yet the master of cinema anticipates the postmodern cinema of the time-image. His train becomes Deleuze's 

<b></b>

time-image and Iris finds herself traveling in "chronic non-chronological time" with its noncommensurable, involuntary movement on her way to an unknown destination, revealed only in the final shot in the British Consulate where the couple discovers Miss Froy in a grounding master shot, providing a movement image that resolves all of the narrative's questions.
</p>

<p>
With the foreseeable future ahead of the train and the past securely in place, the railroad track in both <i>The Lady Vanishes</i> and <i>Under the Volcano</i> is an image of certain succession. As Deleuze notes in <i>Cinema 2: The Time-Image</i>, post-war films no longer rely on continuity editing in which seamless images present a knowable subject and world; the seams of Lowry's novel are also visible. If the train were the perceiver, movement would remain essential, but the train orients an entirely new consciousness for a passenger's experience of speed&#x02014;which begins with cinema after the Second World War for Deleuze, and with standardized time and the locomotive for Sir Sanford Fleming. The perception of speed is not unified, even on the same train, so couples can become separated in the same physical location because of each individual's relative speed of travel. Paradoxically, the artificial reconstruction of velocity&#x02014;in a time-image or as time zones&#x02014;provides a municipal or international site for considering how quickly different lifetimes arrive at the final depot. Hitchcock's and Lowry's images of trains allow for interpretive consistency following travelers at various speeds: Iris with her trauma caused by an accidental blow to her head exacerbated by a kidnapping and the rushing train, or the Consul with the traumatized present on his final day.

7. Express Death
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Geoffrey sits at the bar of the Farolito examining ads on the wall that announce last night's events. A dead scorpion clings to the ads, an image of the fleeting daily news. Geoffrey understands that the new day is a commodity to be consumed. Yesterday's products are moth-eaten&#x02014;we must buy anew. In the Farolito, the bartender's son crams himself with chocolate skulls as he reads a magazine, linking an ephemeral publication with the day of death. If the Consul buys into the moment, he, too, will be consumed. He knows he must grasp for tomorrow's news, the next thing, because moments are always new: "<i>Su&#x000E9;lteme!</i> Save me, thought the Consul vaguely" (<i>UV</i>, 350). Was he petitioning the day, death, or eternity?
</p>

<p>
In <i>Under the Volcano</i>, three sinister police officers laugh at the Consul's feeble attempt to outwit their plan to frame him for an Indian's murder. The <i>polic&#x000ED;a</i> weave a tale of the Consul's alleged crimes, measure the degree of his guilt, and pronounce the sentence: "You are no a de wrider, you are de espider" (<i>UV</i>, 384). The fascists usurp the roles of time, as if becoming the three daughters of Zeus and Necessity to whom the ancient Greeks attributed authorship of a life: Clotho weaves life, Lachesis measures it, and finally Atropos cuts the thread. Instead of spanning generations, all three are present at once in Chapter 12, creating a black hole of the Consul's lifetime. The Consul recognizes the tangibility of the danger present in these personages of omnitemporality: "They were taking their time" (<i>UV</i>, 373). Time, including the Consul's time, was theirs 

<b></b>

to take. Alternate thoughts define his state of flux. In one paragraph, the Consul himself, like the <i>polic&#x000ED;a</i>, embodies the three fates, experiencing at once the past, present, and future. Past: "He <i>was</i> where he <i>was</i>, there <i>was</i> nowhere to fly to" (<i>UV</i>, 375, italics mine). Present: "[The pimp] had been talking to him <i>for the last five minutes</i>" (<i>UV</i>, 375, italics mine). Future: "Now once more, he <i>could go</i>" (<i>UV</i>, 375, italics mine). The eternal express train bound for glory has always existed but is still becoming realized in the time-image defined by Deleuze and interpreted by Lowry.
</p>

<p>
The Consul makes no move. His action is to remain still&#x02014;the motion of perpetual stillness, and its dead calm. "It was not the end quite yet [ . . . ] He could neither climb up nor down [ . . . ] The abyss yawned, waiting" (<i>UV</i>, 374). The yawn of time as it waits indicates falling asleep; a character falling into the yawning abyss will be put to rest. Since Lowry admits in a letter that throughout the novel "it is as if I hear a clock slowly striking midnight for Faust," and also cites Goethe's <i>Faust</i> as an epigram, we may conclude that in Lowry's mind, the Consul is saved because of his striving.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  <i>Under the Volcano</i> is a life that ends as the new life of eternity begins. The idle pace of ticking has ceased at the apocalypse of express, all-present time.
</p>

<p>
On the Day of the Dead, the Consul's future and past converge at the center of the hourglass, where Stephen Hawking would pinpoint a black hole. The disparate granules of his identity are funneled through the cylinder; themes become a unified theme when a life becomes a death; the sequence of life's moments reaches its apex when they fuse at the single moment of death. The Consul falls into his bottomless drinks and down into the volcano. While Dante's architecture of the inferno and paradise are clearly diagrammed, Geoffrey Firmin reaches the inferno where there is no grammar or structure to delineate experience into points of view and narrative time. Under the volcano, the past, present, and future are simultaneous, as are the <i>life</i> and <i>time</i> of a lifetime. The locomotive's wheels spin without a track, and still carry its passengers from the vertigo of samsara to nirvana.
</p>

<p>
Stephen Hawking's image of the past and future forms an hourglass, with the future at the top, and the past at the bottom. The Consul has fallen into the ravine of the barglass, volcano, Inferno, and hourglass, and passed to the other side. To live is to remain in the upper chamber of hope, even while the quicksand of life slips away, but to fall is to lose hope. The Consul ascends into the future above, but loses his footing and plummets into the past with the sands of time, as a hopeless, but forgiven man. The voluntarily involuntary end engulfs him with its time-image of speed.

8. The Triumphant Monster
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
While Charles Dickens' <i>Dombey and Son</i>  is not a limited duration novel restricted to the 24 hours of <i>Under the Volcano</i>, Dickens' Chapter 55 can be read alongside Lowry's Chapter 12 as an ur-moment of speed just before the moment of death. Carker steals the second wife of Dombey, a wealthy London merchant, and makes an escape on horseback after ruining their marriage. Carker, like the Consul, is falling into a black hole because of a woman. Neither Carker nor Geoffrey Firmin has a Virgil who will 

<b></b>

escort him to paradise; instead, is the murderous re of a train and a ride through hell. Like the stealthily advancing express behind the scenes of <i>Under the Volcano</i>, a speeding train pursues Carker. The insentient express train has the hostile intention of a relentless demon plunging headlong through life, indiscriminately leaving a trail of deaths in its wake: the unscrupulous Carker and the faithful Consul.
</p>

<p>
An outcast on the run for stealing his boss' wife, Carker is unsettled by train travel, so he follows an intensely personal journey on horseback, forging the course of the time-image. Conversely, the Consul is wary of rejoining the community, acting like a pariah after losing his wife; he experiences a hallucinatory narrative rush, although not on horseback like Carker, and is finally overrun by a daemonic horse terrified by the storm. Horses and trains are only the vehicles for the fatal velocity that ends a lifetime. Like Lowry's Chapter 12, Dickens' Chapter 55 "was a fevered vision of things past and present all confounded together; of [Carker's] life and journey blended into one."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  In a scene that could have happened in the Farolito, a drowsy Carker is disconcerted and experiences the Consul's mescal-induced vertigo. Carker turns to a waiter as he attempts to catch up with time:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
"What day is this?" he asked of the waiter, who was making preparations for his dinner. "Day, Sir?" "Is it Wednesday?" "Wednesday, Sir? No, Sir. Thursday, Sir." "I forgot. How goes the time? My watch is unwound." [ . . . ] How long he sat, drinking and brooding, and being dragged in imagination hither and thither, no one could have told less correctly than he.

Like the Consul, Carker fails to escape the painful present through the numbness alcohol promises, but is instead "drawn at the heels of wild horses" (<i>DAS</i>, 740).
</p>

<p>
Whereas the Consul has been riding an express narrative, Carker is on horseback. In passive states of exhaustion and drunkenness, both Carker and the Consul seem to be passengers carried away by their own lives. The natural force of a violent rushing horse and a man's innate strength contrasts with the industrialized confusion of railway travel and the resulting enervation. At midnight, disordered from both wine and exhaustion, a terrified Carker stays awake listening as trains pass nearby like fiery devils. The fierce transit of a locomotive fills his consciousness:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
A trembling of the ground, and quick vibration in his ears; a distant shriek; a dull light advancing, quickly changed to two red eyes, and a fierce fire, dropping glowing coals; an irresistible bearing on of a great roaring and dilating mass; a high wind, and a rattle&#x02014;another come and gone, and he holding to a gate, as if to save himself!

<p class="noIndent">
The end approaches with its divine flourish; Carker, like the Consul, does not dare to hope for life since death has almost overtaken his flight. They share a self-preservative need to escape the siphon of the end: "Save me, thought the Consul vaguely" (<i>UV</i>, 350). But the end is final.
</p>

<p>
Carker's horse carries its rider on a visionary ride with the momentum of a powerful beast that is reminiscent of the rider-less, frenzied horse of the murdered Indian 

<b></b>

in <i>Under the Volcano</i>&#x02014;or like an express train rushing its passengers to a destination: "Some visionary terror, unintelligible and inexplicable, associated with a trembling of the ground,&#x02014;a rush and sweep of something through the air, like Death upon the wing" (<i>DAS</i>, 731). The runaway horse runs through an apparent eternity on an "endless road" that encompasses a man's lifetime and future, through "morning, noon, and sunset; night, and the rising of an early moon," then sunset, nightfall, dawn, and daybreak again (<i>DAS</i>, 736, 738). Even landmarks are intertextual rhymes; Carker sees "the distant Jura, fading along the plain" in Britain like the ever-present volcanoes looming above the Consul in Quauhnahuac, Mexico (<i>DAS</i>, 733).
</p>

<p>
The speeding horse is an omen of death&#x02014;the end of life advancing with a fury&#x02014;as it runs by cemeteries on long roads to the treacherous horizon. Carker's horseback journey creates a sense of vertigo: a rush chills his blood and memories pass with the scenery as the present fuses with the past and future (<i>DAS</i>, 741). The trochal image of the fulfillment of time is prominent in Carker's fevered, somnolent vision reminiscent of the Consul's, when Carker sees images of wheels: "a vision of change upon change, and still the same monotony of bells and wheels, and horses' feet, and no rest" (<i>DAS</i>, 738). All night, he is troubled by the monotonous vision of what would be his final journey: the civil, domesticated movement-image of wheels and horses' feet before another train would pass with the disconcerting, untamed, and mysterious time-image of equus speed. Recurrent time spirals with increasing rapidity as it unwinds, or conversely, as it winds itself into the density of a black hole. In both cases, the end hastens to unfold.
</p>

<p>
During Carker's final thirty minutes, however, the narrative pace slows. Like the Consul asking for the time just before his murder, Carker asks for the time of his train: "About a quarter after four, Sir. Express comes through at four, Sir.&#x02014;It don't stop" (<i>DAS</i>, 741). An <i>absolutamente necesario</i> vehicle for conveying the narrative velocity, the express train of <i>Dombey and Son</i> seems to continue on its course into Lowry's novel. In the final thirty minutes, Carker learns that two gentlemen have arrived and he panics; running toward the railroad track, he is chased by Dombey.
</p>

<p>
In Chapter 20 when Dombey takes a trip after the death of his son, the train becomes an anthropomorphic re of death, foreshadowing the later accident:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The very speed at which the train was whirled along mocked the swift course of the young life that had been borne away so steadily and so inexorably to its fore-doomed end. The power that forced itself upon its iron way [ . . . ] piercing through the heart of every obstacle, and dragging living creatures of all classes, ages, and degrees behind it, was a type of the triumphant monster, Death.

</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
With similar rhythm and language used to describe the horse in Chapter 55, the train is a harbinger of relentless mortality, becoming a remorseless, indomitable monster of Death: passing faces in a station, leaving them behind, small and insignificant; tearing through mountains and ruined towns; crossing valleys on bridges, and proceeding on in remorseless triumph until Death overruns Carker in Chapter 55. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
In the Consul's final moments after being shot by the police, he hears the sounds of a world at war, and the newly freed horse can be imagined galloping off stage as the link to the synchronized deaths of the Consul and Yvonne. The last page of <i>Under the Volcano</i>'s Chapter 12 reads like the last page of <i>Dombey and Son</i>'s Chapter 55 when Carker experiences the pandemonium of a private war before he is thrown to the dogs:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[Carker] heard a shout&#x02014;another&#x02014;saw the [pursuer's] face change from its vindictive passion to a faint sickness and terror&#x02014;felt the earth tremble&#x02014;knew in a moment that the rush [of the train] was come&#x02014;uttered a shriek&#x02014;looked round&#x02014;saw the red eyes, bleared and dim, in the daylight, close upon him&#x02014;was beaten down, caught up, and whirled away upon a jagged mill, that spun him round and round, and struck him limb from limb, and licked his stream of life up with its fiery heat, and cast his mutilated fragments in the air. When the traveler, who had been recognized, recovered from a swoon, he saw them bringing from a distance something covered, that lay heavy and still, upon a board, between four men, and saw that others drove some dogs away that sniffed upon the road, and soaked his blood up, with a train of ashes.

The glaring red eyes of a speeding lifetime rush at its victim with the force of a wild stallion in <i>Under the Volcano</i> and <i>Dombey and Son</i>. Apart from being transported safely and in sync with the speed of time like a rider on horseback or a passenger on a commuter train, the inhuman speed causes the vulnerable to land in a pile on the rails. The streams of life&#x02014;men, horses, the fleeting landscape&#x02014;are caught up in the speed of an industrial whirlpool and mutilated. Arriving at the station, Dombey reflects that the blackened, deteriorated town "was the journey's fitting end, and might have been the end of everything; it was so ruinous and dreary" (<i>DAS</i>, 271). Dickens' and Lowry's trains deliver a corpse when they arrive at a halt and eternal time begins. The pariah dogs who lap up death first appear in <i>Dombey and Son</i>, and make a later appearance in the final line of <i>Under the Volcano</i>: "Somebody threw a dead dog after him down the ravine" (<i>UV</i>, 388).
</p>

<p>
Velocity, like time, is artificial and will cease. The Consul's descent into the abyss is traceable and narratable even though it is rapid; after death, the final resting place is beyond expression, beyond images in the black hole Hawking predicts. The Consul has been speeding on a symbolic, fatal express train while seated at the bar. His consciousness rushes into the poetic time of eternity during a lifetime that becomes the speeding train itself. Time is the train on its course, and he is its passenger. The Consul remains utterly alone in his symbolic compartment with the blurred scenery passing by his window; the train has divorced him from the natural world and he is literally embodied by industrial speed.
</p>

<p>
By definition, speed will accelerate, creating the need for new images and models that help us understand the nature of velocity. Speed outran its nineteenth-century paradigm of municipal time; and then its twentieth-century of standardized, industrial time; and now in the twenty-first century, digital time is already trailing behind. With the imminence of the end, it is <i>absolutamente necesario</i> that a corpse be transported

<b></b>

by express or even death will leave it behind, and we will be unable to express twenty-first century velocity. Like the light we view from a star, express time has left its origin even before our births. Perhaps the new image of time will arrive soon from the twentieth-century.

The express train signifies death and relentless speed in the traditional gospel song: "This train is bound for glory, this train. / This train is bound for glory, this train. / This train is bound for glory / Don't carry nothin' but the righteous and the holy / This train is bound for glory, this train." Written in 4/4 time, the tempo shifts from quarter notes to eighth notes at "Don't carry nothin' but the righteous and the holy," giving the illusion of speed as a chugging train hastens to reach a modernist's ideal of "glory" in which heaven's streets are paved not with gold but with railroad ties and the train becomes the vehicle of salvation.

Two versions of <i>Under the Volcano</i> survive from 1940 and 1947, which might explain the phenomenon of its construction as both a movement- and a time-image. Pierre Schaeffer discovers chronology to be the most significant change in the versions. Without mentioning the text's velocity, Schaeffer cites the shift from a "fairly traditional mixture of narratorial report and free indirect discourse" to "a patchwork of discourses defying the laws of novelistic verisimilitude but foregrounding dialogism" in the final version.

Sherrill Grace similarly avoids analyzing the narrative speed as she considers the 1947 manuscript's spatio-temporal shift in which symbols overwhelm the temporal flow. In the 1947 version, Lowry employs two narrative patterns as counterpoints that allow the interplay of time and symbol: the view from the train and its interpretation.

Critics regard Gaston Bachelard's <i>The Poetics of Space</i> (<i>La po&#x000E9;tique de l'espace</i>, 1958) as the inception of phenomenological criticism. E.M. McAllester, "Gaston Bachelard: Towards a Phenomenology of Literature," <i>Forum for Modern Lanugage Studies</i> 12.2 : 93&#x02013;104, especially page 101. For a phenomenologist such as Bachelard, experience is a structure; every reading is a crossroads bound by horizons that are constantly shifting, but ultimately subjective; the key to understanding comes through the image, and through understanding images, we appreciate the meaning of a text. Bachelard attempts a personal understanding by allowing impressions to possess him entirely; an image "emerges into the consciousness as a direct product of the heart, soul, and being of man, apprehended in his actuality." Gaston Bachelard, <i>The Poetics of Space</i> (<i>La po&#x000E9;tique de l'espace</i>, 1958), trans. Maria Jolas (Boston: Beacon Press, 1994), xviii; hereafter abbreviated as <i>PS</i>. As a new offering, this revelatory image is a direct ontology with no past: "a sudden salience on the surface of the psyche" (<i>PS</i>, xv&#x02013;xvi). Northrop Frye commends Bachelard's work: "The ideal critic of poetry is capable of recreating the poet's world of symbols. In giving us this ideal, the work of Bachelard may well make us hopeful as to the future of literary criticism [ . . . ]" Northrop Frye, "Myth and Symbol," in <i>Myth and Symbol: Critical Approaches and Applications</i>, ed. Northrop Frye (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1963), 50.

<blockquote class="extract">

Men, like poets, rush "into the middest," <i>in medias res</i>, when they are born; they also die <i>in mediis rebus</i>, and to make sense of their span they need fictive concords with origins and ends, such as give meaning to lives and to poems. The End they imagine will reflect their irreducibly intermediary preoccupations. They fear it, and as far as we can see have always done so; the End is a re for their own deaths.

The photographer, O. Winston Link (1914&#x02013;2001), captured the last days of steam power on the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway between 1955 and 1960. Link photographed trains as the Romantic, iconic American machine of industry and progress: as the interloper in a photograph of neighbors gathered on a porch beside the tracks, or passing unobtrusively in the window for a portrait of the stoic Hester Fringer in her living room, reminiscent of the Consul seated at the bar.

In Willa Cather's short story, "Paul's Case," Paul is an evicted high school student who steals money and takes a train to New York, posing as a gentleman; but in a week his thievery is publicized in the newspapers. He follows the railroad tracks out of town and personifies a steam train, even snow seems to boil in his mouth. He rushes in front of an oncoming train, "afraid lest he should be
