By Newton's time the planets had proved to trace elliptical orbits, not the circular ones we find congenial. . . . The better to purify the observations by which such knowledge is gained, men learned to follow method, not caprice . . . to cherish the pure detachment which telescope and microscope confer on the eye, and to exercise a comparable detachment when we are using neither telescope nor microscope, but the very eye with which we regard the things we love. Such is the discipline of becoming, for specific purposes, something other than a human being.

Hugh Kenner's intellectual foundations lie in late-seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century British Enlightenment. Our modern European world was invented there and then, but Kenner's Enlightenment is a self-conscious construction, an intellectual framework that he assembles like an anthropologist; it gives his critical and historical writing its basic concepts and distinctions, method, lucidity, and above all characteristic irony. This Enlightenment is not a postmodern concept, not a terminal or unfinished project of rationalization and disenchantment; it is an Augustan schema whose rationality involves critical observation of particulars rather than the deployment of integrated, self-regulating systems. This is not the Enlightenment of Descartes and Leibniz, who want self-evident truths, but that of Bacon and 

<b></b>

the Royal Society, of Defoe, Swift, and Pope, of Locke and Newton&#x02014;res whom Kenner consulted repeatedly. Descartes appears in Kenner's reading of Beckett, because Beckett's characters parody Cartesian subjectivity. Kenner's is an empirical, rather than rule-governed, rationalist Enlightenment that thinks self-evident truths need to be tested and, often, unmasked. Human reason is not all that philosophy claims for it. The documentation of states of affairs, indistinguishable from the stripping away of appearances, trumps totalities of every sort: encyclopedias and dictionaries, essays and inquiries, notes and epistles, lists and enumerations, satires and parodies&#x02014;these, together with the novel that imitates them, are basic genres of Kenner's Enlightenment, in which distrust of general ideas motivates an irrepressibly corrosive wit aimed at the consequences of unchecked reasoning. The purpose of logic and mathematics in this event is practical rather than theoretical: namely the construction of productive machinery, not the formation of abstract structures. Mathematics is a useful science: it can make things work&#x02014;a Geodesic dome, for example. Automatons are more interesting than ideas. Kenner's is a ground-level Enlightenment that knows the importance of small increments and the fraudulence of every idealism. Collect anecdotes, scorn theories. Each random particle deserves scrutiny. So, lower the threshold of description and follow the method of detail. This is the motto of Kenner's practice.
</p>

<p>
The opening pages of <i>Dublin's Joyce</i> describe Dublin as "an eighteenth-century time capsule" whose citizens are clich&#x000E9;d in thought and speech because they incarnate Augustan ghosts. Kenner does not see this as altogether bad:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Through other countries other rivers flowed, bearing away all the past that floats. . . . Only Dublin had kept its past above the waters; evading the cataclysmic mutation of the Romantic revolt, it had chosen to preserve its form rather than its life. And a man born into that Dublin, exhorted to admire the image of old buildings in the stream, might seek instead to seize the once-living City. . . . such a man&#x02014;James Joyce . . . &#x02014;would find himself simultaneously citizen and exile.

Dublin's Joyce is an Augustan satirist or, more accurately, a parodist who wants to restore the coherence of words and things by documenting in detail their echoes in his fellow Dubliners' talk. But parody is also a redemptive genre. For Kenner the paralysis of Joyce's Dublin saves it from becoming a nineteenth-century London debauched by industrial and romantic revolutions. Kenner came to maturity in an age that defined itself critically against the romantic period: that is what Kenner's <i>modernism</i> is in its deepest motivation, namely a rejection of subjectivist poetics, tending toward a rejection of any interest in human subjectivity (such as psychoanalysis, which Kenner ridiculed).<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Joyce's Dublin is a utopia: a city of the dead which preserves a human order that romanticism swept away, leaving Eliot's unreal city behind. Simon Dedalus is a ghost, but the ghost of Swift, not of Tennyson: "his wit proceeds from a critical alertness, a flexibility of response to social clich&#x000E9;s," words that could just as well describe Joyce himself (<i>DJ,</i> 22). The "English analogue for Joyce," Kenner writes, "is Pope," "conscious of intellectual traditions running back through St. Augustine to Cicero and 

<b></b>

Homer," who "predicted at the end of the <i>Dunciad</i>" "the universal darkness . . . the Romantic night-world. . . . Ireland had simply undergone some two centuries' arrest on the very brink of the precipice, and Joyce's generation was hailing a suicidal forward stagger as progress" (<i>DJ,</i> 23). In his essay, "In the Wake of the Anarch" , Kenner remarked that fifty years after his death Pope became "all but unintelligible. His editors could not read him; his commentators cannot read him [note the present tense]." We find ourselves, "since the Romantic explosion, on another planet," unable to pursue "a most precise analysis" based on "premises desperately in need of recovery" (<i>GN,</i> 172). Kenner sees Pound struggling to free himself from the nineteenth-century nightworld by rediscovering these premises, including the premise that a poem is made of learning, as a novel is made of facts, rather than merely private perspectives: "Most of Pound's work is worth reading . . . because he doesn't play solitaire with general ideas." His mind works by the incorporation, rumination, and digestion of "facts" (<i>GN,</i> 133). "The allusiveness of modern poetry needn't be a sign of cultural breakdown, but a manifestation of one of poetry's oldest functions"&#x02014;to be encyclopedic: "The teacher of modern poetry finds himself discussing the Grail Legend, Heraclitus, Cuchulain, the <i>Odyssey,</i> Dante's trimmers, Chinese ideograms, the culture of Provence, usury, spirit writings, the <i>Noh.</i> What justifies the use of such materials by the poet is that they are worth learning about anyway" (<i>GN,</i> 140&#x02013;41).
</p>

<p>
And Leopold Bloom? As Kenner says, "when Joyce makes Bloom suddenly ask, 'Do fish ever get seasick?' we are in the presence not of an exercise in nineteenth-century pessimism but of a tribute to the unpredictable creative leaps of the human soul" (<i>DJ,</i> 10). Bloom is the literal-minded eighteenth-century man whom romanticism blurred into extinction, leaving Stephen Dedalus struggling and failing to transmute the mere facts of everydayness into vibrant images of eternal beauty. As Kenner puts it, "Stephen the romantic artist, <i>thanatos,</i> is Joyce without Joyce's sense of fact" (<i>DJ,</i> 24). More precisely: "Joyce was never the Stephen Dedalus of his 1914 <i>Portrait,</i> mirror of nineteenth-century romantic idealism: Byron, Shelley, Axel, Fr&#x000E9;d&#x000E9;ric Moreau" (<i>DJ,</i> 44). What saved Joyce was the writing of <i>Stephen Hero,</i> a process of depersonalization that parallels Yeats's development of an aesthetics of the anti-self, which defines the character of the later "cubist" portrait of Stephen, whom Joyce's "moving point of view" comes to characterize no longer as just himself (a subject) but also as the (objective) product of the naturalistic forces of environment and heredity that produce Dubliners.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Joyce's "imagination" at twenty-three "had arrived at the point Yeats was only to reach at fifty, and passed beyond it while young enough to profit" (<i>DJ,</i> 47). Kenner finds in the "dryness" (<i>DJ,</i> 33) and the Jonsonian irony of <i>Chamber Music</i> lyricism subjugated by a scrupulous empiricism. Pound's hand is in this judgment&#x02014;as Kenner acknowledges when he cites Pound's praise of the "'clean-cut ivory finish'" of Joyce's lyrics (<i>DJ,</i> 32).
</p>

<p>
Kenner's modernism is defined less by formal innovation than by an "objectivist" aesthetic attuned to sheer factuality, the irreducible singularity of the here and now. His link with the British Enlightenment lies in the rejection of subsumptive thinking, emotive expressionism, deduction from generalities, and appeals to imagination. Categories are occasions of comedy, because on close inspection categories are always 

<b></b>

empty, like the minds that use them. Kenner's invisible poet is a constructivist rather than expressionist, like T. S. Eliot, whose <i>Waste Land</i> is an exemplary modernist collage. Eliot was simultaneously "very Augustan" and "post-Symbolist" (<i>TPE,</i> 275). The poem, in short, is an object, a pattern of words the way the novel is a container in which any number of disarticulated objects can be rearticulated into patterns of facts.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Stoic Comedians</i> , whose ideas Kenner was developing in the early sixties when I was his student at the University of Virginia, is the quintessential Kenner text. Three interrelated critical themes stand out from this period:  the stoicism of the Augustans: their essential impersonality, imperviousness to misfortune, restraint of feeling, and deadpan documentation of human folly;  a romantic skepticism which doubts whether the world can exist independently of the mind's operations, whereas Augustan skepticism doubts reason's capacity to surmount the mind's obstacles to knowing what exists; so satire undoes the egotistical sublime; and  the concept of the closed field, which unfolds the idea that facts are finite in number and can be arranged, combined, and recombined in multifarious ways&#x02014;alphabetically, encyclopedically, or novelistically; but however we organize them, facts define human finitude, the absolute limit that inevitably defeats human projects. However, comedy, not tragedy, is their fruit. The straight face (Buster Keaton's face, Pound's <i>personae,</i> and Eliot's possum) defines the decorum of a metaphysics of facts.
</p>

<p>
Kenner adds multiple turns of the screw, for example, his interpretation of Swift's Gulliver as Kenner's self-portrait and self-critique in the fourth chapter of <i>The Counterfeiters</i> . Kenner traces the genealogy of his intellectual heroes, Charles Babbage and Alan Turing, prime movers of the digital age, to <i>Gulliver's Travels.</i> For him Alan Turing's Game&#x02014;where a detached observer tries to determine objectively (without looking at the subjects in question) the difference between a machine's operations and a human being&#x02014;is already fully in place in <i>Gulliver's Travels,</i> where the creatures Gulliver encounters have grave difficulty in concluding on the evidence of Gulliver himself what a human being might be. The comedy is that Swift has created in Gulliver the "Compleat Empiricist," someone who has no capacity for accepting received ideas, whose capacity for experience is confined to what he can hear, see, and compute, and who is confounded by being simultaneously empirically indiscernible from the Houynymns (owing to his exhibition of consecutive discourse) and indistinguishable from the Yahoos (owing to his biped physiology, not to mention his appearance as an object of Yahoovian desire). A classic epistemological crisis. However, "Swift's great irony" involves presenting Gulliver as an observer who is himself "constantly under observation." This makes Swift "the real inventor of Turing's game." In this situation of multiple observation, Gulliver as "<i>our</i> spokesman" shows himself incapable of explaining "what it may mean to be human." Yet "he represents a modern ultimate, carrier and incarnation of the values we really value: notably accuracy, cleanliness, and the power to adjust. Compared with Swift's, Turing's formulation of the game seems almost trivial" (<i>TC,</i> 120&#x02013;21). Gulliver, knowing nothing but facts, is the perfect narrator because he makes Swift's text a novel and not just a diatribe. What Gulliver lacks, as Kenner points out, is a classical education; he has no context, history, or tradition in which to place 

<b></b>

himself. The critic self-reflexively making that point had himself been one of the last recipients of a classical education.
</p>

<p>
Hugh Kenner had a superhuman memory. In the classical age memory served as a library&#x02014;not a personal memory but a commonplace book, an encyclopedic inventory on which to draw. Asked a question about Emerson, not someone in whom Kenner maintained much interest, he would recite from memory whole paragraphs of an Emerson essay. This fabulous memory informs central aspects of Kenner's method. <i>The Pound Era</i> is a book of anecdotes, citations, and factual glosses (not "readings") held together by recurring res of "patterned energy"&#x02014;the Vortex, for example&#x02014;whose prime model is Buckminster Fuller's analysis of knots, a study of how something works. The concept of "patterned energy" is as close to a general idea as Kenner ever comes. He had no use for general ideas&#x02014;hence the gleeful contempt he heaped upon literary theorists and the French philosophers who procreated them. He worked by moving particulars, like Buster Keaton's face, from their native contexts to different, foreign ones where they served as descriptive models, chiefly of how certain kinds of writing like the novel work. That is the call of Kenner's <i>mechanic muse</i> (which was also Newton's muse): How do things work?Kenner was interested in, among other things, the impact of new technologies on writing&#x02014;the printing press, the typewriter, the railroad, and of course the digital computer. With Charles Hartman he is the author, so to speak, of <i>Sentences,</i> a volume of computer-generated poems (recall the objectivist poem that no one seems to have written).<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Kenner's modernism is technological in character. In <i>The Mechanic Muse</i> he writes that "Technology alters our sense of what the mind does" and that "the Modernist enterprise evolved its verbal technologies, its poem- and novel-machines of intricate interacting discrete pieces" drawing "for tacit analogies" on technology that "is largely obsolescent now: as much so as, say, Dante's Earth-centered cosmos": "The Dublin trams . . . and the linotype machine; the typewriter . . . . That world survives now, like Dante's world, in art. Its assumptions survive in the structures of its art: complex artifacts we even sometimes take apart for maintenance" (<i>TMM,</i> 110&#x02013;11).
</p>

<p>
The reconstruction and maintenance of modernism: that's a neat way of thinking of Kenner's intellectual achievement.
