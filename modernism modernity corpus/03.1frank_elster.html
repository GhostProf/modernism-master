It was originally my interest in Roger Caillois--sociological essayist, 
erstwhile surrealist, and cofounder of the College of Sociology--that led 
me to the forgotten avant-garde writer Armand Petitjean, an acquaintance 
of his youth in the 1930s. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">
1</A>
</SUP>
This philosophical essayist 
published four major works, now almost entirely inaccessible outside the 
Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale: 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation</I>
(Imagination and realization [1936]), 
<I>Le Moderne et son prochain</I>
(Modern man and his fellow man [1938]), 
<I>Combats pr&eacute;liminaires</I>
 (Preliminary combats [1941]), and 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu</I>
 (The unveiling [1946]). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">

</SUP>
<p>
Petitjean seemed to represent an interesting case against which to gauge 
the political ambiguities of the left-leaning and antifascist College of 
Sociology, whose actual relation to fascism is a matter of some 
debate. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">
3</A>
</SUP>
In the French context, the issue of fascist ideology 
per se is complicated by the question of individual political choice or 
action during World War II. As did the College of Sociology, Petitjean 
protested against the predominantly pacifist, 
<I>munichois</I>
 (i.e., 
pro-Munich Accords) mood of French intellectuals in 1938. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">
4</A>
</SUP>
He 
then fought the Germans with particular patriotic zeal until the Armistice 
of June 1940, losing part of his right hand. Yet after 1941 he became an 
active collaborator--unlike any core member of the College of Sociology. 
Switching sides again in late 1943, he fought with the Allied forces, only 
to be condemned by the postwar literary 
<I>&eacute;puration</I>
 (purge): 
his name appeared on the first "blacklist" decreed by the CNE 
(Comit&eacute; national des &eacute;crivains [National writers' 
committee]) in September 1944. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">

</SUP>
<B></B>
<p>
From late 1940 through 1941, Petitjean worked for the Vichy administration 
in the interrelated spheres of youth and propaganda. His career was 
largely sponsored by the former Communist Paul Marion, who became 
Fran&ccedil;ois Darlan's notorious minister of information (February 
1941-April 1942) and who then, "having helped undermine the Darlan 
government in March-April 1942, remained as head of propaganda efforts 
under [Pierre] Laval," to quote Robert Paxton. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">
6</A>
</SUP>
Petitjean 
thus played an active role in the 
<I>chantiers de jeunesse</I>
 (youth 
workcamps). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">
7</A>
</SUP>
A young pawn of complex political maneuvers, he 
was unsuccessfully backed by Marion and others in May 1941 for the 
leadership of the Compagnons de France (Companions of 
France). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">
8</A>
</SUP>
After this defeat, according to Pierre Hebey, he 
then sought to form the Jeunesses l&eacute;gionnaires (Legionary 
youth). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">

</SUP>
Unconfirmed allusions in Pierre P&eacute;an's 
biography of Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand even suggest that the future 
president was a youthful "follower" of Petitjean. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">
10</A>
</SUP>
<p>
After the war, Petitjean was blacklisted as a writer because of 
<I>Combats pr&eacute;liminaires,</I>
 a collection of essays written at the military 
front (1939-40) and after the Armistice, which delivered, in 1941, a 
clearly collaborationist message. His publications under the aegis of 
Vichy also included articles for 
<I>Compagnons</I>
 (Companions), 
<I>Jeunesse</I>
 (Youth), at least one for 
<I>La Gerbe</I>
 (The sheaf), and 
nine contributions from January 1942 to August 1943 to the monthly, 
nonofficial publication, 
<I>Id&eacute;es: Journal de la R&eacute;volution Nationale</I>
 (Ideas: journal of the national revolution). He wrote six 
articles between 1940 and 1943 for the Paris-based 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
 which had become collaborationist with the new 
editorship of Drieu la Rochelle (July 1940-June 1943), since the German 
invaders hoped to preserve this journal as a "strategic bastion of 
Literature," in the words of Hebey. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">
11</A>
</SUP>
Bernard Comte suggests 
that it was after Petitjean's defeat in Vichy in the summer of 1941 that 
he returned to Paris and to the 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
where he served as Drieu's editorial assistant. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">
12</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Partly because Petitjean had fought so heroically (on the proper side), 
Jean Paulhan, the magisterial editor of the prewar 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
 did spring to his defense in 1947, in 
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
 (On the wheat and the chaff); we will return to 
Paulhan's famous, if cryptic, assault on the censorious strategies of his 
fellow literati. More recently, Hebey's survey of the collaborationist 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
 from which Paulhan dissociated 
himself in 1940, cites two trenchant participants in twentieth-century 
intellectual life--Claude Roy and Ren&eacute; Etiemble--both of whom deem 
Petitjean's case a uniquely thorny postmortem of the postwar. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">
13</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Petitjean's career offers a unique perspective on the question of fascism 
and modernism in the French context, one that illuminates it more broadly. 
In ideological terms, Petitjean's career adds an interesting wrinkle to 
debates about the relation between intellectual nonconformism and fascism. 
"Nonconformism" generally indicates the ideological fluidity of the French 
1930s, and specifically refers to those nonpartisan intellectuals who 
rejected not only political parties of the Right and of the Left but 
parliamentary democracy as well. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">
14</A>
</SUP>
In a more cultural sense, 
emerging as it does within the "surrealizing" 
<I>("surr&eacute;alisant")</I>
 avant-garde, Petitjean's ambiguous 
<B></B>
 path offers a new vantage on the complex interaction of 
political and literary, and political and aesthetic, discourse in this 
milieu. Why did this particular nonconformist member of the avant-garde, 
unlike so many others, become a true political fascist? Does he differ 
significantly in this respect from his patron at the collaborationist 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
 Drieu la Rochelle? 
<p>
The only real discussion to date of Petitjean is that offered by Hebey, 
who claimed in 1992, "[He] has done everything he could to be forgotten. 
After 
<I>Mise &agrave; nu</I>
 [1946] . . . he definitively opts for 
silence and retirement." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">
15</A>
</SUP>
And yet, upon reading this, I 
recalled that I had seen Petitjean's byline in the September 1989 issue of 
<I>Le Monde diplomatique</I>
 on an article entitled "Toward Man's Contract 
with Nature," in the series Inventing a Future for the Planet. I soon 
discovered that his recycling as an ecological thinker had begun in 1973, 
when he assembled and introduced a collection of essays for the Club of 
Rome, a rather secretive group of industrialists propounding no-growth 
development. The Club of Rome is deeply revolutionary, Petitjean wrote at 
this time, "but leaves off at the threshold of politics, in the 
traditional sense of the term." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">
16</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Some forty years earlier, Petitjean had given his own twist to the term 
"availability" 
<I>("disponsibilit&eacute;")</I>
 for politics in his 1937 
essay "Disponsibilit&eacute; de la jeunesse fran&ccedil;aise actuelle" 
(Availability of youth), a polemic demanding that France acknowledge the 
untapped energy of his generation. He lent availability the new political 
sense of an energetic and affective openness to event--rather than to 
ideology or party--that would render his generation the agent of 
history. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">
17</A>
</SUP>
Petitjean hailed "men of good will, of plasticity 
to history." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">
18</A>
</SUP>
Of course, historical plasticity denotes 
passivity to event; properly to 
<I>make</I>
 history, these young men must 
be oriented and led by "'revolutionaries' who, more conscious than they, 
act in coordination with them." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">
19</A>
</SUP>
Petitjean consistently 
presents his own authorial and intellectual role as that of an 
<I>active</I>
 revolutionary who stimulates "coming-to-consciousness" 
<I>("prise de conscience").</I>
 Yet his own career reveals a pronounced 
historical plasticity. My primary purpose here is to explore the 
"revolutionary" historical plasticity--or, perhaps better, "revolutionary 
plasticity"--of his conceptual framework as it encountered the march of 
history: we will find there, I am proposing, a rather distinctive 
conjunction, within the French context, of modernism and fascism. 
<p>
Omitting, for now, the distinction between belief and opportunism, I 
intend to highlight three essential, and interrelated, factors in 
Petitjean's particular form of "fascist modernism." First, we find a cult 
of ideological and intellectual indeterminacy; second, a paradigm of 
revolutionary consciousness detached from any real ground in 
sociohistorical crisis; and third, a vitalist obsession with youth. 
<p>
In order to situate Petitjean vis-&agrave;-vis current historical 
discussions of ideological nonconformism, let us glance quickly at his 
evolution during the 1930s. Born in 1913, he had become active by 1935 in 
a cultural milieu for which the surrealist movement was a primary point of 
reference, although Petitjean was himself more inclined to the modernism 
of James Joyce and of German 
<I>Lebensphilosophie</I>
 (life-philosophy). 
<B></B>
 Having left the &Eacute;cole Normale after one year, 
he participated, as did Caillois, in 
<I>Les Cahiers du sud</I>
 and became, 
again like Caillois, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Jean Paulhan, of the 
nonpartisan 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise.</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">
20</A>
</SUP>
Paulhan's own complex ideological nonconformism, currently the object of 
some scrutiny, found in the youth a congenial political 
interlocutor. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">
21</A>
</SUP>
This was especially true after 1936, when 
political questions dominated the cultural scene. Aligned then, unlike 
Paulhan, with the leftist and antifascist Popular Front, Petitjean in July 
1936 both proclaimed an imminent New French Revolution and put forth an 
ambiguous plea for fresh doctrine. On the one hand, he declared, "French 
revolutionaries find a magnificent future in their past." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">
22</A>
</SUP>
On 
the other hand, he contended, "since reactionary traditions are poorly 
established in France--or, rather, obsolete--French 'fascists' must 
innovate." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">
23</A>
</SUP>
From late 1937 through the end of 1938, he wrote 
a weekly column, Battle of the Books, for 
<I>Vendredi,</I>
 a journal that, 
in the words of Pascal Ory and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Sirinelli, sought to 
be the "conscience" of the Popular Front by maintaining strict editorial 
independence. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">
24</A>
</SUP>
In 1938, still loyal to the flagging Popular 
Front, Petitjean urged his nation toward revolution "without fascism, 
Hitlerism, or Stalinism, and without the anticommunism of Mister Jacques 
Doriot [of the PPF, or French Popular Party]." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">
25</A>
</SUP>
He also 
criticized the excessive abstraction and formal perfection of right-wing 
nationalist ideology, declaring that Hitler himself was little concerned 
about questions of "indeterminacy." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">
26</A>
</SUP>
By this point, his 
private brand of revolutionary national-populism, quite militarist at the 
end of the year, had acquired a resoundingly protofascist ring. 
<p>
Petitjean's nonconformism in the 1930s and his subsequent collaboration 
with Vichy render him quite relevant to current historical analyses of 
French fascism. His writings after 1936 fit well with Zeev Sternhell's 
influential description of left-leaning, nationalist 
antiparliamentarianism as 
<I>ni droite ni gauche</I>
 (neither Right nor 
Left) fascist ideology. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">
27</A>
</SUP>
However, Michel Winock, one of 
Sternhell's most articulate opponents, questions the existence of any 
"coherent" French fascist ideology, since "no political movement was ever 
able consistently to assemble or to unite" under such a 
banner. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">
28</A>
</SUP>
Daniel Lindenberg, on the other hand, is broadly 
sympathetic to Sternhell's approach and tries to establish a fascist 
political continuum from the nonconformist 1930s to Vichy 
collaborationism--a continuum in terms of Vichy's doctrine of National 
Revolution, already proposed in the 1930s by Petitjean and 
others. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">
29</A>
</SUP>
Drawing upon the work of Robert Paxton, Lindenberg 
thus opposes ideological collaborationism to the realpolitik of Vichy 
state politicians who remained anti-German while collaborating with the 
invader. Collaborationism, in this formulation, involved a form of 
visionary fervor or "mental world, characterised by 'an ethic of 
conviction', committed pro-Nazism, a world far from the compromises and 
trickery that [collaborationists] all condemned at 'Vichy'" ("FI," 
155). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">
30</A>
</SUP>
Petitjean can serve here as a prime example. He 
enthusiastically endorsed the Vichy doctrine of National Revolution within 
a German Europe: "The national socialist revolution will proceed in the 
West and will make Europe, or Europe will succumb to foreign enslavement 
in its own anarchy." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">
31</A>
</SUP>
Petitjean's article in the December 
1942 issue of 
<I>Id&eacute;es,</I>
 "Friends of 
<B></B>
 the 
Revolution," which lists prewar opponents of both the Left and the Right, 
sustains Lindenberg's broad claim about the legacy of 1930s nonconformism: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
A collaborationist, therefore, was to be distinguished from a fascist, a 
pacifist, a socialist or an old-style Jacobin republican precisely because 
he believed that, thanks to Franco-German collaboration, he had 
transcended the contradictions and weaknesses inherent to those ideologies 
whose impotence and harmfulness had been demonstrated by the defeat of 
[France in] 1940. ["FI," 140] 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">
32</A>
</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The larger historical debate about French nonconformist fascism can hardly 
stand or fall on such a re as Petitjean, but I would underscore that 
precisely what is distinctive about Petitjean among the ranks of 
nonconformists turned 
<I>collabos</I>
 can shed new light on the bigger 
picture of French fascistic 
<I>(fascisant)</I>
 modernism. Like Sternhell, 
Lindenberg highlights a "profound apocalyptic and eschatological mentality 
to be found amongst those disappointed by the Republic, by radicalism, by 
socialism and by syndicalism"; this shapes their "utopian" views of 
Europe, as well as their "rejection of all forms of hedonism and 
materialism" ("FI," 155). And yet Petitjean, despite his heightened and 
dogmatic rhetoric of 1942 and 1943, seems strikingly immune, on the whole, 
to the then-pervasive obsession with the failures of French society--an 
obsession that marked the French 1930s in general and then devolved to the 
revolutionaries of occupied France. For instance, his introduction to 
<I>Combats pr&eacute;liminaires</I>
 declared: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The word that, of the entire French language, took me the longest time to 
pronounce was "decadence." To avoid facing the facts, I sought refuge in 
every available system. In particular, I tried to say that the idea of 
decadence was romantic and anti-French, that it existed for us only as 
literature. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">
33</A>
</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
In 1938, Petitjean's explicit rejection of the 
discourse of decadence, of crisis, was received with raised eyebrows by 
the right-wing fascist sympathizer, Robert Brasillach, since what the 
latter considered to be at stake was the constitution of a fascist force 
among French youth. Reviewing Petitjean's 
<I>Le Moderne et son prochain</I>
 for the "Causerie litt&eacute;raire" (Literary chat) of the 
<I>Action Fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
 Brasillach declared: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
[Petitjean] explains to us, and it is true, that fascism 
<I>"is always born from a state of crisis following upon a state of war, when the generation of war has hypnotized, as it were, that of ruin."</I>
 And he 
maintains that nothing of the sort has yet occurred in France because 
there has not yet been a 
<I>"generation of crisis."</I>
 I nonetheless 
suspect that it is on the rise. But let us not quibble about these 
delicate matters. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">
34</A>
</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Petitjean's resolve to deny a "generation of crisis"--and, indeed, 
"crisis" itself--also distinguished him from the "hypnotized" outlook of 
Drieu la Rochelle, whose own generation had been deeply marked by World 
War I. Their contributions to the first issues of the collaborationist 
<I>Id&eacute;es</I>
 clearly convey this divergence. Drieu's "Sense of 
<B></B>
 the Tragic" (November 1941) attributes the defeatist 
French sense of humiliation to its lack of "tragic 
philosophy." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">
35</A>
</SUP>
Rather than similarly dwelling upon Nietzschean 
tragedy, Petitjean optimistically praises (in the journal's next issue) 
what he terms the shift from "necessary" to "possible" 
revolution. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">
36</A>
</SUP>
Moreover, he will assail in September 1942 those 
writers generally viewed as the most prominent exemplars of French fascist 
modernism: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
At times, the consideration of our task may imbue us with vertigo, the 
spectacle of our ruins may paralyze us. How many "fascist temperaments" in 
France, from Drieu to Lucien Rebatet, including C&eacute;line, have known 
the temptation of nihilist despair or gleeful anarchy. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">
37</A>
</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
This 
attitude toward decadence in 1942, to which we will return, also clarifies 
Petitjean's specificity within the French cultural avant-garde before the 
war, where, as the voice of a 
<I>new</I>
 generation, he resolutely 
challenged the omnipresent ghosts of World War I. 
<p>
For Brasillach in 1938, Petitjean was not a fascist but displayed a 
"'prefascist' temperament, broadly analogous to what may have been [the 
temperament] of many young Italians prior to 1922." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">
38</A>
</SUP>
Without 
pursuing this Italian comparison, we could say nevertheless that Petitjean 
stands out during a decade mired in the crisis of liberal democracy, one 
that was expressed by varying junctures of aesthetic and political 
modernism and antimodernism in nonconformist and 
<I>fascisant</I>
 literary 
intellectuals alike. "Gnostic, Nietzschean, Drieu embodies throughout his 
career the very type of the antimodernist modern," writes 
Lindenberg. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">
39</A>
</SUP>
In contrast, Petitjean remains surprisingly 
sanguine. Note the equilibrium he posits in 1938: "the forces of 
re-creation are in close equilibrium with those of creation. . . . The 
powers of man are no longer distant from those of the ancient gods (and of 
course from those of the demons). . . . He can finally look life and 
reality in the face." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">
40</A>
</SUP>
Or, again, consider his calm praise in 
1938 for the themes of the Swiss writer Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz: these 
descriptions of nature and the peasantry are an act of "sacred" 
preservation, without which the world of the future, "that which we are 
rebuilding, would lose its measure and raison d'&ecirc;tre." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">
41</A>
</SUP>
More concretely, he insisted that his generation was exempt from and 
untainted by World War I and, furthermore, that the Third Republic was not 
Weimar. On such grounds, and on the basis of a more recent discovery of 
"the people"
<I> ("le peuple"),</I>
 Petitjean would hence refuse in July 
1938 to heed the siren songs of "French abjection"; in fact, the French 
"people is so happy that it's still unconscious of being 
so." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">
42</A>
</SUP>
<p>
This outright rejection of a sense of despair suggests how Petitjean's 
nonconformist discourse is unhinged from any socioeconomic or, indeed, 
historical basis to assume the form of a plastic, or infinitely mobile, 
projection. According greatest attention to Petitjean's 
<I>surr&eacute;alisant</I>
 vanguard years, let us follow the early 
theoretical construction and some oddly illuminating intersections--with 
Bachelard, Lacan, Paulhan, among others--of Petitjean's revolutionary 
plasticity. 
<B></B>
<p>
During a decade so fraught with the seeking of Personalist or spiritual 
regeneration, 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">
43</A>
</SUP>
few writers so performed--not to mention 
theorized--the state of youthful promise as did the lively Petitjean, who 
was appreciated as a bracing blend of avant-garde intellect and 
unrestrained passion. For Gaston Bachelard, in 1936, Petitjean's writing 
revealed "dynamism and experience, poetry and knowledge, that is to say, 
irreconcilable qualities." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">
44</A>
</SUP>
"Encephalitis" balanced by "a 
vigorous animal appetite" declared Brasillach's review of 
1938. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">
45</A>
</SUP>
Drieu discovered Petitjean (and Swift) through 
Petitjean's 
<I>Pr&eacute;sentation de Swift</I>
  and applauded this 
study of how Swift's "passion saves him at every step from intellectual 
rigidity." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">

</SUP>
<p>
Petitjean's earliest work affords a revealing illustration of the relation 
between ideological and intellectual indeterminacy, one that arose largely 
as a reaction against surrealism. Reading Petitjean's wartime text, 
<I>Combats pr&eacute;liminaires,</I>
 in 1943, Jean Piel (future editor of 
<I>Critique,</I>
 along with Georges Bataille) would record in his diary: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Here we have the final result of this frenzied naked will, lacking any 
real conviction that might assign it a goal: deformation of so many 
pseudointellectuals before the war, who were reacting against surrealist 
fatalism, and for whom the false reek of Nietzscheanism was awakened by 
the noisy echoes across the Rhine.

Many on the periphery of surrealism in the 1930s, inspired to achieve a 
synthesis of Marx and Freud and interested in questions of representation, 
superstructure, and affect, responded in various ways (political, poetic, 
aesthetic, scientific, philosophical) to "surrealist fatalism," as Piel 
suggests. This term echoes the opinion, increasingly voiced as political 
anxieties gripped the decade, that surrealism involved an idealist and 
aestheticized pseudoscience of the unconscious mind.

Petitjean's own variant of avant-garde revolution entailed the dialectic 
of what he termed Imagination and Realization, as outlined in his study 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation.</I>
 This work recast his earlier 
essays on Joyce of 1934-35. A Germanophile and an Anglophile, fluent in 
both German and English, Petitjean was distinctly cosmopolitan in his 
avant-gardism. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">

</SUP>
"He inspired me to reread 
<I>Ulysses,</I>
" 
wrote Brasillach, "that immense challenge to art and to 
nature." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">
50</A>
</SUP>
And yet, Petitjean's undying passion was not for 
<I>Ulysses</I>
 but for the play of language in Joyce's 
<I>Work in Progress,</I>
 or 
<I>Finnegans Wake.</I>
 So enthralled was he that the 
contagion of Joycean prose complicates any access to his ideas, especially 
in his work of the mid-1930s. Benjamin Fondane, a rather mystical Rumanian 
Jewish avant-garde writer who was to die in Auschwitz, exclaimed about 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation:</I>
 "such vast amounts of material 
cited in the original language, English, German, Spanish, Latin, Greek, 
even Sanskrit! not to lead you to suspect just that the author is young 
but that he 
<I>knows</I>
 he is young." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">
51</A>
</SUP>
Fondane was generally 
hostile, though, to what he elsewhere termed the 
<I>"rational appropriation of the irrational"</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">
52</A>
</SUP>
prevalent in French 
surrealizing modernism; hence, he found Petitjean's "manner undoubtedly 
more satisfying than the 
<I>excessive clarity</I>
 of 
Bergson." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">
53</A>
</SUP>
Paulhan, on the other hand, repeatedly enjoined 
Petitjean to re&euml;merge from under the weight of his readings and his 
foreign languages 
<B></B>
 (this ironically echoed in 
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
) to elucidate his own thoughts. 
<p>
Yet it was largely in response to the surrealist "unconscious" that 
Petitjean had, paradoxically, derived from 
<I>Finnegans Wake</I>
 a model 
of intellectual lucidity. Joyce's literary aesthetic proposed a form of 
absolute self-consciousness unavailable, or so Petitjean claimed, in the 
French context: "a new meaning, a mythical measure, born out of the 
psychological depths, a veritable 'tempo' of the thought." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">
54</A>
</SUP>
Joyce masters free associations "through what in others . . . would be 
called improper language"; he thus transcends Val&eacute;ry's "supreme 
consciousness" as well as Andr&eacute; Breton's "supreme 
unconsciousness"--toward "hyperconsciousness." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">

</SUP>
Petitjean's 
"Joyce and Myth" appeared in Eugene Jolas's English-language Parisian 
journal, 
<I>transition,</I>
 which had single-handedly sustained and 
published Joyce's 
<I>Work in Progress.</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">
56</A>
</SUP>
In 
<I>transition,</I>
 the Jolases yoked together two distinct 
avant-gardes--"the 
<I>Finnegans Wake</I>
 current" and "the surrealist 
current," in the words of Maria Jolas--which even in this promising 
context had little or no interaction. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">
57</A>
</SUP>
Petitjean's essay of 
1935, "Joyce and Mythology," reflects such a rift--or, rather, pits the 
first current against the second. Although he uses Joyce to assail Bergson 
and Proust--here is no "mythology of the inner world" ("JM," 134) and 
Joyce has not "lost his time" ("JM," 136)--the real enemy is surrealism, 
with its use of the unconscious, automatic writing (which dissociates 
language and thought), objective chance 
<I>("le hasard objectif"),</I>
 and 
"primitive mentality" (Lucien L&eacute;vy-Bruhl's influential category). 
<p>
Joyce's own leftist political views notwithstanding, Petitjean predicates 
on the writer's literary "authenticity" both a nonconformist, 
anti-ideological perspective and a theory of revolution. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">
58</A>
</SUP>
In 
defining Joyce as the only "poet" who might "bring us back through 
mythology to ourselves and the world" ("JM," 135), Petitjean is concerned 
less with language than with ideology. 
<I>Finnegans Wake</I>
 is the 
demystifying salvation for modernity escaping the "non-sense of history," 
a world where 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
mythology becomes more and more a factor, a desperate counterfactor of 
history: some retreat into the past, others return to it (Giulio Evola, 
Gimenez Caballero, Rosenberg, every fascist), and more than one Marxist 
prophet tries to return to the future; under the pretext of the crisis, 
each one gets off on the wrong foot. All too human mythology where the 
hero himself, the F&uuml;hrer, presents himself gratuitously as Ecce Homo, 
the simple tensor of the more or less political energy of the men that 
[sic] are "his" men! ["JM," 134] 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Petitjean is thus already rejecting "crisis," the "mythology of 
catastrophe, which wants to be, and is, the very motor of history, that of 
Dostoevsky, Georges Sorel, Spengler--earlier that of Choderlos de Laclos" 
("JM," 134). Petitjean had previously mentioned Beckett's reading of Joyce 
that had proposed Vico's 
<I>New Science</I>
 as the structuring principle 
of 
<I>Finnegans Wake</I>
--here, claims Petitjean, is "the fundamental 
order of things." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">
59</A>
</SUP>
He emphatically contrasted this cycle with 
Nietzsche's "eternal return," which, in Petitjean's opinion, was conceived 
"in its distress rather than 
<B></B>
 its glory, and as a 
vision rather than as a law of nature, only to . . . forestall 
[Nietzsche's] own catastrophe." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">
60</A>
</SUP>
By July 1939, Petitjean 
would transpose Beckett's Joyce into nationalist optimism: "If there is 
one country where Vico is right, it is ours, which finds eternity in the 
very periodicity of its new agings and youths." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">
61</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Before he developed such political applications in the late 1930s, 
however, Petitjean had translated his reading of Joyce into 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation.</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">
62</A>
</SUP>
This study of "realism 
recover[ing] reality by dint of mythology," explored the cycles, or 
"eternal return of the imagination," in a broader philosophical 
sense.

</SUP>
Entirely forgotten today (although worth 
republishing, I believe) this work offers a breathtaking romp through the 
various discourses of the European avant-garde and was received, at least 
by Bachelard and Fondane, with great enthusiasm. I suspect that Lacan also 
took an interest in what converged, in some ways, with his own thoughts on 
the "mirror stage." 
<p>
To help us grasp Petitjean's argument, let us examine a summary he later 
presented in 
<I>Combats Pr&eacute;liminaires,</I>
 in which he claimed a 
continued adherence to the basic terms of 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation.</I>
 This can aptly serve as the essence of what I have 
called his revolutionary plasticity: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The imagination projects the world for us as a state of nature, as 
absolute; but . . . the different techniques of the will, harnessing an 
ever growing sum of natural forces, animal instincts, human passions and 
motives, permit us to possess this world that we knew at birth only as an 
image and in a way that becomes ever more complete as we realize and 
reconstruct it. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">

<p>
It was through his work on Joyce that Petitjean had met Paulhan, whose 
<I>Les Fleurs de Tarbes</I>
 (The flowers of Tarbes), which first appeared 
in 1936, would challenge "surrealist fatalism" in the spheres of language 
and rhetoric, claiming that the Romantic avant-garde destroyed the "word" 
to obtain the "idea." Unlike Paulhan, however, and despite his own 
continued celebration of Joyce and persistent attack on surrealism, 
Petitjean did little in 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation</I>
 to 
analyze the verbal artifact. 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation</I>
 can 
be seen as a pataphysical 
<I>Finnegans Wake,</I>
 or theoretical stream of 
consciousness in the extreme. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">

</SUP>
Its sixteen-page index lists 
German, French, and English philosophers, natural and social scientists, 
all of Western literature (except for Wordsworth and Coleridge), and the 
surrealizing avant-garde. Kant, Schopenhauer, Hegel, Kierkegaard, 
Nietzsche, Ludwig Klages (the right-wing philosopher of 
<I>Der Geist als Widersacher der Seele</I>
 [The Intellect as opponent of the soul]) and 
Heidegger are important points of reference. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">
66</A>
</SUP>
<p>
In his review of 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation,</I>
 Fondane 
discerned a significant attack on the dominant French philosophical theory 
of the imagination--namely, Bergson's "fabulating function" 
<I>("fonction fabulatrice"),</I>
 which arises only as a phenomenon secondary to 
"intelligence." "Petitjean restores the flow's proper direction," writes 
Fondane; "Imagination comes first." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">
67</A>
</SUP>
Indeed, Petitjean posits 
an initial state of radical skepticism. Only through "the Imagination, 
that spiritual precipitation of vitality" do we perceive 
reality. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">
68</A>
</SUP>
Such Imagination is then Realized through the "will 
to conversion," 
<B></B>
 an imperative to reconstitute the 
self and the world in terms of the Imagination, as a form of projection 
called "imitation": "Realization is integration, insertion of the 
Imagination onto the plane of reality. It will thus proceed from imitation 
to imitation." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">
69</A>
</SUP>
Drawing upon Klages, Petitjean argues that 
primary imitation--a form of biological imagination, or mimicry--is a 
feature of the natural world, but that imitation in the second 
degree--that is, dialectical Imagination, or self-representation--is an 
activity of which only man is capable. Accordingly, the "will to 
imitation" must be harnessed as a form of dialectical mimicry, as the 
"conversion process" between Imagination and Realization, between the 
imaginary and the real. It is a 
<I>prise de conscience</I>
 predicated on 
"the integration, in turn, of that Imagination that initially integrated 
us." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">
70</A>
</SUP>
<p>
At this point, we locate a second major thrust of Petitjean's argument, 
which, like his earlier Joycean essays, still largely inveighs against the 
surrealist literary aesthetic. Of course, 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation</I>
 does proffer a more generally anti-ideological 
attack on the "fictionalism" of modernity, the degraded Imagination of 
which is politically and socially exploited, society of the spectacle 
<I>avant la lettre.</I>
 Petitjean seems really more interested, though, in 
how the avant-garde Imagination has run wild--and in this, he pinpoints 
"surrealist fatalism." If we do not master our Imagination in a virile and 
willful dialectic with Realization, he argues, first-degree imitations 
will stand as "
<I>sur- or subreality</I>
 . . . [,] a mockery of this 
reality and of its Imagination." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">
71</A>
</SUP>
Only the "hysteric," an 
epithet Petitjean often applies to surrealism, will take his (or her) 
relatively unself-conscious--or, indeed, unconscious--projections and 
mimetic pantomimes for real. 
<p>
Gaston Bachelard, who sought to revolutionize scientific epistemology in 
1934 with his "new scientific spirit" 
<I>("le nouvel esprit scientifique"),</I>
 was discovering surrealism in the very years in which 
he was becoming the "Master of Break Theory," to quote J. G. Merquior's 
study of Foucault. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">
72</A>
</SUP>
This may explain Bachelard's ecstatic 
response to Petitjean's philosophical style, "unique in the annals of 
philosophy." "Until now the Imagination had not found its metaphysician," 
he writes. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">
73</A>
</SUP>
These "programs of psychical realization[,] . . . 
 which we will henceforth have to call 'Petitjeanian gyrations' 
<I>[' les retournements petitjeaniens']</I>," convey "the true dynamics of the 
psyche." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">
74</A>
</SUP>
For this philosopher of science, such epistemic 
ruptures also revealed the imaginative dimension, or "breaks," within 
biology and natural evolution itself. "Life, just like thought, jumps from 
one image to another," Bachelard intones under the spell of Petitjean's 
lyrical prose. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">
75</A>
</SUP>
<p>
I would also correlate 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation</I>
 with that 
great monument to surrealizing phenomenological skepticism, Lacan's 
Imaginary, which, like Petitjean's conceptual framework, arose through and 
against surrealist "hysteria." Lacan's early work, as is well known, 
reflected a dialogue with Salvador Dali, whose own theory of "critical 
paranoia," of strategic obsession, purported to endow surrealism with a 
more powerful and active grasp of imagination than did its prior 
techniques, such as automatic writing. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">
76</A>
</SUP>
<p>
To establish a specific biographical connection, I would note that in 
October 
<B></B>
 1941, Paulhan will write to Petitjean, 
"Lacan is very eager to see you. Could you please give him a call before 
you leave." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">
77</A>
</SUP>
Three years earlier, reviewing the 
<I>Mental Life</I>
 volume of the 1938 
<I>Encyclop&eacute;die fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
Petitjean had himself evoked Lacan's "remarkable" article on the 
family--which included a section on the mirror stage--to praise this new 
psychology that "integrates the world in man by relating him to his own 
knowledge of the world and to what he mistook, until now, for 'objectivity.'" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">
78</A>
</SUP>
Their relation may even date back to 1935, 
when Petitjean published an essay in 
<I>Minotaure</I>
 linked to 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation</I>
--an essay he called "Analyse 
spectrale du singe" (Spectral analysis of the monkey). This appeared 
printed next to Caillois's "Mimicry and Legendary Psychasthenia," which 
Lacan enthusiastically mentions in his postwar, 
post-
<I>&eacute;puration</I>
 essay, "The Mirror Stage as Formative of the 
Function of the I" of 1949. Petitjean's essay, like Lacan's, compares 
monkey and man and their relation to mirrors. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">
79</A>
</SUP>
Above and 
beyond dizzying dialectical play, largely inspired by Klages--Who is 'aping' whom? (where the verb "to ape" 
<I>["singer"]</I>
 unites mimicry 
and ape 
<I>["singe"]</I>
)--we learn that we are not the acme of evolution: 
"the skull of man is closer to that of a monkey fetus than to that of an 
adult monkey." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">
80</A>
</SUP>
Indeed, such "infantilization" is at the 
source of our compensatory 
<I>human</I>
 Imagination: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
[Since] the monkey does not recognize itself in the mirror, since if it 
did it would immediately be metamorphosed into man, which is exactly the 
gesture of Narcissus, and [since] man is an animal capable of representing 
to himself death, the infinite, and himself, the fact remains that man is 
a laughing monkey. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">
81</A>
</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
Like Petitjean, Lacan cites "a real 
<I>specific prematurity of birth</I>
 in man" that conditions the desire 
for self-mastery through his specular image; this 
<I>mirror stage</I>
 will 
hence definitively situate "the agency of the ego . . . in a fictional 
direction." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">
82</A>
</SUP>
For Lacan, this process is "jubilant" ("MS," 2). 
For Petitjean, in 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation,</I>
 on the 
contrary, such relations to the gestalt may be "imaginary, forced, and 
desperate"--and Petitjean aspires, as we have seen, to a dialectical 
resolution of Imagination and Realization. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">
83</A>
</SUP>
It is intriguing 
to consider Lacan's 
<I>"function of m&eacute;connaissance"</I>
 ("MS," 6), 
derived from man's unique "organic insufficiency in his natural reality" 
("MS," 4) as a radical counterpoint to the voluntarist "eternal return of 
the imagination." 
<p>
After 1936, claiming allegiance to the Popular Front, Petitjean will take 
Imagination and Realization to "the people," to National Revolution, and, 
ultimately, to war. I mean to emphasize two things about this period of 
extreme intellectual complexity, during which Petitjean himself addressed 
a vast array of topics for 
<I>Vendredi.</I>
 First, as I mentioned 
previously, Petitjean, while remaining a nonconformist of the Left, moved 
increasingly toward right-wing nationalism. Second, Petitjean's veritable 
target, that is, the sole clear enemy of his revolutionary consciousness 
(which collapsed all distinction between the political and the aesthetic), 
remained the French avant-garde; 
<B></B>
 this will bring us 
back to our point of departure, the College of Sociology. 
<p>
Let us, then, briefly trace, without engaging the ideological chaos of 
these years, Petitjean's trajectory from leftist revolutionary Jacobinism 
to a more nationalist revolutionary populism, which he associated, in 
1938, with the great Dreyfusard, Charles P&eacute;guy. In the heyday of 
L&eacute;on Blum's government (1936-37), Petitjean's hopes ran high: 
revolution was compatible with negotiation. Against all odds, in early 
1938, he still favored the indeterminate Popular Front, "a political 
formation that our 'nationalists' abhor," whereby "slowly but surely," 
nevertheless, "with the same 'disorder' as that of the bourgeoisie during 
the French Revolution, the people of France is becoming 
nationalized." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">
84</A>
</SUP>
After Germany's 
<I>Anschluss</I>
 of Austria 
in March 1938, however, he adopted a posture of nationalistic 
belligerence. All the same, this did not diminish his Germanophilia and 
his chivalric esteem for the enemy. In April 1938, we find him praising 
the aristocratic German army, which "miraculously" survived the 
humiliating Treaty of Versailles and which "despite all the temptations of 
its strength, 
<I>was able to await Hitler.</I>
" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">
85</A>
</SUP>
In fact, 
Petitjean himself even sounds moved by the rise of Hitler: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
This man from the south, whose primary experience was Viennese, and who 
could witness how racial diversity, excessive speculation, and 
intellectual sophistication may threaten a great empire such as that of 
the Hapsburgs, came to return all of its people to Prussian rule, has 
armed the Reichswehr itself with an ideology more fearsome than any that 
motivated the last war. . . . As for the end result, I expect we shall see 
it soon. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">

</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
To his own pacifist country, Petitjean did not 
recommend socioeconomic change but articulated instead an agressive 
doctrine in which political (that is, governmental), social (that is, 
demographic), and cultural (that is, aesthetic) senses of "representation" 
were indissociable: "No 'people' is as poorly represented by their 
politics, literature, or by their capital as the French." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">
87</A>
</SUP>
This called for re-representation of the people on a grand, national 
scale. On the one hand, he endorsed a literary aesthetic, an ethics, and a 
politics of nationalist "reorientation" 
<I>("repaysement").</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">
88</A>
</SUP>
In more militaristic terms, he 
called for "the dictatorship of France over all Frenchmen." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">
89</A>
</SUP>
Petitjean would ground this protofascist ideology in the 
<I>"mystique"</I>
of P&eacute;guy, whose ambiguous intellectual legacy bridges Catholicism, 
socialism, and nationalism: "P&eacute;guy is coming back," he wrote in 
December 1938. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">

</SUP>
<p>
Petitjean's ideological indeterminacy is matched, if not conditioned, by 
the conceptual indeterminacy of Imagination and Realization as these terms 
are applied to the political sphere. 
<I>Le Moderne et son prochain</I>
describes how modern man is intellectually and emotionally "mobilized," or 
exploited, by liberalism, communism, and foreign forms of fascism. Russia, 
for instance, seems pragmatically nationalist, if paradoxically so. 
Unwittingly modernist in its very antimodernism, on the other hand, 
Germany's hypertrophied Imagination, or "integral Romanticism," is on the 
point of dangerous Realization. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">
91</A>
</SUP>
But worse than all the rest 
is liberal modernity's "concerted lack of consciousness." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">
92</A>
</SUP>
<B></B>
<p>
In these more local quarrels of the mind, Petitjean assumes a curious 
stance, since 
<I>repaysement</I>
 hardly dictates his nonconformist tastes; 
indeed, humor, for example, "allows the move from action to 
reflection." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">
93</A>
</SUP>
Most importantly, he is still on the Left. He 
advises the professorial author of 
<I>La Naus&eacute;e</I>
 (Nausea) "to 
open himself up to life, to immerse himself in the world, to harmonize 
Imagination with Realization."

(On 18 August 1938, Paulhan

Chronicling Malraux's antifascist engagement in the Spanish Civil War, the 
novel 
<I>L'Espoir</I>
 (Hope) offers, in Petitjean's estimation, the 
perfect antidote to Sartre: Malraux is "the first in France, since the 
upheavals of the last war, who enters voluntarily--consciously--into the 
history of the twentieth century." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">

Indeed, Petitjean has not 
even fully withdrawn from the avant-garde. In 1938, for example, he is 
planning to write 
<I>L'Oeil,</I>
 the first interdisciplinary study of the 
eye. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">

pure." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">

Petitjean's cosmopolitan sensibility has simply 
become nationalist as well. 
<p>
In effect, Petitjean's ideological and cultural ambiguities resolve 
themselves into a t with the surrealizing avant-garde he knows best. 
The "hysteria" of liberal modernity may well seem embodied in 
surrealism. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">

By 1938, however, "the surrealist movement is no

rigidity, claims Petitjean.

The real dangers for politicized 
consciousness now lie in C&eacute;line's lyrical right-wing anarchism and 
in the internationalist nonconformism of the experimental College of 
Sociology. If Petitjean's review of L'&Eacute;cole des cadavres (School 
for corpses) assails C&eacute;line as "spokesman for all that is 
spineless, cowardly, abandoned, catastrophic, Cassandresque, and 
treacherous in the country,"

Petitjean thereby underscores 
the revelatory but false consciousness such modernist prose may extend to 
its readers:

This language that is thought, that is not even purified by speech, these 
insults that are much more blasphemous, activist, and quasi-incantatory 
than Homeric invectives, due to the fact that they are no longer 
pronounced but written, do not reflect any reality (even verbal reality) 
or any jargon at all. Rather, they express the latent thoughts of 
thousands, of tens, of hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen.

<p>
In mimetic tension, Petitjean's violent diatribe against C&eacute;line 
recovers the Joycean prose of 
<I>Imagination et r&eacute;alisation.</I>
<p>
This very same month, December 1938, Petitjean published a confusing piece 
in the 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise</I>
 almost as virulent as his 
attack on C&eacute;line. In "Fascisme anti-fasciste" (Antifascist 
fascism), he raged against unnamed French "intellectuals without calling," 
"left-wing conservatives," whose absurd slogan was "
<I>Antifascist fascism!</I>
" and who had "recourse to foreign stimulants." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">

Drawn to the "rhythms" of Hitler and Mussolini, these res dissociate 
themselves, nevertheless, from German and Italian nationalism out of 
self-interest. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF104" HREF="#FOOT104">

</SUP>
Worst of all, however, they constantly 
<B></B>
 attack France itself. "Antifascist fascists" do not 
realize that "the great French revolutions did not occur in a state of 
dearth but involved, on the contrary, an overabundance of heart. They are 
revelation much more than transformation." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF105" HREF="#FOOT105">

<p>
And just who were these "antifascist fascists?" Here we return to the 
political ambiguities of the antiparliamentarian College of Sociology, to 
Bataille and Caillois, who generally shared Petitjean's belief that 
"contemporary history . . . involves psychology rather than 
economics." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF106" HREF="#FOOT106">
106</A>
</SUP>
Paulhan's correspondence with Petitjean, 
however, reveals the latter's deep conflict with the interdisciplinary 
College, which, along with Petitjean (and others), had criticized the 
Munich Accords in the November 1938 issue of 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise.</I>
 Nonetheless, as the "Declaration," drafted by 
Caillois, made perfectly clear, the antipacifist College of Sociology was 
also firmly antinationalist out of leftist, internationalist conviction; 
moreover, it envisioned a much more radical revolutionary strategy, one 
which could take shape after discussions and research. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF107" HREF="#FOOT107">
107</A>
</SUP>
Briefly put, and reflecting its own emergence against "surrealist 
fatalism," the College envisioned the resurrection of a loosely 
Durkheimian "sacred" that would recast "society" as "community" through 
sociological rather than patriotic or nationalist 
<I>prise de conscience</I>. 
<p>
In January 1939, after the publication of "Fascisme anti-fasciste," 
Paulhan proposed that Petitjean and the College resolve their internecine 
warring. As Paulhan would have it, the College of Sociology would cease 
rejecting any specific attention to France, and Petitjean, in turn, would 
stop singing the praises of France. "Is there not some institution, some 
social form, that might replace it, that through its very presence might 
provide . . . the broad outline of such praise?" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF108" HREF="#FOOT108">

</SUP>
By the very 
next month, Petitjean had launched a new journal for his generation, 
<I>Les Nouveaux Cahiers de la quinzaine,</I>
 the descriptive announcements 
of which suggest a Nationalist Revolutionary College of Sociology--"an 
Institution," declared Paulhan.

<A NAME="REF109" HREF="#FOOT109">

 Invoking P&eacute;guy and

<I>Les Nouveaux Cahiers de la quinzaine</I>

Compared to the 
conflictual and ambiguous College of Sociology, Petitjean's project seems 
a model of revolutionary plasticity, insofar as it explicitly aimed to 
reconcile dogma with ideological pluralism, theory with praxis, revolution 
with status quo, religion with materialism, mystical patriotism with 
social science, state with family (among other collectives), and the 
imaginary with the real. Discussion topics were to include "family, jobs, 
cult of the dead, army, youth groups, theater, spiritual authorities, 
intermediaries, representatives, managers, French regions, North Africa, 
French propaganda, foreigners in France."

concurrent discussion of the family in the

Alas, 
given the onset of the war, Petitjean's envisioned journal became instead 
the single-issue military journal 
<I>Courrier</I>
 (Paris-Province) (20

recruits.

As I noted at the outset, the members of the College of Sociology did not 
collaborate with the Germans. Caillois himself was trapped in Argentina 
during war. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF116" HREF="#FOOT116">

In his own wartime journal,

 edited under the auspices of Victoria Ocampo's 
<I>Sur</I>

<p>
Bearing in mind Petitjean's strong Germanophilia and sympathies for 
right-wing nationalism, can we predict the divergent paths these 
nonconformists were to take in any other way? I would tentatively suggest 
that the revolutionary intellectuals of the College of Sociology, 
generally older (except for Caillois), were both more radically visionary 
and more rigorous and principled than Petitjean, each in his own way. The 
"community" of the College thus floundered on the contradictions, both 
collective and private, that informed its members' responses to a deep 
sense of historical crisis. We might wish to consider, as well, the rather 
scientistic dimension of French modernism that inspired the College of 
Sociology--the "rational appropriation of the irrational," to recall 
Fondane's remark, however paradoxical or subverted--as opposed both to 
Petitjean's eccentric reading of Joyce and to his absorption of 
<I>Lebensphilosophie.</I>
 In any event, applauding the 
<I>Courrier</I>
several months later, Paulhan queried Petitjean nonetheless, "Once again, 
<I>what is it</I>
 that you want?" 
<SUP>

In February 1940, Drieu la Rochelle wrote quite poignantly about Petitjean 
in his diary: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_/extract-->
He seems already quite struck and frightened by the disintegration that he 
must directly confront at last. He is clenched, but there is already a 
sense of despair. Poor boy. More terribly than I will he come to know the 
shame that crushed me at such a young age. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF121" HREF="#FOOT121">

<p>
But Petitjean bounced back despite his wounded hand, the fall of France, 
and his disaffection from "the people." In September 1941, Paulhan, whose 
own intricate interactions with both collaboration and the Resistance have 
not yet been fully chronicled, wrote to Drieu about Petitjean. He was 
clearly surprised by Petitjean's easy move to the Vichy ministry of 
information: "Yes, the case of Petitjean is striking 
<B></B>
 and (most likely) tragic. Can one bring about revolution as a minister? . . . I don't know. I don't think so. . . . It means having great faith in 
the power of lies, in one's own ability to lie." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF122" HREF="#FOOT122">
122</A>
</SUP>
<p>
I will not survey at this point the continuity of youth movements between 
the Popular Front and Vichy, Petitjean's maneuvering throughout a period 
of political flux, his numerous articles in 
<I>Id&eacute;es: Journal de la R&eacute;volution Nationale</I>
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF123" HREF="#FOOT123">
123</A>
</SUP>
and the 
<I>Nouvelle Revue fran&ccedil;aise,</I>
 or his endorsement of French "imperial 
consciousness" toward North Africa ("Without the Empire, all hope is 
lost"). 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF124" HREF="#FOOT124">
124</A>
</SUP>
Most important, I think, is the basic shift in 
Petitjean's dialectic of Imagination and Realization, which during the 
Occupation is now conducted in dialogue with Vichy and the Third Reich 
rather than with the French avant-garde. After the fall of France, 
Petitjean no longer argues that his country need merely acknowledge its 
own strength. His particular form of fascist modernism generally shuns 
both the "rose-colored glasses" of P&eacute;tain's National Revolution as 
well as the "dark glasses" of collaborationists and others who reiterate 
the discourse of national crisis, namely that France should engage in 
National Revolution under the German aegis since the defeat confirmed its 
failure as a society. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF125" HREF="#FOOT125">
125</A>
</SUP>
In Petitjean's opinion, the most 
objective analysis of French socioeconomic collapse has been provided by 
German strategists themselves ("IF," 11-14). Yet an equally objective 
remedy for such problems is to revitalize French motivation and will by 
focusing on France's "true status in the world . . . as the avant-garde of 
human civilization." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF126" HREF="#FOOT126">
126</A>
</SUP>
<p>
If the Jacobin tradition placed France at the revolutionary forefront of 
Europe, Petitjean's essay "Principles of a Western Order"  also 
suggests, nonetheless, that German power should now inspire French 
revolutionary consciousness. Before the war, as we have seen, Petitjean 
viewed the problem of European modernity as that of an excessive, 
exploited, or unbridled Imagination. Thus, for example, Weimar was infused 
by dangerous, compensatory Romanticism. At present, in contrast, the 
problem (if it can be called that) is not modernity as weakened by myth 
but, instead, as gloriously bolstered by technology--that is, by excessive 
(or German) Realization. "The wealth, strength, and science of Western man 
evolve more quickly than does his consciousness," writes 
Petitjean. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF127" HREF="#FOOT127">
127</A>
</SUP>
This creates an imbalance between Imagination and 
Realization that triggers revolution. In the twentieth century, in other 
words, this disjunction has given rise to ideological Western 
revolutionaries, both Nazis and Bolsheviks, who "more secure in their 
traditions and more conscious of the future than the masses, have always 
strengthened and extended the masses' social structure and national 
horizon while restoring their sense of sacred honors." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF128" HREF="#FOOT128">

</SUP>
Such 
<I>prise de conscience</I>
 defined as elite utopian 
<I>doxa</I>
 seems 
tailor-made for the former nonconformists turned National Revolutionary 
propagandists in occupied France! 
<p>
After the war, and having been blacklisted by the CNE, Petitjean appraised 
his postwar ordeals in 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu</I>
 , which Daniel 
Lindenberg considers today an unjustly neglected and rare "auto-critique" 
of the time. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF129" HREF="#FOOT129">
129</A>
</SUP>
This historian likes what he 
<B></B>
 calls Petitjean's "desacralization" of writers and intellectuals 
whom, he claims, Paulhan tends on the contrary to "sacralize" and thus to 
exonerate in 
<I>De la paille et du grain.</I>
 Here, explains Lindenberg, 
lies "the true motive of [Paulhan's] practice, which consists of shielding 
[collaborationist writers] from any criticism." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF130" HREF="#FOOT130">
130</A>
</SUP>
Paulhan's 
defense of Petitjean and others from the CNE--of which he himself was a 
founding member--does indeed turn, in part, on the doctrine of the 
writer's "right to error." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF131" HREF="#FOOT131">
131</A>
</SUP>
<p>
A closer look at 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu</I>
 should help to illuminate 
these issues. First, when read closely, Petitjean's "unveiling" is nothing 
if not a self-exoneration. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF132" HREF="#FOOT132">
132</A>
</SUP>
Second, it glorifies Petitjean's 
status as a writer. Again, he positions himself above and beyond the 
ideological fray: "[this ter] has made too many mistakes, he has 
witnessed too many fully to adopt any one dogma." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF133" HREF="#FOOT133">
133</A>
</SUP>
Assailing 
the orthodoxies of 
<I>"gendlettres,"</I>
 (the intellectual avant-garde, 
that is, the CNE), Petitjean poses as a religious, universalizing moralist 
who may clarify the confused minds of his compatriots--"Divided 
<I>between</I>
 or 
<I>within</I>
 themselves?" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF134" HREF="#FOOT134">
134</A>
</SUP>
Unlike himself, 
they have not fully grasped the experience of the war. 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu</I>
 thus questions countless postwar ideological and moral oppositions 
and seeks to remedy, in particular, the unhinged identity of the French 
<I>"patrie"</I>
 (fatherland). Petitjean decries, for example, "the case of 
the internationalist sharpshooter [member of the Communist Resistance], 
who will t for his country only insofar as he deems it in accord with 
his political ideal." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF135" HREF="#FOOT135">
135</A>
</SUP>
<p>
Both Paulhan and Petitjean thus defined themselves in these years as 
nonconformists, as opposed to the Communist-dominated CNE, which wore the 
mantle of the national Resistance--yet Paulhan's defense of Petitjean in 
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
 can be read as a study in comparative 
nonconformisms. During the war, Paulhan remained loyal to Petitjean while 
consistently pointing out the logical and ethical contradictions of his 
behavior in a fascinating series of letters; his allusions to Petitjean in 
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
 are also ambivalent in the extreme. Most 
seriously, Paulhan remarks of 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu</I>
 that "[it] 
decides issues, instead of sorting them out." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF136" HREF="#FOOT136">
136</A>
</SUP>
This, of 
course, is precisely what 
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
 attacks in the 
"fascist adjudications" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF137" HREF="#FOOT137">
137</A>
</SUP>
of the CNE and is precisely what 
Paulhan seeks to oppose through his complex analyses of the "mysteries" 
inherent in patriotism and language. On the first crucial topic, for 
example, he counters Petitjean's lament that France was defended by 
Communists who foreswore the "fatherland" 
<I>("la patrie")</I>
 as an 
ideal. France was brilliantly betrayed, Paulhan replies, but it was 
betrayed by the very nationalists who worshipped it as such. In these 
confusions, Petitjean, the CNE, and others are 
<I>equally</I>
enmeshed. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF138" HREF="#FOOT138">
138</A>
</SUP>
<p>
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
 targets Petitjean in particular, however, 
by summoning his tendency to use untranslated foreign words. Despite 
Paulhan's ironic intimations of the relation of multilingualism and 
collaborationism, his line of thought is hardly so reductive; rather, it 
recalls Petitjean's reading of Joyce and the question of literary 
lucidity. For Paulhan, the question becomes, how well does a writer master 
the mysterious play of his own language, of a foreign language--or, more 
generally--of what he is writing? 
<B></B>
<p>
At this point, 
<I>De la paille et du grain</I>
 cites Petitjean's use of 
the Kierkegaardian term 
<I>einkelte</I>
 (the individual) with seemingly 
gratuitous aim. If we return to 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu,</I>
 however, we 
realize that Petitjean had vigorously condemned in this singular re, 
"[one] who takes himself tragically, who finds himself suddenly before God 
without any self-awareness." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF139" HREF="#FOOT139">
139</A>
</SUP>
In a sense, Kierkegaard's 
<I>einkelte</I>
 is made to serve as an antithesis to Petitjean's own 
moralizing stance. Yet, Paulhan writes of the 
<I>einkelte,</I>
 "once it 
has gone astray in a French text, [it] is no longer simply the solitary. 
It is the solitary with some kind of advantageous nuance (which remains 
Petitjean's secret)--as if it were very serious to be 
solitary!" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF140" HREF="#FOOT140">
140</A>
</SUP>
The secretive, "advantageous" opacity that 
Paulhan attributes to Petitjean's 
<I>einkelte</I>
 becomes deeply ironic, 
since it reverses the 
<I>einkelte</I>'s stated status in 
<I>La Mise &agrave; nu</I>
--and thus implicitly impugns the writer's own relation to 
self-consciousness and conscience. More than mere hypocrisy, linguistic, 
or intellectual error, or uncharted semantic excess, it is rather a form 
of unintentional inauthenticity that Paulhan seems to reveal. In other 
words, any writer may make mistakes, in either his own or in a foreign 
language, but some writers are completely blind to what they write. 
<p>
Living conduit that he is between the 
<I>ni droite ni gauche</I>
 1930s, 
the Phony War, Vichy, the 
<I>&eacute;puration,</I>
 and ecology trends of 
the 1970s and 1980s, Petitjean reveals a remarkable plasticity. On one 
level, he returns to the right-wing biological metaphysics of his youth, 
although now shorn of its Nietzschean voluntarism. On another level, he 
returns to the politically nonconformist Left; despite man's encounter 
with the limits of nature, Petitjean still believes in utopias. In the 
wake of May 1968, he thus asserts: "the global vision of a just world must 
arise in our hearts." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF141" HREF="#FOOT141">
141</A>
</SUP>
In 1989, he recommends that the 
experimental "biosphere" avoid "all ideological 
infiltration." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF142" HREF="#FOOT142">
142</A>
</SUP>
He assails egocentrism, anthropocentrism, 
Eurocentrism, and tempers the strain of the world's demise with all the 
fervor of a revolutionary Deep Ecologist: Man must acknowledge "alterity 
within himself, in all beings, within Nature itself." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF143" HREF="#FOOT143">

If

 scoffs at Petitjean's 
"entertaining" but "tenuous argument," remarking that this "contributor to

 has written a long essay . . . in order to commend the 
linguistic experiments of Mr. Joyce. He pays tribute to the master more 
effectively in his manner than in his matter. . . . His dismissal of D. H. 
Lawrence and Sherwood Anderson has point; but his remark regarding Mr. 
Pound that 'American imagism has become no more than a kind of poetical 
atomism' is a fairer sample of how he has sought to make his too many 
verdicts more terse than arresting. He may be said to coruscate, not to 
burn with any devouring flame" (M. B., review of

The Declaration of the College on the International Crisis reads as

regards the general absence of intense reaction in the face of war as a

Bernard Comte's spectrum of ideological currents in Vichy explains 
that 
<I>Id&eacute;es</I>
 united authoritarian proponents of "hard-line

supporters of Paul Marion--with dissident right-wing Maurrassians in an 
attack upon loyal followers of the Mar&eacute;chal P&eacute;tain 
(
<I>UC,</I>
 371-72). Comte notes elsewhere that the founders of 
<I>Id&eacute;es,</I>
 targeting an audience of educated youth, had little 
resonance in this milieu where they lacked "strong institutions" 
("organisations puissantes") and where the Catholic church prevailed

On the philosophical aspects of Deep Ecology, see Luc Ferry, 
<I>Le Nouvel ordre &eacute;cologique</I>
 (Paris: Grasset, 1992). Petitjean's 
title, "Toward Man's Contract with Nature," explicitly echoes the basic 
premise of Deep Ecology, which, according to Ferry, displaces the Social 
Contract with a Natural Contract, whereby "the entire universe becomes the 
subject of rights: it is no longer man, viewed as the center of the world, 
who must be first and foremost protected against himself, but it is now 
rather the 
<I>cosmos</I>
 as such which must be protected against man" 
("l'univers tout entier deviendrait sujet de droit: ce n'est plus l'homme, 
consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme centre du monde, qu'il faut au premier chef 
prot&eacute;ger de lui-m&ecirc;me, mais bien le 
<I>cosmos</I>
 comme tel, 
qu'on doit d&eacute;fendre contre les hommes" [28]).

 It might be suggested, though, that Petitjean disproves Ferry's claim
