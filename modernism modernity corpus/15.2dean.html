<b>Abstract</b>
<p>Gertrude Stein's notebooks reveal her acute awareness of a constitutive feature of late nineteeth- and early twentieth-century urban life, the grid. The grid structure, as a model of visual and material organization, characterizes and is consolidated across legible environments from the visual-textual integration of the printed page to the design of city streets, becoming the definitive paradigm of modern spatio-temporal experience. Stein's notebooks for "Subject-cases: The Background of a Detective Story" demonstrate that Stein, in playing with the grid, not only subjects its basic features to rearrangement through her diagrammatic method but also uncovers its political foundations.</p>

<p id="lead">In one of her little <i>carnets</i>—a bound notebook smaller than a stack of cards—Gertrude Stein plays a game of fill-in-the-blank. Printed on the flyleaf, inside a box decorated with a floral motif, are black lines dedicated to proper identification: lines on which to write the notebook's subject, the start and end date of its use, and the owner's name and address. But Stein refuses this staid propriety. Her book says instead: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>LIVRE  <br />

Commence le <i>best</i> <br />
Termine le <i>best also</i> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APPARTENANT <br />
A <i>cuddle</i> <br />
Rue <i>muddle</i> No. <i>middle</i><sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The little book's empty lines evidently offered an irresistible opportunity. Stein's elliptical sense of humor and trademark language <i>à rebours</i> meet their perfect straight man here, the sober idiom of function, producing a Mad-Libs poem that parades its own diagrammatic skeleton.  </p>

<p>The diagram as a term is suggested by Stein herself in her essay "Poetry and Grammar," in which she speaks of and performs the synchronization of the material world, the abstract system of language and the self: "I really do not know anything has ever been more exciting than diagramming sentences. . . . I like the feeling the everlasting feeling of sentences as they diagram themselves. In that way one is completely possessing something 

<b></b>

and incidentally one's self."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Stein's reference to "completely possessing something and <i>incidentally</i> one's self" (my emphasis) brings together external, objective experience and internal, subjective experience, carefully refusing a claim of relation between them. The point is precisely that, in her pleasure in diagramming, the grammatical vectors of sequence are, ironically, detached from any theory of origin or causation regarding subjects and objects. The "I" enjoys diagramming sentences; meanwhile, the sentences independently "diagram themselves." Likewise, the "possessing" trespasses back and forth across normal lines of transmission, for the things of language are possessed by a self that is also possessed by language, in a present continuous tense—"is possessing." Such mutually constitutive possessing is, like the feeling it produces, "everlasting." Stein's diagramming, therefore, involves the mapping of experience on to an elastic and transitory conceptual space where specific elements and the relations between them matter but cannot take a fixed form.  </p>

<p>Outside of its didactic use in grammar, in English a diagram is a basic structural illustration or outline of a re. In French, however, a <i>diagramme</i> is also a graph. Given that French was most plausibly the language that galvanized Stein's interest in grammar—the language that she was learning at the beginning of her writing career and that she never completely mastered—it is likely that the other French meaning of the term inflects her use of it.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  But whether it is conceived as a schematic rendering of syntax, as a schematic illustration, or as a schematic grid of intersecting lines, a diagram in the conventional sense is a visual system for the representation of predetermined categories into which specific information is inserted. Stein's use of the term, however, radically rearranges this system. She insists on the primacy of concrete experience rather than fixed categories and fixed relations between categories, although she does not deny the existence of categories either. Stein's diagramming does not contain experience through <i>a priori</i> categories, nor does it provide an answer key to relieve the reader. Rather, it is an evolving structure in which categories and experiential data signify on the same plane. Her statement about diagramming sentences, in the end, articulates a philosophy of language in which the diagram res as the ground rule: a means of perceiving and simultaneously organizing experience. The diagram thus provides Stein with an answer to the problem of representation—the philosophical impasse and historical baggage associated with representation that, like others in her generation, she was attempting to circumvent. It allows her to sidestep representation in favor of presentation, via language as object. Through her diagrammatic practice, language may be treated materially, as a set of detachable units to be broken apart and rearranged. </p>

<p>Diagramming therefore captures Stein's analysis of living experience, which associates concrete objects and their fundamental lack of knowability. In order to resist the shell game of mimesis—the pretense that something is not missing—Stein uses words to turn experience into things that are simultaneously present and absent, aiming to make both presence and absence perceptible. As she touches each thing again and again in its process of unfurling, she creates repetitions, or what she calls "insistence."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  "Insistence" is crucial to her "continuous present," a phrase that oversees the slippage 

<b></b>

between physical presence and temporal presence, the <i>pas de deux</i> of experience in space-time. Based on a manner of conceptualizing experience indebted to sentence diagramming, graphing, and similar modes of visual demonstration, Stein's diagram is a scrolling display of coincident text and metatext.  </p>

<p>The little notebook's fill-in-the-blank text is just such a machine-in-the-making, for it registers and sets into motion an experience in progress, one present for Stein at the time of writing that she obliquely situates next to the prompts and blanks provided by the notebook. It is likely the <i>carnet</i> really did come from the <i>cuisine</i>—it probably belonged to the cook originally, and perhaps Stein simply meant to praise her cooking, to say that it was always the best from beginning to end. "Cuddle" is one of Stein's nicknames, here evoking the cosy warmth appropriate to the kitchen, and "muddle" and "middle" are euphonious, mouthy words to mix with it. The three words also, in sequence, cleverly reproduce the idea of filling in the blank, as they vary by only one letter from the preceding word. </p>

<p>However, this hybrid text is also a display of script intersection in which printed type meets manuscript, which is supposed to conform to print's dictates but here satirizes it instead. The other writings and drawings in the <i>carnet</i>, epitomizing the innocent and familiar inscriptions that attend domestic life, also exhibit this feature of writing—writing that, even in the most casual context, has become bound to its own surface, to a support that is visually assertive and visibly organized. The last page of the <i>carnet</i> contains a homemade chart: a list in French, containing the words, with some misspellings, <i>corsage</i>, <i>cache corsets</i>, <i>calcons</i>, <i>bas</i>, <i>mouchoirs</i>, <i>tricots</i>, <i>jupon</i>, <i>chemisette nuit</i>, <i>col dentelle</i>, <i>peignoir</i>, in a handwriting that is not Stein's, followed by four columns of numbers, some of which are crossed out or ticked off, separated by four hand-drawn vertical lines.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  The back flyleaf of the <i>carnet</i> is printed with a "Table de Multiplication" for the numbers two through fifteen, in three columns; opposite this, on the inside back cover, is a crude pencil drawing of a four-legged animal with a tail. The paper itself in this <i>carnet</i> is quadruled in light blue lines. Each of these innocuous and ordinary elements displays the dominance of visual array: the quadruled paper invites the writer to graph, inventory, or tabulate; the multiplication tables provide a pattern for the budget-maker; even the sketch can be seen to conform to the geometric imperative, precisely because it has no obvious purpose—it was made because the space for making it existed.  </p>

<p>Stein's diagrammatic method in the flyleaf poem and throughout her work is thus predicated on the prevalence of paper geometrically cut, printed, and bound. In Stein's compositional environment, the alliance between these mechanomorphic qualities of the everyday writing surface and the diagram is apparent. A diagram even makes an appearance on the cover of one of her larger compositional notebooks, a schoolchild's <i>cahier</i>, where an image of children playing with a paper airplane is accompanied by a labeled plan of the airplane—presumably allowing the young consumers of the notebook to use its very pages to reproduce the toy. (<a href="#1"> 1</a>) The <i>cahier</i> cover, like the multiply charged <i>carnet</i>, reveals that Stein's practice of diagramming is reinforced by a popular textual culture inherited from the nineteenth century, one valorizing the 

<b></b>

organized visual presentation of text. Stein participated in this culture through her choice of writing materials, her compositional methods, and her daily domestic and metropolitan experiences. The popular textual culture of Stein's Parisian milieu, that is, produced an environment of surfaces organized into lines and quadriform spaces: a gridded world.  </p>

Detecting the Grid: From Printed Page to City Plan 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>The grid is a familiar re of modernist visuality. As the basis for and constant preoccupation of a modernist visual aesthetic that signifies a break with the past, the grid, according to Rosalind Krauss, "has been almost totally successful in walling the visual arts into a realm of exclusive visuality and defending them against the intrusion of speech."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  As it is "[impervious] to language," it is also "[hostile] to narrative" and by extension to chronology and incident (<i>OAG</i>, 158). These characteristics of the grid, in Krauss's account, are implicitly caught up in its simultaneous and contradictory "centripetal"

<b></b>

 and "centrifugal" effects, its role in the modernist secular religion of abstraction, and, above all, what Krauss calls the "illusion . . . of the originary status of the pictorial surface" (<i>OAG</i>, 18; 160). The grid, therefore, is what enables the avant-garde to signify itself as such, even though it is paradoxically a structure that only permits repetition, a "system of reproductions without an original" (<i>OAG</i>, 162). Krauss's argument, focused on the repressed and yet essential role of the copy in avant-garde practice from the nineteenth century on, requires a definition of the grid that is fundamentally resistant to language. The implicit temporality of her schema is static; both as a period in which art was premised on the denial of an original and as a style that defiantly reiterates framing, this grid thwarts the entry of time into the space of the visual. </p>

<p>Krauss's account of the grid, however, overlooks the grid's most prevalent medium in the period of the modernist avant-garde: not painting, but popular print culture—printed texts and printed images. Krauss thus betrays the influence of Clement Greenberg and other formalists with whom she is in other ways at odds; the grid in Krauss's argument is, symptomatically, the grid that one gets with the limited purview of high art. Despite her attention to pastiche and collage, Krauss slights the materiality of the grid as the formative rubric of modernist art practice, which manipulated and was in large part a response to the inescapable actual products of reproductive technologies, not just the theoretical condition of reproducibility. The printed texts and images that permeated the legible environment, especially in the urban centers where artists gathered, were not only widespread but increasingly allied; text and image, previously held to separate philosophical and practical conditions, were enlisted in the same framework. Illustrated postcards, magazines, newspapers, advertisements, posters, and books were the products of reproductive print technologies such as lithography, photography, and rotary press processes, which allowed for the integration of text and image. This integration was consummated through the grid, a paradigmatic structure into which words and pictures could be placed and valued as equivalents.  </p>

<p>The grid devolves from, reinforces, and is reified by print. As the product of typography and the graphic imperative, it does not erect a fortress <i>against language</i> as Krauss claims, but is instead profoundly <i>attached to language</i> through printed text, the form in which language takes on a uniform visuality. Accordingly, the grid operates with the temporal movement of language. The grid of popular print culture is integrally implicated in sequence, rather than repetition that denies an origin, for printed text is the first example of a system of "repetitions" that evolve block by block—a system that culminates in cinema. As the defining feature of the legible environment, the grid is materialized primarily in visual-textual objects that depend on visible and potentially infinite sequencing, generating the transitory and serial temporality of the line of letters, the daily newspaper, the roll of film—the modest, mass-produced, and omnipresent things of everyday life. Stein calls attention to this temporality through the continuous present; her mischievous deployment of the continuous present is one of her many techniques—which collectively I am calling her diagrammatic method—for revealing, parodying, and playing with the grid.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>As the dominant vehicle and effect of popular print culture, the grid must be understood to comprise an inexorable feature of modern temporal experience. Modern temporality, as described by Benedict Anderson, was indeed instigated by print technology; in particular, the "simultaneity" of the novel and the newspaper—in which, respectively, concurrent plotlines and newsworthy events took material form—was indebted to the grid.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> In its reliance on, and revaluation of, temporal sequence, the grid initiates a reading-and-looking activity that is in constant but orderly motion. But the grid also fundamentally affects the spatial experience of the page, by facilitating a revisionary and fluctuating understanding of positive and negative space. The codependence of, exchange between, even interchangeability of text and image within a common matrix, are the most important factors contributing to the paradigm of the grid, and this unified display of text and image in turn depends on the basic units of the grid, lines and spaces. Yet the visual value accorded each of these units varies depending on location. The line may be visible, as in the black ink of the line of printed letters, or it may be "invisible," a visible blankness awaiting completion, as in Stein's <i>carnet</i>. Likewise, the quadrangular element of the grid created by lines may be an empty space, a framed absence, or it may be a solid block. The grid therefore puts into play a constantly changing and contingent relationship between what is there and what is not there, requiring a visuality that must be aware of the potential legibility of both positive and negative lines and spaces. </p>

<p>So far this survey of the grid has been concerned with its production in popular print culture, the visual-textual complex of the "pictorial turn" of the mid-nineteenth century.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  But the visual tracking of time and space that the visual-textual grid necessitated was not, in fact, confined to the page, and neither was the grid structure itself. Indeed, those technologies responsible for the visual-textual grid, beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, were intimately related to other technologies of mass production that had begun to change the basic terms of everyday life, in transportation, communication, recreation, the workplace, and domestic practices. These technologies and their products shared the basic temporal and spatial characteristics of the grid: the framed and changing spectacle of goods in department store windows; the successive movement of railroad boxcars; the sequential time of the assembly line. The nexus of these new forms of everyday experience—temporal and spatial experience associated, broadly speaking, with the visuality of the grid—was the city.  </p>

<p>The city was the place where the goods of mass-production were concentrated, and where the producers, sellers, managers, and distributors of those goods worked and lived. It was also in the city that the emblems of the visual-textual grid, such as newspapers, were produced. Most importantly, the nineteenth-century city itself took on the aspect of the grid. For example, the reorganization of Paris in the 1860s not only created standardization in the layout of streets, but also in the names of those streets and their identification in consistently spaced and uniformly designed street signs. Haussmann could not make Paris conform completely to the grid, since the new city had to be adapted to the preexisting medieval city and its landmarks, but he did apply to the city surface the basic units of the line and the geometric space, especially 

<b></b>

the straight line of the broad avenue, affording a clear view and the visual delectation of order.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In the United States, the grid was adopted as the <i>de facto</i> planning device of new towns and cities, for the grid proved to be "cheap, fast, reliable, and widely understood . . . a perfect marketing formula for headlong growth."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Moreover, the grid "registered the cultural expectations that conditioned nineteenth-century land use": equality, accessibility, adaptability, and the infinite extension afforded by the interchangeability of parts.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Envisioned through the structure of the grid, the city itself became a legible environment. </p>

<p>Its physical layout in lines and geometric shapes made the nineteenth-century city consonant with the visual-textual grid.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  The grid thus organized very different forms of nineteenth-century physical culture—the spaces through which one moved as well as the things one observed. On the large scale, the grid was the progeny of the nineteenth-century marriage between commodity culture and new visual technologies such as lithography, photography, and halftoning, which had industrial applications but which could also produce new private and domestic "spaces" through personal mementos like daguerreotypes and keepsake albums and parlor games such as zoetropes and stereoscopes. This intersection manufactured new methods of seeing texts and reading images, new urban experiences of space and time, and new spectatorial visions of selfhood. However, while the grid's multiple and interconnected forms originated in the nineteenth century, the grid per se was not yet fully visible, for the grid <i>as a system</i> was only unveiled as such in the twentieth century.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> </p>

<p>In the twentieth century, the grid system of the city and the grid system of print culture could be seen and read together, being equally subject to legibility and visual surveillance. Given this correspondence, the grid became an organizing value of spatiality itself, an abstract notion made manifest in urban design, architecture, the packaging and advertising of manufactured consumer items, and the already recognizable geometric schemes of apartment blocks, textile patterns, maps, and newspapers. In this epistemological shift to a gridded world, such disparate dimensions of everyday life appeared not only as interconnected components of the grid, but as visual surfaces bearing or awaiting textualization. The concept of the grid could thus extend into blank spaces free of inscription. It could also extend into time, which was made to conform visually to the grid through the publication of timetables and the standardization of time zones. In short, the grid no longer needed to be visible in order to be seen. The "grid vision" of modernism, therefore, was imaginary as well as physiological: the lines and spaces of the material grid available to sight were supplemented and multiplied by the developing mental habit of envisioning gridded structures. In its visible forms, the grid provided reading cues—as in a line of printed text, the key to a map, the border around an illustration in a magazine. In less visible forms, it also provided writing cues, because even those kinds of inscriptions that might seem to be outside the parameters of a geometric matrix, such as handwriting or the drawn line, were joined to an imagined grid. Such "invisible" grids often consisted of framed and designated blank spaces awaiting manuscript completion, as in the vacant square of the postcard, a contract to be signed, or Stein's travestied <i>carnet</i>. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>The grid as the ubiquitous form of the visual-textual interface would have become increasingly familiar to Stein through multiple sources. Photographs, postcards, bound booklets, pieces of lined paper, official licenses and documents, receipts, bills of sale, and other ephemera of everyday life had the visual appearance of the grid, often modified or completed by manuscript. The most telling evidence of the grid as an environmental fixture for Stein, however, occurs in her notebooks, the small <i>carnets</i> and the composing <i>cahiers</i>.  </p>

<p>The small <i>carnets</i> contain not only the cook's shopping lists and Stein's jokey doodles and play texts, but also messages exchanged between Alice and Gertrude, as well as occasional drafts and writing memos. They contain, in other words, a full range of inscriptive possibilities, all upon surfaces of lined or quadruled paper. These visually organized, commonplace, and cheap instruments of writing would have been especially marked for Stein, who did not spend time in an office, as part of home life.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Throughout her decades in Paris, Stein used these devices on a daily basis; they provided the essential material of composition, but they also imparted domestic order and pleasure, connecting private and public space through the grid. As vehicles of the regulation of manuscript and, by extension, the thought process, an effect that might seem properly to belong to bureaucratic, official, and public realms, the <i>carnets</i> demonstrate a limited power, for they also facilitate transgression. That is, the <i>carnets</i> seem to offer a means to organize and contain domestic note-taking that is easily, sometimes joyfully, and sometimes indifferently flouted, as in the fill-in-the-blanks poem, the willy-nilly combination of "genres," or the illegibility of one <i>carnet</i> page on which Gertrude and Alice wrote notes to each other at perpendicular angles, one text block right on top of another, one stage of writing eclipsing and obscuring the one beneath it in perfect grid formation.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The <i>carnets</i> indicate that, treated diagrammatically—subjected to Stein's categorical rearrangements, perception of blank spaces, and experience-centered organization—the grid format can be adapted to ends contrary to its inherent and seemingly unassailable regimentation. </p>

<p>The larger <i>cahiers</i> that Stein generally used for composition, which as objects are equally indicative of the structure of the grid, are filled with writing that seems at first glance less visually responsive than that in the <i>carnets</i>.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Nevertheless, the <i>cahiers</i> also demonstrate how diagramming can absorb the grid and rearrange its formal components. Stein used the kind of notebooks that were intended for schoolchildren and were widely available, not just at stationery shops, but at bookstores, newsstands, groceries, department stores, and pharmacies. Before and during the First World War, all her <i>cahiers</i> have black cardboard covers, are approximately nine by seven inches in size, and contain anywhere from eighty to two hundred pages of paper in horizontal lines or grids. Beginning in the early 1920s, notebooks with illustrated, colored paper covers prevail among her collected papers. These later notebooks are not only more visually complicated, but also represented for Stein a novelty item, a departure from her prewar norm. They materialize the grid in a more obvious form, so it is not surprising that in these later notebooks Stein seems both more aware of the grid and more keen to play with it.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<h1 class="sec-headA">
Diagramming the Grid: Stein's "Subject-cases" 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Characteristic of this latter category of notebook are the fifteen <i>cahiers</i> that contain the manuscript of Stein's story "Subject-cases: The Background of a Detective Story," composed in 1923.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  "Subject-cases" presents an exceptional opportunity for reading Stein's diagrammatic method in relation to the grid of print culture as its commitments to both the diagram and the grid are pronounced. As a story, "Subject-cases" has been diagnosed even by a Stein critic as "impenetrable" and "enigmatic."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Such a conclusion is not surprising, for in print "Subject-cases" is entirely opaque; the story has no discernible plot, setting, or characters. Viewed through the framework of its title, the story establishes Stein's special interest in the genre of the detective story—and, given its word repetitions, cascading sentences, and cumulative paragraphs, that this interest is, at bottom, "structural."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  However, while the text in printed form makes no obvious statement about the significance of the writing environment of its original manuscript, an examination of its detective-story foundations in relation to the notebooks as objects reveals that in fact it stages a pointed and triumphant diagrammatic sally with the grid. "Subject-cases" articulates specifically, first of all, that the detective story mirrors the grid in its structure—its urban <i>topos</i>, its sequentiality and implied temporality, and its predictable arrangements of repeated objects. Secondly, through the detective story, Stein not only discloses the structure of the grid, but also, through a diagrammatic treatment, subjects it to recombination and rearrangement. Finally, Stein's probing engagement with the grid exposes its political foundations. </p>

<p>Stein's structural interest in the detective story is best summed up in her 1936 lecture, "What Are Master-pieces and Why Are There So Few of Them," in which she claims that "the detective story is . . . the only really modern novel form that has come into existence."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  She attributes its modernity to its reversal of the usual linear progression of plot: "by having the man dead to begin with . . . you have so to speak got rid of the event before the book begins. . . . In real life people are interested in the crime more than they are in detection . . . but in the story it is the detection that holds the interest and that is natural enough because the necessity as far as action is concerned is the dead man . . ." ("MP," 358). She continues this thought with a self-demonstrating joke that again underlines what makes a detective story interesting, the death not only of its pseudo-protagonist but of a particular time-consciousness: "I <i>once said</i> that nothing could bother me more than the way that a thing goes dead <i>once it has been said</i>" ("MP," 361; my emphasis). This "modern" feature of the detective story may seem implausible. After all, the detective story is by definition acutely dependent on plot, more so than any other genre; by extension its temporal structure would seem to be hypertypical. For Stein, though, it is this very dependence, constituting the essential and candid contract between reader and writer, that removes the detective story from the predicament of plot, the elaborate constructedness of which is supposed to remain politely unremarked. This structural legibility makes the detective story peculiarly modern; its "'formulaic' qualities"—"experiments with narrative voice, generic codes, and self-reflexivity"—"constitute less an 'escape from literature' than a foregrounding 

<b></b>

of its very nature."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  The detective story as it progresses is always in the process of analyzing itself, for it is a plot about a plot, and more generically, about plot itself. </p>

<p>This structure makes the detective story a prime candidate for Stein's diagrammatic treatment. The typical detective story has two temporalities that work against each other: the detection narrative progresses while the narrative about "the event"—the death, the culminating incident—regresses. The two narratives hook up at either end; the conclusion of the past event, the death, is what initiates the detection, and the detection ends only when the beginning of the past event has been discovered. The way to stay current in the detection plot is to update the present continuously by counterpoising it—"weigh" and "measure" are recurring terms in "Subject-cases"—against the fragmented pieces of the past event. Stein reminds the reader of this dual temporal scheme throughout "Subject-cases" by emphasizing the broken chronology of the detective plot. She throws its progress into relief through fragments that intimate temporal disjunction, such as, "It was succeeded by, it was before this" ("SC," 8).<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The word that inserts time-consciousness most often and that most succinctly suggests the double temporality of the detective story is "antedate," as in, "The history and beaming, the first article antedating making more than examples" ("SC," 12). The word dominates an entire paragraph but also appears repeatedly throughout the entire text. Through these temporal communiqués, Stein proposes that to read a detective novel is to participate dramatically in narrative presence, an experience of continually uncertain, contingent currency that is distinguished from and marked against the partial, isolated, and dissonant pieces of the past event.  </p>

<p>Besides the temporality required by its plot, Stein unveils and maneuvers other constitutive features of the detective story structure. She mimics the cumulative minutiae of clutter that inhabits the detective story, and the manner in which these "same things" must be constantly arranged and rearranged to form plausible narratives in the minds of the reader and the detective.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  In a conventional detective story, the hard facts that are built up into a reconstruction of the past event must be repeated, because the reappearance of a thing is the clue to its validity. These "same things" also characterize the genre as a whole, making repeat appearances in multiple texts as stock elements: the smoking gun, the dead body, the stolen diamond, the cryptic telegraph, and so on. </p>

<p>"Subject-cases" sets up these features of the same thing with an opening section of clever doggerel, essentially like Stein's fill-in-the-blank <i>carnet</i> game, that introduces the main ingredients of the detective story and the recombinational play of elements central to the process of detection:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In case of this. / A story. / Subjects and places. / In place of this. / A story. / Subjects and traces. / In face of this. / A story. / Subjects and places. / In places of this and in place of this. / A story. / Subject places. / In place of this. / A story. / When the work when the work and when the work when should he work. / In place of this and in place of this and in place of this places. </p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This section prepares the reader for increasingly complicated paragraphs of recombination in which the sounds and various grammatical functions of words are exhibited, as in, "Every now and then and when, when every now and then and where . . . very presently and to present it as a present or as present. It is present, and better pleased than before" ("SC," 19). Here the sound of the stock phrase "now and then" is emphasized by the addition of the rhyming word "when," and the different syntactic forms of the word "present" require different pronunciations. Often Stein uses rhyme and simplistic word associations to exhaust the possibilities, aurally and conceptually, of each of the fundamental detective story elements that each paragraph explores—structural components necessary to detective plots such as "agitation," "accident," "periodical," "change," "a station in justice," "direction," and "antedate." The process of word experimentation imitates the continual, recombinational mental activity of detection and glosses pure Steinian diagramming. </p>

<p>Gradually, these paragraphs about plot elements are interrupted more and more frequently by fragments of idiomatic genre speech, as if imported from actual stories. For instance, possible "subject-cases" are introduced, that is, suspects on whom a case could be based—a "he" who "makes music" and "was in love with his wife," a "they" circling around "two," and later "three" and "four" and a "party." Other telling details and phrases appear as well, some of which return and some of which do not, in keeping with the formula's requirement that the reader/detective be occasionally misled: "Corals are again stylish" ("SC," 9), "silver set of course" ("SC," 16), "blinds can be drawn" ("SC," 20), "finders keepers" ("SC," 21), "central baggage" ("SC," 23). Stein never lets us forget (which would force us to rely on the representational faculty of memory) that <i>this</i> detective story is, in effect, a story about a story about a story. Adding another layer of referentiality, Stein also throws in deictic pointers to the text itself and her writing process: the title, of course, forces us to apply the grammatical sense of the subjective or nominative case—the state of being a person or thing—to the gumshoe vocabulary of "subjects" and "cases."  </p>

<p>The piece of idiomatic genre speech that saturates "Subject-cases" most thoroughly is the word "parlor," which is the basis for several especially fervid stretches of verbal orchestration, as in, "So indeed so indeed a parlor settles that. So indeed and so indeed and so indeed and a parlor settles that and so indeed a parlor and so indeed a parlor settles that. A parlor. Indeed, and as to a parlor. Indeed as to the parlor. A parlor settled that" ("SC," 22).<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The last paragraph of Chapter II evokes a climactic feeling by playing at length on the words "at once," calling up both meanings of immediacy and simultaneity; this paragraph is preceded by a paragraph that tells us, "Prepare, kindly prepare the parlor. The parlor is prepared. Kindly antedate it, it is antedated, kindly attend to it, it is attended to . . ." ("SC," 28). The word "parlor" distinctly conjures the all-important setting of the detective story. Moreover, the rhythm of its appearances in Stein's story corresponds to its structural role at the beginning, middle, and end: the crime scene, where the event is committed or discovered; the place to which the detective must continually return in search of clues; and the location of the crime's exegesis, where the detective finally informs the various suspects and witnesses gathered "at once" who 

<b></b>

among them are the real "subject-cases." In that place, the dual temporalities of the story reconnect and the story must end with its conclusive "antedating." </p>

<p>If "antedate" explains the temporal sense of the title's "background," then "parlor" supplies the other, spatial sense: a detective story has a prescribed "background" temporal structure, but also employs a limited set of possible "background" settings. The parlor is one of a number of spaces repeatedly enlisted by the detective story—city spaces such as railway stations, police stations, dark alleys, bare attics, crowded thoroughfares, shabby offices. Such sites, familiar from Edgar Allan Poe to Dashiell Hammett, comprise the standard lexicon of the detective story's usually urban settings, many of which manufacture the feelings of enclosure or vulnerability that can instigate the necessary sense of urgency. But the psychological connotations of particular settings are not their only function; they also have an integral relationship to the plot, because "the plot must appear to be an actual record of events springing from the terrain of its operations . . . the plans and diagrams so often encountered in detective stories aid considerably in this effect."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  City spaces subtend the plot of the detective story and its "modernity," for as G. K. Chesterton observed in 1901, the urban setting offers a pervasive textuality that the detective story is the first to exploit fully: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Of this realization of a great city itself as something wild and obvious the detective story is certainly the "Iliad". . . . A city is, properly speaking, more poetic even than the countryside, for while Nature is a chaos of unconscious forces, a city is a chaos of conscious ones . . . there is no stone in the street and no brick in a wall that is not a deliberate symbol—a message from some man, as much as if it were a telegram or a post-card. . . . Every brick has a human hieroglyph as if it were a graven brick of Babylon; every slate on the roof is as educational a document as if it were a slate covered with addition and subtraction sums.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The city is here rather remarkably described by Chesterton as the incarnation of the visual-textual grid.  </p>

<p>The parlor, in the metropolitan world of the middle class, purports to be removed from the outdoor, public, "wild," and prolix textuality of the urban landscape. In truth, because it is the room traditionally consecrated to conversation (as Stein probably knew, from its roots in the French "parler"), the parlor functions as the domestic space where public and private realms are mediated. It is the space, that is, where the interface between public and private is overtly textualized through specialized language codes: certain conversational modalities and subjects, radio and television broadcasts, the reading of newspapers, mail, and socially acceptable texts such as detective novels. Like the dining room of Stein's 1934 "mystery novel" <i>Blood on the Dining-Room Floor</i>, it is a room for semi-private affairs and semi-public gatherings, where family members and invited guests congregate, especially on formal occasions. The parlor is the privileged place in the grid where public and private surfaces correlate. Stein's own famous "parlor" at 27 rue de Fleurus, where her salons took place, vividly illustrates how the textuality of the public world was mapped on to this space in the interior of the home. Photographs of the room reveal that those walls were covered by the square 

<b></b>

shapes of many frames—the Stein art collection, materializing as an uneven geometric gridwork.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Stein's archived papers even include a drawn plan of the placement of her paintings, a picture of the picture grid. (<a href="#2"> 2</a>)  </p>

"References. Begin Now": The Grid's Colonial Background 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>The grid is not only present behind the scenes as the "background" of or to the parlor in "Subject-cases," it is also built right into it, albeit in camouflage. In the text of "Subject-cases," Stein references the fifteen manuscript notebooks containing "Subject-cases," but in ways that make their presence hard to detect. Given that publication was not imminent at the time of the composition of "Subject-cases," the ongoing references to her own writing environment constitute a kind of private investigation.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  These references are among the general class of techniques that Stein often employs to integrate into her text concrete features of her current life and work.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  What distinguishes the references to the manuscript notebooks in "Subject-cases" and the other instances of such incorporation—for instance, in "Natural Phenomena" , "A Bouquet" , and "A Diary" —is that they are prompted by the visual and physical properties of the immediate writing environment, not primarily their linguistic properties.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Perhaps because the novelty of the illustrated notebooks was still remarkable in the first decade or so of her use of them, Stein began to see them as part of the same framework of textuality that she was creating in her writing. Her diagrammatic attention to language-in-motion was catalyzed by the notebooks as textual-visual entities—as, that is, emblems of the grid to be transcribed and transgressed.  </p>

<p>Like postcards or comic strips, the kind of notebooks <small class="caps">s</small>tein used were often produced as serials. The position of each individual notebook within sets and subsets of sequenced topic matter was indicated by signals of serialization: titles, subtitles, numeric ordering, and other visual data pertaining to classification. Such serialization was clearly intended to facilitate collecting. Often, in addition to a topical illustration, a notebook contained extensive written information related to the topic on its inside and back cover. Any one notebook thus constituted a mini-lesson, complete with visual aid; the illustration and informative text were even overtly "authored," with the names of illustrator, engraver, writer, and editor given. To appeal to young consumers and to please their parents, the subject matter of these serials tended to be educational or useful, but also adventurous, exciting, or moving in some way. In short, these notebooks were oriented toward producing patriotic and functional citizens, appropriately socialized men and women with a solid literacy in canonical French culture. They visibly materialized the abstract grid of the knowledge desirable or necessary for successful cultural navigation, intersecting not only with the paper vehicles of entertainment, like newspaper cartoons, serialized stories, and puzzlebooks, but also with the pervasive icons of a carefully organized, nationalized pedagogy. In this context, the title "Subject-cases" takes on yet another level of meaning, for each of the notebooks in which the story is written comprises a case study of a particular subject.

<p>The notebooks containing "Subject-cases," however, seem to have nothing to do with the subject matter of the story. The story does not begin with embedded notebook references.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Nor do the notebook topics and illustrations serve any discernible function integral to the text, for they describe exploration and conquest, scenes from the colonized world and sources of national pride. In contrast to the modern, metropolitan fixations of the detective story, symbolically and structurally centered in the parlor as the site of exchange between public and private urban worlds, the notebooks of "Subject-cases" assemble a territory that is almost exclusively historical, militaristic, non-urban. Cover illustrations depict "men of action," desert scenes, flags, ships, airplanes, and France's colonial adventures in the Congo, Morocco, and Algeria.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Sometimes this territory is overtly political, as in, "France in Morocco, After Six Months of the Protectorate." In other cases, colonial authority is vividly exhibited, as in the disturbing "Measurement of the Natives" illustration depicting a black man up against a wall; one colonial supervisor measures his forehead, another notes the results, and a third looks on. Guns are in the foreground.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  (<a href="#3"> 3</a>) Many of the covers, however, contain illustrations whose political relationships are brought into view by Stein's gathering itself: ancient "Byzantine" domestic architecture becomes ominous next to images of marauding Algerian horsemen; "How to Construct a Model Biplane" becomes protomilitaristic beside illustrations of airplanes flying reconnaissance missions, encamped air squadrons, surveillance kites, and the flags of Napoleonic conquest. The last of the notebooks switches the scene: a picture of eighteenth-century outdoor theater in the Place Dauphine. Clearly, Stein is constructing a counternarrative through the notebook covers, a revelation of the vast military, political, and economic network of empire built up over centuries. If the relationship of these alien "backgrounds" to Stein's detective story seems unclear at first, the final image suggests that those adventures in the colonies boil down to metropolitan political performance, returning us to the detective story's setting. Collectively, the cover illustrations of Stein's notebooks force us into a different kind of detective story in which the evidence is out in the open, an environmental presence so pervasive that it is unlocatable and invisible: the colonial background of the grid. </p>

<p>While this background is, by definition, unrepresentable in standard language, Stein uses her diagrammatic method to cite it. She has three modes of response in the text of "Subject-cases" to the encyclopedic categories of knowledge and colonial mastery represented by her notebooks. The first, most basic mode consists of specific, literal allusions to their texts and illustrations, although her manner of making the connection between them and her own subject is insistently indiscriminate. Sometimes a direct quotation from a notebook text appears that also reinforces a concern of the story.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  More often, however, the references to the notebooks seem crudely pasted into the story's text, with little or no integration.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  These references are the ones that most loudly declaim the acute incongruity of their presence, yet, paradoxically, their obscurity is made less perceptible by the bewildering gradations of digression throughout the text. </p>

<p>The second mode of response is Stein's employment of a metatextual level of commentary on the materiality of the notebooks by frequent recourse to the vocabulary of 

<b></b>

illustration. In these instances the lack of integration is slightly less pronounced, but only because the references are less specific, less obviously alien to the surrounding textual flow. Occasionally her use of this vocabulary is explicit, as when she refers to colors, foregrounds, or, repeatedly, illustration.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Sometimes she seems to be noting the physical properties of the notebook, with long riffs on "paper" ("SC," 17), "tissue paper fairly certain to be inherited" ("SC," 31), and something that is "understood as periodical" ("SC," 7), although here it is not clear whether the word "periodical" originates in Stein's musings about her notebooks' material characteristics or in her dematerializing of the detective story structure. </p>

<p>The third, and most abstract, mode of allusion focuses specifically on this idea of periodization, fundamental to the notebook serials, the structure of the detective story, and the grid itself. Periodization breaks entities up into discrete temporal or material units. It is the disciplining operation of a supervisory power, intended to organize reproducible sequences, but it also unintentionally abets rearrangement. Through de- and re-periodization, Stein most forcefully articulates her diagrammatic interference with 

<b></b>

the order of the grid. The text, for instance, appears to announce the commencement of its notebook references with, "References. Begin now," but in fact this statement comes after a quotation from the "Histoire de l'habitation" notebook—after, that is, references have begun already ("SC," 9). The statement is as misleading as a deliberately planted false clue. What she actually provides is something that works diligently against any preestablished path, for her references in the text to the notebooks do not follow the order of the notebooks, nor do her chosen notebooks represent in any sense a sequence. It seems rather that she has gone to some trouble to detach the notebooks she uses from their original serial arrangements and to reorchestrate them according to the progress of "Subject-cases." In place of the fixed and predetermined spaces of the grid, Stein's order is the order of "at once," of the handwritten line as it takes shape on the page. The notebooks thus contribute to a different kind of "periodization" that reveals the constructedness of the grid, just as the detective story reveals the constructedness of plotted narrative. </p>

<p>Stein herself explicates this diagrammatic "periodization." Following a paragraph that imaginatively pursues the idea of multiple "directions," the words on the page proclaim that <i>something</i> is, "Ineradicable to remain, to possess and to see movements when movements are approachable approachable as if it were undoubted. . . . Ineradicable to remain. <i>What is it</i>. In as it were intentional. And to be presentable. Bows and smiles. Organisation and in time" ("SC," 8; my emphasis). Stein is describing and enacting an itinerant "What" that leaves, follows, and erases its own traces simultaneously, an organizational process that takes place only from the site of its own current time frame. While the specific subject of the description is not named and is therefore in doubt, the subject must be the writing itself—a mobile principle that has to conjure its presence wordlessly. In fact, Stein pledges soon afterwards that, "In this way anything can seem to be read," including, one must assume, references to "backgrounds" that would disappear in any printed version of her text ("SC," 9). Reading is always a case of "seeming" to read, of skimming surfaces, because meaning is always contingent on the local conditions in which a text is embedded. The reading subject, flagrantly missing from this oddly passive construction, is similarly contingent. The "anything"—the text, whatever it may be—is actually what directs the experience. Stein comments on this insistently idiosyncratic order, this de- and re-periodization, in a tone at once reassuring and self-abnegating: "Everything in order, in that order in order that there is no value. There is no value in our having been right. Alright. To ground a ground and on the ground, to be as if it were to be found here and there" ("SC," 15). This order that is "as if it were . . . found here and there," invented to circumvent predetermined values, itself has no value. What it does have is a ground, or rather "backgrounds," even when they are undetectable, barely perceptible, or overlooked. </p>

<p>The fleeting legibility of the notebook "backgrounds" is Stein's wily way of presenting absence; the founding absence that is framed and glimpsed is the trivializing, infantilizing, and normalizing text of colonialism. "Absence" is indeed the telltale symptom of this structure: the structure hides its systematicity and the colonial subjects on whose invisibility its continuation depends. In fact, the metropolitan center connects not only 

<b></b>

to the domestic "private" interior of the parlor, via the ordered and textualized grid of its spatial conration, but by the same route to the unseen marginal excess of the colony. For the grid extends beyond the page, past the printer in the city, past the paper manufacturer in the factory town, all the way to the natural resources and labor on the other side of the ocean. To catch sight of the faint and transient appearance of the grid as a totality is to catch sight of the scaffolding of the otherwise unrepresentable colonial relationship.  </p>

<p>Fredric Jameson describes these "representational effects" of the colonial system as a sort of meaning-blindness: "the mapping of the new imperial world system becomes impossible, since the colonized other who is its essential other component or opposite number has become invisible."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  In contrast to the "loss of meaning" characterizing the industrialization and commodification of the modern metropolis, the loss adhering to the system as a whole is "spatial disjunction." Its cultural productions  </p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Given the detective story's articulation of the grid and its modern narrative structure, it is not a surprise that Jameson's thoughts about the visual space of modernism were initiated in an essay on the detective novelist Raymond Chandler.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Nor is it surprising that they were originally prompted by Stein's 1934 lecture, "What Is English Literature." Jameson notes Stein's observation that, in England, </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>If you live a daily life and it is all yours, and you come to own everything outside your daily life besides and it is all yours, you naturally begin to explain. You naturally continue describing your daily life which is all yours, and you naturally begin to explain how you own everything besides. You naturally begin to explain that to yourself and you naturally begin to explain it to those living your daily life who own it with you, everything outside, and you naturally explain it in a kind of way to some of those whom you own.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">"Some of those whom you own": the laissez-faire texture of Stein's actual politics warns us that her unveiling exploits with the lines and blank spaces of the grid should not be understood as a technique she developed in order to challenge global imperialism, the militaristic use of technology that enabled it, or its inherent violence, although all of these features are depicted in the notebooks of "Subject-cases."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Her remark about the proprietary relationships that define daily English life is shocking for its casual tone; she dryly conveys the "naturalness" of this arrangement. Her perceptions register a stark analysis, embellished with the performative cleverness that often characterizes her work: "can you see what I see." Through her continuous, contingent, and exploratory approach to looking at the everyday world and her own experiences, she has come 

<b></b>

to see the grid as a system, enabling her to make a coded but trenchant observation about its deadly games. </p>

<p>Stein's references to the imperialist discourse of her notebooks register a recognition of this context. Her "kind of way" of explaining it is both more and less explicit than that of a properly modernist style, according to Jameson, who claims such styles mark the "unrepresentable totality" through a "new spatial language" ("MI," 58). Her diagrammatic deployment of language turns words into things, but by integrating the actual terms of the grid into her diagrams, she essentially turns things—the commodities that are the form and content of colonial circulation—back into words. The maligned, beloved, and abused realist object that modernism seeks to expunge is really only redefined. The thing in question is no longer the thing represented in the text, but the text itself. Such is the sense of the book as commodity suggested by the term "pulp fiction," a narrative genre defined by its paper content.  </p>

<p>Paradoxically, the detective story genre is an ingenious screen on to which to project the colonial relationship precisely because its purview is so insistently parochial, and because it is so densely cluttered with its own set of "same things"—its own repertoire of commodities, those false symptoms of a realist environment. As Stein says of the detective story, the process that starts with "somebody being dead" continues to "move along" so that the absences and presences of the grid unroll in a reading present that is commensurate with the textual thing.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  The scenes of national identity and its transnational attachments that decorate the covers of Stein's "Subject-cases" notebooks, seemingly so remote from their detective story subject, are in fact not simply <i>coincident with</i> but <i>constitutive of</i> it. Her transmogrifying linguistic recombinations are not "beyond all point of view," as Jameson says of Joyce ("MI," 62); they are instead manifestations of the invisible ink of the grid, in which all points of view are eventually contacted and connected. </p>

<p>North Africa may seem a long way from "cuddle"'s kitchen <i>carnet</i>, her salon/"parlor" and the other focal points of Parisian domesticity, but indeed, as the regulatory paradigm of Western cultural and epistemological power, the grid is designed to conceal its own links. Stein points out those unmentionable lines and spaces, evacuates them of the usual categorical meanings and fills them with words that act as the agents of concrete experience. It is perhaps inevitable that her diagrammatic digging eventually bumps up against the political matrix in which the visual-textual grid is embedded. From its margins to its center, the grid is the background through which we need to read Stein, to appreciate fully the perverse reversals of her diagrams.  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT8" href="#REF8">8</a>. The "pictorial turn," referring to the visual preoccupations of postmodern philosophy, is W. J. T. Mitchell's term. I would argue, however, that such a turn actually dates back to photography, the distinctive phase of popular print culture that it initiated, and consequently the new varieties of visual conceptualization that it offered. Forms of visual-textual integration in print culture certainly predate the nineteenth century. Intaglio and relief methods of printing images were both reproducible and potentially coterminous with printed and engraved text. However, not until the advent of photography and the related technological advances in printing could image and text become truly unified and in a sense indistinguishable within a single visual paradigm. See W. J. T. Mitchell, <i>Picture Theory</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994) and, for his expanded view of visuality which I have adopted, <i>Iconology: Image, Text, Discourse</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986); also, Jonathan Crary, <i>Techniques of the Observer: On Vision and Modernity in the Nineteenth Century</i> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1990) and <i>Suspension of Perception: Attention, Spectacle, and Modern Culture</i> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1999).

The city, in Europe and the Americas, underwent unprecedented population growth and related geographic expansion beginning in the 1820s. Thus, while the geometry of the nineteenth-century city can be seen, in some respects, as an extension of the principles of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment that had structured urban space and architecture for centuries, the new "great city urbanism" of the nineteenth century required entirely new kinds of planning—not just of city surfaces but of public works and services, policing, population control, and "hygiene"—and, consequently, new theories of urban space.

Long before the nineteenth century, of course, the textual order of print had crossed the threshold of the newsstand, library, school, gallery, theater, office, shop, church, home, and coffeehouse into the urban outdoors, by way of posted announcements and signs; during the eighteenth century, for example, European and American public and private spaces were increasingly interconnected through the circulation of print, aided by an economy of reproduction based on the engravings of paintings. In the mid-nineteenth century, however, the sheer number of textualized surfaces expanded, due to the new printing technologies and the more numerous applications for their use, in domestic, educational, commercial, and civic settings. For similar reasons, textualized surfaces also acquired more regularized appearances, which coincided with other forms of the regularization of visible space, particularly in the urban environment. On the history of the newspaper and periodical press in the eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, and its connection to political change, public opinion, and definitions of reading, subjectivity and citizenship, see Hannah Barker, <i>Newspapers, Politics and English Society, 1695–1855</i> (New York: Longman, 2000), Charles E.

<p><a name="FOOT16" href="#REF16">16</a>. A thorough survey of all the notebooks and Stein's idiosyncratic compositional methods in them would here be impracticable. Suffice it to say that, in the earlier type of notebook, Stein employs a variety of writing practices that seem to recognize the physical boundaries of the notebook and the lines that fundamentally structure the grid. Note, for example, the way she addresses her writing surface in <i>The Making of Americans</i> in place of the reader: "Truly I never feel it that there ever can be for me any such creature, no it is this scribbled and dirty and lined paper that is really to be to me always my receiver." <i>The Making of Americans</i> (New York: Something Else Press, 1966), 33. In other instances, Stein seems to work deliberately against the grid. She developed an unusual habit of filling the notebook only on the recto of every page, then flipping the book over to fill every verso; she would fill a notebook with multiple different texts in this manner, which then sometimes required splitting a single text among several notebooks, instead of simply starting a new text in a new notebook. She had a way of crossing things out that was sometimes indistinguishable from underlining. Her own lineation, at times "poetic" and at times in paragraph form, seems to have no consistent relationship to page boundaries or surface markings, and at the same time seems based on no discernible "literary" system. That is, Stein's lineation indicates not only her patent disregard for the conceptual distinctions between prose and poetry and her general program of genre disruption, but also a refusal to supply or obey the potential markers of such distinctions on paper (for instance by beginning a new "poetic" section within a "prose" piece on a new page, or drawing a line between sections or skipping a space)—a striking lack of distinction that is broadly consistent with her custom of combining different texts within one notebook. Ulla Dydo broadly outlines the status of the <i>carnets</i> and <i>cahiers</i> in "Reading the Hand Writing: The Manuscripts of Gertrude Stein," in <i>A Gertrude Stein Companion: Content with the Example</i>, ed. Bruce Kellner (New York: Greenwood Press, 1988), 84–95. She argues that the manuscript notebooks probably do not represent first drafts, but that between the <i>carnet</i> notes and the <i>cahier</i> versions, there must have been other notes or notebooks. Dydo also considers that the <i>carnets</i>, noting the various kinds of lists, doodles, and so on that they contained, are useful for establishing a personal context for some of Stein's writings, but that probably most of them were destroyed and that the few bequeathed to the Yale archive were left unintentionally—implying that the information they could collectively provide about Stein's compositional practice is limited. Nevertheless, it would be unwise to conclude that critics should dismiss the possibility of finding in the <i>carnets</i> some relationship in them to Stein's finished texts simply because the majority of them are probably missing; it also seems that to regard the writing in the <i>cahiers</i> as fair copies would be a mistake, for as Dydo herself notes, Stein not only copied into them but also composed new writing in them to "continue or complete her pieces" (Dydo in <i>A Gertrude Stein </i>Companion, 85). In any case, my argument that the notebooks, generally speaking, provide evidence that Stein's diagrammatic structure is in part a response to the grid does not depend on the particular stage of writing they represent.  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT20" href="#REF20">20</a>. Landon, "'Not Solve It But Be In It'" in <i>American Literature</i> 53:3, 488. "Subject-cases" dates from ten years before the period when Stein began to make frequent use of detective story conventions in her writing and as a pointed topic of reflection about her writing. Her recourse to the detective-story form in this text, then, could not have been habitual; rather, in all likelihood, "Subject-cases" instigated her later attraction. Landon points out that Stein was an avid reader of detective stories. The genre receives a great deal of attention in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>  and <i>The Geographical History of America</i> . In addition, Stein wrote a detective "novel" in 1934 called <i>Blood on the Dining-Room Floor</i>, gave a lecture in Chicago collected in <i>Narration</i>  called "The Audience and the Novel and the Mystery Story as Narrative," discussed detective stories in the 1936 "What Are Master-pieces and Why Are There So Few of Them," provided a short piece for <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> in 1937 called "Why I Like Detective Stories," and in 1944 wrote a short play about a murder called "Three Sisters Who Are Not Sisters," published in <i>The First Reader</i> , which was based on a "film" written in 1929 called "Deux Soeurs Qui Ne Sont Pas Soeurs" and published in <i>Operas and Plays</i> . "Subject-Cases," therefore, was written well before Stein's interest in the genre reached its height in the 1930s, a time that corresponded with the "golden age" of detective fiction. This "golden age" came after the "clue puzzle books" of the early 1900s, which mimicked the genre of fill-in-the-blank game books, and before the division of the detective story into national subgenres, as described in Raymond Chandler's 1949 essay "The Simple Art of Murder." </p>

Henceforth abbreviated "MP." This lecture, given at Oxford and Cambridge in 1936, was directly the result of Stein's own recent authorial fame and begins with deliberations on the inadequacy of oratory as a form that will produce masterpieces. Thus it is paradoxically caught up in the drama of authorial identity that it is also an attempt to discredit, for her goal here, echoing her concerns in <i>The Geographical History of America</i> , is to make a case against "human nature" and identity in the creation of masterpieces, i.e. work that is original. Identity must be forgotten in the act of creation because, "At any moment when you are you you are you without the memory of yourself because if you remember yourself while you are you you are not for purposes of creating you . . . [master-pieces] are knowing that there is no identity and producing while identity is not" ("MP," 356–60). Indeed, while a masterpiece must be <i>about</i> identity and time, it cannot be written from inside the consciousness of those circumstances, nor can it betray any awareness of them: "master-pieces have no more time than they have identity although time like identity is what they concern themselves about . . . " ("MP," 361). As genre fiction, the detective story avoids the trap of identity because it must deliberately occlude the author's personality, except for the minor style variations permitted within the limited genre repertoire ("MP," 358).  </p>

This fundamental uncertainty means that it is difficult to know how to regard the status of the notebooks: if she accepted that the work was unpublishable, perhaps we can consider its form in the notebooks to be definitive. In the absence of the nineteenth-century practice of handwritten document exchange that provided a limited public for "private" manuscripts, notebooks like Stein's, we have to assume, would have gone largely unread.

Stein also picks up on the subject of the eleventh notebook cover, titled "L'Exploration: Les hommes d'action—A bord"; the text in that notebook begins, "Exploration. The party prepares to depart and starts to leave having first put everything in order as a preface . . . " ("SC," 24). The twelfth notebook, which depicts "L'Exploration: Les hommes d'action—Mensuration d'indigènes," is referenced by the extended use of the words "measure" and "measurements" ("SC," 26). </p>

<p><a name="FOOT37" href="#REF37">37</a>. Sometimes the significance of these terms is relatively transparent, as in, "In the foreground are usually to be found grass and colors colors as if it were as if they were to be worn . . . " ("SC," 12–13) and, "As it can be illustrated if they do not move as it can be illustrated . . . . The illustration of it as an illustration of it, and illustrate, to illustrate, as illustrated" ("SC," 29). Sometimes these references are only recognizably consonant with the discourse of illustration because they pick up on her title word "background," as in, "Was there a background and was there a ground for deers" ("SC," 9) or, "A background and leisurely approached by them in the meantime" ("SC," 26).  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT41" href="#REF41">41</a>. Stein's "actual politics" are of course difficult to assess, but by her own pronouncement and her alliances, she was more conservative than the negotiations of her identity as a Jewish lesbian would imply for contemporary readers. For a consideration of her apparent political position during the Second World War, see Janet Malcolm, "Gertrude Stein's War," in <i>The New Yorker</i> (2 June 2003), 58–81. </p>
