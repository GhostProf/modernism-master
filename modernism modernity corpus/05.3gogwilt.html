A geography text should aim at literary form. It should present a

ought to be built round the map, not the printed page, for only so can
we cultivate the visualizing habit of mind.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The prototypically modernist linguistic play of "the green wothe botheth"
establishes a problem of imagining to which the young Stephen will
return, although the problem cannot be resolved: "you could not have a
green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could" (<I>PA,</I>
12-13). In its encoded contestation of national and poetic imagery
(the Irish green, the poetic rose), Stephen's "green wothe" is an
exemplary geopolitical image. It posits a form of cultural and political
identification whose difficulty Stephen later finds inscribed in and
around the "picture of the earth on the first page of his geography"
textbook (<I>PA,</I> 15).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The meaning of "geopolitics" as a term used to describe global political
problems is by no means easy to pinpoint. Its increasing use as a keyword
in critical theory and cultural studies signals a need to theorize
what Homi Bhabha has recently called "the geopolitics of the historical
present."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 As part of that critical effort a number of studies
of geopolitics have appeared, including Gear&oacute;id O Tuathail's
recent <I>Critical Geopolitics</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The genealogy I offer
here emphasizes two features of the formation of what O Tuathail calls
"classical geopolitics" (<I>CG,</I> 22): the suppressed importance of
anarchism in the formation of imperialist geopolitical paradigms, and
the fate of nineteenth-century ideas of "culture" in the formation of
twentieth-century geopolitics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The history of geopolitics may be summarized as the failure to constitute
the discipline of geography as a scientific field of study, a failure
on which the very success and persistence of reactionary geopolitical
paradigms are premised. Most of my examples are drawn from the work
of geographers, anthropologists, and social scientists, and something I
emphasize is the way geopolitical paradigms took shape around disciplinary
boundary crossings within the academy not unlike the interdisciplinarity
that characterizes cultural studies today.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 At issue is not
only the fate of an academic field of study, but also the ensemble of
residual problems and questions that come to mark the wider sense of
"geopolitics." Stephen's problem of imagining a "green rose" is exemplary
of this ensemble of questions because it offers not a definition, but
a problem: "It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant
and that he did not know where the universe ended" (<I>PA,</I> 17).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Joyce's novel, a geography textbook precipitates Stephen's problem
of identification, and it is to geography books that I turn to examine
the emergence of the geopolitical image. In particular, I am interested
in the work of three geographers: Elis&eacute;e Reclus (1830-1905),
the French anarchist geographer; Friedrich Ratzel (1844-1904), the
German geographer whose theory of "living space" <I>(Lebensraum)</I> and
political geography generally set the terms for the later development
of <I>Geopolitik;</I> and Halford J. Mackinder (1861-1947), the
British geographer who championed the "new geography" in schools and
universities in Britain.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mackinder is given special prominence, not only for the central place he
occupies in genealogies of geopolitics, but also because his geography
illustrates a formalist logic at work in the formation of geopolitics
reminiscent of both the strategies of literary modernism and of the
Freudian dreamwork of condensation and displacement.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<B></B>

The
significance of Mackinder's geography lies in its ability to synthesize
the radically different political implications of Ratzel and Reclus into
a single geopolitical image, that of Britain in his <I>Britain and the
British Seas</I> . In that image are constellated not only the
contradictions of European geography over the turn of the century, but
also the distinctive features of the breakdown of nineteenth-century
European ideas of culture.

Halford Mackinder is remembered as an important re in the development
of geopolitical thinking chiefly for his heartland thesis. First
formulated in "The Geographical Pivot of History," a paper delivered
in January 1904 to the Royal Geographical Society, Mackinder's thesis
projects global political power as naturally pivoting around Central
Asia, the "heartland" of land-based power in what Mackinder sees as
the fundamental strategic and historical interplay of land and sea. The
thesis is abbreviated first in the form of the map of "The Natural Seats
of Power" that accompanied the 1904 paper (<A
HREF="5.3gogwilt_1.html"> 1</A>), and then in the set
of maxims in <I>Democratic Ideals and Reality</I> :

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The key features of this rhetoric and iconography of geopolitics may be
seen as early as 1887 in Mackinder's influential address to the Royal
Geographic Society, "On the Scope and Methods of Geography." Assuming
leadership of the "new geography" movement, Mackinder took up the
"educational battle" over the place of geography in British schools and
universities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Mackinder argued not only for the unity of
geography as a discipline, but also for its central place in general
education. The "continuous argument"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 of geography, which
ranges from physical geography to political geography, makes it the
discipline able to bridge the gap between the natural and the human
sciences: "One of the greatest of all gaps lies between the natural
sciences and the study of humanity. It is the duty of the geographer
to build one bridge over an abyss which in the opinion of many is
upsetting the equilibrium of our culture." (<I>SM,</I> 16) In all of these
claims, and perhaps most particularly in the gesture toward resolving a
general crisis of "culture," Mackinder condenses and displaces a range
of debates giving shape to the formation of geopolitics, most notably
the theoretical debates in Germany, including those raised in Ratzel's
two-volume <I>Anthropogeographie</I> (1882-91).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The opening sections of the first volume of <I>Anthropogeographie</I>
offer a comprehensive classification of the different branches
of the science of geography as a whole, which Ratzel divides
into "physical geography" <I>(physikalische Geographie)</I> and

<B></B>

<I>Anthropogeographie,</I> Ratzel's coinage for "human geography." As
his title indicates, Ratzel is most concerned with the second of these
branches of geography, whose systematization as a science was the project
of <I>Anthropogeographie</I>. His definition of "anthropogeography"
asserts that priority should be given to human geography since the
human being <I>(der Mensch)</I> is the main object of study for
every science.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 He then goes on to insist, however, that
anthropogeography is intimately connected to the natural sciences. The
connection between the natural and the human sciences gives geography
its distinctive object of study, namely "the geographical diffusion of
humankind across the earth's surface" (<I>A,</I> 22).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This core claim of Ratzel's--what Woodruff Smith has dubbed the
"diffusionist revolt" against dominant liberal patterns of academic
thinking in nineteenth-century Germany--has many implications
for the disciplines of geography and anthropology. Its innovative
construction of what each discipline takes for its object of study
belongs, moreover, to the late nineteenth-century attempt to unify the
so-called cultural sciences <I>(Kulturwissenschaften).</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
The significance of "culture" as the shared object of study is
suggested by Ratzel's classification of the branches of geography that
renders cultural geography <I>(Kulturgeographie)</I> as a synonym for
<I>Anthropogeographie.</I> Neither "culture" nor "humanity," however,
survives as the principle of coherence around which Ratzel is able to
construct geography as a science. By the late 1890s, "biogeography"
displaces anthropogeography--eclipsing both "culture" and "humankind"
as the proper object of geographic study--to produce a geography in the
service of an expansionist, imperialist politics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The logic of the formation of geopolitics may be traced largely in
the changing focus of Ratzel's works from <I>Anthropogeographie</I>
to <I>Politische Geographie</I>  and <I>Der Lebensraum</I>
. The same logic, at once disciplinary and political, simultaneously

<B></B>

informs Mackinder's "new geography," a formulation aptly reminiscent
of "new imperialism." It is hardly a surprise that the formation of
geopolitics coincides with the rise of "new imperialism" in Europe in
the late nineteenth century, although its full scope and importance for
the foundations and legitimation of the modern discipline of geography
have only recently been addressed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Mackinder's work helps
illustrate the wider cultural crisis within which geopolitics take

shape and the logic by which the formation of geopolitics reconres
nineteenth-century notions of culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his <I>Democratic Ideals and Reality</I> Mackinder looked back with
revealing ambivalence on the success of German geography, "Judged from
the standpoint of Berlin, it was a wonderful thing to have impressed
<I>Kultur,</I> or <I>Strategical mentality,</I> on the educated class of
a whole people, but from the standpoint of civilisation at large it was
a fatal momentum to have given to a nation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In abbreviated
form, Mackinder's phrase <I>"Kultur,</I> or <I>Strategical mentality"</I>
encapsulates the conceptual knot linking the definitional confusion
of "culture"--in translation across a variety of languages--to the
formation of geopolitics. Among the many things condensed in Mackinder's
use of the German term <I>"Kultur"</I> is the logical culmination of
Ratzel's attempt, and failure, to unify a science of cultural studies
<I>(Kulturwissenschaft)</I> around geography.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mackinder's diagnosis of the "fatal momentum" of <I>Kultur</I> is
attended by a barely concealed admiration for the "wonderful thing"
that made geography into the teaching of "strategical mentality." Part
of Mackinder's ambivalence clearly comes from the fact that he had been
advocating this kind of teaching since the 1880s. If the difference for
Mackinder lies in the distinction between <I>Kultur</I> and "civilisation
at large," this only makes the key role of "culture" in the formation of
geopolitics all the more visible. It also conceals the extent to which
Mackinder's own "educational battle" in the 1880s to bring geography
into schools and universities formed part of a complex collaboration and
competition amongst geographers from different European countries who
together were shaping their disciplines to legitimate, and be legitimized
by, official nationalism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One immediate source for Mackinder's arguments was J. Scott Keltie's
influential 1885 report on geographical education throughout
Europe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 In an appendix, Keltie's report translates the
curriculum statement for the military academy of the University of
Berlin. This "'Instruction' as to the Scope and Method of Studies to
be Observed at the <I>Kriegs-Akademie,</I> Berlin"--a title echoed
in Mackinder's "On the Scope and Methods of Geography"--has strong
affinities with Mackinder's claim for the "continuous argument" of
geography: "The circle of sciences, comprehended generally under the
name of geography, forms the transition and concatenating link between
the natural and historical sciences" (<I>GE,</I> 111). The imperialist
"scope and methods" of each educational program is suggested in the
final section, with its significant emphasis on the term "culture":

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A systematic scientific conception of geography will take the whole
earth's surface as the subject of its comparative studies, and all
the more when at the present time European culture is pressing forward
on every hand with rapid progress. In consideration, however, of the
historical task devolving on Europe, to become the representative
and

<B></B>

leader of this world-wide culture, the student in his
historico-geographical studies will specially apply his mind to
the appreciation of the physical conration of Europe, and how it
exercised such influence on its inhabitants as to qualify them for such
a mission. [<I>GE,</I> 111]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here, perhaps, is registered the birth of geopolitics. If so, it is more
than an embryonic version of the U.S. fascination for Haushofer's program
to make the man in the street "think geopolitically" and to train the
nation's leaders to "act geopolitically."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Translated for
an English evaluation of the place of geography in education throughout
Europe, which in turn served an international readership, Keltie's
report is a document that registers the moment in which a discourse
of geopolitics takes shape. In its formulation of "European culture,"
it registers the roots of geopolitics in an entanglement of geography
and culture, anticipating the terms of Mackinder's equation between
<I>Kultur</I> and "strategical mentality."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mackinder's "political geography" draws its rhetorical strength not
only from the new imperialist and militarist discourse of post-1870
Europe, however. The generalist vision of his 1887 address also looks
back to the mainstream of nineteenth-century European geography and its
encyclopedic ambition to provide an inclusive description of the earth
and its inhabitants. This had been Alexander Humboldt's ambition, in his
travel writings and his <I>Kosmos;</I> it had been Carl Ritter's, too,
in his <I>Erdkunde.</I> Perhaps the fullest, most ambitious attempt to
realize the grand narrative claims of nineteenth-century geography was
the nineteen-volume <I>La Nouvelle g&eacute;ographie universelle</I> by
Elis&eacute;e Reclus. Reclus's work provided a monumental precedent for
Mackinder's vision of a geography that sought to follow the "continuous
argument" from "physical geography" to "political geography."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
From his first major work on physical geography, <I>La Terre</I>
(1868-69), through the <I>Nouvelle g&eacute;ographie universelle</I>
(1876-94), up to his final, six-volume work of "social geography,"
<I>L'Homme et la terre</I> (1905-08), Reclus had followed just such
an argument.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Reclus, however, the argument of geography was a matter of human
emancipation. Writing in the second volume of <I>La Terre</I> ,
Reclus articulated the connection between the work of geography and the
work of political emancipation:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Human beings, these "reasonable beings" who love so much to boast about
their free will, nonetheless cannot make themselves independent of the
climates and of the physical conditions of the country they inhabit. Our
liberty, in our relations to the Earth, consists in understanding the laws
of these relations to confirm the liberty of our existence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Liberty was a theme Reclus would never abandon. The experience of
imprisonment as a Communard a few years later only helped confirm
that theme more clearly with the simultaneous formulation of
his anarchist position and his project to write the <I>Universal
Geography.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Liberty, of course, was also the great theme of nineteenth-century
liberalism. In the <I>Universal Geography</I>'s effort to realize the
full emancipatory impulse of the nineteenth century's grand narrative
ambitions, it underscores the role of geography in helping shape the
principles of both freedom and science in what Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois
Lyotard calls "the narrative of legitimation" of knowledge in the
nineteenth century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The central place of emancipatory
principles in nineteenth-century geography shows through even in the "new
imperialist" rhetoric with which the Berlin "Instruction" characterizes
Europe's "mission" as "representative and leader of this world-wide
culture" (<I>GE,</I> 111). The same terms--with a different inflection
from that given in Keltie's translation--belong to the emancipatory
claims with which Reclus conditions the narrative of his <I>Universal
Geography.</I> Reclus, in his introduction of 1876, writes that Europe's
"inhabitants, whatever their failings and vices, or their state of
barbarism in some respects, still impel the rest of mankind as regards
material and mental progress."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Progress" for Reclus, of course, has a different political
significance than for the curricular "Instruction" (or its likely English
readers). That very difference, however, draws attention to the importance
for geography of the definitional confusion over the term "culture" in
the formulations "European culture" and "world-wide culture." For Reclus,
"first place" (<I>UG,</I> 3) is accorded to Europe, the historical and
geographical formation of whose "material and mental progress" is made
the narrative condition for a "universal" geography. This eurocentric
imperative also informs the Berlin "Instruction," both in its explanation
for why special curricular emphasis is to be placed on the physical
geography of Europe, and in the implied synonymy of "European culture"
and "this world-wide culture" (<I>GE,</I> 111).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What gets blurred in the Berlin "Instruction"'s use of the term
"culture," however, is a hypothesis on which Reclus's "universal"
descriptive geography depends: that the "progress," or "laws of liberty,"
of Europe's historical development may be linked to the universal history
of humankind. This hypothesis of culture in the broadest sense might be
said to be the founding ideal of European historical geography. Johann
Gottfried Herder's <I>Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der
Menschheit</I> (1784-91) is a crucial antecedent. While attacking
the presumptive superiority of European culture, it made European
geography the condition for imagining what principle of development
or culture <I>(Bildung)</I> connects European culture with the history
of all humankind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The connection between the two remains
a hypothesis for a whole range of nineteenth-century formulations
of culture. The multiplicity of senses that Raymond Williams has
shown to accrue around this keyword depends, moreover, on a complex
translation effect, by which, for example, Matthew Arnold translates the
German idealist notion of <I>Bildung</I> as culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 The
specifically geographical formulation of eurocentrism in this hypothesis
of culture conditions many of the most ambitious nineteenth-century
narratives; G. W. F. Hegel's <I>Philosophy of History</I>, Henry Thomas
Buckle's <I>History of Civilization</I>, and Karl Marx's <I>Capital</I>
are some of the more influential.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The rhetoric of Mackinder's call for a "new geography" is shaped around
the ambiguous legacy of this older geography, hence the "duty" of the
geographer to make a "bridge" over the "abyss" that is "upsetting the
equilibrium of our culture." What

<B></B>

makes Mackinder such a revealing
re in the crisis of legitimation at the turn of the century is how
he attempts to remodel the old into the new imperialist vision. If his
crucial talent as a synthesizer of knowledge enabled him to reproduce the
theoretical arguments of Ratzel while masking their real consequences
for the discipline of geography, it also enabled him to abbreviate the
emancipatory narrative claims of that earlier "universal" geography
embodied in the work of Reclus.

Outlining his "geographical philosophy" in 1908, Mackinder wrote:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When you have got your myriad facts, registered by the labour of all
the generations which have gradually built up the map of the world in
its infinite detail, you have then got to play with them. You have to
acquire such facility in this respect that you are able to see with the
mind's eye, not the mere map of Italy with the boot at the end of it,
but the blue sky, and the blue sea, and the brilliant sun. . . . You
must be able to see this image, and then to prolong it by an effort of
imagination beyond the horizon. Thus to be able to visualize is of the
very essence of geographical power.

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Confirming the rhetorical power of synthesis in Mackinder's "new
geography," this characteristic statement underscores the central place
of visualization in that rhetoric. Visualization, as Derek Gregory
argues, is at the foundation of the modern discipline of geography; its
"Cartesian perspectivalism" defines what O Tuathail, following Gregory,
argues is the key feature of Mackinder's "geopolitical gaze."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
In his series of geography textbooks, which reflect an ambitious attempt
to reshape all aspects of education from kindergarten to the university,
Mackinder sought to provide a solution for the problem Joyce formulates in
Stephen's encounter with his geography textbook.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 For Stephen
the geography textbook reveals a contestation of political perspectives
through the colors green and maroon, which his school-mate Fleming has
used to illustrate the picture of the world, and which Stephen associates
with the colors of Davitt and Parnell: "He turned over the flyleaf and
looked wearily at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon
clouds. He wondered which was right, to be for the green or for the
maroon, because Dante had ripped the green velvet back off the brush that
was for Parnell one day with her scissors and had told him that Parnell
was a bad man" (<I>PA,</I> 16). If for Mackinder the geography textbook
ought to resolve such contradictions, simultaneously instructing the
pupil "what politics meant" and "where the universe ended," Mackinder's
emphasis on the formative imaginative experience of the child's "varying
at will the pattern seen" nonetheless draws attention to a process of
"play" in visualization reminscent of the auditory, verbal, and visual
play inaugurated by Stephen's "green wothe."

Some of the founding ambiguities of Mackinder's "geographical philosophy"
emerge in his most important geography textbook, <I>Britain and the

Britain," provides a revealing illustration

of how he uses the visual
aid of the map. In the process, he abbreviates, almost subliminally, a
whole history of geographic representation from classical antiquity to
the present, in which the position of Britain shifts from the periphery

and spread in a single continent from the shores of Spain to those of
Cathay. Britain was then at the end of the world--almost out of the
world. . . . During two thousand years Britain was at the margin, not in
the centre, of the theatre of politics, and for most practical purposes
her position was accurately shown in the maps of the Greek geographers
[. <A HREF="5.3gogwilt_2.html">2</A> and <A HREF="5.3gogwilt_3.html">3</A>] and in the fantastic charts of the medieval monks

Mackinder's emphasis on Britain's peripheral position is illustrated by
two ancient maps, the thirteenth-century <I>Mappa Mundi</I> that places

The maps serve more than an illustrative purpose, however, as becomes
clearer in the second paragraph, "The historical meaning of the Columbian
discoveries can best be realised by turning a terrestrial globe so that
Britain may be at the point nearest to the eye (<A HREF="5.3gogwilt_6.html"> 6</A>)." (<I>BS,</I>

world maps, the gradually emerging contours of a familiar Mediterranean
yield suddenly to the global projection. All the while illustrating
the text's argument about the position of Britain, this sequencing of
maps abbreviates, diagrams, and illustrates a history of geographical
exploration as a history of the world. The text sustains the argument
about the position of Britain, although it has modulated into an argument
about how the "globe-wide" world may best be viewed, geographically and
historically, from the point of view of Britain (<I>BS,</I> 13). This
modulation becomes complete when the text completes the sequence of
res by reference to a "photograph of a globe showing the true form
of the North Atlantic" (<I>BS,</I> 5):

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Europe, Asia, Africa, and the two Americas are thus included within the
visible hemisphere; but the chief feature even of the land-half of the
globe is a great arm of mediterranean ocean, Atlantic and Arctic, winding
north-ward . . . . No flat chart can give a correct impression of the
form of the North Atlantic. Only a globe can suggest its vast bulging
centre, and the relative insignificance of its Arctic, Mediterranean,
and Caribbean recesses [<A HREF="5.3gogwilt_7.html"> 7</A>]. . . . For most purposes, therefore,
the North Atlantic is a rounded basin, with eastward, northward, and
westward gulfs, and a southern exit. But the five historic parts of
the world are accessible from its waters, and for the generations that
followed Columbus history centred increasingly round its shores. Thus
Britain gradually became the central, rather than the terminal land of
the world. [<I>BS,</I> 1-4]

The effect of this series of images is to produce an argument seemingly

Mackinder's use of maps stands in revealing contrast to that of Ratzel,
whose idea of the <I>"Oecumene"</I> Mackinder cites to formulate
the expression "globe-wide world."

<B></B>

At the end of volume 2 of
<I>Anthropogeographie</I>, Ratzel presents a "classificatory map of
humankind in the framework of the <I>Oecumene"</I> (<A HREF="5.3gogwilt_8.html"> 8</A>) to indicate
what he has called "the anthropogeographical picture <I>(Bild)</I> of
humankind" depicting the spread of different peoples throughout history
over the surface of the earth (<I>A,</I> 470-71). Emphasizing the
difficulty of representing, without distortion, the true geographical
"picture" or "image" <I>(Bild)</I> of humankind, Ratzel invokes the
model of realist pictoral perspective:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
To the geographical image/picture of humankind belong, besides the
horizontal distribution that we determine through the depiction of the
boundaries of the <I>Oecumene,</I>

and the shadings of distribution

humankind are ordered one behind the other according to historical age,
and the heights to which better-positioned or culturally better-equipped
peoples have risen.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ratzel's imaginary picture illustrates the problem of human perspective
that must vanish in the production of the geopolitical image. As Mackinder
turns Ratzel's anthropogeographical picture of the world into his
"globe-wide" world, the question of anthropology disappears. Mackinder's
geopolitical image thus constitutes the riddling afterimage of all
those attempts to systematize and explain human history as the cultural
development of all humankind.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Much of Mackinder's political geography, and geopolitics generally, may be
derived from the striking juxtaposition of the ancient map of the world,
with the Mediterranean in the center, and the world map organized with an
"eye" on Britain. The formalist logic of this play on the visual image
is most evident in the middle two maps of the four-part sequence. Here,
without the distraction of the details on the medieval map or the claim
to realism in the photograph of the globe, there is a stark contrast
of black against white. The black and white spaces of the ancient map
effect, indeed, a momentary confusion

<B></B>

 while the eye sorts out the
relation of black, corresponding to land, and white corresponding to
water; a correspondence that is confirmed as one turns to the continents
and oceans of the global vision. This perceptual play of re against
ground is reminiscent of the perceptual experiments in literary and
artistic modernism discussed by Fredric Jameson in <I>The Political
Unconscious</I> and Rosalind Krauss in <I>The Optical Unconscious.</I>
If the formalist play of re and ground results in what Jameson calls
the modernist "declaration of independence of the image as such," the
modernist logic of this "optical unconscious," in Krauss's terms, is as
applicable to Mackinder's political geography as it is to what Jameson
traces in the "perceptual vocation" of Joseph Conrad's "sensorium" and
to what Krauss traces to the origins of abstract art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 It
is according to such a logic that Mackinder establishes a central aspect
of his political geography, the interplay of sea-power and land-power.

The reversal of re against ground is by no means incidental to
the overall argument. In  4 the <I>land</I> is white, and the sea
black, something that surely contributes to the initial confusion of
looking across to the blank spaces of the sea and the blackened land
masses of <A HREF="5.3gogwilt_2.html"> 2</A>. Similarly, the
curious effect of the photograph of a
globe is, in part, produced by the visual contrast of white continents
and black seas, juxtaposed with the white seas and black continents
of the preceding image. This alternating pattern produces a formalist

ambiguity, not only in the sense that what stands out as re 

<B></B>

 in
the one map--the shape of continents--becomes ground in another map, but
also in the sense that on any one map re and ground might be reversed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The visual trick of what might be called an unconscious optics of
geopolitics serves to place the image of Britain in particular relation
to that educational and formalist imperative of the child's "varying at
will the pattern seen." Concluding the argument of his first chapter,
Mackinder writes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Seen thus in relation to earlier and to later history, Britain
is possessed of two geographical qualities, complementary rather
than antagonistic: insularity and universality. Before Columbus, the
insularity was more evident than the universality. . . . After Columbus,
value began to attach to the ocean-highway, which is in its nature
universal. [<I>BS,</I> 11]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is good reason to recognize here, if not the central paradigm
of geopolitics, at least one of its most characteristic abbreviations
of world history. It constitutes the rhetorical power of the opening
to Mackinder's 1904 address to the Royal Geographical Society, "The
Geographical Pivot of History," in the argument that, "from the present
time forth, in the post-Columbian age, we shall again have to deal with
a closed political system, and none the less that it will be one of
world-wide scope" (<I>SM,</I> 30).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Virtually the same abbreviation of world history accompanies what
is probably the first use of the word "geopolitics" in the English
language. In the same year that <I>Britain and the British Seas</I>
was published, Emil Reich, the Hungarian-born historian who settled in
England in the 1890s, gave special emphasis to the term in his review
of the monumental <I>Cambridge Modern History.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Nor
is Reich's "geo-political" an isolated formulation, since it recurs in
his noted <I>Foundations of Modern Europe</I> , and again in the
two-volume <I>Handbook of Geography</I> , whose opening chapter
closely follows the shape of Mackinder's argument.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Reich
reiterates Mackinder in arguing that "English history falls, from the
geo-political point of view, naturally into two divisions, prae-Columbian
history and post-Columbian history."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Reproducing this
paradigmatic abbreviation of world history, Reich codifies Mackinder's
"position of Britain" as a specifically geopolitical image.

Reclus's Social Geography, the Image of the State, and the Hegemony
of Europe
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even as Emil Reich was codifying Mackinder's "position of Britain" as a
specifically geopolitical image, a very different reading of Britain's
unique position was being advanced by Elis&eacute;e Reclus in his last
monumental work, <I>L'Homme et la terre</I>. As Reclus argued in the
final volume's analysis of contemporary history, Britain occupies a
unique position because "Each movement of the British Isles, which
little England symbolises, has its repercussions throughout the entire
world."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Entitled "England and its Cort&egrave;ge," Reclus's
analysis of British imperialism emphasizes the

<B></B>

contradiction around
which Mackinder's geopolitical image of Britain is shaped: "The life of
the nation finds itself thus split and determined, in certain respects,
by a contradictory politics, since it must act all at once to safeguard
the ferocious insularity of the homeland, and ever more actively to
maintain its relation to its colonies in order to assure the means of
conquest and domination over tributaries spread in all parts of the earth"
(<I>Ht,</I> 6:1-2). Reclus's alternative reading of the "position
of Britain"--based, indeed, on a rereading of the opening chapter of
<I>Britain and the British Seas</I>--calls attention to the fundamental
ambiguity of Mackinder's geopolitical image. (<I>Ht,</I> 4:460)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If that image seems singularly fixed on the British nation-state,
the fascination with its fixed position on the world map is not a
result of the Britishness of the image, but rather the potential
global rearrangement of the world and of world history that it makes
imaginable. To be sure, Mackinder's <I>Britain and the British Seas</I>
is fairly explicitly premised on projecting the political unity of the
British state and its Empire--thus the "geographical qualities" of
"insularity" and "universality" are said to be "complementary." The
very terms, however, in which Mackinder attempts to resolve the split
imperatives of national sovereignty and imperial power call attention all
the more clearly both to that contradiction and its attendant political
instability. Mackinder's imperialist geopolitical image is not only
haunted by Reclus's anarchist geopolitics; its very power depends on
the anarchist thesis that the nation-state is a merely transitory form,
a thesis that geopolitics articulates in the ambiguous imperialism and
anarchism of its own image.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mackinder's heartland thesis, while appearing to make the "pivot" of
history something objectively given by global, physical conditions--the
dichotomy of land and sea, and the distribution of the continents--is
an extended argument for welding the British nation to its imperial
system.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 What gives the "geographical pivot of history"
strategic interest, after all, is not the fixed position of the state
within a set global order, but rather the very instability of political
forms in a changing international "balance of powers."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The principles of "social geography" that enable Reclus to redirect
Mackinder's geopolitical image toward a critical analysis of conquest
and domination have a striking resemblance to later marxist theories,
particularly from Lenin onward, of imperialism, uneven development, and
the global reach of capital. In this radical socialist sense, as Yves
Lacoste argues, <I>L'Homme et la terre</I> anticipates twentieth-century
critiques of imperialism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Reclus outlines these principles
in his introduction to <I>L'Homme et la terre,</I> "'Class struggle,'
the quest for equilibrium, and the sovereignty of the individual's
self-determination <I>(la d&eacute;cision souveraine de l'individu)</I>,
these are three types of phenomena that are revealed to us in the study
of <I>social geography</I> and which, in the chaos of things, prove
sufficiently constant for us to be able to give them the name of 'laws'"
(<I>Ht,</I> 1:iv). Among the many striking points to emerge from these
"laws" is the way "class struggle" and "the search for equilibrium" both
follow from the splitting of all human collectivities as the result of
"an unequal development" (<I>Ht,</I> 1:iv).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The anarchist politics informing these laws explains not only the
"repression" of Reclus in the formation of academic geography, but also
his rejection by marxists, for whom "the sovereignty of the individual,"
for example, would have been suspect in its utopian refusal to engage in
a politics of wresting control of the state.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Consigned to
the utopian nowhere of nineteenth-century anarchism, Reclus's geography
nonetheless illuminates the persistence with which the ambiguities of
nineteenth-century ideas of progress, evolution, and culture shape the
formation of twentieth-century geopolitical paradigms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most revealing is the insistence with which Reclus sustains the
eurocentric imperative for hypothesizing the connection between European
culture and the cultural development of human history as a whole. The
narrative condition of the <I>Universal Geography</I>'s emphasis on the
"moral ascendancy and industrial preponderance" of Europe had depended on
the ambiguous, utopian future condition that "equality will obtain in the
end" and "what we call civilisation will have 'its centre everywhere, its
periphery nowhere'" (<I>UG,</I> 3-4). Between the completion of the
<I>Universal Geography</I> and work on <I>L'Homme et la terre,</I> Reclus
reformulated the terms of this future "equilibrium" to argue, in an essay
entitled "The Hegemony of Europe" , that Europe had become "the
centre of equilibrium between the forces of the human race."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reclus's notion of "hegemony" is premised on a eurocentric articulation
of the accelerated unification of the world under the forces of global
capital. Such forces involve a process of "Europeanisation"; all parts
of the world, he writes in <I>L'Homme et la terre,</I> are being drawn
into "the atmosphere of a general culture, of a predominantly European
type" (<I>Ht,</I> 2:139). The ambiguities with which Reclus formulates
the connection between European culture and the global strategies of
domination and conquest come close to the leverage Antonio Gramsci gives
his key concept of "hegemony"--in the outline, for instance, of his
"Hegemony of Western Culture over the Whole World Culture."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
The affinities are interesting to note since Gramsci's concept of
"hegemony" has played a particularly important role in current cultural
studies, opening nineteenth-century formulations of "culture" to
anticolonial contestations of eurocentric assumptions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reclus's perspective is necessarily eurocentric, but its relevance
for his analysis of the means of imperial conquest and domination
sheds light on the conceptual riddle of culture that haunts
the imperialist formation of geopolitics. Mackinder's ambiguous
evaluation of the success and "fatal momentum" of "<I>Kultur,</I> or
<I>Strategical mentality</I>"--anticipating later repudiations of Nazi
<I>Geopolitik</I>--now suggests that Mackinder's political geography
is constructed to condense and displace the connection between European
culture and military strategy. This is necessary for Mackinder's imperial
geography because what for Reclus is only implicit in the formulation of
"Europe's hegemony"--anticolonial contestation of European culture--is
what imperialism seeks to make unconscious. In this sense the geopolitical
image might be considered the shared dreamwork--"Europe's hegemony"--of
both anarchism and imperialism.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Something of the spirit of Reclus's conception of Europe's hegemony
shows through in his remarks on the effects of "Europeanisation" on the
"citizen of the world:"

himself in material made from American fibre, uses devices which are the
product of the combined work of a thousand inventors of every time and

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In what sense the "sentiments" and "thoughts" of this cosmopolitan "he"
might be "experienced" by millions of other men and women remains, of
course, open. This is precisely the sort of question that Mackinder's
geopolitical image of Britain seeks to foreclose through formalist
abstraction. The place of Reclus in the formation of geopolitics provides
a reminder that this foreclosure is, in fact, an open question that not
only haunts, but that also determines any reading of the geopolitical
image.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mackinder's "new geography" is clearly premised on the politics of the
"new imperialism." Nonetheless, <I>Britain and the British Seas,</I>
whose "idea," Mackinder notes, "was first suggested to me by the needs
of some foreign students visiting Britain" (<I>BS,</I> vi), can only
ever reiterate the "play" of the pupil's imaginative "varying at will
the pattern seen." For all the ocularcentrism of Mackinder's geography,
and geopolitics generally, the geopolitical image is always open to the
fullest kind of contested cultural play. The "green wothe" of Joyce's
infant artist is one example, but there are many more. Another touchstone
of literary modernism, Gertrude Stein's <I>Geography and Plays</I>
, is full of such examples--both in its title, and in its most
celebrated line from the poem "Sacred Emily": "Rose is a rose is a rose
is a rose."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Like Stephen's "green wothe," this "signature
phrase" for Stein's experimental literary modernism might also be read as
an exemplary geopolitical image, particularly in the extended use to which
Stein put it in her children's book about the nine-year-old girl Rose in
<I>The World in Round</I> .
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Used as an epigraph to
that book, the formalist play of the phrase and its circular ambiguity
("rose is . . ." or "a rose is . . .") both illustrates and contests
the elementary geographical fact that "the world is round."

Imaginary Institutions of Geography
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The formation of "geopolitics" over the turn of the century is not
a history of geographical institutions. It is, rather, the story of
imaginary institutions of geography. Indeed, the foundation in 1923
of Karl Haushofer's famous <I>Institut f&uuml;r Geopolitik</I> turns
out, as O Tuathail so well describes, to be a myth, an "imaginary"
embellishment on German geopolitical theories that reveals perhaps more
about the "unconscious fears and fantasies" of U.S. political discourse
than it does about the role of

<B></B>

<I>Geopolitik</I> in shaping Nazi
policy. (<I>CG,</I> 114) Far from suggesting that geopolitical theories
have no effect on the real world, what this imaginary geopolitical
institute underscores is the fact that the influence of geopolitics
persists long after its failed institution as a "science."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The history of geopolitics traced here is a genealogy of an imaginary
institution whose contours are defined not only by the reactionary
politics of European imperialism, but also by the emancipatory politics
of European socialism and anarchism. Perhaps no image captures the
spirit of the moment in which geopolitics took shape better than the
Great Globe proposed by Elis&eacute;e Reclus for the World Exhibition of
1900. Exceeding both the scale and spectacle of previous globes, such
as the one built for the Great Exhibition in 1851, Reclus's "dream
monument" sought to achieve a scientific precision in geographic
measurement, description, and representation after the pattern of
Enlightenment ideals, rationalism, and scientific inquiry.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
In the elaborate scaffolding of galleries, ladders, and elevators
necessary for its exhibition, it offers a striking illustration of
Timothy Mitchell's thesis that the apparatus of nineteenth-century
representation and its "metaphysic of modernity" constructs "the
world-as-exhibition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 It is, indeed, a perfect example
of those ambiguous "dream images" of the nineteenth century discussed
in Walter Benjamin's "Paris, Capital of the Nineteenth Century," from
which Mitchell draws to reformulate Martin Heidegger's "age of the
world picture."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This image encapsulates the ambiguity with which geopolitics is formed
by the rejection and incorporation of nineteenth-century forms of
representation. In presenting his project at the Sixth International
Geographical Congress in London in 1895, Reclus suggested the accuracy
of relief might make the Globe a model for the photographic reproduction
of maps, possibly creating "a complete revolution in the cartographic
industry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Mackinder's photograph of a globe, the last
in the sequence of images demonstrating the position of Britain,
is an interesting modification of Reclus's ideal. Anticipating
late twentieth-century satellite images of the earth from space, its
characteristically nineteenth-century fascination with the photographic
image illustrates the turn-of-the-century optics around which the
geopolitical image constitutes its modernist perspective.

Mackinder's respect for Reclus's work is indicated, albeit
ambiguously, by the inclusion of Reclus in a series he was editing. The
title of the series, <I>The Regions of the World,</I> already suggests
Mackinder's own abbreviation of the encyclopedic reach of an earlier
geography. In the prospectus Reclus is listed as a contributor entrusted
with the region <I>Western Europe and the Mediterranean.</I> In the end,
Reclus's work and that of his fellow anarchist geographer Kropotkin never
appeared. It is nonetheless revealing that, when Mackinder published his
own contribution, <I>Britain and the British Seas</I> in 1902, Reclus, at
that time both well-known as a geographer and notorious as an anarchist,
red so prominently in Mackinder's editorial vision. It points to the
shaping presence, albeit edited, of an anarchist geography and politics
in the reactive formation of geopolitics.

Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard, <I>The Postmodern Condition: A Report
on Knowledge</I> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1985),
31. Lyotard's argument traces two major versions of this narrative. The
first, "more political" one whose subject is "humanity as the hero of
liberty"  is associated with the politics of French primary education;
Lyotard traces the second "more philosophical"  version back to the
ideals of German education/culture <I>(Bildung)</I> as instituted with
Wilhelm von Humboldt's foundation of the University of Berlin. What
Lyotard suggestively calls the <I>"Bildung</I>-effect<I>"</I> of the
second higher educational ideal of "the disinterested pursuit of learning"
 has a particular bearing on what I call here the hypothesis of
culture in the most general sense. A <I>"Bildung</I>-effect,<I>"</I>
for example, shapes Matthew Arnold's notion of culture in <I>Culture
and Anarchy.</I> Already evident in Arnold's translation of the ideal
of German <I>Bildung</I> is the attempted combination of the politics of
primary education and the political contradictions of higher educational
ideals. If Reclus's unwavering insistence on the quest for liberty
suggests Lyotard's first "narrative of freedom," Reclus, a student of
Carl Ritter's at Berlin, also held to the ideals of that second, "more
philosophical" narrative associated with the model of German higher
education. The hero, for Reclus, was <I>both</I> science <I>and</I>
liberty.

Such an abbreviated account of Herder's argument necessarily elides
the complexity both of that text and its reception, complexities discussed
recently in Robert Young, <I>Colonial Desire: Hybridity in Theory, Culture
and Race</I> (London: Routledge, 1995). The foundational passage, which
leaves its imprint on Reclus, Ratzel, and Mackinder, reads as follows:

The unique Mediterranean sea, how much has it become the determinant
of all Europe. . . . Were one to change the borders of these lands
[that surround the Mediterranean], take away a channel here, close up a
waterway there; then the development <I>[Bildung]</I> and the laying waste
<I>[Verw&uuml;stung]</I> of the world, the fate of whole peoples and parts
of the world through centuries takes a different course. [Johann Gottfried

Arnold translates Wilhelm von Humboldt's ideal of <I>Bildung</I> in
the epigraph for his report on education (Matthew Arnold, <I>Schools and
Universities on the Continent</I> [London: Macmillan and Co., 1868],
177). Discussed in that work, it also shapes the spirit and title of
<I>Culture and Anarchy.</I> This blurring of senses of culture is by no
means, as Williams suggests, merely an English <I>Bildung</I>-effect, see
Raymond Williams, <I>Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society</I>
(New York: Oxford University Press, 1983), 91; and idem, <I>Culture
and Society: 1750-1950</I> (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1963). Nor is
it only the European and North American <I>"Bildung</I>-effect<I>"</I>
Lyotard describes. As Gauri Viswanathan has shown, the colonial shaping of
educational ideals opens the translation effect of "culture" to a great
many more inflections, see Gauri Viswanathan, <I>Masks of Conquest:
Literary Study and British Rule in India</I> (New York: Columbia

Buckle's <I>History of Civilization in England</I>, noted for its
emphasis on the influence of geography on human history, provides a useful
point of reference for the geographical formulation of eurocentrism:
"looking at the history of the world, as a whole, the tendency
has been, in Europe, to subordinate nature to man; out of Europe to
subordinate man to nature. . . . The great division, therefore, between
European civilization and non-European civilization, is the basis of the
philosophy of history" (Henry Thomas Buckle, <I>History of Civilization
in England</I> [1857; London: Oxford University Press, 1911], 1;115). The
formulation is a particularly useful point of reference for a great many
liberal versions of the hypothesis of culture, perhaps especially in that
it suggests the highly unstable, imaginary anchor of eurocentrism for
nineteenth-century narratives. I shall pursue this point in a further
stage of the current project, turning to the form of narrative not yet
addressed here, namely, the form of the novel.

The link between primary and university education in Mackinder's vision
is summed up by the nickname given to the courses Mackinder organized,
at the request of Richard Burdon Haldane, Secretary of State for War, for
senior army officers at the London School of Economics. Taught from 1906
until 1914, the years in which Mackinder produced his school textbooks,
they came to be known as "Haldane's Mackindergarten" (W. H. Parker,

The liberal-sounding term "equilibrium" and Reclus's quotation marks
around "class struggle" might well have aroused marxists' suspicions. A
notable example of Reclus's active neglect in marxist debates is provided
by G. V. Plekhanov's 1906 review of L. Metchnikoff's analysis of the
geographical causes of oriental despotism, in which Plekhanov uncovers
an anarchist tendency in Metchnikoff's reference to Reclus. See Anne
Bailey and Josep R. Llobera, <I>The Asiatic Mode of Production: Science

Studies group has put Gramscian ideas. See <I>Selected Subaltern
Studies,</I> eds. Ranajit Guha and Gayatri Spivak (Oxford: Oxford

of the term "hegemony" in the mid 1890s is suggested by the genealogy of
the concept offered by Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, <I>Hegemony and
Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics</I> (London:

Mitchell's reformulation of Heidegger reads as follows:
"Non-Europeans encountered in Europe what one might call, echoing a
phrase from Heidegger, the age of the world exhibition, or rather, the
world-as-exhibition. World exhibition here refers not to an exhibition
of the world but to the world conceived and grasped as though it were
an exhibition" (<I>Colonising Egypt,</I> 13). This final phrase, in
particular, applies well to Reclus's account of the scaffolding needed to
exhibit the Globe. In his project for the Great Globe, presented at the
Sixth International Geographical Congress of 1895 held in London, Reclus
conceived of a <I>second</I> globe, framing the scientific globe, in
order to protect it from the weather (Reclus, "Project," 629-30). We
might thus note that Gregory's reproduction of the 1897 illustration for
the Paris World Exhibition of 1900 in fact represents only one part of
the extraordinary utopian project, and, notably, the form imagined for
exhibition. This form <I>leaves out</I> the actual globe, not only in its
display of the outer model, but also in conceiving the inner vault as the
screen for the projection of a vast panorama. See Gregory's description
and illustration in <I>Geographical Imaginations</I>, 38.
