When the Court Theatre in Chicago announced that during its 2000-2001
season it would be staging a new chamber opera by Philip Glass based
on Franz Kafka's story, "In the Penal Colony," we decided to use the
occasion to try to open a new discussion of Kafka's remarkable text, the
relevance of which, given contemporary debates about the death penalty,
human rights, and the legacies of colonialism, was beyond doubt. In order
to stimulate new thinking we invited a group of scholars from a variety
of disciplines, most of whom would never ordinarily consider themselves
Kafka experts, to address the text without engaging the vast secondary
literature on Kafka. (The one exception to this "rule" was the inclusion
of Stanley Corngold, the noted Kafka scholar who has produced much of
this literature). We were not, in other words, interested in producing
new Kafka "scholarship" in any traditional sense of the term. We invited
our speakers, instead, to think out loud about the issues raised in
Kafka's text from the perspective of their own work and orientation. In
this sense, we sought an academic correlative to the theatrical gambit:
like the Court Theatre, we were interested in revisiting Kafka's text,
asking how it might resonate anew some eighty years after its initial
publication. The papers were given on 1 and 2 December 2000, at the
Theatre on the campus of the University of Chicago.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As is well known, Kafka himself had mixed feelings about "In the Penal
Colony<I>."</I> The story was written in the autumn of 1914 and though
Kafka considered grouping it together with "The Metamorphosis" and
"The Judgment" in a collection called "Punishments," it was only at
the urging of his friend and publisher, Kurt Wolff, that he, in 1919,
finally allowed the story to appear in print. At some level he could
not fully understand Wolff's

<B></B>

admiration for the text and Wolff himself had to admit that his own
profound love for the story was mixed with a certain horror and disgust
with respect to the "dreadful intensity of the frightful material"
(<I>die schreckhafte Intensit&auml;t des furchtbaren Stoffes</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  One of our goals at the symposium was to explore this amalgam of
  attraction and repulsion that surely characterizes every reader's
  relation to this strange work of fiction. At the core of this amalgam
  is no doubt the very thing that invites compositional, dramaturgical,
  and performative engagement with the work. We are thinking, of course,
  of the numerous references and allusions in the story to a certain
  theatricality informing the institutions of law and punishment,
  to the <I>spectacle</I> of human pain in its function as real and
  imaginary support of social and political bonds. There is something
  at the very heart of "In the Penal Colony" that would seem to open it
  to the universe of opera, a medium in which tormented bodies so often
  issue in songs of supplication that are met--or unmet--by responses
  of mercy and grace on the part of sovereigns and lovers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the central issues that preoccupied our contributors is the depth
and omnipresence of ambiguity in the text. Generally thought to be one of
Kafka's most straightforward texts, one whose plot most people can easily
follow and recall, "In the Penal Colony" proves, under closer scrutiny,
to be riddled with disorienting shifts of perspective and tone. One of
the crucial passages in the text, for example, the description of the
apparatus by the officer, includes a remarkable claim as to the spiritual
efficacy of the punishment-machine on its victim:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
But how quiet he grows at just about the sixth hour! Enlightenment comes
to the most dull-witted [<I>Verstand geht dem Bl&ouml;desten auf</I>]. It
begins around the eyes. From there it radiates. A moment that might
tempt one to get under the Harrow oneself. Nothing more happens than
that the man begins to understand the inscription (<I>die Schrift zu
entziffern</I>), he purses his mouth as if he were listening. You have
seen how difficult it is to decipher the script with one's eyes; but
our man deciphers it with his wounds.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his nostalgic reminiscences about the glory days of the apparatus,
the officer recalls the impact of this moment on the spectators: "How we
all absorbed the look of transration on the face of the sufferer,
how we bathed our cheeks in the radiance (<I>den Schein</I>) of that
justice, achieved at last and fading so quickly!" ("IPC" 154)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the symposium, in a round-table discussion following a performance
of his opera, Philip Glass himself recalled these scenes as the ones
that stuck with him from his first reading of the story some forty years
earlier and as the ones that, indeed, inspired his work on the opera. He
went on to associate Kafka's story with Sch&ouml;nberg's <I>Verkl&auml;rte
Nacht</I> (Transred night) and questions of art and transration
more generally. In the opera itself, Glass and JoAnne Akalaitis,
who directed the production, endow the officer (played alternately by
Eugene and Herbert Perry) with a kind of sympathy and poignancy proper
to one engaged in a spiritual quest. But what are we to make of the
ambiguity of Kafka's choice of words with respect to this moment of
"enlightenment"? The emergence of some sort of understanding specified as
a corporeal decipherment of a coded script, a decipherment that produces
what may only be the appearance (<I>den Schein</I>) of justice: is this
really the stuff of spiritual transration? And what are

<B></B>

we to make of the fact that the officer himself is denied any sort of
understanding once he subjects himself to the machinery of justice? At
the end of the story, the face of the officer "was as it had been in
life; no sign was visible of the promised redemption; what the others had
found in the machine the officer had not found. . ." ("IPC" 166). And of
course the sentence that was to be inscribed on the officer's body was
not this or that determinate commandment or injunction but rather the
general and categorical one, the very source of any spiritual dimension
of law whatsoever: "Be just!" ("IPC" 161)  Furthermore, why does the
machine break down at this particular moment, under the weight of this
commandment?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In light of such difficulties, it makes sense that one of the motifs of
the papers that follow is the status of <I>nonsense</I>-- or rather, the
limits of sense--both in the text and in the administration of justice as
represented by the text. Though these limits assume many forms, evoking,
in turn, horror, disgust, and laughter, we are tempted to correlate
them with a more general feature of Kafka's work. To use a formulation
proposed by Gershom Scholem in his correspondence with Walter Benjamin
about Kafka, the fictive world revealed in Kafka's prose is distorted by
a surplus of validity over meaning. Scholem characterizes this surplus
as the force of revelation at a zero-degree of content.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  res in Kafka's work, as well as the reader of his work, are
  constantly addressed by messages that can never be fully grasped,
  enigmatic signifiers that, as it were, get under the skin without
  ever being metabolized into a livable meaning. Though uncoupled from
  signification, they remain valid, i.e., they inform intentional life. So
  if there is "enlightenment" of some kind in the story, it may well have
  to do with this dimension of enigma at the boundary between meaning
  and the body in pain. All of the papers in this dossier explore,
  in one way or another, Kafka's remarkable meditation on this boundary.

The symposium was organized under the aegis of the newly constituted
Faculty Committee on Theater and Performance Studies and the Department
of Germanic Studies at the University of Chicago, and was made possible
by generous support from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) in
New York and, at the University of Chicago: the Master of the College, the
Dean of the Division of the Humanities, and the Adelyn Russell Bogert Fund
of the Franke Institute for the Humanities. In addition to thanking each
of these sponsors (as well as the Court Theatre for hosting the event),
we want to thank our colleagues whose work is presented here--for their
willingness to venture into unfamiliar territory. Thanks to their efforts,
Kafka's text emerges here as newly compelling.
