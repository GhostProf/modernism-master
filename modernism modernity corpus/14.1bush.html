1. Introduction
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p id="lead">
Well before publication it was apparent that Ezra Pound's greatest poetic achievement, <i>The Pisan Cantos</i>, was preoccupied with memory. When Pound's wife Dorothy received his first messy typescripts, she wrote back in surprise that the new Cantos, rather than treating historical concerns like the previous ones, "are your self, the memories that make up yr. person."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Her comment provides an essential entry into a poem that, produced in the aftermath of a breakdown, dramatizes the resurrection of a self--so much so that one is tempted to approach <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> in the light of a heartbreaking outburst in Barry Levinson's 1999 film, "Liberty Heights," in which Levinson's alter ego--a younger brother and aspiring writer--concludes his account of adolescence in Baltimore with the remark that if he had realized so much of the world he grew up in would disappear, he would have tried harder to commit the whole of it to memory. </p>

<p>But Pound's wartime suite amounts to more than a private reminiscence, and the philosophical, historical, and ideological dimensions of memory in his meditation have only slowly come into focus. As concerns philosophy, Pound for more than ten years before the war had prepared himself to create in the last third of his projected hundred Cantos "un cielo sereno e filosofico" ("a serene philosophical heaven")--a Paradise based on the state of being implied by the highest flights of the mind.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  This project was 

<b></b>

 to be based largely on the neoplatonic implications of Cavalcanti's canzone "Donna mi prega" ("Because a Lady Asks Me")--a poem that treats the way affection prepares a place in the memory for images of beauty to reside, and celebrates the ability of those images to conjure up the intellectual form of Love and join the soul to universal intellect.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  (The special place of memory in the mind's quest for reunion with the forms of the divine had in Pound's view been theorized by the neoAristotelian tradition of Avicenna, which Pound believed had supplied Cavalcanti the key intellectual premises of his poetic disquisition, and which assigned an even more important place in cognition to memory than had Aristotle himself.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> ) </p>

<p>In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Pound seized on a handful of key phrases in "Donna mi prega" and used them to explore similar philosophical notions in Scotus Erigena and elsewhere.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Again and again in these notes he includes reference to Cavalcanti's "formato locho," which Pound translates in Canto 36 as the "formed trace" of the beloved which Love carves "dove sta memoria"--"where memory liveth" (C36/178, 177).<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  And when he produced the first fragments of his Paradiso in the early 1940s he built them around citations from Cavalcanti, Erigena, and Confucius.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  This constellation of material would have provided the core of the last section of the Cantos had Pound's situation not deteriorated during the Second World War. As Pound said at the time "if it weren't for this tiresome war," there would be time to consider whether Western thought had progressed or declined since the Middle Ages, and to ask questions such as, "Have we got better at thinkin'? Do we think with greater clarity? Or has the so-called program of science merely got us all cluttered up mentally and pitched us into greater confusion?"<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Relentlessly, though, wartime conditions in northern Italy did interrupt Pound's philosophical endeavors and turned his attention to the precariousness of another kind of thought--communal associations anchored by the monuments of Italian culture that Allied air raids in 1943 and 1944 were progressively ruining. As this destruction forced Pound back upon the cords of his personal memory frayed by the stresses of the war, he responded to the great theme of Italian Fascist propaganda in the latter stages of the war--that the Allies were engaged in a campaign of calculated cultural terrorism, attempting what a recent book by Robert Bevan has called "The Destruction of Memory." Allied bombing, in this view, was aimed not only at the demolition of the Axis's military and industrial structure, but also at what Bevan describes as an "enforced forgetting" linked to the premeditated destruction of architectural traditions whose aim is "the erasure of the memories, history and identity attached to architecture and place."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The effect on Pound of the Allied conduct of the war involved both rage and paralysis, resulting from being a compatriot of the bombers who were obliterating the material culture he had cherished for forty years. The by-product was a sharpened sensitivity to what historians lately have begun to call the phenomenon of "social" or "cultural memory"--that is, to the power of material images, including public monuments and especially including the monumental sites of ritual re-enactments, to "impose interpretations of the past ... shape memory and thus to construct social identity."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  <i>The Pisan </i>

<b></b>

 <i>Cantos</i>, I want to suggest, grew out of key late statements of Italian Fascist cultural propaganda and came to construct a theory of cultural memory that identified Italy with visual sophistication and the Allied powers with those bursts of iconoclasm that Robert Bevan reminds us were entailed in an "ancient pattern" of sacred destruction from "Byzantium's Quarrel of the Images to the Reformation and beyond" (DM, 17). In harmony with the more extreme elements of Italian Fascism, though, Pound took this argument to its anti-Semitic limit and traced the origins of Allied iconoclasm to the sanctions against graven images in the Old Testament. In poems leading up to <i>The Pisan Cantos</i>, he elaborated this reaction into a defence of an Italian "arte monda," or clean art, associated with the decimated cultural patrimony of Italy and opposed to the modern world's absorption of art into the ideologies of the marketplace and the religious fanatic. Growing out of these nightmares, <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> became a poem devoted to shoring up a collective memory not only of the monuments that the Allies had so lamentably defaced but of an Italian culture rooted in antiquity and revitalized by Mussolini. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">

<p>Once the Second World War started, Pound, his English wife Dorothy, and his American parents--aliens in Axis territory--were stranded in the English watering hole of Rapallo, not far from Genoa, and cut off from their income in England and America. Like George Bernard Shaw and Winston Churchill, Pound had been an early supporter of Mussolini. Unlike them, he maintained his support for the Italian regime after its invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 and then again after it notoriously introduced racial laws against the Jews in 1938.  </p>

<p>When, therefore, the opportunity arose to be paid for broadcasting his views on the way Allied propaganda had distorted the history of Fascism over the Italian radio, Pound did not hesitate. It was for this that on July 26 1943--the day after Mussolini was deposed in Rome--the American government indicted Pound for treason for having given aid and comfort to the enemy. Determined to continue his broadcasting even then, Pound found himself in a studio in Rome in the tumultuous days after September 8 1943, when Badoglio surrendered Rome to the Allies, prompting the Germans to seize it on their own and greatly increasing the danger principally to the Jews of Rome (many of whom were exterminated before the end of the year) but also to resident foreigners. </p>

<p>Fleeing for his life, Pound made his way through the chaos to the north of Italy, making contact with men who would become key members of the new Salo Republic, which the Germans created after springing Mussolini from a mountain confinement. The result was that for the rest of the war Pound became one of very few foreign intellectuals advising the remnants of Mussolini's cultural establishment--an effort that more and more bizarrely amount to his pressing on them the translations into Italian of Confucius that he was simultaneously incorporating into his poetry and his prose.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Finally and decisively, the run of composition that leads directly to <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> was triggered by the shock of the 1943-44 Allied bombardment of Italy and by a brief moment of elation late in 1944, when it seemed that the Italians and Germans had reversed the Allied progress. During the winter of 1943 and then intermittently in the summer and fall of 1944 even the sleepy town of Rapallo was damaged by air raids that were aimed at anti-aircraft installations on the Ligurian coast and at the port city of Genoa. And after Florence fell in September 1944, the Allied bombing of northern Italy only increased, as Rimini and Forli on the so-called Gothic Line continued to be sites of heavy ting and the fate of Bologna hung in the balance. Exhausted by this effort, at the end of 1944 the Allies reined in their efforts for the winter. Though they managed to take Ravenna on December 5 after many days of ting, Bologna remained in Axis hands until the following year. Meanwhile, in Europe above the Alps the Battle of the Bulge was raging, allowing a last desperate hope in Fascist Italy that the Allied invasion of Europe might be turned back. </p>

<p>In the midst of these developments, Mussolini's Ministry of Popular Culture launched a campaign to win back ordinary Italians to Fascism by reminding them of how much of Italy's cultural patrimony was being damaged by apparently senseless Allied bombing. That part of the Italian press still under Fascist sway took up the regime's cause enthusiastically. Mario Rivoire, for example, was appointed editor of the <i>Il Secolo XIX</i> of Genoa just after September 1943 as part of what Lawrence Rainey has called "the [Salo] government's effort to control the press by placing trusted supporters in key positions"--an effort that relentlessly stressed the destruction of cultural monuments "wrought by the 'terrorist bombers' of the English and Americans." One of <i>Il Secolo</i>'s recurrent features carried a headline variation on the rubric "I monumenti che il nemico ci distrugge" ("The Monuments the Enemy is Destroying"). Thus on Sunday, June 4 1944, the paper published an article relating the damage that Allied bombing visited during late 1943 and early 1944 on the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini. And though this particular article concentrated on the historical importance of the Tempio rather than the extent of its destruction and produced pictures only of the building before its damage, Pound, who had in large part established his reputation as an epic poet upon an identification with the building, saved the piece, and the faded clipping still resonates with his shock.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  </p>

<p>This, however, was only one of many shocks that the Fascist press relayed that season, not only in <i>Il Secolo XIX</i> but in the other newspapers Pound read, including the anti-Semite Farinacci's <i>Regime Fascista</i>, and the <i>Corriere della Sera</i> of Milan (<i>PIF</i>, 197-98).<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  The <i>Corriere</i>, the most important newspaper still under Fascist sway, in late 1944 echoed <i>Il Secolo</i>'s "Monumenti" articles with its own series about the destruction of Italy's artistic patrimony under the general rubric "L'Italia Artistica Mutilata." </p>

<p>On Monday, September 4 1944, Genoa and Rapallo were bombed, weakening Renaissance arches in Rapallo and degrading the city's supply of drinking water. Ten days later Pound, who had been displaced by the Axis military in May from his apartment in Rapallo and forced with his wife to move into the residence of his mistress, Olga Rudge, situated on a hill path above the city in San Ambrogio, wrote to Fernando 

<b></b>

 Mezzasoma, the Salo Republic's Minister of Popular Culture, to advise on the situation. In the letter he refers to himself as a "sfollata," an "evacuee."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> </p>

<p>Also on September 4, the <i>Corriere</i> announced the destruction of another of Pound's sacred places, this time the brilliant mosaic chamber outside Ravenna commonly known as the mausoleum of the Empress Aelia Galla Placidia. The <i>Corriere</i> said Ravenna had suffered multiple attacks, and that almost all the great public buildings of the city that had once been capitol of the Byzantine Exarchate had been badly damaged--the Cathedral and the churches of San Francesco, San Domenico, San Giovanni Battista, San Vittore, and San Simeon (p.1). </p>

<p>As part of its propaganda campaign, the <i>Corriere</i> also featured a running feature entitled "Sangue Italiano" ("Italian Blood"), whose aim was to praise Italy's citizen heroes. On October 1, for example, under the headline "Sangue Italiano: L'eroina di Rimini" ("The Heroine of Rimini"), the paper told the stirring but apparently fabricated story of an "anonymous, radiant heroine from Rimini," who, having been "raped by two Australians," deliberately led a group of Canadian soldiers into a mine-field and, dying, announced, "Ho vendicato il mio onore"--"I have vindicated my honor" (<i>EPMC</i>, 244-45). And on Monday, November 20 1944, under the same rubric another account of patriotic sacrifice recounted battles around the city of Forli (not far from Rimini in the direction of Bologna). Below headline stories that triumphed Mussolini's "fede nella riscossa della Patria" ("faith in the resurgence of the Fatherland") and quoted the promise of one of Mussolini's officials that "ritorneremo"--"we Italians shall return"--the paper's third lead for that day told the story of "Sangue Romagnolo" ("Blood of the Romagna") in the form of a story (possibly also fabricated and certainly intended to remind its readers of "Il libro cuore" of Edmondo De Amicis) of anonymous women who put their lives on the line at Forli's gate by shielding Fascist snipers and obstructing the entrance of Allied troops, thus becoming "voluntarie della morte" ("volunteers for death") in Mussolini's cause (p.1). (<a href="#1"> 1</a>.) </p>

<p>The sadness and resolve of these articles had a dramatic effect on Pound's wavering equanimity, but what finally shattered his silence were three articles that appeared in the <i>Corriere della Sera</i>'s Sunday editions of December 3 and December 17 1944. On December 3, the <i>Corriere</i> (<a href="#2"> 2</a>) rehearsed the matter of the "L'Italia Artistica Mutilata" under the sub-head, "La calata degli iconoclasti" ("The Descent of the Iconoclasts"). This article proffered shocking pictures of how much damage Allied bombing had inflicted on the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan and the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini. The latter picture was captioned: "Solo uomini che odiano l'arte potevano ridurre in questo stato un capolavoro come il tempio malatestiano di Rimini" ("Only those who hate art could have reduced to such a state a masterpiece like the Tempio Malatestiano of Rimini").  </p>

<p>"La Calata degli iconoclasti" begins with the leader, "Dai monumenti sacri e profani ai capolavori della pittura, della scultura e dell'arte decorativa, il catalogo delle distruzioni e interminabile: ancora una volta il nembo della barbarie si e abbattuto sulla terra che custodisce le vestigia e il fuoco delle piu nobili civilta" ("From sacred and profane monuments to masterpieces of painting, sculpture and the decorative arts, the 

<b></b>

 catalogue of destruction is endless: once more the barbarian storm has descended on ground that tends the traces and the spirit of the highest civilizations"). Then, noting the recent rebombing of Genoa, it relates ruin in Turin, Milan (where the church of Santa Maria della Grazie was severely damaged and the Last Supper of Leonardo was almost lost), Bologna, Cagliari, and Naples; also, recounted in great detail, in smaller cities around the country, including Rimini ("con i suoi trenta edifici monumentali infranti, segnatamente con il rovinatissimo tempio Malatestiano, fulgida espressione del nostro Rinascimento ... nel quale sono andati distrutti un affresco del Battaglini, </p><!--_re 1-->

 for months," dwelling at length on the losses in the Romagna and noting that the great churches of Ravenna had been reduced to a pile of ruins, including the cloister of San Vitale and "all of the famous churches of the Exarcate"--"l'Esarcato." </p>

<p>Yet, the <i>Corriere</i> consoled its readers, some things had been spared and, while Ravenna and Bologna resisted, Fascist Italy was not yet lost. Crucially, the paper focused its account of Italian identity around Fascism's reconsolidation of the work of Dante, who, it said, fostered "the resurrection of the nation" and was buried in the Ravennese "fragrant pine wood" immortalized in <i>Purgatorio</i> XXVIII:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>La battaglia rugge sulla soglia della dolce pineta<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  aromatica, il suo rombo incessante ha troncato da tempo il silenzio reverenziale creato intorno alla tomba di Dante. E mai come in questi giorni alla tomba di Dante si rivolge il pensiero degli Italiani, non tanto per il pericolo che sovrasta alle ossa del divino annunciatore medievale della resurrezione della Patria ... quanto per trarne la fede e l'auspicio che "l'aiuola che ci fa tanto feroci"<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  pacificata riprenda nel mondo il posto che il nostro tempo le aveva conquistato.</p>

<p>
	(The battle rages around the edge of the soft fragrant pine wood; its incessant roaring has broken the reverential silence around the tomb of Dante. And never as in these last days has the thought of all Italians turned to the tomb of Dante, not only because of the danger that continues to hang over the remains of the divine prophet of the resurrection of the nation ... but also so that we may receive faith and good omen that "the little threshing floor that makes us so fierce" will, pacified, again take up the place in the world that our time [meaning the age of Fascism] has won back for it.)
</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Especially suited to get under the skin of readers like Pound who had been persuaded by the Fascists that the war was a result of betrayal by European Jewish finance, the article lamented that Italy's losses were as much the fault of international finance as Allied bombing. As the <i>Corriere</i>'s writer, Gino Damerini, asserted, even if Italy's remaining treasures were to escape the chaos of battle, "al seguito dell'invasione agisce una folla di intressi che mira ad impossessarsi delle nostre ricchezze artistiche" ("in the wake of the invasion a crowd of special interests has taken aim at our artistic heritage"). Financial speculation and inflation, he averred, have put into place an art market that will spirit away what has not been destroyed unless Italians respond to "il dovere di resistere, almeno di reagir, agli allettamenti della moneta rapinatrice, rifiutandosi ad un commercio vietato dalle leggi, di cui proprio essi, soltanto essi, porteranno la responsabilita e, diciamolo pure, il disonore" ("the duty to resist, or at least to react to the allurements of plundering finance, refusing a commerce forbidden by law and of which they, and they alone, will carry the responsibility and, we must say it, the dishonor"). In any case, he lamented, "le distruzione dei segni della nostra secolare supremazia civile saranno ricordate, sempre, come prove della barbarie altrui: la storia di tutte le epoche insegna" ("the destruction of the traces of our secular civic supremacy will be remembered, always, as proof of the barbarism of others: the history of every epoch teaches the same lesson"). </p>

<p>Finally, the same issue of the <i>Corriere</i> announced the death of the Futurist Tomasso Marinetti, who had been a volunteer in Mussolini's Imperial campaign in Africa and 

<b></b>

 had more recently served on the Russian front, where he conducted himself like a professional soldier, careless of the by now precarious condition of his health. This was consistent, the managing editor of the <i>Corriere</i> noted, with his behavior after September 8 1943, when he was among the first to draw around Mussolini, "a cui rimase fedele in ogni circostanza" ("to whom he remained faithful in every circumstance") (p.3). </p>

<p>Two weeks after these horrific stories, the news took a dramatic turn for the better from the Fascist perspective. At 11 o'clock on December 16, Pound listened on the radio as Mussolini, making what was to be his last major public speech from the teatro Lirico in Milan, called on Italians to take heart from the Allied difficulties in the Marches and farther north in Belgium and mount a counteroffensive ("riscossa") to take back their native land.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The next day the Sunday <i>Corriere della Sera</i> provided a full text of the speech under the headline "Da Milano E' Squillata La Diana della Riscossa" ("from Milan sounds the reveille for a counterattack") (p.1). </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
3. a First Suite in Italian
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>These stories in the <i>Corriere della Sera</i> of November and December 1944, combined with the unexpected hope for the Mussolini government fomented by the hiatus in the Allies' advances in winter 1944, kick-started Pound's work on new Cantos and triggered four months of almost continuous composition in Italian, beginning on or soon after December 3 and continuing until April 1945. The Italian propaganda campaign could not help but play on the shame Pound felt as a countryman of the bombardiers who were destroying so much of Italy's cultural heritage, and seems to have solidified his conclusion that the war was being fought between two different mentalilities--a civilized culture of religion and art and a barbaric culture of iconoclasm. </p>

<p>Pound's Italian composition, moreover, would prove more than a wartime oddity, since he proceeded to incorporate not only fragments of it but its ideological framework into <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> that he began to compose in July 1945. In both phases of his work, Pound follows the <i>Corriere</i>'s attempts to preserve the memory of all that had been recently lost, thus demonstrating that imagination and memory are not passive activities but forces imbued with philosophical and practical wisdom. Especially in the Italian verses he enacts this aim by means of a dialogue with ghosts--a collective invocation of a series of great souls whose sparks counter the random destruction of the Italian culturescape.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Within a month of the <i>Corriere</i>'s "Calata degli iconoclasti" article and two weeks after the newspaper's reporting of Mussolini's call for a "riscossa," Pound had finished two poems reflecting Mussolini's call to action that that were eventually to take their place as Cantos 72 and 73 of the published <i>Cantos</i>.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  In them Pound allowed the deceased Marinetti to speak for himself, but as the voice of Fascist resistance in Florence and in Mussolini's provincial home, the Romagna, he presented not Mussolini himself but two historical analogues. In Canto 72, which records that "Rimini arsa e Forli distrutta" (C72/428: "Rimini is burned, Forli is in ruins") and which suggests the ruin of Ravenna in the disturbed sleep of Galla Placidia, the primary spokesman is Ezzelino da Romano, 

<b></b>

 for thirty-four years the Ghibelline Lord of the March of Treviso and a re in <i>Inferno</i> XII. At Canto 72/427 it is Ezzolino who repeats the government's pledge, "torneremo"--"we will return." In Canto 73 on the other hand, it is the Florentine aristocratic poet Guido Cavalcanti who announces Mussolini's "diana / della riscossa" (C73/438) and who retells with admiration and at length the <i>Corriere</i>'s story of the heroines of Rimini.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Buoyant with his progress, Pound then extended his composition in Italian to an expansive suite that, like the "Sangue Italiano" articles on heroic Italian citizens in the <i>Corriere</i>, was meant to furnish avatars of love and courage. In Pound's Italian they are presented as burning embers to revive the flame of the high civilization ("il fuoco delle piu nobili civilta") whose shining achievements ("[le] fulgid[e] espression[i] del nostro Rinascimento"), the <i>Corriere</i> reported, had so recently disappeared. And so not only Cantos 72 and 73 but these subsequent and until now unpublished poems in Italian draw on the accounts in the <i>Corriere della Sera</i>'s winter 1944 accounts of the mutilation of Italian culture and amplify the defiance expressed in the actions of the citizen heroes and heroines of Rimini and Forli. </p>

<p>The deepest subject of the new Italian Cantos, however, affirms art's power to preserve in a paradise of memory the ruined monuments of Italy that the <i>Corriere</i>, with specific reference to the Fascist revival, had called "segni della nostra secolare supremazia civile [che] saranno ricordate, sempre, come prove della barbarie altrui: la storia di tutte le epoche insegna" ("traces of our secular civic supremacy [that] will be remembered, always, as proof of the barbarism of others: the history of every epoch teaches the same lesson"). This underlying theme begins in a quiet moment of Canto 72, where the spirit of Galla Placidia recalls the music of the past amid that part of the pine forest of Ravenna that the <i>Corriere della Sera</i> maintained was still intact and close to the yet unbroken tomb of Dante and the tomb of Placidia herself, lying in ruins nearby. Then in fragments written immediately after Cantos 72 and 73, Pound creates an analogue for Galla Placidia in the form of a young girl--a refugee or "sfollata" of the kind he himself had become in Rome and in Rapallo. Envisioned on the hillpath ("salita") above Rapallo, she is addressed by Pound as "la scalza" ("the barefooted one") and she speaks of herself as a wandering Madonna, displaced from a destroyed icon of "l'Assunta" ("the risen Virgin") in one of the bombed churches in the area. (Recall the <i>Corriere</i>'s note about the destroyed "l'Assunta" of Frangipane at Rimini.)  </p>

<p>It is possible to piece together the structure of Pound's Italian sequence, (which was never completed but extended to dozens of pages of rough typescript drafts and semi-finished typescripts of two poems labeled Canto 74 and 75), not merely from the internal coherence of the drafts that survive in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale, but from several schemas that Pound inscribed on them.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The most authoritative of these schemas runs as follows:

<p>Pound here sketches out a movement that begins with his own visionary encounters on the "Salita" of Rapallo--first with "la scalza" from his earlier fragment ("la sfollata," the evacuee)--and then with the Renaissance poet Basinio of Parma, whom Pound encounters on the ancient Via Aurelia in Liguria in the company of his patron Sigismondo Malatesta on the way to finalize a treaty. Basinio recounts to Pound a fading vision of the great thirteenth-century beauty, Ezzelino da Romano's sister, "Cunizza." </p>

<p>The draft sequence then shifts to two great outbursts of defiance--Sigismondo Malatesta's blast against the corruptions of the modern world (modeled after Sordello's rage in <i>Purgatorio</i> VI) and a recall of Caterina Sforza's ringing statement of contempt for her captors on the walls of Forli. Malatesta, who had been lord of Rimini, a legendary patron of the arts and a fierce scourge of Papal Rome, is included to give historical resonance to the Axis defenders of Rimini. And Caterina Sforza, the great Renaissance virago and ruler of Forli, epitomizes the heroic women at the gate of Forli. To rebels who were holding her children for ransom to ensure that she would help them take over her city, Caterina, according to Guicciardini, safely on the walls of a nearby fort, "lifted her skirt and exclaimed defiantly, 'Don't you think, you fools, that I have the stuff to make others?'"<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  (On another occasion, rather than surrender to Cesare Borgia, she attempted to blow the powder magazine under her own castle aerie--"il Paradiso.")  </p>

<p>From there Pound's drafts rise out of the hell of war and return to the young waif on the hillside, this time in the guise of "l'Assunta," and continues with a Landoresque imaginary dialogue between Scotus "Erigena" and Dante. Finally Pound ends with an ambiguous Lotus-like "Eliseo" ("Elysium") and an equally ambiguous limbo populated first by the emperor Hadrian and then by (a re identified in other versions of the schema) Lorenzo de' Medici.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The double climax of Pound's Paradisal theme occurs in draft tableaux entitled "Assunta" and "Eliseo." Pound's "Assunta," like his Galla Placidia, is inextricably linked to an icon, both in the sense of an image of a sacred object (in this case, a damaged "Assumption" on a ruined church wall) and in the Aristotelian (and later scholastic) sense of a thing that is an aid to memory.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  As such, these drafts strongly anticipate Canto 74 of the published <i>Pisan Cantos</i>, which, invoking the phrase "formato loco" from Cavalcanti 

<b></b>

 in "Donna mi prega," testifies to the resurgent power of such "EIKONE " to recall us to the form of the divine. In Canto 74, as Pound draws near to the first climax of his suite, he tells us that "funge la purezza"--"purity functions"--because  </p>

<p class="continued">Pound's Italian "Assunta" and "Eliseo" drafts anticipate this passage by making not only negative reference to "la calata degli iconoclasti" as in the 1944 <i>Corriere</i> but positive reference to the mnemonic value of iconic images in philosophy since Aristotle. Even in Aristotle's <i>De Anima</i> ("On the Soul," which Pound studied in the 1940s) and its related text, <i>On Memory and Recollection</i>, all human thought and imagination are said to depend on the memory of the sensible image ("phantasma"), which becomes the soul's source of intelligible form 
<img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek01.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="39" height="17" />

.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Thus the soul receives "the form <img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek01.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="39" height="17" /> of sensible objects without the matter <img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek02.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="41" height="16" />, just as the wax receives the impression of the signet-ring without the iron or the gold"; and subsequently "all things which are imaginable are necessarily objects of memory."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  However, as Aristotle adds in <i>On Memory and Recollection</i>, in recollection a mental object is not merely "phantasma" but also, "insofar as we consider it in relation to something else, a 'likeness' <img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek03.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="46" height="16" /> that serves as an 'aid to memory,'" and that it is "the affection <img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek04.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="47" height="17" /> which is produced by sensation in the soul" that corresponds to the "lasting state ... we call memory."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  In this way "EIKONE " serve to recharge our affection for the source, and motivate us to reanimate it. </p>

<p>Adapting this definition of mental process, Pound's Italian "Assunta" and "Eliseo" drafts both ally the material reality of a graphic icon with the attainment of truth and translate Aristotle's psychological account into cultural terms. As Pound puts it in a 1944 essay, "A Visiting Card," "Tradition <i>inheres</i> ... in the images of the gods [elsewhere in the essay he calls these images "mnemonic and commemorative symbols"], and gets lost in dogmatic definitions. History is recorded in monuments, and <i>that</i> is why they get destroyed."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In other words, the cultural memory embodied in European monuments works hand in hand with individual memory to resist the course of social disintegration. </p>

<p>Especially in "Assunta," moreover, Pound insists that insofar as the "mnemonic" power of EIKONE  depends on their status as images, image-centered art resists iconclasm's tendency toward abstraction and meretriciousness--an impulse that Pound tendentiously associates during the war with the West's Semitic heritage and with Jews. So "Assunta" begins by asserting, "mai coi codini sara l'arte monda" ("there will never be clean art among the fanatics"), where "monda" signifies not "of the world" but an adjective, "pure" (from "mondare," to remove impurity), and where "i codini" ("the fanatics") invokes Pound's hostility to Semitic and Protestant resistance to religious images and to their creation of a disembodied and intellectualized religion and its associated fanaticism and repression.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The "abstracter superstitions" of this fanaticism, 

<b></b>

 he maintains elsewhere, are consistent with the way Jewish, Protestant, and Puritan traditions involve the "destruction of symbols" through the "prohibition of 'graven images'"; whereas only concrete images, in his view, can provide a bulwark against an "abstract and generic" mode of thought.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In what can only be called the anti-Semitic extremity of these views (which ignore on the one hand age-old Jewish traditions of Kaballistic iconography and on the other hand the danger of idolatry, in which images are allowed unqualified hegemony in intellectual discourse), clean art is everywhere threatened by the forces of usury and abstract analysis in a world dominated by the bombardier's destructiveness and by the invidious "iconoclasm" of what the <i>Corriere</i> called "plundering finance." And so, in his explicitly Fascist history of Western culture, Pound frames the struggle of Mussolini's Italy during the war as a contest not only against Allied barbarism but also against those cultural inclinations of the modern West that, in alliance with Jewish finance, would (in the words of another line in the Italian drafts) "distruggere i simboli del bel pensiero"--"destroy the 'symbols' of authentically creative thought."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The climax of Pound's Fascist Paradise occurs in the draft of an "Eliseo" ("Elysium") that invokes res of deceased lovers who are said, after "Donna mi prega," to be "formati"--that is, to have produced a "formato locho"--a "formed trace"--in the memory. Pound's language here is exceedingly odd, not just in its Italian expression but in its account of the relations between life and death. I quote from near the end of the poem: </p>

<p>Here, in the midst of an advancing host of the dead falling in April 1945 like snowflakes, newly spilt blood takes the lead--"il sangue sparso fa il conducente"--but Pound counsels his readers: "non cercate qui i nuovi ([i] vostri) morti / non son formati ancora"--"don't seek here for your own recently dead; they are not formed yet"--with the implication that only when the kiln of memory has shaped the dead into resonant images can they take their place with the muses of antiquity and inspire our faith in the future. Note also that the beloved dead call out here: "Qui sono"--"here we are," with the sense of "we are still here, the best parts of yourself, remaining to help you rebuild your life." And though in a belated afterthought the poem worries that their voices may be only siren songs, tempting Odysseus to return to the good old days, the draft ends on the note of "serenity" amid "slaughter" with an allusion to a line of Pound's "Homage to Sextus Propertius," which holds out hope for a living immortality, an "at[t]imo del gran respire" ("moment of the great breath").<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, then, in the formal opening that Pound appended to his "Eliseo," the "morti formati" are named as true muses. Their private histories remain (as in Cavalcanti) accidentals, but the love they inspire has become a site of illumination and the song they sing is strong enough to attract the sun and his fleet of planets to the plains of Italy. The following passage seems to be the last that Pound worked on before the war ended: </p>

4. Memory and <i>The Pisan Cantos</i>
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>With his long-meditated "Eliseo" still unfinished, on 1 May 1945 Pound found himself without warning abducted in Sant' Ambrogio by Italian partisans aware of his Fascist connections. Unexpectedly released, he then surrendered himself to the custody of the American army, whereupon the FBI interrogated him for several weeks in Genoa. Finally he was dispatched to solitary confinement in a small wire pen with a cement base (he called it "the gorilla cage") in the U.S. Army Disciplinary Training Center outside Pisa, to be held there until the U.S. government saw fit to proceed with a trial for treason. The Center harbored some soldiers turned real criminals, among them rapists and murderers. But the camp was also a rehabilitation center for soldiers convicted of lesser crimes, who were later returned to combat.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Pound remained there, just short of 60, for three weeks under a relentless sun alternating with the pelting rain and evening dampness of an Italian summer, eventually suffering symptoms that included "violent and hysterical terror," "claustrophobia," "confusion," and a temporary but "complete loss of memory"--signs that the camp doctors feared might be "premonitory" of a mental breakdown.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  (Later he told a psychiatrist that he felt "as thought the upper third of [his] brain were missing" and again that "[my] mainspring [had been] busted."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> ) </p>

<p>Because of his distress, around 1 July Pound was transferred to a tent in the camp's medical compound, where he was technically still forbidden to speak to fellow inmates but where he was allowed writing implements. At that point, the recent Italian drafts in his head but his identity wavering, he began once more to compose, this time in English. In Peter Makin's words, the substance "of the Pisan Cantos is, first, a simply cry of pain and, second, a naming--over of what has been known, sorrowing over the lost, and trying to find, in what is left, some hope-worthy meaning and reason to go on" (<i>PC</i>, 239). And so at the end of the first of the new poems, Canto 74, though Pound continues to draw on the technical account of memory in Aristotle and in "Donna mi prega," his utterance has taken on the urgency of a man saved at the last moment from drowning. Attributing his salvation to the power of memory, he depicts himself

<p>In this passage, "liquid" signifies a <i>form</i> associated first with the perception and the memory of the inexhaustible sea, then with the image of Aphrodite who rises out of it (in, for example, Botticelli's "The Birth of Venus"), and finally with an intelligible concept of Love itself--a neoplatonic vision of the unity of things in which we are "suddenly conscious of the reality of the <i>nous</i>, of mind, apart from any man's individual mind, of the sea crystalline and enduring, of the bright as it were molten glass that envelops us, full of light."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Having thus linked memory with the power of the forms it is invested in, Pound concludes that memory must be not simply an "accidental" quality of the mind, but an essential property of it, as Aristotle distinguishes accident from property in his "Topics." "A property," Aristotle holds, is "a predicate which does not indicate the essence of a thing, but yet belongs to that thing alone ... thus it is a property of man to be capable of learning grammar, for if A be a man, then he is capable of learning grammar, and if he be capable of learning grammar, he is a man." "An accident" on the other hand is "something which may possibly either belong or not belong to any one ... thing, as ... 'whiteness,' for there is nothing to prevent the same thing being at one time white, and at another not white." "Accident," Aristotle adds, is etymologically related to "what happens (<i>accidit</i>) to be true of [something]."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, then, as contemporary reviewers of <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> noticed, the salvific workings of memory help shape the suite's revolutionary poetic techniques--techniques that subsequently set a standard of poetic immediacy and influenced the most important poetry in the English language for the rest of the century. Pound acknowledges these revolutionary procedures in Canto 81, when he writes that to "break the pentameter that was the first heave" (C81/538) and more bluntly in a rude note to his publisher. Pound thought that his friend James Laughlin was paying too much attention to conventional page layout when he was preparing <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> for press in 1946 and admonished him: "God damn &amp; buggar the punctuation--the important thing is for the 1<sup>st</sup> time to emphasize the articulation of the thought."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  In <i>The Pisan Cantos</i>, that is, the work of recollection radically refashions grammar, rhythm, and lineation to render its intuitive forays and consolidations. Consider a short passage from Pound's Canto 74, which begins and ends taking note of a just-finished rain:

<p>Here, the sight of butterflies and the smell of mint sharpen Pound's imagination, causing his memory to associate the sparrows he notices with "Lesbia's sparrows" in Catullus IV and by implication with the goddess of love, Venus. In the scene in front of him, though, these small beauties are nearly overwhelmed by the stark reality of the camp, in which prisoners forbidden to speak occupy themselves with the sound of drumming and see only banners and guard towers (the latter just softened because Pound can perceive in them the shape of Chinese ideograms). The oppressiveness of all this drives Pound (shifting now to his adopted Italian) back into the past, where he remembers a rainy trip in Southern France, to Ussel and Ventadour. When, however, Pound recognizes that even his memory has been obstructed, the bleakness of his present situation begins to overshadow his recollection, and emblematically the gracious re of a French salesman whose name Pound is unable to recall answers a simple request with words of portentous sadness: "'No that is impossible.'" Frighteningly, Pound realizes that he has also forgotten the name of the city where this took place, and where he saw the primitive cave paintings; and the pain of his loss echoes in his disappointed statement that the paintings were less striking to his youthful incomprehension than postcards of them--a deficiency whose melancholy mirrors Pound's present confusion and seems as irremediable as his confinement. Apparently, neither in the future nor in memory is he likely to revisit "those old roads" again.  </p>

<p>Then, inexplicably and magically, he recollects the precious name of the keeper of the inn he was then staying in, and the force of this recovery (caught in a syntax that simultaneously and deliberately deploys her name both as something remembered and a call to her presence--"Mme Pujol"!) enters the inspiriting "smell of mint under the tent flaps / especially after the rain." It is in such quotidian scenes that Pound stages the renewal of his will to survive. Recently terrified that his breakdown-induced amnesia might mean the loss of what his wife would call "your self, the memories that make up yr. person," his recovery drives him to relive his life--as a boy in the suburbs of 

<b></b>

 Philadelphia and on the streets of New York; as a young man traveling with a beloved aunt on the grand tour of Europe; as a fledgling poet in the salons of Venice, London, and Paris, and backpacking on the roads of Provence; as a mature husband and lover in Venice and Rapallo; and as an aging man on the winding path up from Rapallo to its surrounding cliffs.  </p>

<p>As emphatic as it is, though, the brio Pound conveys in these passages does not mean that <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> have moved beyond the ideological and political concerns of his Italian drafts. In the opening of Canto 76 we find carried over from Pound's Italian "Eliseo" that "the sun in his great periplum" still "leads in his fleet here ... under our craggy cliffs," and that "la scalza" is still to be seen where the hillpath ascends, moaning "they have broken my house" (C76/472-73). The suite, that is, continues to inhabit the world in which "the barbarian storm [let loose by the iconoclasts] descended on [sacred] ground." </p>

<p>One could discount, of course, the vestiges of Fascist Italy in <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> by arguing that Pound, like Milton, came to believe that utopia cannot exist in the mixed motives of the political world and must be given up for "A paradise within thee, happier far."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup> But if we look at a passage from Canto 74 that is sometimes invoked to substantiate such a reading, we find no such resignation: </p>

<p>Pound here alludes to an African fable related by the German anthropologist Leo Frobenius that tells of the Fasa tribe and their city of Wagadu. The fable, "Gassire's Lute," explains that the city was four times destroyed and will someday be again rebuilt for the last time; it is, in the words of Carroll Terrell, "destined to live so forcefully in the minds of men that she will never be lost again."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  But, as the phrase "Italia tradita" ("betrayed Italy") implies, Pound's invocation of the tale affirms no transcendence of the politics of the world but rather that Italy's bricks and stones may be reconstructed in the faithfulness of our memory. </p>

<p>Not only in this passage, then, but everywhere in <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> "the descent of the iconoclasts" exhibited in images of European ruin drawn from the pages of the wartime <i>Corriere della Sera</i> is insisted on and then opposed by rehearsing the (now-destroyed) icons of Italian culture--"monuments" in which (and in the memory of which) the "history" of the culture has been "recorded." It is only through such "resurgent EIKONE ," Pound implies, that we can attain "Elysium" by apprehending the <i>form</i> through whose shaping power these monuments were created in the first 

<b></b>

 place. In "the whole of medieval philosophy," Pound comments, "every spiritual form sets in movement the bodies in which (or among which) it finds itself" and energy is a matter of the kind of "shape" that we see in "the rose that [a] magnet makes in the iron filings" (<i>LE</i>, 188, 154). </p>

<p>The culmination of this association of memory, form, and intuition in <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> can be found in the justly famous epiphany at the center of Canto 81, where Pound encounters a vision of Aphrodite within his tent. Suddenly able to extract the intelligible form of Love itself from the remembered presence of the eyes of a number of beloved women in Carneval masks, Pound, with the same sense of discovery he displayed in Canto 74 when he emphatically declared that "This liquid is certainly a / property of the mind," encounters the full form of Love and finds himself transported first to "the seen" and "then thus the palpable / Elysium, though it were in the halls of hell": </p>

<p class="continued">Pound's delight here is clear even if his terminology is obscured by the New Directions text, which altered Pound's typescript by changing the Greek word at the center of the passage into <img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek05.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="37" height="15" />, a participial form which Carroll Terrell glosses as a kind of presocratic "knowing" or "seeing."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Pound's typescript, however, indicates simply "EIDOS"--a transliteration of the standard Aristotelian word for form <img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek01.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="39" height="17" />. Pound's sense is signaled by the way that he contrasts "what thou lovest well" to "dross" (Aristotelian 

<b></b>

<img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek06.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="32" height="16" />, or unformed matter). His celebration of the power of form was reinforced on his typescript, where, in subsequently excised lines, he specifies that what is intended by "the full EIDOS" is "the <i>form</i> to / pass and intercross / each space full of its <i>formal life</i> / that moves and keeps defined / its clarity, demarcations" (emphasis mine).<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Pound's epiphany, in other words, corresponds to an apprehension of a formal pattern that reveals the shaping power of "<i>nous</i>, of mind, apart from any man's individual mind." Because memory is central to apprehension, Pound insists, the recollection of that which we have loved and understood gives us access to such light no matter what horrors have overtaken us. The rest is truly dross, as it is unrelated to the EIDOS of Love which grounds all meaning and whose presence Pound has newly apprehended in the most wretched of prisons.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Canto 81 goes on to hold that this "Elysium" is one that sustains the courage, order, and grace of "scaled invention or true artistry" (C81/541) and so links with Paradise the two senses of icon that Pound had implied in the phrase "resurgent EIKONE "--the sense of a remembered likeness and the sense of a formed image in which history inheres. As Pound had intended since he started to think about writing a Paradise in the early 1930s, then, this "Elysium" exists "dove sta memoria"--"where memory liveth," for it arises, in Peter Makin's words, only when "the original passion was strong," that is, only by loving well can we contemplate the essential shapes of the world (<i>PC</i>, 186). But from the above account of the origins of the suite in wartime Italy, it should be clear that <i>The Pisan Cantos</i>' grand synthesis of memory and love implies more than that. Canto 81's "Elysium," after all, grew directly out of the Italian 1945 "Eliseo" draft in which icons of memory include not only lost loves but also "morti" amid "il sangue sparso"--the dead associated with the spilt blood of Fascism. No less than in Canto 73, where the voice of Guido Cavalcanti himself trumpets faith in the Fascist movement, the Cavacanti-like understanding of memory in <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> is inextricably linked with the imperatives announced in the <i>Corriere della Sera</i> in the last days of Mussolini to remember "il sangue Italiano" and to condemn the Allied and Jewish "iconoclasts" who have descended upon the sacred ground of Italy. </p>

<p><i>The Pisan Cantos</i>, that is to say, present us with a celebration of the process of recollection that is both dazzling and irredeemably compromised. On the one hand, the techniques Pound devised to articulate recollective immediacy were so successful that they were taken up by several generations of American poets, beginning with Robert Lowell and Charles Olson and culminating in the vogue for confessional poetry of the following decades. On the other, Pound clearly intended, beginning in the Italian drafts of 1944-45, to present an "arte monda"--a "clean" art deliberately purified of the commercial and abstract practices of Semitic "iconoclasm." The Fascist orientation of this desire continues to pervade <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> and remains firmly rooted in the ideological passions of the last year of the Second World War. It is the final irony of this story that in the way he theorized his "resurgent EIKONE " Pound may have violated the deepest truth of his own vision. After all, based on the proposition that contemporary history is not visible to its contestants under the aspect of eternity, he had admonished the potential readers of "Eliseo" not to seek in Elysium images from the 

<b></b>

 just-spilt blood of the war ("il sangue sparso fa il conducente / non cercate qui i nuovi ([i] vostri) morti") because the significance of the dead will not have been formed yet ("non son formati ancora"). Yet in <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> he himself continued to allude to "300 years culture at the mercy of a tack hammer / thrown thru the roof" (C74/454) and to associate his earthly paradise as much with the memory of Fascism's recent martyrs as with the muse-like res once loved by the gods and heroes of antiquity and by Pound himself in his youth. </p>

Avicenna like Aristotle holds that memory retains perceptions for the uses of cogitation. However, he also maintains that a second kind of memory consists of a "perfect disposition" to "reestablish conjunction with the active intellect vis a vis the given thought" . In this sense, memory not only prepares a formed trace, it also functions as an essential bridge to the world of perfect form. In the words of Davidson, translating Avicenna: "Images are transformed into universal concepts 'not in the sense that they are themselves transported from the imagination to the human intellect ... but in the sense that examining them prepares the soul for the abstract concept to emanate upon it from the active intellect'" .  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT22" href="#REF22">22</a>. See Ernst Breisach, <i>Caterina Sforza: A Renaissance Virago</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967). Breisach alludes not only to Guicciardini but to contemporary sources for the story (including Machiavelli's letters to the rulers of Florence, which reported that she said something much ruder: "che ne aveva piena la fica"--"that her cunt was full of them [children]"). But he adds that the story was probably exaggerated at the time: more likely, he explains, "Caterina entered the fortress and took command of it. Once inside ... [when her enemies] hinted that such a betrayal would lead to the murder of her children, Caterina shouted at them the lie that a new infant was just now growing in her body and the obvious truth that she could always remarry and produce others. The castellan on his part added that after a murder of the children he would level the town with artillery bombardments and that the duke of Milan would seek some vengeance of his own. Then Caterina celebrated her escape with a festive dinner" . For an overview of Caterina Sforza's life that Pound probably read, see also G.F. Young, <i>The Medici</i> (New York: Random House, 1930), 509-30.

The citation in the original in Italian explicitly attacks "gli iconoclasti": "Parlero in un altro articolo della distruzione dei simboli; cioe di ogni forma di comunicazione che induce lo studioso all' indagine deliberata e contemplativa dei fatti che non si puo comunicare con una frase astratta e generica. Questa battaglia data non solamente dal tempo degli iconoclasti, data dal divieto di fare 'immagini scolpite.'"

Compare the Italian original ("Carta da visita" 1942) of "A Visiting Card": "Nella storia troviamo due forze: una che divide, spezza ed ammazza, l'altra che che contempla l'unita del mistero ... Una forza distrugge ogni simbolo rato, e trascina l'uomo nelle discussioni astratte: cosi distruggendo non una, ma ogni religione" in Ezra Pound, <i>Opere Scelte</i>, ed. Mary de Rachewiltz (Milan: Mondadori, 1970), 1367. See also the citation from <i>Idee fondamentali</i>, in fn.30, where Pound contends that the Semitic elements of Christianity associated with the Church's turn toward usury in the age of the Medici have caused a "distruzione dei simboli" because of a faith and a way of speaking that is "astratta e generica" ("abstract and generic") rather than concrete . </p>

<p><a name="FOOT32" href="#REF32">32</a>. See "Homage to Sextus Propertius. VII": "To-day we take the great breath of lovers, / to-morrow fate shuts us in." It is worth noting that the translation presents a very Poundian textual crux. As K. K. Ruthven notes, it comes from the problematic Latin of Propertius II.15, which Pound takes as 

<b></b>

 "magnum spiramus amantes" but which others read as "magnum speramus amantes," changing the sense altogether (Loeb: "so that we that love and whose hopes are high"). It is out of this textual knot that Pound derives a formula for epiphany of the highest order. (K. K. Ruthven, <i>A Guide to Ezra Pound's "Personae" </i> [Berkeley: University of California Press, 1969], 110-11.)  </p>
