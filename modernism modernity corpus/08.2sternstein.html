<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At his coterie's gatherings, Kafka was well known for laughing out
loud during the readings of his tales--and being the only one to do
so. He reportedly laughed at the most inopportune moments, moments of
the greatest torment to his hero, of the bleakest hour, moments of the
most grotesque and exquisite torture to his hero's psyche and body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A Kafka who laughs out loud at his own terrifying story, who laughs not
nervously but vigorously, is hardly recognizable to us, schooled as we are
on modernist readings of his voice. By this modernist cast he is inactive,
sad, despondent, drifting in a universe abandoned by God, pessimistic,
sullen--in short, unfunny. Yet Slavoj  Zizek demonstrates that
"Kafka's problem is, on the contrary, that in this universe God is <I>too
present</I> in the guise of various obscene, nauseous phenomena. Kafka's
universe is a world in which God . . . has gotten too close to us."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  If God is not focally absent in Kafka, then His proximity and fullness
  as ironic interlocutor in conversation with humanity offers the
  possibility of the ultimate and strange solace of irony. For Milan
  Kundera, Kafka devot&eacute; and countryman, the craft of the novel
  is that of irony. He considers the novel consubstantial with irony,
  and the wisdom of the novel the full reverberation of God's laughter
  at man thinking. "There is a fine Jewish proverb," he writes:

Man thinks, God laughs. Inspired by that adage, I like to imagine
that Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais heard God's laughter one day, and thus
was born the idea of the first great European novel. It pleases me to
think that the art of the novel came into the world as the echo of God's
laughter. But why does God laugh at the sight of

<B></B>

man thinking? Because man thinks and the truth escapes him. Because the
more men think, the more one man's thought diverges from another's. And
finally, because man is never what he thinks he is.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Old Testament is replete with the <I>proximal</I> ironies of a
God-interlocutor, the laughter of a God exceedingly close to humanity:
Job thinks and the truth escapes him; Adam and Eve are beloved and
are exiled; Moses leads his exodus but is not given to see the fruit
of freedom; Abraham, willing to sacrifice his son, is exempted from
demonstrating this willingness. None of these laugh at God's ways. But
what of Sarah? Sarah does laugh at God's ironies--and is not punished.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Three men appear to Abraham (some exegetical remarks cite them as angels,
some as God triumvirate); and they ask him,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
"Where is your wife Sarah?" And he replied, "There, in the tent." Then
one said, "I will return to you when life is due and your wife Sarah
shall have a son!" Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which
was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years; Sarah
had stopped having the periods of women. And Sarah laughed to herself,
saying, "Now that I am withered, am I to have enjoyment--with my husband
so old?" Then the LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying,
'Shall I in truth bear a child, old as I am?' Is anything too wondrous
for the LORD? I will return to you at the time that life is due, and
Sarah shall have a son." [Gen. 18:9-14; my translation]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sarah's beauty was legendary but it was barren: she remained childless
until the fulfillment of God's (laughable) promise that she would be
"a mother of nations" (Gen. 17:16). Old as she and Abraham were--she in
her 90s, he a centenarian--she gave birth to the promised son. Sarah's
doubt of God (giving her maidservant Hagar to Abraham as a surrogate
mother, she enterprisingly fulfills God's promise <I>for</I> Him) is
often cited as the center of this tale. Yet Sarah is not punished for
her lapse of faith; she is not scolded for her skeptical laughter, her
gallows humor. She is instead rewarded. She laughs (<I>va-titzchak</I>)
and it is her gift: "Sarah remarked, 'God has prepared laughter for me;
everyone who hears of it will laugh with me" (Gen. 21:6). Her laughter
is embodied forever in God's award of Isaac (<I>Vitzchak</I>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tale of Sarah is often eclipsed by that of Abraham. It is sometimes
treated as a tale of prophetic onomastics, of the iconicity of Isaac's
naming; it is more accurately treated as a tale of irony, the tale
Kundera in his <I>Book of Laughter and Forgetting</I> tells between the
lines. This novel seems, on its surface, to bypass the biblical in its
comprehensive ironies. But the careful reader with an appropriately rich
"meditative background" (Kundera's term) will note an Old Testament echo
in the love and longing that the character Mr. Kundera has for "Sarah,
the Jewish girl, Sarah my sister." Perhaps her existence somewhere will
countermand the angels' "fearsome laughter." The devils, on the other
hand, laugh joyously, incipiently, devilishly at the angels who are the
arbiters of world order.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  The devils' laughter exceeds order and suits, as much as Kundera might
  deny it, the revelry in ambiguity that Zizek proposes
  is Kafka's.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Still, Kundera has done much to recuperate Kafka's jocundity, his very
real comedic touch.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  Irony is often, strangely, penned away from comedy or the humorous;
  but in

<B></B>

Kafka, it is uproariously funny. His comic tragic res are those of
Job, Prometheus, Christ, Adam, and Satan, the exiled angel. His laugh,
like Sarah's, incorporates all the semantic field of laughability: joy,
absurdity, irony, mockery. In turn, God's laughter--Isaac--fixes meaning
as an end of interpretation. Sarah's laugh dwells in the moment; God's
incorporates a moment into the universe of meaning.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka would likely have laughed robustly at the very moment in his "In the
Penal Colony" that the spike is driven through the officer's head. But how
is Kafka funny to himself and so unfunny to modern sensibilities? Does
the spike undo the machine of interpretation? Is that a moment when the
text becomes "a coagulated, stigmatized, signifying chain repelling
signification with an excess of sticky enjoyment?" (<I>LA</I> 151)
These questions require an exploration of the effect of gesture in
Kafka's writing, specifically in order to expose laughter itself as a
gesture--a resistance of--and to--interpretation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the second of December, 1914, at one of the regular salon meetings of
Kafka's writers group--a group including Max Brod, Franz Werfel, and Otto
Pick--Kafka read "In the Penal Colony" aloud. Famously dissatisfied with
his own writings, he was noncharacteristically "easy" on his latest work:
"am not entirely dissatisfied," he recorded in his diary, "except for
its glaring and ineradicable faults."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  But what follows in the diary is of even greater relevance to an
  inquiry into gesture:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Werfel read some poems and two acts of <I>Esther, Kaiserin von</I> P<I>ersien.</I> The acts carry one away. But I am easily carried
away. The criticisms and comparisons put forward by Max, who was not
entirely satisfied with the piece, disturb me, and I am no longer so sure
of my impression of the play as a whole as I was while listening to it,
when it overwhelmed me. I remember the Yiddish actors. W.'s handsome
sisters. The elder one leaned against the chair, often looked at the
mirror out of the corner of her eye, and then--as if she were not already
devoured by my eyes--gently pointed a finger to a brooch pinned on her
blouse. It was a low-cut dark blue blouse, her throat was covered with
a tulle scarf. Repeated accounting of something that happened at the
theatre: some officers kept saying to each other in a loud voice during
<I>Kabale und Liebe</I>: "Speckbacher is cutting a re," by which they
were referring to an officer who was leaning beside a box. [<I>D</I> 319]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka's recollection of his first experience with the Yiddish theatre
shows an obsession with gesture. Elsewhere in the diaries, he takes
detailed notes on the history of Yiddish theatre, including its important
dates and plays and politics. The Jewish theatre disturbed Kafka:
he felt alien to it but heard in it too his own internal voice. This
ambivalence expresses ambivalence about his own identity. Further, it
is clear from the diary entries that the cabaret quality, the stylized
movements, and the almost circus-like mannerism resonated with his own
sense of the secret life of things.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The theatre of gestures--Kafka's unique emblem--makes his work at once
so naturalistic and terribly difficult to translate to the stage. His
scenes are essentially performative: his depictions of sex, for example,
are always public, with someone watching and often annotating. The
voyeurism in every expectedly "intimate" moment is a hallmark of his
burlesques. Gazes are constantly interpenetrating. His matrices of arms

<B></B>

and legs and eyes, ears and fingers and hair--a world where human
limbs sport minds of their own--are more complexes of interiority
than characters' "thoughts." The secret life of things and their
self-appointments on the world stage are of the utmost importance in the
fate of man. This common language of gesture afforded Kafka pleasure in
the theatre in general, and in the Yiddish theatre in particular. To
acknowledge the common bond between his stylizations and the Yiddish
theatre's <I>kabuki</I> is to uncover the language of gesture so
fundamental to an understanding of Kafka's fiction and phenomenology.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka's fictive worlds are worlds of things. Gestures--the language
of the sensate body--play off one another in his tales as they do in
the stylized choreography of Yiddish theatre. In this fashion they
establish a discrete dialogue with the reader outside of speech (if
not outside of semiotics) that exploits the reader's ability to sense
"meaning" rather than translate it. Take, for example, the rosy, whorled
wound of the patient in "A Country Doctor": the worms bore within the
folds of flesh and skin as they burrow, they cannot help but elicit a
<I>felt</I> repulsion, even nausea in the reader. Such metaphysicians
aside, his tales are told of, by, and about the body as a phenomenon. The
noumenal realm is inserted a posteriori by those who would have Kafka's
wounds invoke the divine rather than the Real. To quote again from the
same diary entry (where Kafka quotes from Werfel's play <I>Esther</I>):
"God's masterpieces fart at one another in the bath" (<I>D</I> 319). An
essential mockery and laughter is entailed in the events on the stage of
the world. If we can take Gustav Janouch at his word, Kafka's saying,
there is hope, plenty of hope, just not for us, but for God, then why
couldn't farting be the discourse we own, our freedom of speech?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dominant readings of Kafka have dwelt on his pervasive obsession with
guilt (father-son, employer-employee, native-alien) and have associated
his genius with shame. In this context his radical performativity is
also elided, for shame is fundamentally performative--communal, public,
relational--in a way that guilt typically is not. A truly radical reading
of Kafka, then, must underscore the equally important (if not <I>more</I>
important) interest in the performance of a collective shame--a shame that
includes his own. "In the Penal Colony," notorious for its description
of the inscription of sin and redemption directly upon the flesh of the
condemned, is a document of shame written upon the body politic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The story of Kafka, as told by literary historians and as embedded in
the popular imagination, perfectly embodies Northrop Frye's descriptive
poetics of pathos. We tend to read it as God's pathetic narrative. Note
how in encyclopedia entries and book jacket blurbs alike Kafka's story
is consistently conflated with that of Josef K--"a tragedy basted with
pathos"--with apologies made for any hint of his "social affability."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Forcing the author into a sort of irresistible victimhood, we have made
  him, pace Sander Gilman, society's patient. But Kafka was no thorough
  hermit; he was intimate with the most outspoken members of Prague's
  social scene. His affair with Milena Jesensk&aacute; was not a staid
  courtship with a retiring and discreet young lady but a tumultuous
  affair with one of Prague's most noteworthy citizens. Milena was but
  one of his

<B></B>

liberated lovers, a "new woman" and a socialist as well. A pioneering and
politically radical journalist, the pomp of Jesensk&aacute;'s aristocratic
pedigree was matched by her desire to sully it. Dora Dymant, Kafka's
last lover, was also, by no accident, a socialist activist.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hannah Arendt has said that what concerned Kafka most was not metaphysical
justice or absolute moral requirement but "a world constructed by people,
in which the actions of man depend on nothing but himself and his own
spontaneity and in which human society is ruled by laws established
by men."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  In underlining his humanity, she subverts the image that has dominated
  his reception from the inception of his friendship with Brod. Kundera
  takes Brod to task, in the essay "The Castrating Shadow of Saint
  Garta," for the dissemination of the sanctified Kafka image (<I>TB</I>
  35-53).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  But it is not Brod's culpability in an inchoate crime that matters most
  here. There is a humanism that we can attribute to Kafka's "laughter":
  though qualified by God's ironies, Kafka's humor indicts and comforts
  laterally; it is concerned with "us." It is in this engagement with the
  human condition, and the use of irony to illuminate this condition, that
  Kafka ranks with the likes of Shakespeare. His ironic humor is directed
  at the social order and individual claims in that order. His sympathetic
  irony does not alienate; it supports a restoration of human compassion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Irony frequently enters scenes of pathos in Kafka's work. His "heroes"
are scorned and isolated, then suddenly and inexplicably embraced and
adored, often by individuals who are scorned or isolated themselves. The
intense longing he shows for affection ironically thrusts him further
away from the object of his desire (recall the acute longing Gregor Samsa
expresses for the photograph of the woman in fur). The officer is finally
freed--neither transcendentally nor immanently but <I>actually</I> by the
machine that he adores in his explanation, "Guilt," as in Kafka's world,
"is never to be doubted."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's reading of "In the Penal Colony" and its body in pain are
informed by a modernist mission and he places more emphasis on guilt
(interiority) than on shame (exteriority). The exquisite wounds carved
on the soldier become a battleground between "those in power" and those
subservient to it. The inscription in the flesh is a portal to the
discovery of one's own (perhaps universal) guilt:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
an archaic apparatus . . . engraves ornate letters on the backs of guilty
men, multiplying the cuts and increasing the ornamentation to the point
where the back of the guilty man becomes clairvoyant, able itself to
discover the writing from whose letters it must learn the name of its
unknown guilt. It is, then, the back upon which this is incumbent.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet an alternate reading can employ the same descriptors to a variant
conclusion. If the project of those in power is to fix the language of the
Law onto the body of its citizens, to make it legible, Kafka's is to force
this eminent "legibility" into "overexposure," which then "blocks every
essay of interpretation." The struggle for signification--the officer's
and the reader's--is laughable. What better language to defy paradigmatic
signification than that of bodily praxis? This code of gesture, of bodily
signs and postures, is Kafka's foremost language. It is one Benjamin
not only noticed, praised, and analysed, but also criticized for its
sometimes pathetic essentialism in his 1934

<B></B>

essay on the significance of the Kafkan gesture. For him, the allegory of
Kafka's tales cannot be apprehended through the conventional complex of
symbolic correspondences: Kafka's artistic force and vision lie within
the "codex of gestures" and it is from here any understanding of his
work must begin. The codex of gestures is one necessarily located in
the body; no surprise then that Kafka is so concerned with the body's
material potential for pain, wounding, breakage, and amputation. Pain,
wounding, and decampment of the body are natural, if extreme, issues of a
desire to restore the body to memory--to re-member the body--that recalls
Benjamin's phrase, "the most forgotten alien land is one's own body."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  Benjamin senses a failure unspectacular in Kafka's gestural lexicon:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In the mirror which the prehistoric world held before him in the form of
guilt [Kafka] saw the future emerging in the form of a judgment. But he
did not say what it was like. Kafka could understand things <I>only</I>
in the form of a <I>gestus,</I> but he could not understand this
<I>gestus</I> itself. In Kafka, narrative thus regains the significance
it had in the mouth of Scheherazade: to postpone the future.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But this failure to unravel the full meaning of the <I>gestus</I> is the
crucial moment of his postmodernity and as such the "procedure seems to
us much more subversive than the usual modernist one, because the latter,
by not showing the Thing, leaves open the possibility of grasping [its]
central emptiness"--a process much more terrifying and liberating,
and perhaps joyful, than the exposure of lack alone (<I>LA</I>
144-5). For Deleuze and Guattari, Kafka is less interested in
"presenting the image of an unknowable law" than in "dissecting the
mechanism" of the machines that use the idea of Law to set themselves
in motion. "Because it has no object of knowledge," the machine is not
the Law; "the law is operative only in being stated and stated only
in the act of punishment: a statement directly inscribed on the real,
on the body and the flesh."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  The punishment inscribed on the victim's flesh is a practical
  application of the Law, a shaming. Transcendence, proscribed or
  anticipated, has less to do with the sacrosanct character of the Law
  than with its vacuous need to be made meaningful by such gestures.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The pleasure the officer receives from his machine is well suited to
the relish with which he describes it to the explorer; the story is as
much about the ritual violence of <I>language</I> as the ritual violence
of <I>punishment</I>:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
"I don't know," said the officer, "if the Commandant has already
explained this apparatus to you." [. . .] "It consists, as you see,
of three parts. In the course of time each of these parts has acquired
a kind of popular nickname. The lower one is called the Bed, the upper
one the Designer and this one here in the middle that moves up and down
is called the Harrow. ["IPC" 193]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The apparatus itself is compared, ironically, to instruments of
healing--"You will have seen similar apparatuses in hospitals; but in our
Bed the movements are all precisely calculated" ("IPC" 196)--and we can
be certain that Kafka's ironic insertion is not lost on us. The apparatus
<I>is</I> meant to heal. But it cannot: the machine of interpretation
fails and succeeds simultaneously. Kafka's narrative keeps the wound open.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The practice of circumcision and the archaic and ornate instruments used
to write one's faith on one's body are not thematically distant from
Kafka's ironized machinery of interpretation. As inscriptions on the body
are marks of community, so one's "guilt" (understood as the aftereffect
of a transgression) may be written on the body as shame. While alienating
one from the community one has betrayed, wounds inflicted by the machine
of the Law on the individual body underscore the individual's essential
communal existence. Inscriptions on the body, that alien territory,
are designed to reconcile the individual with his community; but this
gestural language of community, written quite literally <I>on the
body,</I> individual and social, has forgotten its significance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For all the guilt in Kafka's tale--and this may be a function of the
explorer's role as witness and the narrative's tone--there is also a deep
sense of the power, putatively "healing" and hygienic, of shame. After
all, the prisoner, and ultimately, the officer-<I>cum</I>-victim,
are meant to learn their transgression by reading it upon their back,
a feat possible only through the sense of touch, not vision:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Many questions were troubling the explorer, but at the sight of the
prisoner he asked only: "Does he know his sentence?" "No," said the
officer, eager to go on with his exposition, but the explorer interrupted
him, "He doesn't know the sentence that has been passed on him?" "No,"
said the officer again, pausing a moment as if to let the explorer
elaborate his question, and then said: "There would be no point in
telling him. He'll learn it on his body." ["IPC" 197]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Knowledge (and self-knowledge) is penetrative and rapaciously violating.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In an early letter dating from January 1904 to his friend Oskar
Poll&aacute;k, Kafka explains in a language of physical violence the
effect that writing should have on us:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
it's good when your conscience receives big wounds, because that makes
it more sensitive to every twinge. I think we ought to read only the
kind of books that wound and stab us. If the book we're reading doesn't
wake us with a blow on the head, what are we reading it for?
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The import of the body in dialogue also helps explain the frequency
of nakedness in Kafka's tales. For obvious reasons, the prisoner must
be naked to have his crime inscribed onto his body, but the nakedness
of the officer, prior to his "self-sacrifice," stands in a different
relation to the machine of Law than does the practical assignment of
the prisoner's naked body:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In spite of the obvious haste with which he was discarding first his
uniform and then all his clothing, he handled each garment with loving
care, he even ran his fingers caressingly over the silver lace on the
jacket and shook a tassel into place. This loving care was certainly out
of keeping with the fact that as soon as he had a garment off he flung
it at once with a kind of unwilling jerk into the pit. ["IPC" 220]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The officer's ritualized striptease is uncannily funny--in each gesture
of the shedding of the garment lies the significance of the rite. The
officer performs his last act as

<B></B>

though on stage for an audience long gone (the ladies' gift of stale
handkerchiefs comes instead of their presence). His reabsorption into the
machine is literally equivalent to writing his own finale, the "Be just"
sign on his body is a desperate and violent way to return the body into
the communal realm, and so to restore community.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But something goes terribly wrong: "The Harrow was not writing, it was
only jabbing, and the Bed was not turning the body over but only bringing
it up quivering against the needles. The explorer wanted to do something,
if possible to bring the whole machine to a standstill, for this was no
exquisite torture such as the officer desired, this was plain murder"
("IPC" 224). And it is now that the machinery lives a life of its own,
apparently also struggling to fulfill its duty to the Law: "The Harrow
tried to move back to its old position, but as if it had itself noticed
that it had not yet got rid of its burden it stuck after all where it was,
over the pit" (ibid.). The explorer races to help but it is too late:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And here, almost against his will he had to look at the face of the
corpse. It was as it had been in life; no sign was visible of the promised
redemption; what the others had found in the machine the officer had
not found; the lips were firmly pressed together, the eyes were open,
with same expression as in life, the look was calm and convinced,
through the forehead went the point of a great iron spike. ["IPC" 224-5]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Penetrative knowledge indeed, but not exquisite transcendence. The tale's
conclusion is anticlimactic, but this suits a reading of inscription--all
writing and reading--as violent. The explorer returns to the "teahouse"
where he finds the grave of the Old Commandant. The laborers there
push their chairs aside, as though changing sets, so that the hidden
gravestone's inscription becomes visible. The explorer's suppliant pose
as he reads--Kafka's language of gestures again--indicates an impulse
to knowledge that is choreographed by power relations:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It was a simple stone, low enough to be covered by a table. There was an
inscription on it in very small letters, the explorer had to kneel down
to read it. This was what it said: "Here rests the old Commandant. His
adherents, who now must be nameless, have dug this grave and set up
this stone. There is a prophecy that after a certain number of years
the Commandant will rise again and lead his adherents from this house
to recover the colony. Have faith and wait!" ["IPC" 226]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The bystanders meet the inscription with amusement. The explorer only
restores the table and departs. What are we to make of this final
inscription in a story of the violence of inscription? The violence of
the prophecy written in stone, the body of the world, is clear. But
even the promise of final judgment--the future itself--is written in
the body of the world, buried, hidden, and ridiculed (as it is written,
so it shall be). The violence of living it out is inescapable: "They
could have jumped in the boat but the explorer lifted a heavy knotted
rope from the floor boards, threatened them with it, and so kept them
from attempting the leap" ("IPC" 227). The inscription virtually written
into the earth in this alien territory is left to be articulated. The
ferryman rows off with the explorer.

The conclusion allows nothing of the penal colony on board the departing
ship. The officer has been stilled forever in the machine as the
explorer is trapped forever in his alterity (home is not a possibility)
and the historical narrative of the island's inhabitants written in
the Old Commandant's gravestone. With the final--suspended--gesture of
departure, "In the Penal Colony" is about only itself, resisting symbolic
"interpretation" and underscoring the territorial (bodily) violation of
the machine. Conventional, sanctifying, readings of Kafka have long made
metaphors of his life and works. Yet he begs to be read by the body, to
be felt like the spike through the forehead. Whose back fails to arch
(involuntarily) as the machine inscribes its Law? But as gruesomely
performative as the narrative is, it is also funny at the gut-level. The
reader is caught in a community of convulsion and comedy, not unlike
Kafka himself was caught standing in the shadows of the Yiddish theater,
unmindfully slapping his thigh in laughter. The reader abandons the colony
with the explorer, orphaning the story to a fatal distillation--but not
without a final incredulous laugh from Kafka's Sarah at the irony of
this ineluctable end.

Jesensk&aacute;'s and Dymant's and, for that matter, Felice Bauer's own
accomplishments have too long been overshadowed by their relationships
with Kafka; their names are inextricable from his and literary history
has thus killed their stories where his ends. Derek Sayer makes some
admirable amends for Jesensk&aacute; in <I>The Coasts of Bohemia.</I>

Here too Kundera implies that by aligning Kafka/Nowy with Buddha,
Moses and Christ, Brod writes Kafka's hagiography. I agree, and yet
the fault may lie in with a misconception of "sainthood," a failure to
honor the humor of the Buddha, of Christ, or of the Torah, rather than in
"sanctifying" Kafka.
