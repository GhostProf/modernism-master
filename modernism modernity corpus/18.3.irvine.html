<h1 class="sec-headA">Modernist Dialectics</h1>
<p>
	Few would dispute the assessment of A. M. Klein as a second-generation, late-modernist Canadian author and critic who took an obsessive interest in Joyce’s modernism in particular and who more broadly adapted to an Anglo-Jewish context the densely allusive and elliptical style of the first-generation European and American modernists to his later poetry and prose fiction of the mid-1930s to the early 1950s. Even so, that critical portrait largely overlooks two interlocked phases in Klein’s modernism that deserve particular notice: his work from 1938 to 1955 as editor of and contributor to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Jewish Chronicle</span> (1914–66) and his contributions from March 1944 to 1947 as an editor or poet to the little magazines <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> (1942–45), <span style="font-style:italic;">First Statement</span> (1942–45), and <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Review</span> (1945–54). These phases coincide with his shift away from traditional prosodies and literary forms toward the innovative aesthetic modes of modernism. The first phase was initiated by his employment by Hirsh Wolofsky’s Eagle Publishing Company as editor of its Montreal-based English-language weekly paper; the second by his editorial collaborations—first with members of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group (Patrick and Peggy Anderson, F. R. Scott, P. K. Page, Neufville and Kit Shaw, and Bruce Ruddick) and those of the <span style="font-style:italic;">First Statement</span> group (John Sutherland, Irving Layton, and Louis Dudek), and later with both groups when the two magazines merged in 1945 to form <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Review</span>.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	These phases I correlate with two intersected dispositions in Klein’s authorial and editorial practice, namely the Jewish-Canadian diasporic modernism of his <span style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Jewish Chronicle</span> period and, as an Anglo-Canadian variant on the modernist poetics of diaspora, the postcolonial modernism of his <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> period. The dialectical interrelation of his diasporic and postcolonial modernisms is, I think, key to understanding the ways in which Klein’s editorial consciousness of specific social and political contexts in periodical cultures shaped the dissemination of his modernist aesthetic practices. While the Anglo-Montreal context of <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> leant toward the localized national and socialist politics of an incipient postcolonial modernism in Canada, the Anglo-Jewish Montreal context of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Jewish Chronicle</span> was tied to the globalized politics of an emergent diasporic modernism that addressed the transnational histories of Zionism, the Holocaust, and the state of Israel. For Klein, the politics of postcoloniality was but a local concern subsumed under the global politics of the Jewish diaspora. These social and political orientations thus direct my investigation of the periodical cultures in which Klein formed his modernist practices as an editor and author.
      </p>
<p>
	To situate Klein within the dialectics of postcoloniality and diaspora is to return to the scene of Anglo-Montreal modernism in the 1940s and its incitement of the so-called native-cosmopolitan debate. According to the original terms of the debate, as articulated by A. J. M. Smith in the introduction to his 1943 anthology, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Book of Canadian Poetry</span>, the nativist poets “attempted to describe and interpret whatever is essentially and distinctively Canadian,” and the cosmopolitan poets attempted “to transcend colonialism by entering into the universal, civilizing culture of ideas.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Conjoining two keywords of the period, the native-cosmopolitan dialectic has frequently offered a ready-made theoretical nomenclature, but one that has been mobilized too often and uncritically in the interests of one or the other side of the debate. Because the significations of this dialectic oscillate throughout the 1940s, I want to insist that that these keywords—native and cosmopolitan—denote <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> colonial and postcolonial orientations. In other words, the terms of the native-cosmopolitan debate represent a kind of shorthand for an interrelated set of colonial-postcolonial cultural formations. In my reading the native-cosmopolitan debate is a sign of Canadian literary culture in transition from colonial to postcolonial positionings. There is no unilateral linkage between nativism and postcolonialism or between cosmopolitanism and colonialism, or vice versa. This terminological indeterminacy is a marker of the transitional movement within Canadian modernism of the 1940s from a colonial to a postcolonial literary culture. By dismantling the binaries of the native-cosmopolitan dialectic, it may be seen that postcolonial modernism incorporates overlapping definitions of the native and the cosmopolitan, and that this overlap corresponds to a contested site within Canadian modernist literary culture, where the narrative of a residual colonialism is interrupted by an emergent postcolonialism.
      </p>
<p>
	At the same time that Klein participated in an incipient postcolonial modernism in Montreal, he articulated a globalized poetics as a Jewish writer who saw himself in the context of a diasporic modernism.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> James Clifford’s notion of diaspora as a “traveling term”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> is apposite to Klein’s modernism, especially as it functions in his 1951 novel,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>. This is a traveling text not just because of its hybridized form and itinerant narrator’s transnational narrative but also because of the textual migrations involved in its transmission history. According to Clifford, the process of “displacement and transplantation” in “diaspora cultures” represents “specific, often violent, histories of economic, political, and cultural interaction—histories that generate what might be called <span style="font-style:italic;">discrepant</span> cosmopolitanisms.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> If, as Charles W. Pollard argues, the correlation of diaspora cultures and discrepant cosmopolitanism “essentially restates and reorients the modernist ideal, an ideal that recognizes the fragmentation and diversity of any contemporary culture but also seeks to bring those fragments together to form new, provisional, and transnational cultural wholes,”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> it follows that the discrepancies and contradictions that emerge at points of intercultural contact and exchange correspond to expressions of “cultural collage and incongruity” that Clifford makes explicit comparisons to when referencing “<span style="font-style:italic;">modernist</span> art and poetry.”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Klein’s diasporic modernism manifests itself in what Rebecca L. Walkowitz would call his “cosmopolitan style,” his signature bricolage of multiple and divergent genres, modes, and languages.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Because his cosmopolitanism is always dialectical, his modernism articulates the discrepant and contradictory conjuncture of Israeli and diasporic cultures. Although it would be overreaching to assert precise homologies between Klein’s conceptions of diasporic and Israeli cultures and of cosmopolitanism and nativism in Canadian modernism, there is no doubt that these defining literary and cultural narratives of the period are contiguous in his mind and, more concretely, his columns for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Jewish Chronicle</span>. As with the indeterminacies of a postcolonial modernism, there are no absolute alignments of nativism with Israel or cosmopolitanism with diaspora, or vice versa. Just as Klein sought to articulate a dialectical relationship between diaspora and Israel, so he expressed a vision of modernist literature in Canada that correlated both native and cosmopolitan orientations.
      </p>
<p>
	Against universalist conceptions of cosmopolitanism, “counter-cosmopolitanisms”—theorized in recent years by an interdisciplinary cast of thinkers such as Kwame Anthony Appiah, Homi Bhabha, James Clifford, David Harvey, David Held, Bruce Robbins, Boaventura de Sousa Santos, and many others—have been “variously described as ‘rooted,’ ‘situated,’ ‘actually existing,’ ‘discrepant,’ ‘vernacular,’ ‘Christian,’ ‘bourgeois,’ ‘liberal,’ ‘postcolonial,’ ‘feminist,’ ‘proletarian,’ ‘subaltern,’ ‘ecological,’ ‘socialist,’ and so forth.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> From a critique of these “adjectival cosmopolitanisms” or “hyphenated versions of cosmopolitanism,” the Marxist geographer David Harvey mounts his own “cosmopolitan project,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Cosmopolitanism and the Geographies of Freedom</span>, of a “historical geographical materialism” that is “dialectical, process-based, and interactive” . Among the new cosmopolitan theorists who adopt a dialectical method is the sociologist Ulrich Beck, who contends that cosmopolitanism is not opposed to nationalism or ethnicism but rather engaged in “a non-linear, dialectical process in which the universal and the particular, the similar and the dissimilar, the global and the local are to be conceived, not as cultural polarities, but as interconnected and reciprocally interpenetrating principles.”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> These processive conceptualizations of the dialectic bear theoretical affinities to Klein’s correlation of native-cosmopolitan and Israel-diaspora dialectics.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	The philosophical sources of Klein’s dialectics are multiple. As Zailig Pollock has demonstrated, dialectical thinking for Klein is as much—if not more—Talmudic as it is Hegelian or Marxist. Although he was well aware of Hegel and Marx, neither historical nor materialist dialectics proved sufficient to Klein’s predilection for the dialectical structures of the Talmud and the unresolved contradictions of Talmudic thought. His ambivalence toward the Hegelian formula of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis and his skepticism toward the laws of dialectical materialism (transformation of quantity into quality, unity of opposites, and negation of the negation) find accommodation instead in “the lack of an ultimate synthesis of opposing views in the Talmudic version of the dialectic.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> While Pollock also aligns Klein with a general “modernist ambivalence towards the dialectic” posited by James McFarlane,<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Michael Greenstein suggests more specific similarities between Klein’s dialectics and the Frankfurt School’s critical theory, particularly Adorno’s negative dialectics, which refuses “to reconcile antitheses into a conclusive synthesis,” performs a critique of “totalizing authoritarian philosophies” that could lead toward political extremisms, and “seeks to prevent final doctrinaire positions in favour of a more open-ended and open-minded fluidity.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> As Klein aptly concludes in his poem “Sestina on the Dialectic”—his meditation on the “change that changes” but never reaches “the final synthesis”—“no thing’s still.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>
	When Fredric Jameson considers the possibility that, “from a formal perspective, modernism itself is dialectical to the degree to which it is obliged to posit its own formal oppositions and to navigate them by way of invention and differentiation,” he only begins to explore the potentiality of a “properly dialectical aesthetic program.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> With Klein’s dialectical modernism, he pushes beyond its formal properties to interrogate the ideological mediations of its postcolonial and diasporic formations.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Postcolonial Modernism</h1>
<p>
	The conceptualization of a postcolonial modernism in anglophone Canadian literature is a relatively recent phenomenon, but one only tentatively extended to the modernist poets of the mid-twentieth century. In his 1987 essay “Canadian T(w)ink: Surviving the Whiteouts,” Gary Boire singles out F. R. Scott as an exemplary re in “a recurrent post-colonial modernist dilemma,”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> only to charge him with complicity in “historical and ideological erasures,” principally the “exclusion of Canada’s indigenous populations” from his 1945 poem “Laurentian Shield.”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> With terminological slippage indicative of his depiction of Scott and other Canadian modernists as anticolonial nationalists rather than postcolonialists, Boire proceeds to expose the motives behind their “declarations of a decolonized aesthetic”  and to posit a series of leading questions about “the political dimensions involved in the writing and reading of many modernist nationalistic texts”:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  In what ways did the Canadian modernists define their own relationship with Canada’s imperialistic past (and present)? In their heroic attempts to evolve a decolonized poetic, did they in fact construct the basis for a decolonized society? Or did they, in both simple and complex ways, help to perpetuate an already existing state of historical amnesia?
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	    <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Rather than leading towards Boire’s negative conclusion—that Canadian modernists including Scott and, by extension, other members of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group were amnesiac nationalists—we may redirect his identification of the “post-colonial modernist dilemma” toward a critical approach to Canadian modernism that is no longer incommensurate with postcoloniality. In his 2002 study <span style="font-style:italic;">Unreal Country: Modernity in the Canadian Novel in English</span>, Glenn Willmott calls for just this kind of literary-critical reorientation:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      We must undo any assumptions which, drawing on a later conration of global history, oppose modernism to postcoloniality. For only then can we bring a description of literary modernism that is postcolonial, and a description of historical modernity, into relationship. This task has barely been approached, even in general terms, so powerful has been the postcolonialist alignment with a postmodern period transcending and all but severed from the modern. . . . Hence the simple need for a theoretical discourse concerning modernity which aligns rather than opposes modernist expression with postcolonial experience.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Scholars familiar with studies of colonialism, imperialism, and modernism in landmark essays by Said and Jameson may find the situation of Canadian modernist studies baffling.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Why have critics resisted considerations of Canadian modernism’s postcoloniality? According to Larry McDonald, the origins of resistance may reside in Canadian post-modernist critics’ characterizations of modernism.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Beginning with Robert Kroetsch’s infamous pronouncement in 1974—“Canadian literature evolved directly from Victorian into Postmodern”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a>—which posits Canadian modernism’s absence, we may begin to perceive the strategies of postmodernist self-fashioning that positions itself against a nonexistent Canadian modernism. As Lorraine Weir writes in her 1991 critique of Linda Hutcheon’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canadian Postmodern: A Study of Contemporary English-Canadian Fiction</span> , “One result is that Canadian modernism, like the dissenting tradition in Canadian social and political thought with which it is strongly aligned, has still not been considered in Canadian theory.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> In other words, the absence of any sustained consideration of Canadian modernism in Hutcheon’s study merely replicates and validates Kroetsch’s dictum. Furthermore, Weir’s alignment of Canadian modernism with a tradition of social and political dissent calls into question Hutcheon’s assertion that “gone now is the modernist belief that art can really be autonomous or separate from the world.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Among the dissenting traditions to which Weir alludes is the social and political thought of the Montreal modernists of the 1940s, notably that of leftist res such as Scott, Klein, and Patrick Anderson of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group. McDonald, as well, takes issue with Hutcheon’s depiction of the Canadian modernists, calling it “an ahistorical travesty of modernism in Canada”;<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> like other commentators on the Montreal poets of the 1940s,<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> he notes that they “wrote for little magazines that were avowedly socialist”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a>—thus debunking Hutcheon’s claim that a belief in the autonomy of art was universal among modernists.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Yet Hutcheon’s portrait of an autonomous (dehistoricized, desocialized, and depoliticized) modernism in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canadian Postmodern</span> was typical, as Jeffrey M. Perl puts  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> it, “in the microsaga of how and when modernism and New Criticism are and have been seen together.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> For Perl, the pairing of modernism and New Criticism in the late-twentieth-century critical imagination is actually a mismatch, and the result of their misalignment is predictable: “[I]t was thus natural that, when the overdue rebellion against New Critical orthodoxy occurred, academic opinion would turn against modernism” . Hence the joint criticism of Canadian modernism and New Criticism that one finds in Boire:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      What emerges in so many “appreciations” of the Canadian modernist movement is a duplication in criticism of the same dehistoricized ideals contained within the literary texts. The base of critical activity is an approving, unquestioning acceptance of New Critical standards which constitute a depoliticized view of art as a psychological harmonization of the social, an aesthetic resolution of opposition and conflict into an organic whole.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    What Boire’s assessment of New Critical approaches to modernism in Canada makes all too obvious is not only their profound misunderstandings of the period’s historical, social, and political consciousness but also their misrepresentations of New Criticism’s practice by Canadian modernists themselves. Members of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group, most notably Anderson and Klein, certainly employed selected New Critical techniques in their essays, articles, and editorials on literary modernism.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Yet closer inspection of this critical archive reveals that the accusation that Canadian modernists practiced and explicated a dehistoricized, desocialized, and depoliticized modernism, especially in the case of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group, is unwarranted.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The conjuncture of New Criticism and modernism occupied center stage in the September 1944 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>, a special number entitled “An Explanatory Issue.” Members of the group at the time—Anderson, Scott, Klein, P. K. Page, and Bruce Ruddick—contributed poems accompanied by explanatory headnotes. Assembled and introduced by Anderson, the issue fulfilled a critical mandate initiated and carried out by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group during the previous year. That mandate employed selected elements of the New Critical method as vehicles to promote the reading and writing of literary modernism in Canada, a coupling of literary and critical practices that coincided with the group’s articulation of a decolonized poetry and poetics.
	  </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s modernism sought to supersede what Scott, in the December 1942 issue, called “our Canadian colonialism.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> According to his analysis, this form of colonialism is “a cast of thought, a mental climate” that inhibits the co-emergence of both a modernist poetry and a postcolonial “state of mind” that break with the imperial institutions and formations of empire.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> For the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group, postcolonial thought and modernist poetry were coextensive concerns; their coincidence is amply evidenced by the poetry, editorials, and articles published in the magazine itself. This evidence has not, however, been adequately documented in the literary-historical record; instead, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group has been characterized, at times, as no more than a colonial mimicry of the Auden generation and, at other times, as a colonizing presence importing European modernism into Canada. These characterizations bespeak the period’s symptomatic anticolonial  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ambivalence,<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> which finds its correlative in the native-cosmopolitan debates among the Montreal modernists of the 1940s. Extrapolated to Montreal little-magazine culture in the 1940s, the term “postcolonial modernism” rearticulates the theoretical contours of <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s poetics and realigns prevailing literary-historical narratives of the period. Histories of the period have been preoccupied with retelling versions of the native-cosmopolitan schism in Canadian modernism. By resituating the native-cosmopolitan debate among the Montreal modernists in relation to a postcolonial-modernist poetics, we may begin to revise the ways in which critics and historians have characterized the period as a conflict between two warring factions: the cosmopolitans represented by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group and the nativists represented by the crosstown rival <span style="font-style:italic;">First Statement</span>. As Brian Trehearne argues in reassessing the Montreal poets of the 1940s, the quarrel between the two magazines has been overplayed in the historical record; he reconciles their differences and resolves the partitioning of the two magazines and their affiliated poets along native-cosmopolitan lines by presenting their aesthetic commonalities as evidence of a unified modernist poetics.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> But where Trehearne’s reevaluation of the Montreal modernists isolates their aesthetic practice, the theorization of a comprehensive Canadian postcolonial modernism necessitates a cultural remapping of their modernist poetics.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group’s approach to postcolonial modernism culminated in the publication of “An Explanatory Issue,” the origins of which can be traced to a <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> meeting in March 1944.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> At this meeting, the group recognized an urgent need to bridge what it perceived to be a communication gap between modernist poetry and its potential readership, specifically between its own poetry and the general public. <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s initiatives to make poetry more accessible to the Canadian public included the publication of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Victory Broadsheet</span>, a single sheet of newsprint consisting of leftist, anti-imperialist war ballads written by Anderson, not only distributed to subscribers in the August 1943 issue, but also intended for free circulation in factories, schools, bookstores, and newsstands across Canada. According to Anderson, this attempt to “bring poetry to the people” was issued in the interests of “explaining the issues of the war and the problems of the peace in terms of Canadian history and life.” Anderson’s decision, as he put it, to write for the broadsheet “poetry of a simpler, more popular kind than that usually obtaining in the parent magazine” sharply distinguished the broadsheet’s populist poetry from the magazine’s modernist poetry.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> While this populist-modernist schism might suggest analogies to the native-cosmopolitan division often cited in accounts of Montreal literary culture in the 1940s, the swift discontinuation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Victory Broad-sheet</span> after one installment indicates <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s disavowal of the so-called “great divide” between literary modernism and mass culture.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> With the appearance of “An Explanatory Issue” the following year, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group would more broadly implement its populist method, providing its readers with what Anderson called “certain aids to the appreciation of modern poetry.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> In league with the leftist inclinations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Victory Broadsheet</span>, the political orientation of “An Explanatory Issue” was tacitly socialist, leaning toward a populist mode of dissemination. But instead of writing a populist poetry for mass distribution, Anderson designed the special issue to make <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> modernist poetry accessible to the masses. Or, to put it another way, he drafted a plan to bridge the native-cosmopolitan “great divide.” In doing so, he presented <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s modernist poetry and editorial commentaries as guides to a critique of colonialism in Canadian poetry and prototypes of a postcolonial poetry and poetics.
	  </p>
<p>
	    In his editorial statement, Anderson noted that the explanatory issue had been prompted by a request from “a young man interested in <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>, a captain in the Canadian army.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> By identifying a member of the Canadian armed forces as part of the readership of <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>, Anderson not only remobilized the magazine’s support for the war effort, recalling the declaration against fascism and call for solidarity among writers in its inaugural editorial,<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> but also gestured toward the magazine’s potential to reach mass audiences. Having fingered the issue’s intended audience, the editorial proceeds in the manner of a New Criticism primer: “A poem is unparaphrasable and untranslatable. Once separated from the poet’s experience, it is a sovereign and autonomous entity.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Even as he invoked the principles of the New Critics, Anderson found it inevitable that readers of poetry “should, especially in this political age, be still anxious about meaning,” but thought that that they should relegate political significations of the poem to “the background, especially on the important first reading” . On subsequent readings, however, he admits that a reader may wish “to apply his particular, and maybe political, standards.” For Anderson, the reader’s respect for the poem’s “sovereign and autonomous” existence need not divorce it from its political contexts, but rather allows the reader to appreciate “a greater totality of meaning than if he angrily suspects the poem of being obscure.” Anderson’s defense of the sovereign and autonomous poem appeals to the reader’s desire for sovereignty and autonomy, advancing an argument aimed at generating widespread understanding of modernist poetry among lay readers rather than among partisan audiences. Anderson viewed the hermeneutic strategies of New Criticism as tools to disarm the prevalent resistance to “obscure” modernist poetry among the general public. Rather than advance an explicitly politicized, populist leftist hermeneutics—as the apologists for socialist realism had attempted in the 1930s—he appealed to the concurrent rise of New Criticism and its focus on the “totality of meaning” in the text itself, rather than in its contexts, as a way to popularize modernist poetry. Hence his concern that “forces which are progressive politically are sometimes little more than reactionary culturally” may in fact allude to the antimodernism of programmatic leftist aesthetics, mostly notably socialist realism . Even so, Anderson’s populist approach to modernist poetry is consonant with his underlying political beliefs, for he also holds that “the poet has a real function to play in our society, particularly when social and economic progress is getting ahead of cultural and ‘spiritual’ development.” Aware of the reactionary populism among Canada’s wartime poets and their audiences, which fostered persistent colonialism and which was evident in the proliferation of patriotic, anglophile, imperialist war poetry,<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Anderson set himself the task of developing a postcolonial practice that provided a corrective to the antipopulism of modernist aesthetics.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Critical responses to Anderson’s poetry and poetics at the time and in retrospect often invoke the native-cosmopolitan debate, placing Anderson on the cosmopolitan  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> side. From a nativist critical perspective, Wynne Francis’s portrait of Anderson depicts him as a colonizing presence, a British-born expatriate poet who came to Montreal where he “exploited” the natural resources of Canadian geography and climate and the national pastimes of skiing and hockey.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Francis’s anti-cosmopolitan commentary stems from the rhetoric of pro-nativist poets such as Dorothy Livesay, who in an April 1944 article published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Forum</span> derided Anderson and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group, not for their colonizing presence in Canada, but for what she considered their poetry’s colonial derivation from European modernism.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Anderson’s retort in the correspondence column of the May 1944 <span style="font-style:italic;">Forum</span> accused Livesay of “[a] ‘colonial’ fear of cosmopolitanism, a provincial carping at those derivations and early dependencies which are inevitable in young writers,”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> which he followed with a poetic history and critique of Canadian colonialism in his “Poem on Canada” published the following month.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> With both sides of the native-cosmopolitan debate pointing the “colonial” finger across the “great divide,” Anderson may have intended to resolve the agon by putting together “An Explanatory Issue.” Yet his plan backfired, for instead of inciting Canadian poets and critics to embrace <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s postcolonial modernism, his opponents countered with a nativist, “nationalist modernism”—to borrow Jody Berland’s coinage.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> In the end, the negative reception of <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s postcolonial modernism was not so much a conceptual repudiation of its cosmopolitanism as a rejection of the teachings of a British-born schoolmaster.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Perhaps a better spokesperson for <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s postcolonial modernism is Klein, whose poem “Montreal” appeared in “An Explanatory Issue.” In his headnote to the poem, he explains that it is “written in a vocabulary which is not exactly orthodox English. It is written so that any Englishman who knows no French, and any Frenchman who knows no English . . . can read it intelligently. It contains not a word . . . which is not either similar to, derivative from, or akin to a French word of like import; in short, a bilingual poem.”<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Klein’s “Montreal” delineates a civic history of colonization, its bilingualism attesting to the predominant languages spoken in his Anglo-French metropolis. The poem elaborates a conceit through which the poet articulates his spiritual and bodily identification with the city. By the poem’s close, the poet is no longer a resident of the city; “the city is resident in the poet.”<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> For a Jewish poet to write of Montreal without mentioning his city’s Jewish history is a remarkable elision, for this lacuna testifies to the process of incorporation—the rative embodiment of the city in the poet—as a metaphor for the colonization of the Jewish poet’s body, the effacement of his people’s language, culture, and history. As a poet of the Jewish diaspora, Klein res the Jewish poet’s city as a colonized body, a body populated by his city’s histories of colonization and by the languages of its colonizers. The opening lines of the final stanza make plain the correlation between the Jewish poet’s and the city’s colonization, where he envisions the city as a “new-world Torah,”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> a testament to colonial exploitation: “City, O city, you are vision’d as / A parchemin roll of saecular exploit / Inked with the script of eterne souvenir!”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> From the opening line’s allusion to Joyce’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span> (“O city metropole, isle riverain”) to the closing stanza’s invocation of Eliot’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> (“City, O city, you are vision’d”), Klein’s “Montreal” is framed by a modernist practice  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of incorporation, the juxtaposition of linguistic fragments picked from the rubble of European empires.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> Moreover, throughout the poem, Klein deliberately mimics a celebratory rhetoric of imperial conquest and colonization, ending every sentence and every stanza with a triumphant exclamation mark; its superficial appearance might suggest the poet’s complicity with these rhetorical gestures, but he emphatically aligns himself with the colonized. His mimicry of the colonizers’ languages is, as Homi Bhabha demonstrates, a strategic tool for the postcolonial writer. Neither wholly French nor wholly English, the poet’s “postcolonial mimicry” decries the purity of a native tongue; his unorthodox language resides “in-between” the colonizers’ linguistic orthodoxies and hegemonies.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    To recast this reading of Klein’s “Montreal” in terms of the native-cosmopolitan debate, I should note that the Jewish poet’s identification with his city is neither nativist nor cosmopolitan. Although the poet resides in his native city, and his native city resides in him, Montreal is the domicile of his exile. For a poet of the Jewish diaspora writing before the formation of the state of Israel in 1948, the experience of exile is accentuated by his attachment to Montreal. Without a nation-state to affix his sense of belonging, he adopts his native city as his surrogate “state” of exile. Occasioned by his “sojourn in alien place,” for instance, the poet recalls the suburbs of Montreal as his “exile’s verdure fresh.”<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Removed from the city and its environs, he continues to identify himself and his experience of exile with Montreal. At the same time, the poet’s consciousness of living in Montreal and in a “state” of exile is incommensurate with a cosmopolitan sense of global citizenship. For Klein, the diasporic Jewish poet is neither native nor cosmopolitan, neither at home in his native city nor at home in the world; he is <span style="font-style:italic;">unheimlich</span>. His unhomely postcoloniality is, as Scott puts it, a “state of mind.” If, for Freud, the unheimlich is “the name for everything that ought to have remained . . . secret and hidden but has come to light,” then my reading of Klein’s “Montreal” is a decidedly unhomely one: it seeks to reveal his articulation of the diasporic poet’s unhomely condition and to unveil that poet’s colonized body.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Diasporic Modernism</h1>
<p>
	    If among members of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group and in his contributions to that magazine Klein articulated the Jewish-Canadian poet’s postcolonial modernism in concert with his Anglo-Canadian contemporaries, he elsewhere and more enduringly expressed the fully globalized view of the Jewish writer’s diasporic modernism. As significant as his involvement with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group may have been to the development of his modernist poetics, the magazine was not by any measure the most important public forum for his responses to aesthetic modernism and writers of the Jewish diaspora. That distinction belongs to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Jewish Chronicle</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span>), the weekly paper that Klein edited and to which he contributed short stories, poetry, translations, editorials, literary essays, and book reviews on a continuous basis from October 1938 to June 1955.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> abounds with Klein’s views on both modernist and diasporic cultures. Writing in the 13 May 1949 issue, Klein’s conceptualization of the relationship between  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Israeli and diasporic Jewish cultures resonates with the debate over native and cosmopolitan literary cultures among Canada’s midcentury modernists:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      The mere fact that Jewish existence has now achieved a national status and dignity cannot be without its influence even upon the culture of those who have another sovereign allegiance. And it is precisely here that the true flowering of Jewish culture is possible. A culture which is confined to but one area tends to become restricted and insular; a culture which is everywhere planted tends to become diffuse and diluted. Neither the one nor the other are consummations greatly to be desired. But with Israel hewing straitly to the line, following directly in the path of ancient tradition, and with world Jewry thinking in larger cosmopolitan terms, our culture is very likely to acquire a completeness and wholeness it never enjoyed before. At once placed solidly in the ground and yet looking with eager eyes upon the world, surely it may inherit the best qualities of both Diaspora and Israeli culture.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Klein emphatically sided against those Zionists who saw the establishment of the Jewish homeland as the negation of the diaspora, a position against which he argued repeatedly in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> through the late 1940s and early 1950s.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> Rather, he sought the articulation of a transnational Jewish culture in the dialectics of diaspora and Israel. Together with the dialectics of nativism and cosmopolitanism, Klein articulated the dialectical relationship between Israel and the diaspora. These dialectics may not be homologous, but they are interrelated. For instance, a few years prior to his columns on the question of the diaspora, he entered the native-cosmopolitan debate via his reply to a questionnaire sent to him by the poet and little-magazine editor Raymond Souster, which Klein published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> in February and March 1946 under the title “Writing in Canada.”<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> Faced with questions about national “identity” , “character” , and “consciousness”  in contemporary Canadian literature, Klein mobilizes his dialectic to arrive at a hybridized position between the nativist and the cosmopolitan where “a writer may be prompted to choose his Canadian subject so that his universal attitudes, since confined to a given locale, may be accentuated the more” .
	  </p>
<p>
	    Not unlike his rejection of the Zionist negators of the diaspora, however, Klein shows no compassion for a “factitiously nationalist . . . literature”  in Canada and thus reveals his antipathy toward the nativists. Corroborated by his commentaries on Israeli poetry in “Notebook of a Journey”—a series of seventeen articles published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> (August 12–December 23, 1949) reporting on his trip to Europe, Israel, and North Africa in the summer of 1949—that he later integrated into the “Deuteronomy” chapter of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>, Klein’s critique of the nativist literature and culture that he discovers in Israel bespeaks his disparagement of the same in Canada. In the context of the narrator’s survey of Israeli poetry in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>, he targets those “primitive, tribal” nativists (“Irgun poets, <span style="font-style:italic;">sabra</span> poets, Yemenite poets”) who regard themselves as “more aboriginal than the aborigines,” those who espouse “<span style="font-style:italic;">shilath hagaluth</span>—the negation of the Diaspora—a conviction that Jewry abroad was doomed, whether by uxorious embrace of assimilation or the fierce hug of anti-Semitism, doomed to disappear,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> if not immediately, eventually.”<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> Conversely, the narrator also takes to task the extreme of the avant-garde poet of Tiberias, “a completely underivative poet,” “a poet of an austere economy of words”<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a>—in other words, the epitome of the cosmopolitan modernist. Solomon J. Spiro suggests that Klein’s portrait of the Tiberian poet takes satiric aim at Ezra Pound and the imagists, and draws specific comparisons between the two sheets of paper that make up “[t]he complete works of” the Tiberian and the five imagist poems of “The Complete Poetical Works of T. E. Hulme,” published as an appendix to Pound’s 1912 volume <span style="font-style:italic;">Ripostes</span>.<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> What the narrator’s survey reveals are limit cases of nativism and cosmopolitanism, radical extremes of antimodern primitivism and avant-garde modernism, neither of which satisfies the narrator’s “quest of the essence of contemporary Hebrew poetry” for his projected anthology.<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> Neither native nor cosmopolitan exclusively, the narrator’s ideal “poetry” is found not at the “literary soirée” but “[i]n the streets, in the shops”; its creators “were not members of literary societies, the men who were giving new life to the antique speech, but merchants, tradesmen, day labourers” . “Nameless authorship flourished in the streets” , the narrator reports, as he surveys the business signs and advertisements of Israel’s capital:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	      An insurance company, I observed as I lingered in Tel Aviv’s commercial centre, called itself <span style="font-style:italic;">Sneh</span>—after Moses’ burning bush, which had burned and burned but had not been consumed. . . . A well-known brand of Israeli sausage was being advertised, it gladdened my heart to see, as Bashan—just tribute to its magnum size, royal compliment descended from Og, Bashan’s giant king. A dry-cleaner called his firm <span style="font-style:italic;">Kesheth</span>, the rainbow, symbol of cessation of floods! An ice-cream organization, Kortov, punned its way to custom fissioning <span style="font-style:italic;">kortov</span>, a drop, to <span style="font-style:italic;">kor-tov</span>, cold and good!
	    </p>
<div class="attrib">
	      
	    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      However “anti-climactic” the narrator’s “epiphany,” as Michael Greenstein describes it,<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> the narrator’s celebration of a democratic, populist, everyday, modern Hebrew poetry of the people marks the conjuncture of multiple discourses—native and cosmopolitan, myth and modernity, Israel and diaspora. With his populism, the narrator faintly echoes Anderson’s stance on modernist poetry in “An Explanatory Issue,” but Klein’s aesthetic is far from the socialist modernism that informs the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group: it is, rather, a modernism that is manifest in the signs of global capitalism, the advertisements of a globalized modernity. That the anthology the narrator discovers in a signature Joycean epiphanic moment consists of advertising is doubtless Klein’s nod to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, whose central re, Leopold Bloom, is a professional ad man;<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> this allusive gesture to Joyce is one of the signature ways in which Klein orients his modernist project in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Most notable among Klein’s commentaries on Anglo-American modernism in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> is his late critique of antisemitism in the writings of two of its principal practitioners, Eliot and Pound. Although Klein had during his McGill days raised uncompromising objections to modernism on aesthetic grounds,<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> his far more pointed attack on Pound and Eliot in the late 1940s was additionally motivated in the immediate aftermath of the Holocaust by their shameful legacy of antisemitism. In her analysis of Klein’s ambivalent relationship to Eliot and Pound, Darlene Kelly points out that Klein  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> launched his attack “in the Jewish periodicals which he edited,”<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> including a parodic verse-review of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cantos</span> titled “Cantabile” (September–October 1948), an essay of protest against Eliot’s Nobel laureateship called “T. S. Eliot and the Nobel Prize” (November 12–26, 1948), and an essay of censure against the 1949 Bollingen Prize committee for honoring Pound called “Old Ez and His Blankets” (March 4, 1949)—all of which appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span>. If critics have been perplexed by Klein’s repudiation of the progenitors who provided models for his own modernism through the 1930s and 1940s,<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> their perplexity may find some clarification if we recall the pair of modernist projects to which Klein turned his attention in the late 1940s: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> and his critical commentary on Joyce’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>. After all, unlike Eliot and Pound, “Joyce was clearly a Judeophile,” and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> provided the prototype for Klein’s own story of the diasporic Jew and his practice of a diasporic modernism.<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      As Klein distanced himself from the antisemitic modernism of Eliot and Pound, he started to articulate the relationship between the Jewish diaspora and Joyce’s modernism. According to Caplan, “Klein often thought of writing a monumental poem or novel that would capture the Montreal of his youth just as <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> had memorialized Joyce’s Dublin. . . . In the forties he made several starts at a novel set in Montreal, using himself as the model for its Jewish hero and drawing up elaborate schematic outlines in clear imitation of Joyce” . Although Klein cast off the idea of writing what Caplan calls the “Canadian <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>” , he retained the blueprint of Joyce’s narrative of the wandering Jew when he came to write his own version for a post-Holocaust generation in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>. As Lorraine Weir makes plain, Klein’s “Notebook of a Journey” commences in the first installment with “the catechetical technique which Joyce used in the ‘Ithaca’ chapter of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>” in which he produces a sequence of ten stylistic experiments (titled “Reportorial,” “Rhetorical,” “Sentimental,” “Ironic,” “Satiric,” “Poetic,” “Biblic,” “Mishnaic,” “Talmudic,” and “Cabbalistic”) that gloss the “<span style="font-style:italic;">plain unvarnished fact</span>” of his departure for Israel on July 31, 1949.<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> These glosses also allude to the “Oxen of the Sun” episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, where Joyce enlists a “progress of parodies,” as Klein calls it in his “Oxen” essay,<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> through which he recapitulates the history of the English language and its literary styles from “alliterative and monosyllabic and Anglo-Saxon . . . until it ends in a frightful jumble of pidgin English, nigger English, Cockney, with Bowery slang and broken doggerel.”<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a> Given their obvious and deliberate indebtedness to Joyce, these stylized glosses at the beginning of the “Notebook” effectively translate the Irish author’s narrative of Bloom the wandering Jew in Dublin into the story of Klein the diasporic Jew’s return to Israel. That Klein chooses the form of the gloss to commemorate his <span style="font-style:italic;">aliyah</span> to Israel not only complements his concurrent critical project of writing glosses on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> but also anticipates the contrapuntal text-and-gloss structure of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Writing to Leon Edel on January 22, 1948, Klein outlines his <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> project: “a line-by-line, or rather page-by-page, commentary on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, tracking down all the allusions, indicating in the abstruser stream-of-consciousness paragraphs, the mental associations and sequences, explicating text, and relating the parts to the whole etc.” His method is that of the “glossators—no more, but no less; only with embarrassment  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to myself can I skip the cryptic.”<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a> For Edel, Klein’s glossatorial practice is rooted in the Jewish tradition of scriptural commentary, so that in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> the “talmudist has found a new Talmud.”<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> In his article “The Klein-Joyce Engima,” which is based in part on his correspondence with Klein, Edel describes the composition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> glosses as “a second book . . . being created in the margins of the original,”<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> a fitting image of Klein’s Talmudic style of commentary on Joyce’s text. Edel’s remarks on Klein’s work as a glossator serve as prelude to his point not only that <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> is one of the ur-texts for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> but that the glosses on Joyce’s text initiate Klein’s own autoglossatorial practice:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		Joyce had built his <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> on the framework of the Odyssey; Klein builds his on the books of the Pentateuch from Genesis to Deuteronomy. . . . His long letters to me explain and expatiate on his Joycean labyrinth; he now provides a gloss on himself; the book is filled with a series of gloss-chapters named with the letters of the Jewish alphabet.<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Just as Edel notes that the divisions of the main text of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> mirror the five books of the Torah, so the five corresponding gloss chapters (“Aleph,” “Beth,” “Gimel,” “Dalid,” and “Hai”) invoke the structure of Talmud. While the generic multiplicity of Klein’s glosses—poetry, letter, play, liturgy—corresponds loosely to the typographic interplay of multiple glosses in the apparatus of the Talmud, his glosses also represent a secondary anthology, not the “essence of contemporary Hebrew poetry” that the narrator seeks on his trip to Israel,<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> but the global dispersal of texts across the diaspora. Where the main narrative culminates in the narrator’s discovery of an anthology in the streets of Tel Aviv, in its commercial signage and advertisements, the gloss chapters constitute an anthology of the diaspora. The dialectical relationship between these two anthologies can be found in Klein’s intergeneric play between text and gloss. For instance, the Tel Aviv anthology could be construed as a collection of glosses in which the narrator’s commentaries on the mythic allusions and puns on the signs are integrated into his catalogue of advertisements. And conversely, the glosses are for the most part texts rather than commentaries (with the exception of “Gloss Gimel,” which is an exemplary case of Klein’s glossatorial practice). Taken together, these two anthologies manifest <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>’s dialectics of text and gloss, Israel and diaspora, native and cosmopolitan. Building on the Talmud’s archetypal compilation of ancient and early-modern texts from Israel and the diaspora alike, the “[n]ameless authorship”<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a> from the streets of Tel Aviv and the glosses by the anonymous narrator (“Aleph” and “Beth”) and Uncle Melech (“Gimel,” “Dalid,” and “Hai”) from Montreal, Rome, and Casablanca embody anthologies of post-Holocaust Jewish modernity.
	    </p>
<p>
	      As anthologists, Klein and his anonymous narrator perform editorial roles, a mediating function that is integral to their enactment of a modernist poetics. Even in his unfinished attempt to write page-by-page glosses on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, Klein embarks on what is effectively a modernist editorial project. That Klein continues his glossatorial work on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> in his correspondence and in his articles published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> speaks to the open-endedness of the Talmudic textual tradition out of which he  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> emerges as a modernist editor. His editorial work, beginning with his commentaries on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, unfolds an extensible series of glosses that moves through <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> and reappears in his letters and articles.
	    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Parchemin Roll</h1>
<p>
	      The story of Klein’s modernist editorial work is also the story of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>, a text that provoked him to offer his own commentaries on textual editing and that provides its own metatextual commentaries on the editing of the first scroll—the Torah. As numerous commentators before me have pointed out, the Miltonic epigraph that opens <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>—“And ask a Talmudist what ails the modesty of his marginal Keri that Moses and all the prophets cannot persuade him to pronounce the textual Chetiv”<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a>—specifically addresses the textual problems of the Torah. As Pollock and Popham indicate in their annotation on the epigraph,<a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a> Klein supplied his own gloss in his 1951 essay “The Bible Manuscripts,” published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span>: “[T]he word’s writ one way, and tradition bids you read another. <span style="font-style:italic;">Ketib</span>—thus it is written, but <span style="font-style:italic;">Keri</span>—you must read it thus. Nor is it a simple innocuous ambiguity which thence ensues, but often—and this is the most un-hinging thought of all—downright negation.”<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a> Keeping in mind that Pollock has already demonstrated that this essay serves as a “radical revision” of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>,<a name="f79-text" href="#f79"><sup>79</sup></a> I would like to extend the essay’s purview somewhat further and read it as a general guide to the textual history of the novel and, in particular, as a Baedeker to the editorial rationale enacted in Pollock and Popham’s critical edition.<a name="f80-text" href="#f80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      For instance, Pollock and Popham’s method of genetic transcription of the revisions to the extant manuscript of the “Exodus” chapter bears at least faint resemblance to the third of ten edicts established by the scribes of Israel, as enumerated by Klein in “The Bible Manuscripts”: “<span style="font-style:italic;">No erasures</span>. If error has crept into the text, if the scribe’s nodding shows, alas; the words are not expungeable. Ugly, in truth sacrilegious, are deletions, outmarkings, defacements, over-writings, erasures, for it is Holy Writ.”<a name="f81-text" href="#f81"><sup>81</sup></a> I assume that the editors chose to not follow the other nine, which include “<span style="font-style:italic;">Writing to be done upon parchment</span>,” “<span style="font-style:italic;">Before writing, meditate</span>,” and “<span style="font-style:italic;">Before writing, every word pronounce</span>” . While the similarity between their genetic method of transcription and the discipline of early scribal practice is no more than incidental, it does gesture toward their attempted recovery of Klein’s “textual Chetiv”—if only in the paratextual apparatus rather than the reading text. That the original manuscript of the novel is no longer extant may invite some comparison to the lost original of the Torah, for as Klein says, “the scripture in our hands, which attests to the existence and the disappearance of its own original, is but a transcript” . It is tempting to draw analogies between the missing first manuscript version of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> and the version of the Torah “that came down the mountain” , as Klein puts it, “the exact image, the very visual photograph, of the writ which came from Moses’ hand, of God’s primordial glyph” . Though it may not help to think of the subsequent revisions and versions of the various texts that precede and converge in the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> as exact  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> parallels to what Klein calls the “sacrilegious emendation and blasphemous editing” of the Torah , there is some merit in relating his essay’s account of the historical process of the first scroll’s textual transmission and editorial mediation to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>. As represented in the paratextual apparatus to Pollock and Popham’s edition, Klein’s process of composition and revision of the novel approximates the Talmudist’s compilation of “marginal Keri.” Their editorial practice is, at least in their editing of the reading text, not the scribal practice of what Klein calls “mere copyists, duplicators, fashioners of facsimile” . Nor are their minor emendations examples of “downright negation” that Klein laments in his reading of <span style="font-style:italic;">keri</span> in the margins of the Torah. Their list of variants is not a set of Talmudic commandments—“you must read it thus”—but a record of alternative readings that attest to the historicity and sociality of the texts that make up the narrative of the novel’s genesis and dissemination. Just as the story of the Torah’s transcriptions, in Klein’s words, “from the Table of Moses to the Stone of Joshua to the Scroll in the Ark to the writings of Aristeas to the calligraphy of the youngest scribe”  bears witness to the devolution of the first scroll from a state of absent oneness to that of the immanent many, so too is the story of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>’s textual exodus from singularity to multiplicity “re-membered” among the paratextual <span style="font-style:italic;">keri</span> in Pollock and Popham’s edition.<a name="f82-text" href="#f82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      Such is the story of the diasporic text. Pollock and Popham’s edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> attests to the radical hybridity of the text’s construction out of a vertiginous array of avant-textual preliminary materials, manuscript and typescript pages, and previously published versions—all of which call attention to the sweeping range of social forces and collaborative processes that mediate the production and dissemination of the text. The lines of convergence among these forces and processes in the novel’s textual history constitute a map of the diasporic text’s travels among archives, notebooks, periodicals, anthologies, and editions. Granted that the transnational circuits of transmission traveled by the texts that compose the hybrid structure of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> are only remotely comparable to the global networks of the Jewish diaspora, it cannot be ignored that their transit through Jewish periodicals and publishing houses in the United States is a significant feature of their dissemination within a globalized diaspora and their contribution to the formation of a diasporic modernism. At the same time, Klein’s role in circulating early versions of the main chapters (“Notebook of a Journey”) and the glosses (“Gloss Beth,” “Elegy”; “Gloss Hai,” “Of Remembrance”) in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> speaks to his own editorial construction and propagation of a Jewish modernism in the diaspora. Pollock and Popham’s apparatus of textual notes, appendices, and cross-referencing to the apparatuses of earlier volumes in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Collected Works of A. M. Klein</span> stands as testimony to the diasporic textual history of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> and its mediation by an editorial tradition of Talmudic scholarship in the diaspora. To read the Klein committee’s now nearly three-decade commitment to editing Klein’s works as an extension of his own editorial practices is an apt tribute to and necessary acknowledgment of the diasporic tradition of textual scholarship that informs both the author and his editors alike. Diasporic editors and authors—they are always fellow travelers.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

For instance, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Diaspora and Zionism in Jewish American Literature: Lazarus, Syrkin, Reznikoff, and Roth</span> (Hanover, NH: Brandeis University Press, 2002), Ranen Omer-Sherman consistently refers to a Jewish or Jewish-American modernism. Chana Kronfeld’s <span style="font-style:italic;">On the Margins of Modernism: Decentering Literary Dynamics</span> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996), a study of modernism in Israel and the diaspora, refers to Anglo-American, Hebrew, Yiddish, and international modernisms. I have yet to encounter the term “diasporic modernism” in studies of Jewish-Canadian literature, most notably in the considerable archive of articles, chapters, and books on Klein.
