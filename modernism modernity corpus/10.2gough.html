<p>
If the attempt to disentangle itself from the museum was characteristic
of much experimental art in the 1910s and 1920s, and again in the
1960s and 1970s, then we might describe our present historical moment
in terms of the attempt by the museum, as it approaches the condition
of the multiplex entertainment center, to disentangle itself from the
project of experimental art altogether. This is not simply a matter
of what goes around comes around. Nor does it have to do with the ways
in which museums are increasingly devoting more and more space to the
arts of shopping, dining, web surfing, tourism, and so forth. Rather,
it is driven by the fact that museums have oversold the notion, as Brian
O'Doherty once put it, of the assimilation of art without effort.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
  A major force in the promulgation of this notion, particularly
  with respect to the organization of exhibitions, is the dramatic
  reconration of curatorial practice that has taken place over
  the last several decades. Where once it was primarily curators who
  called the shots&#8212;on account of their subject expertise and
  disciplinary judgment&#8212;these professionals now routinely serve on
  box office-driven curatorial teams composed of marketing specialists,
  public relations personnel, education curators, exhibition evaluators,
  and project "managers." The attempt to embrace the differing and
  often directly competing priorities represented by each team player
  often leads to a leveling of critical ambition; perhaps nowhere has
  this leveling proved more detrimental than in the exhibition of new
  and difficult art.

<p>
With this problem in mind, I would like to turn to consider an earlier
moment in the history of the acquisition and exhibition of contemporary
art, wherein an alternative model of curatorial

<b></b>

practice was advanced, and to a considerable extent realized&#8212;in
Russia, in the aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. Involving as
it does the interventions of artists such as Kazimir Malevich, Vasily
Kandinsky, Varvara Stepanova, Aleksandr Rodchenko, Vladimir Tatlin,
and David Shterenberg, and critics like Osip Brik and Nikolai Punin,
this alternative model gives the lie to the standard assumption that
Russian vanguard artists and critics&#8212;in their pursuit of the
dissolution of the division of art and life&#8212;simply turned their
backs on the museum. On the contrary. The former Suprematist painter
Malevich, for example, was among the many vanguard voices calling
in 1919 for the state's construction of a vast network of museums
of contemporary art across the new Republic. This network was to be
interconnected by a "superhighway" (<i>magistral'</i>) for the smooth
circulation of traveling exhibitions, and anchored by a central museum
in the new capital, Moscow.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  Like the electrical engineer Gleb Krzhizhanovskii's adventurous
  contemporaneous plan for state electrification, Malevich's proposal
  followed the structural principle&#8212;the arterial linking of
  city to countryside&#8212;of most utopian visions formulated under
  the Bolshevik government's Civil War-period (1918-1920) policy of
  War Communism. This policy comprised a highly centralized command
  economy&#8212;or, at least, fantasy of a command economy, if we are
  to share Tim Clark's wise skepticism
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 &#8212;with a putatively totalizing control over the Republic's even
 most far-flung reaches.

<p>
As it was to turn out, the vanguard project for the state
"museumification" (<i>muzeefikatsiia</i>) of contemporary art was both
undertaken and substantially realized by the new cultural bureaucracy
established in January 1918, the People's Commissariat of Education
and Enlightenment, or, as it is usually known (by its Russian acronym),
Narkompros. In March 1920, the first of Narkompros's new contemporary
art museums opened as the Museum of Painterly Culture (Muzei Zhivopisnoi
Kul'tury [MZhK]), in a suite of eight galleries on Volkhonka in downtown
Moscow.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  Its definitive installation took place in June 1920.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
  According to a Narkompros guidebook, some thirty such museums were
  founded by 1921, with a centralized Museum Bureau in Moscow functioning
  as an acquisition and distribution center for the shipment of work
  to Petrograd and provincial cities.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
With the Bolsheviks' nationalization of private property in 1918 and
the abolition of the private dealer system&#8212;a system that the
expressionist painter Kandinsky criticized as "more or less accidental,
capricious, and arbitrary,"
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  and that the constructivist Rodchenko condemned as oppressive and
  coercive ("The patrons have oppressed us, have forced us to carry
  out their whims")
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 &#8212;the Moscow Bureau became the new Republic's sole patron of
 contemporary art. In his official capacity as head of that Bureau,
 Rodchenko reports in June 1921 that "for the past three years the best
 contemporary artists, both in Moscow and the provinces, have lived
 exclusively from the sale of their work to the Bureau, and the Bureau
 has supplied the provinces generously with contemporary art." Chiefly
 through a process of studio visits, the Bureau had acquired the
 work of over four hundred artists who would otherwise have been left
 stranded by the dismantling of the market economy. Such state support
 for contemporary art, Rodchenko continues, "is unprecedented anywhere
 in the world," and,

<b></b>

as such, "is an achievement of which the <i>commune</i> ought to be
proud."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  With the 26 million rubles spent on contemporary art between 1918
  and 1921, the state purchased some 1,336 paintings, 404 drawings,
  121 graphic works, 54 sculptures, and 11 spatial constructions.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  About a hundred of these acquisitions were selected for display in
  the Moscow MZhK, while the rest were earmarked for redistribution
  across the Republic.

<p>
Until recently, the new Russian contemporary art museums were rather
little known or studied beyond&#8212;or even by&#8212;specialists in
the field.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  It is thus worth underscoring the fact that they preceded by a decade,
  and in part encouraged, the foundation of the Museum of Modern Art
  (MoMA) in New York, which is often cited as the ur-example of the
  genre. With a single exception, the Russian museums represent
  the very earliest instantiation of a phenomenon that has since
  rapidly proliferated in many parts of the world, particularly in the
  postwar period and especially since the 1980s. At the time of their
  foundation during the Civil War, however, their single precedent
  was the Mus&eacute;e du Luxembourg in Paris, which, in 1818, had
  been transformed by government decree into an institution devoted
  exclusively to the work of "living artists," and thereby differentiated
  in function from the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, the so-called galleries
  of the dead.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  While calls had been made as early as 1912 for a Russian "museum of
  living artists"
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
&#8212;as the Luxembourg was nicknamed&#8212;the notion of a network of
such museums fed by a centralized Bureau handling all acquisition and
distribution, with its underlying principle of centrifugal circulation,
was at the time entirely unprecedented. (Though its basic principle was
soon popularized elsewhere: In 1931, for example, A. Conger Goodyear
asserts that MoMA&#8212;of which he was first president&#8212;"should
be a feeder, primarily to the Metropolitan Museum, but also to museums
generally throughout the country."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  A comparable principle structures Andr&eacute; Malraux's mid-century
  proposal in France for a nation-wide network of cultural centers,
  the <i>maisons de la culture</i>, while the late twentieth century
  witnesses the Guggenheim's global expansion out of New York, and the
  national spiraling of the "new Tates" out of London.)

<p>
Unique to the Russian case, however, is the fact that its Republic-wide
network of museums of contemporary art was proposed, established,
organized, and administered by artists themselves (in concert with a
number of critics), rather than museum professionals. For the division
of Narkompros responsible for overseeing the museum project&#8212;the
Department of Fine Arts, IZO (hence: IZO Narkompros)&#8212;was staffed
predominantly by artists, the majority of whom were leftists and otherwise
known as Futurists. This alliance between state and vanguard had had to
be fought for. Honoring art's new-found autonomy from Tsarist regulation
and censorship, the Futurists had initially refused to collaborate with
the Bolsheviks in the reinstitutionalization of Russian culture. Within
months, however, a realpolitik concerning the control of the Republic's
newly expropriated cultural heritage emerged amidst their ranks. By
mid-1918, Futurists had joined in droves the state's official if still
fledgling cultural bureaucracy.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
My subject is thus the emergence between 1918 and 1921 of a theory and
practice of what might be called Futurist museology. Before turning to
unpack this at first glance somewhat oxymoronic phenomenon&#8212;with
its simultaneous movement forward into the future and backward into the
past&#8212;the meaning of the terms <i>leftist</i> and <i>Futurist</i>

<b></b>

in the present context should be clarified. While sharing the Italian
Futurists' vitality and iconoclasm, the Russian Futurists were a
more diffuse lot, comprising not only the various groups of Futurist
poets and Cubo-Futurist painters that formed around 1912, but also most
experimental practitioners working in the visual and literary arts in the
1910s and 1920s. Generally speaking, Futurist was used wherever we would
tend to say avant-garde, the latter expression being significantly less
common in Russia at the time. After 1917, and no doubt in part because
of the key role of the Futurists in IZO Narkompros, the term Futurist
came to be used more or less interchangeably with leftist&#8212;in
opposition to centrist and rightist. None of these terms necessarily
inferred any particular party political affiliation&#8212;though they
could and sometimes did (as in the case of the critic Brik, who was a
member of the RKP[b])&#8212;but rather referred chiefly to the perceived
radicality, or lack thereof, of one's mode of production.

<p>
The appellation <i>Futurist</i> was more than merely nominal, however. If
one had to say what made certain strands of Russian culture both before
and after 1917 Futurist, it was their shared and unyielding commitment
to, and absolute privileging of, the notion of formal or technological
invention in the arts and the sciences alike. A broadsheet manifesto
issued by the poet Velimir Khlebnikov and his merry entourage in 1916
textualizes this commitment in a sententious formulation that became,
over the course of the next decade or so, something of an all-purpose
Futurist battle cry. Announcing the operative terms of a "new holy war"
against "that fat caterpillar, the freight train of elders," Khlebnikov
trumpets: "LET THE MILKY WAY BE DIVIDED INTO THE MILKY WAY OF THE
INVENTORS [<i>IZOBRETATELEI</i>] AND THE MILKY WAY OF THE CONSUMERS
[<i>PRIOBRETATELEI</i>]."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  The term <i>priobretatel'</i>&#8212;consumer or acquisitor&#8212;was
  rather new in Russian, and the poet's usage of it utterly
  pejorative. In the context of the broadsheet, Khlebnikov's call for the
  division of our galaxy into a vanguard who invent, discover, pioneer,
  and produce culture, on the one hand, and a rearguard who acquire,
  amass, possess, own, and consume it, on the other, was a key part of an
  ingenious repackaging operation undertaken by a small group of Futurist
  poets led by Nikolai Aseev, who remodeled themselves as Martians
  after those in H. G. Wells's novel, <i>The War of the Worlds</i>.

<p>
But Khlebnikov's putative antinomy of invention and consumption was
to have a much longer shelf life than the poet himself might have
countenanced, given his Futurist commitment to a vastly accelerated
temporality. Numerous iterations of it are found in vanguard texts
published after the Revolution. It serves to frame, for example, the
project of <i>Iskusstvo kommuny</i> (Art of the commune), the state-funded
weekly newspaper published by the IZO Futurists between 1918 and 1919 that
quickly became the staple reading matter of all cultural leftists. In its
third issue, the critic Punin&#8212;a major player in the vanguard museum
project in general, and in the organization and administration of the
Petrograd museum in particular, as Jennifer Cahn has recently demonstrated
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 &#8212;invokes Khlebnikov's galactic division as an explanatory gloss
 on the current division of contemporary artists into left and right.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  In <i>Iskusstvo kommuny</i>'s nineteenth (and final) issue, the IZO
  Futurists march Khlebnikov's battle cry across the breadth of the
  front page, directly under the masthead&#8212;a parting shot

<b></b>

at their comrades higher up the Narkompros food chain, who had just
ordered the newspaper's closure on account of its unrelenting attacks
on Russia's cultural heritage.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>

<p>
A few years later, the Futurist poet Sergei Tret'iakov turned multitasker
in the 1920s returns to Khlebnikov's antinomy in his attempt to define,
historicize, and futurize Russian Futurism's first decade of production in
the inaugural issue of the constructivist journal <i>Lef: Zhurnal levogo
fronta iskusstv</i> (Lef: journal of the left front of the arts) (March
1923): "'The creators are set apart from the consumers' (Khlebnikov)."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
  A few years later again, in an extraordinary eulogy written in the
  wake of Vladimir Mayakovsky's suicide in 1930, the linguist and
  Futurist proselytizer Roman Jakobson conjoins Khlebnikov's binary
  with speculative philosophy's antinomy of "I" and "not-I." He thus
  reads Mayakovsky's hostility to the "stagnating slime"&#8212;the
  accumulated conventions and habitual rhythms of "everyday life"
  (<i>byt</i>)&#8212;which "stifles life [<i>zhizn'</i>] in its tight,
  hard mold": "Th[e] terrible 'double' of the poet is his conventional
  and commonplace 'self,' the purchaser and owner whom Khlebnikov once
  contrasted with the inventor and discoverer."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  For Khlebnikovian Futurism, as for the contiguously formulated
  Shklovskian project of defamiliarization, the mundane, repetitive
  world of <i>byt</i> was everything that the vanguard discourse of
  <i>zhizn'</i>&#8212;"life" as defined within the elevated realm of
  philosophical and aesthetic speculation&#8212;sought to repress.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
I dwell on Khlebnikov's holy-war cry and its successive iterations in
order to pose the problem&#8212;even the paradox&#8212;that lies at the
heart of Futurist museology. It goes without saying that the Futurists'
march against the <i>priobretatel'</i> was driven by their longstanding
hostility&#8212;fully endorsed by October&#8212;to the increasing role of
the marketplace in cultural life and the inevitable imbrication of their
practice within the economic structures of capitalism, an economy that
had accelerated rapidly in the late nineteenth century and to which the
avant-garde had been indebted for its survival (precisely the kind of
structural dependency which Clement Greenberg famously described as an
"umbilical cord of gold"). Against all evidence to the contrary, the
utopian Futurists posited the inventor as exempt from capital. But the
Futurists' march against the <i>priobretatel'</i> was driven also and,
in the present context, more significantly, by their campaign against
the past and the suffocating burden of tradition. Khlebnikov's antinomy
reiterates the raw terms of this campaign as it had been originally
set forth in 1912, in the now famous inaugural manifesto of Russian
Futurism: the right of poets to "feel an insurmountable hatred for the
language existing before their time," to "throw Pushkin, Dostoevsky,
[and] Tolstoy . . . overboard from the Ship of Modernity."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
One is prompted to ask, therefore, what is the antipass&eacute;ist doing
in the museology business? What is the significance of the fact that
the inventor him- or herself now becomes a <i>priobretatel'</i>, in the
sense of an acquisitor or collector of a fast-becoming-past present? What
does it mean when, despite all Rodchenko's protestations to the contrary
("We will not give in to . . . the intelligentsia that has taken the
place of the former bureaucrats"),
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
  the Khlebnikovian Futurist became precisely that, a bureaucrat? In
  what ways did such inversions, reversals, and transformations inflect
  the Futurists' negotiation of the museum question? Was the project
  of Futurist museology

<b></b>

ultimately a contradiction in terms? And what happened to the concept
of history in the landscape of museological revolution? A preliminary
sketch of the historical and institutional context in which Futurist
museology developed will help to ground these and related questions.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
The Petrograd Conference
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
For both diplomatic and domestic reasons, museological policy was a highly
sensitive matter for the Bolshevik government, still vulnerable in the
first year of its administration. Rumors had circulated abroad&#8212;as
reported by the critic Felix F&eacute;n&eacute;on, for example&#8212;that
Anatoly Lunacharsky (the first Commissar of Narkompros) would not
intervene to prevent the muzhiks "from cutting boots out of the Rembrandts
in the Hermitage."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
  Along with the destruction of imperial monuments during October,
  and the state seizure of private collections in its aftermath, such
  rumors had done little to convince skeptical European nations of the
  new government's credibility. Since everything had to be done to hasten
  diplomatic recognition of its legitimacy, the Bolshevik leadership was
  obliged to take immediate steps to secure Russia's cultural heritage.

<p>
To this end, Lunacharsky established within Narkompros two separate
departments for cultural affairs. The first was the aforementioned IZO,
the responsibilities of which included the foundation of open-entrance
art schools (after the abolition of the quota-bound imperial academy),
the inauguration of an exhibitions program, and the organization of a
division for publication on the arts. In Petrograd, the key positions
in IZO's Collegium were held by leftists such as the modernist painter
Shterenberg (who served as director), the artist Natan Altman, and the
critics Punin and Brik. A parallel Collegium was established in Moscow
by Shterenberg's deputy, Tatlin, who invited on board radicals like
Malevich and the nonobjective painter Ol'ga Rozanova, as well as more
moderate res such as Kandinsky.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
  The second body within Narkompros was the Department of Museums and
  the Preservation of Cultural Monuments, to which Lunacharsky granted
  exclusive jurisdiction over the reorganization and administration of
  the Republic's cultural patrimony. Unlike that of IZO, its Collegium
  was dominated by conservative artists and museum professionals.

<p>
In February 1919, IZO decided to challenge the Museums Department's
jurisdiction, particularly with respect to contemporary art. It convened
a week-long conference on the "museum question" in the Palace of Arts
(formerly the Winter Palace) in Petrograd, to which it invited artists,
art historians, museum directors, curators, and conservators. Among the
members of the Museums Department's Collegium who traveled from Moscow
were Pavel Muratov, an art historian, and Igor Grabar, an impressionist
painter, art historian, and director of the Tretiakov Gallery since
1913&#8212;both conservative res much maligned within Futurist
circles. IZO's purpose in convening the conference can be gleaned from
its "Declaration," which was read to the assembled delegates by Punin
and circulated at the conference as a broadsheet, later appearing on
the front page of <i>Iskusstvo kommuny</i> in one of two special issues
devoted to the proceedings.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
  Its key premises were also further reinforced by conference

<b></b>

papers by Punin, Brik, the neoprimitivist painter Aleksei Grishchenko,
and the graphic designer and ceramicist, Sergei Chekhonin.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
IZO's "Declaration" made three main demands:<br />
First, that the Russian state should henceforth entrust artists
rather than scholars and museum professionals with the acquisition
of contemporary art: "The business of the acquisition of works of
contemporary art is exclusively the province of artists. . . . As the
only ones competent in questions of contemporary art, and as the force
which creates artistic value, [it is] artists alone [who] are able to
carry out acquisitions."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
  While IZO's first demand&#8212;with its insistence that artists
  should or even could maintain control over the evaluation of their
  practice&#8212;sought to strip existing museum directors and curators
  of their purchasing powers, its second endeavored to force them to
  relinquish their individual fiefdoms: IZO proposed the centralization
  in a single state reserve (Gosfond) of all existing museum collections
  (including, for example, the former Shchukin and Morozov collections of
  modern French painting in Moscow), as well as all new acquisitions. It
  would then be IZO staffers who would have the exclusive right to
  select from Gosfond works of art to supply&#8212;and this is the
  declaration's third demand&#8212;a network of "Museums of Artistic
  Culture" (<i>Muzei Khudozhestvennoi Kul'tury</i>).
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  The idea was that these museums would then be replenished on a more
  or less continuous basis by the latest selections from the central
  reserve.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  As one conference participant put it, "such . . . museum[s] will
  prove to be . . . living organism[s], pulsating together with the
  pulsations of artistic life."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
IZO proposed a single criterion for the selection of work for the new
museums, namely, whether or not a given work manifested "artistic culture"
(<i>khudozhestvennaia kul'tura</i>).
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
  In a separate position statement in the same issue of <i>Iskusstvo
  kommuny</i>, IZO defined this concept in terms of labor and invention:
  "The concept of 'artistic culture' contains within it&#8212;in
  accordance with the very meaning of the word 'culture' as <i>active
  work</i>&#8212;a creative moment; creativity presupposes the creation
  of something new, an invention; <i>artistic culture is [thus] nothing
  other than the culture of artistic invention</i>."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

<p>
With their redefinition of culture as invention, the IZO Futurists
promulgated formal, stylistic, or technical innovation as the exclusive
criterion of aesthetic value, thereby situating their museological project
firmly within the camp of Khlebnikov's vanguard of inventors. A "Museum
of Artistic Culture" would be, accordingly, a museum devoted to (the
history of) artistic invention. Layered over IZO's Futurism was also a new
concern, however, to redefine culture in terms of labor. In the aftermath
of October, the Futurists drew upon the revolutionary rhetoric of the
dissolution of the division of labor in order to promote the artist's
accession to the realm of the so-called practical worker, as opposed to
parasitical <i>intelligent</i>. IZO sought to de- or remythologize the
Khlebnikovian model, rebuffing the class position of intelligentsia with
which the Futurists, notwithstanding their own protests, were typically
associated. By setting forth a history of artistic invention as a history
of "'culture' as active work," the new museums were to document what
Lunacharsky describes as the "evolution of labor in the field of art."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
How did IZO's demands fare at the conference?<br />
More tolerant of the Futurists than any other Bolshevik leader of the
period, Lunacharsky endeavored to play the role of mediator between
the museum workers and their IZO antagonists by making concessions to
both sides. On the one hand, he agrees that in the past scholars and art
historians had indeed exercised too much control over acquisitions, and
he thus endorses IZO's demands for the right of artists both to control
acquisitions of contemporary art and also to establish Museums of Artistic
Culture. On the other hand, he rejects without hesitation IZO's demand
that, in order to supply such museums, artists be granted the right to
rummage through existing collections or a centralized reserve.

<p>
The Commissar's objections to this last are twofold: Most fundamentally,
Lunacharsky rejects as too reductive IZO's definition of the history
of art in terms of a history of invention: its "professional and
technicizing formalism," he argues, neglects equally important questions
such as the role in art of "inspiration" and "imagination." It ignored
art's capacity to express "ideas," reflect "human culture," and provide
"humanity's autobiography." According to the Commissar, IZO's narrowly
professional history of art was incapable of realizing the enlightenment
function of all museums as it had been decreed at the Third Congress of
the Soviets in 1918: to educate a public broader than just specialists
(artists and connoisseurs) so as to facilitate the proletariat's access
to its newfound cultural wealth. "It must be remembered," he points out,
"that the Museum exists neither for scholars nor for artists, but first
and foremost for the people [<i>dlia naroda</i>]."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
  In addition, Lunacharsky argues that if IZO's demand to select
  at its will were granted, a precedent would be established that
  could lead to tremendous instability (not to mention administrative
  nightmares)&#8212;with every changing of the guard, a new history of
  art would have to be written.

<p>
Lunacharsky's response to IZO's demands guided two major resolutions
passed by the Petrograd conference. First, the desirability
of establishing a Museum of Artistic Culture was unanimously
ratified&#8212;although, significantly for our purposes, "without
resolving the question of the form of its organization." Second, it was
agreed that "a united state reserve must be decreed, in principle," but
with the proviso that "each individual collection may defend its right
to inviolability [<i>neprikosnovennost'</i>]" from forced centralization.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  The upshot was that the existing individual fiefdoms were to
  stay intact, which meant, in turn, that the proposed central
  reserve&#8212;and thus also the museums themselves&#8212;would
  have to be supplied entirely through new acquisitions. Thus, while
  these (qualified) ratifications represented significant gains for
  a developing Futurist museology, they nevertheless presented IZO
  Narkompros with new problems: What principles would guide the
  organization of the new Museum of Artistic Culture (and also,
  therefore, of the museum network overall)? What principles would
  shape its acquisitions policy?

<p>
In the following sections, I turn to consider the two most
important&#8212;and in the end antagonistic&#8212;theoretical models
advanced on the museum question in the wake of Petrograd: on the one
hand, that of Kandinsky, a vanguard painter who was, however, neither
a Khlebnikovian Futurist nor particularly committed to October, and,
on the other, that of Rodchenko, a Futurist <i>engag&eacute;</i>. Each
artist played a crucial role in the

<b></b>

initial organization and administration of the new museums: Kandinsky from
a position of considerable authority, Rodchenko as his insurgent young
comrade and eventual antagonist. While predominantly speculative in their
scope and ambition, each model was nevertheless formulated within and in
response to the concrete historical task of establishing and running the
very first of the new contemporary art museums&#8212;that in Moscow. In
the course of differentiating how each artist imagined this museum and,
by extension, the entire network of such museums, it will become evident
that the dialectical struggle between Kandinsky and Rodchenko that came
to dominate the Moscow avant-garde in the early 1920s&#8212;and that
led directly to the emergence of constructivism&#8212;was first played
out within the context of sustained museological experimentation.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
The Museum as a History of Composing
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Shortly after the Petrograd conference, Kandinsky was appointed founding
director of both the Moscow museum and the museum network overall,
as well as a key member of its Purchasing Commission. As such, his
responsibilities included overseeing acquisitions, distribution, and
the organization and administration of the museums themselves.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  In this labor-intensive task, Kandinsky was assisted by a Museum
  Bureau, which carried out the onerous administrative work of
  registration and storage. In 1919, this Bureau was run by the Latvian
  painter Aleksandr Drevin, with the assistance of his compatriot Karl
  Ioganson as its "technical specialist," and from February 1920 onwards
  by Rodchenko.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
  As mentioned at the outset, the Moscow museum opened in early
  1920, but not as a Museum of Artistic (<i>Khudozhestvennoi</i>)
  Culture&#8212;as IZO itself had initially proposed&#8212;but
  of Painterly (<i>Zhivopisnoi</i>) Culture. While the adjectives
  "artistic" and "painterly" were often used interchangeably, the
  former was much broader in its encompass, abrogating the traditional
  distinction between high and low, while the latter was restricted to
  the fine arts, and thereby reinstantiated it.

<p>
Given that Kandinsky was no Futurist <i>engag&eacute;</i>, his
appointment may perhaps seem somewhat surprising. Having spent most of
the preceding two decades in Germany, Kandinsky had returned to Moscow
after the outbreak of the First World War. In 1918, he accepted an
invitation to join the Moscow Collegium of IZO Narkompros, but without
committing himself to the politics of the new government. In retrospect,
it seems plausible to suggest that Kandinsky was appointed in 1919 as the
Bolsheviks' chief arbiter on the museum question not only on account of
his considerable international success and reputation abroad, but also
because his own formation as an artist had been largely removed from
the iconoclasm and internecine rivalries of the Russian avant-garde. In
other words, Kandinsky represented a voice of moderation that could be
entrusted with the difficult task of mediating the conflicting agendas of
radical leftists such as Malevich, on the one hand, and of conservative
artists cum museum professionals like Grabar, on the other.

<p>
In a long essay published in January 1920, Kandinsky discusses IZO's
museological agenda as it had been shaped under his direction over the
course of the year or so

<b></b>

since the Petrograd conference ("MZhK," 18-20; "MCP," 1:437-44). He
envisages the Moscow museum as setting forth the history of painting from
the mid-nineteenth century to the present, including not only Russian
but also French works, the latter drawn from the former Shchukin and
Morozov collections. By history Kandinsky does not mean chronicle. The
MZhK, he writes, will avoid a merely chronological account in which
the position of a work of art within the museum is a function of its
date. Such chronicling&#8212;or "historical sequencing" as he puts
it&#8212;is an utterly "chaotic" way in which to track art's development
over time. Unfortunately, however, it remains the most pervasive approach
to museum organization, both in Russia and abroad:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Museums divide art up into period after period, century after century,
regardless of whether one period has any relation to another, apart
from that of historical sequence. Thus the usual type of museum is
reminiscent of some chronicle that draws its thread from one event to
the next, without seeking to penetrate their inner meaning. Such art
historical museums have a definite value as a treasury of artistic
production. . . . [But] the evident deficiency of this kind of museum
is . . . its lack of any guiding principle or system. ["MZhK," 18;
"MCP," 1:437]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In faulting the presentation of historical sequence as lacking in guiding
principle or system, Kandinsky appears to be speaking to the positivist
dilution over the course of the nineteenth century of a famously
paradigmatic model of the modern museum&#8212;Karl Friedrich Schinkel's
Altes Museum (1823-1830) in Berlin. Controversial in its time, Schinkel's
design for the Altes Museum had overturned the then-prevailing academic
model for museum display, wherein a canon of great masterpieces of
painting and sculpture was assembled to provide exemplars for imitation,
irrespective of their particular place within a historical sequence. The
latter model, predicated upon a concept of normative beauty, had dominated
museum organization during a period when museums were directly connected
to the pedagogical functions of art academies. In the Altes Museum, by
contrast, Schinkel confined the academic model to a single space&#8212;a
rotunda filled with exemplary works of classical sculpture&#8212;while
designing all the remaining galleries in such a way as to accommodate
a chronological narrative of the history of art.

<p>
But this narrative was to be no merely positivist chronicle. As
Douglas Crimp has argued, Schinkel's design enshrined a new notion
of the museum that was indebted not only to the art historians on his
advisory committee, but also to his friend G. F. W. Hegel's lectures on
aesthetics (which the philosopher read in Berlin during the very years
of the museum's construction). The galleries of the Altes Museum were to
constitute the physical realization of the progressive and teleological
narrative of history itself; they were to "march" the visitor "through
the history of man's striving for Absolute Spirit."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
  From Kandinsky's point of view, it was precisely such a guiding
  principle or system that the typical nineteenth-century art-historical
  museum lacked. (In fact, as Yve-Alain Bois has suggested, the narrative
  ordonnance of the Altes Museum did not become the dominant model for
  museum organization until the twentieth century.)
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
  Kandinsky was not seeking a return to the academic model, but rather
  contrasting

<b></b>

two different models for historical construction: one, the merely
"chaotic, historical sequence," the other a Hegelian model in which the
"inner meaning" of art's historical development might be systematically
explicated.

<p>
What, then, would be the guiding principle of Kandinsky's Museum of
Painterly Culture? As discussed above, the IZO Futurists had redefined
aesthetic value in terms of formal invention,
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
  thereby proclaiming their relative disinterest in the broader
  ideological or historical conditions informing artistic production. In
  accordance with IZO's position, Kandinsky proposes that the Moscow
  museum showcase the "invention . . . of new artistic devices
  [<i>priemov</i>]" and the "development of purely artistic forms,
  independent of their content."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
  Like his colleagues, Kandinsky hypostatizes the technology of the work
  of art&#8212;the formal or technical aspects of its making&#8212;as
  the guiding principle for the construction of a new narrative of the
  history of art as a history of pure invention.

<p>
One of the main functions of Kandinsky's proposed organization of
the MZhK was to provide a history&#8212;in the sense of a historical
pedigree&#8212;that would authorize, as it were, the explicitly
formal preoccupations of contemporary art, such as the compositional
concerns of his own series of large-scale "Compositions" of abstract
or quasi-abstract forms that he had completed in Munich in 1913 to
great acclaim. From Kandinsky's point of view, the formal problems
of composition and relational balance constituted the main problems of
artistic production, and while their resolution was for him primarily the
means to an expressive end&#8212;the communication to the viewer of the
"state of his soul"&#8212;these problems nevertheless directly shaped
his ultimate objective for the MZhK, which was to foreground the history
of art as a history of "composing," as opposed to "transcribing."

<p>
As such, Kandinsky's new organizational model sought to dislodge from
center stage the darling of museum professionals in the early twentieth
century, namely, the mid-nineteenth-century Russian realist painter
Il'ya Repin. Kandinsky considered realism, which had arisen in Russia
in the 1860s in protest against the idealism with which the academic
doctrine of imitation had tempered mimetic illusionism, an aberration
within the history of art. The slavish imitation of appearances leads,
he asserted, to weak draughtsmanship and the neglect of composition.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
  Kandinsky proposed, accordingly, a drastic reduction in the quantity
  of realist works to be included in the MZhK. In their place, he
  hoped to narrate the <i>longue dur&eacute;e</i> of composition,
  by presenting a teleological narrative of the history of painting
  which one could potentially imagine as culminating&#8212;not in a
  positivist sense but rather in terms of the realization of history's
  "guiding principle"&#8212;in the Munich Compositions.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
The Museum as Laboratory
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
By the time the MZhK finally opened in late March 1920, however, the
historicizing ambition of both IZO's original proposal and its theoretical
revision and expansion by Kandinsky had been abandoned. Instead, the
new museum was devoted exclusively to the work of living artists. This
substantial modification did not bother radical leftists

<b></b>

on IZO's payroll, such as Rodchenko, who were vastly more interested in
shaping the present and the future than in constructing past pedigree.

<p>
Over the course of 1919, Rodchenko and Stepanova had developed a close
friendship with Kandinsky, and since September of that year had been
living in the house of Vasily and Nina on Dolgii pereulok.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
  But Rodchenko's increasing involvement with the Museum through the
  course of 1920&#8212;in February 1920 he replaced Drevin as Bureau
  Head&#8212;coincided with his growing impatience with Kandinsky's
  artistic and museological priorities. While Kandinsky had attacked
  the typical historical sequence as but the dilution of art history
  into mere chronicle, Rodchenko went much further.

<p>
In a paper presented to a conference of the regional directors of
IZO Narkompros, Rodchenko proposes stripping IZO's museums of any
historicizing function whatsoever. The art-historical museum of the
past, he asserts, bears "the form of an archive"&#8212;within the
vanguard imaginary, an archive being that place to which things are
consigned once they have been brought to resolution or have otherwise
come to an end, a repository for those things with which one has already
finished. As such, the art-historical museum is built only for the benefit
of connoisseurs, amateurs, and ethnographers, Rodchenko continues,
and never for the benefit of artists themselves. Its universalistic
ambitions are encyclopedic and indiscriminate:<br />
to collect anything and everything without observing any kind of
evaluative criteria other than the artist's degree of notoriety. The
archival character of such a museum is underscored by its installation
practices, particularly its "custom of carpeting the walls from top to
bottom" with paintings arranged in chronological sequence.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
To this art-historical museum of the past, Rodchenko contrasts IZO's new
museum which, in being "built upon <i>living</i> [<i>zhivushchikh</i>]
works of art not yet possessing the quality of 'historical value'
(in the narrow sense of this word)," constitutes a "cultural agent"
(<i>kul'turnyi faktor</i>), a dynamic force in the shaping of the
present and the future. The new museum of living works rejects any
hagiographic function: It is built upon works (formal inventions) rather
than authors (a museological reformulation of Heinrich W&ouml;lfflin's
<i>Kunstgeschichte ohne Namen</i>). Its collections are selected according
to two main criteria: First, the degree to which an "inventive factor"
is present in a given work, this factor being that which drives art
forward, destroying any possibility of the latter's transcendence of
its chronotopical specificity: "Everything exists in time and space,
including the work of art." All "dogma," "classical canons," and
notions of "eternal beauty" must be jettisoned, therefore. The second
criterion is a given work's degree of technical or professional skill
(<i>masterstvo</i>). Works are to be grouped and sequenced according
to their respective stages in the development of a particular form or
method, regardless of their author or date of execution. In terms of
installation, the museum's walls will serve as calm and neutral surfaces
upon which paintings will be hung relative to the viewer's eye level
and with adequate room to breathe.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<p>
In a long diary entry of 15 June 1920, Rodchenko begins to flesh out
a model of the museum as a laboratory, prefacing his thoughts with a
note that he had been wanting to write on the subject of "A Museum of
Experimental Technics" (<i>Muzei Eksperimental'noi Tekhniki</i>) ever
since the winter.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
  According to his own testimony,

<b></b>

therefore, the inception of Rodchenko's thinking about the foundation of
such a museum thus roughly coincided with his February 1920 appointment as
Bureau Head and Keeper (<i>Khranitel'</i>) of the MZhK's collections. It
coincided also with his production around this time&#8212;in explicit
rivalry with Malevich's 1918 <i>White on White</i> canvases&#8212;of
a series of <i>Black on Black</i> paintings, wherein <i>faktura</i>
("texture," or the "working of the material")
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
  became the very subject of the work of art, and the art of painting
  a self-reflexive laboratory operation. Rodchenko was not alone
  in this concern. In a March 1920 diary entry, Stepanova remarks
  upon the recent emergence of a group of artists who are engaged in
  "experimental-analytical" work&#8212;including, besides Rodchenko, also
  Ioganson, Vladimir and Georgii Stenberg, and Konstantin Medunetsky
  (in other words, the soon-to-be constructivists)&#8212;who "talk
  about the future liberation of art from painterly culture."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>

<p>
While both Kandinsky and Rodchenko shared a commitment to formulating
a museological practice which would emphasize the procedural aspects
of art making, they did so for quite different reasons. If Kandinsky
sought to construct a historical pedigree for his own preoccupation with
composition as expressive means, Rodchenko believed that the museum should
foreground making as the subject itself of art. Accordingly, Rodchenko's
ambitions with regard to his hypothetical Museum of Experimental Technics
were much grander in both scale and media than IZO's original provision
for a small "section" within the MZhK to be devoted to "experimental
technics in painting" (<i>eksperimetnal'noi tekhniki zhivopisi</i>).
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
  While Kandinsky had agreed that the MZhK would collect "pure"
  experiments in form ("to collect all essential and significant
  experiments with the treatment of raw materials&#8212;[e.g.,]
  <i>faktura</i>"), he insisted that such objects were for study
  purposes only (rather than for exhibition). Acquisitions earmarked for
  a technics-specific section began in February 1920&#8212;again, the
  same month Rodchenko became Head of the Bureau. The first acquisition
  for the technics section was a spatial construction by Ioganson;
  works by Rodchenko and the Stenberg brothers soon followed.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
  But for Kandinsky, anxious about the incursion of the positive
  sciences into the realm of art, the value of such experimental works
  lay only in their redress of the previous neglect of the problem
  of form in Russian art. They did not, in his opinion, constitute
  works of art per se because their forms, he asserted, "clothe" no
  "pictorial <i>content</i>."
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
By contrast, Rodchenko seeks to expand the museum's section of so-called
pure experiments into a full-blown Museum of Experimental Technics,
in which the very air will have "the coldness of a laboratory corpse. . . the dryness of mathematical formulae . . . the analyst's sharp,
unrelenting realism," wherein "everything [will be] invented, broken down,
measured, dismembered, calculated, deliberated, reduced to pure formulae."
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
  In a related text entitled "Everything is Experiment" (October
  1920), Rodchenko declared the abolition altogether of the traditional
  disciplinary distinction between the experiment and the work of art,
  declaring all his work to be but "experiment."
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
  Written to accompany his contribution of some fifty nonobjective
  paintings and spatial constructions to the Nineteenth
  State Exhibition&#8212;an exhibition to which Kandinsky also
  contributed&#8212;this wall-mounted manifesto was one of a series
  of interventions

<b></b>

by which Rodchenko announced his "aversion to [Kandinskian] emotion,"
and the coming to an end of his alliance with his former mentor. That
same month, Rodchenko and Stepanova moved out of the Kandinskys'
building and into the living quarters of the Museum Bureau.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
  This split had been a long time coming. According to
  Stepanova&#8212;who began working in the Bureau in October
  1920&#8212;Rodchenko was already aware as early as January 1920
  (that is, at precisely the moment when Kandinsky's essay on the MZhK
  appeared in print and just prior to Rodchenko's becoming Bureau chief),
  that easel painting was exhausted, and that new media and methods of
  art making "besides canvas and brush" were needed. Hence, Stepanova
  suggests, the strength of Rodchenko's conviction as to the necessity
  of founding a Museum of Experimental Technics precisely in order to
  accommodate new pigments (enamel and metallic), new tools (rollers
  instead of brushes), and new methods (the ruling of lines instead
  of free drawing), and the constructing rather than the carving or
  modeling of sculpture.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

<p>
The difference between Kandinsky's and Rodchenko's respective
theorizations of museum organization&#8212;museum as history of composing
versus museum as laboratory&#8212;was further demonstrated by their
approach to the problem of installation. Although no photographs of the
MZhK have been found,
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
  Stepanova's diary contains information apropos its installation
  from which we may infer the general tenor of the way in which
  the disagreement between Kandinsky and Rodchenko played out in
  practice. With the MZhK's definitive installation taking place in late
  May or early June 1920, their disagreement became glaringly evident. A
  sole point of agreement between the two, according to Stepanova, was
  on the issue of abandoning the traditional principle of hanging an
  artist's entire oeuvre within a single gallery; beyond that, their
  approaches radically diverged.

<p>
Stepanova reports that Kandinsky and the painter Robert Fal'k installed
one gallery "without any system" whatsoever, proceeding instead
"simply by feeling." The result was analogous to "the composition of a
painting." "It's good," she admits, "but very emotional." To Kandinsky
Stepanova attributes a so-called eclectic approach to installation,
wherein the main objective was supposedly to create the most pleasing
composition of the overall ensemble of exhibited objects. By contrast,
she continues, Rodchenko's approach was totally "systematic": "from the
start he had in mind a connecting thread [<i>nit'</i>] for the [whole]
gallery." This thread was none other than <i>faktura</i>. One commentator,
the painter V. F. Franketti, described Rodchenko's installation of the
"faktura-gallery" as "incisive." According to Stepanova, Rodchenko's
principle of a connecting or guiding thread was adopted for the
installation of the remaining Volkhonka galleries.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>

<p>
Whether or not Stepanova's comments merely caricature Kandinsky's
installation, it was certainly the case that the latter's museological
model&#8212;a museum that would articulate a teleological narrative of the
history of painting culminating in, say, the Munich Compositions&#8212;had
been thwarted by the restriction of the MZhK's collection to recent
Russian art only. While no less pitched toward conring the MZhK
as a conduit for his own artistic agenda, Rodchenko's museological
model severed this fundamental connection between history and the
museum. Rodchenko not only undermined

<b></b>

Kandinsky's faith in the expressive function of the work of art but
also evacuated the latter's concern with the problem of history,
by elaborating an entirely new function for the museum&#8212;that of
a historyless laboratory of "living forms," wherein the subject of
art was its own production. As such, Rodchenko's model of the museum
as laboratory reprises the substance if not the inflamed rhetoric of
Malevich's initial response to IZO's museological agenda as it had been
presented in Petrograd a year or so earlier. Having sat through the
entire conference, Malevich had protested in the pages of <i>Iskusstvo
kommuny</i> IZO's emphasis on museums devoted to the <i>history</i>
of invention, demanding instead the organization of "laboratories of
a world-wide, creative, building apparatus."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
  Thus while it was Malevich who was the first to test the very limits
  of the concept of museability by suggesting the reconration of
  the museum as a laboratory, it was his young rival Rodchenko and his
  circle who first attempted to instantiate this idea in practice.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
The End of the Laboratory
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In December 1920, Kandinsky resigned as the director of the MZhK in order
to take up a new position in the recently established Russian Academy of
Artistic Sciences, whereupon the museum was placed under the authority
of the Bureau, and Rodchenko appointed as its new director.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
  But while Rodchenko's ambitions for a Museum of Experimental Technics
  shaped his input into the organization of the MZhK, they were not
  ultimately realized on the scale he had intended. Instead, in November
  1920, Rodchenko and his laboratory comrades had to settle for a single
  gallery within the museum overall, and even this space seems to have
  been difficult to secure.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
  Among the works included in this gallery were relief constructions
  by Tatlin, a black <i>faktura</i> painting by Rodchenko, a spatial
  construction by Konstantin Medunetsky, and a painting entitled <i>White
  Circle</i> by Vladimir Stenberg.
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>

<p>
In this gallery, Rodchenko and his circle of soon-to-be constructivists
sought to abrogate the traditional conception of the space of exhibition
as an arena for contemplative and sensual pleasure in order to transform
the viewer's relationship to the practice of viewing along the very same
lines as the inventor's relation to production had been transformed. In
order to grasp the conceptual path of the artist's experiment, viewers
would have to adopt an "analytical method" which, as Stepanova put it,
was based not on contemplation but on "experimental cognition," "active
thought," and "laboratory work."
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
  The laboratory artists did not seek to eradicate consumption so much
  as to rescue it from the realm of leisure and contemplation for that
  of labor, thereby adumbrating a model wherein consumption was stripped
  of its former association with acquisition and newly reconred as
  the perceptual activity of an activated, revolutionary subject. The
  consumption of art, in other words, was retheorized as a mirror of
  its production, and Khlebnikov's galactic division thereby called
  into question.

<p>
The ultimate ramifications for Futurist museology of this quest for
an activated mode of consumption were set forth by Stepanova in her
catalogue entry for a group

<b></b>

show held in September 1921 at the Poets' Union on Tverskaia&#8212;the
so-called 5 x 5 = 25 exhibition:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Composition is the contemplative approach of an artist in his creative
work. Technics and Industry have presented art with the problem of
construction as active work and not as contemplative fine art. The
"sacred" value of the work of art, as a singular, unique object, has
been destroyed. The museum, as the repository of this unique object,
turns into an archive.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The connection between this little known declaration of the loss of
aura&#8212;the destruction of the sacred value of the work of art as a
unique object&#8212;and Walter Benjamin's more than famous "Work of Art"
essay was first drawn by Benjamin H. D. Buchloh in 1984.
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
  If aura was defined by Benjamin as the "unique phenomenon of a
  distance," a remove or separation between the viewer and object of
  his or her gaze, "however close it may be," a kind of psychological
  inapproachability or authority that results from the object's
  rootedness in tradition ("The uniqueness of a work of art is
  inseparable from its being imbedded in the fabric of tradition"),
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
  then it was precisely this distance that the laboratory practitioner
  sought to overcome by replacing a traditionally passive, contemplative
  gaze with an activated, productive one. Stepanova's concern, then,
  was the desanctification of not only the unique object, but also the
  act of perception itself.

<p>
Its aura destroyed, its "pull" extinguished, the work of art, from
Stepanova's point of view, no longer had the power to enthrall, absorb,
stupefy; and the museum, as its storehouse, was thus no longer a locus
of enchantment. Redundant, the museum became an archive, the place
to which one consigned that which has already reached its end. The
archive was now the condition of all museums&#8212;including the museum
as laboratory&#8212;Stepanova seems to suggest, and not just that of
the traditional art-historical museum to which Rodchenko had earlier
referred. While one might read Stepanova's declaration as indicative of
her conception of the museum <i>of the future</i> as an archive&#8212;and
hence, perhaps, as encapsulating a kind of institutional critique
avant la lettre ("FF," 90-2)&#8212;such an interpretation would seem to
depend upon a conflation of the laboratory model of "active consumption"
with the notion of the "museum as archive," a conflation unwarranted by
Stepanova's text as I read it. The archival condition of the museum was
instead an emphatically negative one for Stepanova&#8212;it was precisely
that which rendered that institution a now altogether irrelevant vestige
of the past. Although she does not refer to any particular examples in
her brief catalogue statement, it seems to me that the Moscow MZhK would
certainly not have escaped this condition, for at least two reasons:

<p>
The first has to do with the situation of the MZhK itself at the time
of the 5 x 5 = 25 exhibition. In July 1921, Narkompros had closed
the Volkhonka galleries and the Museum's collection had been packed
into crates while new premises were sought. The Museum's closure and
relocation seems to have been mostly connected to the 1921 restructuring
of the Narkompros bureaucracy, but the Bureau had also been subject
to an extremely hostile audit by state authorities (Rabkrin) in May of
that year.
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>

<b></b>

These various developments appear to have been extremely demoralizing
for Rodchenko and Stepanova on account of the sheer amount of energy
they had expended on the Museum. Although Rodchenko was still nominally
its director until March 1922, he and Stepanova seem to have refused
any involvement with its administration after August 1921.
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
  At the time of the 5 x 5 = 25 exhibition, the Museum was in boxes
  and its future uncertain.

<p>
The second, and more important, reason for the reorientation of
Stepanova's thinking about the museum in September 1921 had to do with
a radical shift within the constructivist camp itself. Over summer and
fall 1921 the constructivists had become increasingly dissatisfied with
what they derided as "easelism" (a pejorative neologism for the arts
of painting and sculpture). In November 1921, as is well known, they
collectively abandoned easelism altogether, consigning to this category
<i>also</i> their laboratory experiments of the previous year, and, in
the name of securing their own passage from the realm of the aesthetic
into that of the real, announced the transformation of constructivism
into an art of production (i.e., productivism), wherein all energy
would be dedicated to the designing of everyday life. The 5 x 5 = 25
exhibition was an important step en route to this major shift. Although
Stepanova's thoughts were evidently moving faster than her work (she
exhibited rative paintings), among Rodchenko's contributions to 5
x 5 = 25 was his troika of monochromes, <i>Pure Red Color</i>, <i>Pure
Yellow Color</i>, and <i>Pure Blue Color</i>.

<p>
For the constructivists, Rodchenko's monochromes signified that the
history of art, as it had been conceived in the eighteenth century
with the birth of aesthetics and art's isolation from its ritual or
religious function, had reached its end. But this coming to an end
resulted from the expiration of not only its internal dynamic (its
self-reflexive pursuit of painting's irreducible materiality), the
critic and constructivist apologist Nikolai Tarabukin argues, but also
of its external dynamic: the "democratization of the social structure in
Russia" that had eradicated the very class that had fostered the growth
of easel painting since the late sixteenth century. The constructivist
group's subsequent collective call to production was theorized not as
the beginning of yet another aesthetic movement, but as the advent of
another cultural epoch altogether, in which the needs of the new "mass
viewer" (<i>massovyi zritel'</i>) would replace those of the erstwhile
"class consumer" (<i>klassogo potrebitelia</i>).
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
  The immediate ramification of this shift for Rodchenko and Stepanova's
  museological enterprise was that, having theorized the MZhK as a
  laboratory (a site of active rather than passive production and
  consumption)&#8212;a model partially realized in the designation
  within the MZhK of a separate gallery devoted to experimental
  technics&#8212;they discarded this model altogether in 1922 in
  favor of the factory floor, the designer's workshop and, eventually,
  the darkroom.

<p>
From 1922 on, the constructivists no longer sought to orchestrate the
active consumption of works of easelist art, therefore, but rather
the consumption of the <i>bytovoi</i> (the realm of everyday life), as
opposed to the <i>zhivoi</i> (the realm of aesthetic and philosophical
speculation). The "stagnating slime" of <i>byt</i>&#8212;the conventions
and habits of everyday life&#8212;was thus no longer to be repressed,
but instead dynamically activated by the reinvigoration of the objects
with which, and environments within which, everyday

<b></b>

life was carried out. Rodchenko's design for a <i>Workers' Club</i>,
for example, installed in the Soviet Pavilion at the Exposition
Internationale des Arts D&eacute;coratifs et Industriels Modernes held
in Paris in 1925, reconred proletarian leisure as a dynamic, active,
propaganda-consuming activity.
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
  But if the Moscow constructivists abandoned their now erstwhile
  ambition to activate the space of the museum as a laboratory,
  their contemporary and chief rival El Lissitzky took up precisely
  this ambition in his extraordinary <i>Demonstrationsr&auml;ume</i>
  realized inDresden in 1926 and Hannover in 1927-28: If the viewer
  had once been "lulled . . . into a certain <i>passivity</i>" by
  conventional exhibition practice, Lissitzky writes, "[my] design
  should make the man <i>active</i>."
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>

<p>
What was the ultimate fate of the MZhK, once Kandinsky and the
constructivists had left it behind? In December 1921, Kandinsky
headed off to the Weimar Bauhaus on a cultural mission on behalf of
the Russian Academy of Artistic Sciences. He never returned. Stepanova
and Liubov Popova became involved in textile production at the First
State Textile Print Factory (formerly the Tsindel'), Ioganson in the
design of production apparati at Krasnyi Prokatchik, and Rodchenko in,
among a great many other things, graphic design for the state trust for
agricultural products, Mossel'prom. In the meantime, the MZhK remained
in storage for nearly a year, reopening only in April 1922 in smaller
premises on Povarskaia Street under a new director, Petr Vil'iams,
a middle-of-the-road painter who championed precisely those easelist
values that the constructivists had rejected in fall 1921. To raise funds,
Vil'iams even sought to sell the Museum's collection of three-dimensional
work on the grounds that such work was incompatible with its profile as
a museum of <i>painterly</i> culture.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
  In 1924, the MZhK moved to the former Stroganov school on Rozhdestvenka
  in 1924,
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
  where it remained until 1928, when it was made a branch of the
  Tretyakov Gallery, and then a department within the latter and finally,
  in 1929, abolished altogether. What the Tretyakov's custodians deemed
  "museum-worthy" in the MZhK (e.g., Kandinsky's abstract compositions)
  was then merged with its collections; the rest (e.g., the laboratory
  constructivists' experimental technics) was sold or otherwise
  "liquidated."

<p>
But there is a further chapter to the story of the Russian museums
of contemporary art. During the winter of 1927-28, the future founding
director of New York's Museum of Modern Art, Alfred Barr, spent two months
in Moscow and Leningrad scouting out recent developments. In his diary,
Barr records a visit to the Moscow MZhK on Rozhdestvenka where he "found
the best collection of the finest twentieth-century Russian painters,
better by far than the Tretyakov. . . . The cubists, cubo-futurists, and
suprematists were there in serried ranks, also the postexpressionists."
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
  Two days later he was in the studio of Rodchenko and
  Stepanova. Rodchenko, apparently, answered Barr's questions "in a
  rather disgruntled manner, insisting that the past bored him utterly
  and that he couldn't remember at all when he had painted this way or
  that. . . . [but he] showed much satisfaction at having delivered the
  death blow to painting in 1922 [<i>sic</i>]." To which Barr retorts
  smugly in the privacy of his diary that new groups of

<b></b>

Russian easel painters "have thriven" since 1922 ("RD," 125), thus
evading the historical significance of Rodchenko's declaration of the
death of painting&#8212;namely, the constructivists' shift into industrial
production, and their adoption of technologies of mechanical reproduction
and collective distribution.
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>

<p>
One of the last entries in Barr's diary recounts his visit to the Russian
Museum in Leningrad, into which had been folded in the summer of 1926 some
five hundred works from the Petrograd Museum of Artistic Culture. Its
curator Punin&#8212;"perhaps the finest of Russian critics of modern
art," according to Barr&#8212;walked the latter through the modern
galleries, which then comprised what was known as the Department of New
Tendencies. The collection on display was small (about fifty paintings)
but well chosen&#8212;"exactly the sort of collection which we lack in
any American gallery except Duncan Phillips's" ("RD," 136). In 1929,
the year that the Tretyakov liquidated the Moscow MZhK, Barr played a
crucial role in MoMA's foundation. Before any account of the genealogical
connection between Futurist museology and Barr's own enterprise can be
attempted, however, a fully diachronic history of the former between the
years 1919 and 1929 would need to be written. Suffice to say, in closing,
that the form in which Barr saw those collections in 1928 in the Russian
Museum bore little resemblance to the museological ambitions&#8212;the
laboratory of living forms that would activate the viewer and thereby
constitute a new, revolutionary subjectivity&#8212;that Rodchenko's
circle had had for them in the aftermath of October.

No substantive history of the Moscow MZhK has been written; the present
discussion thus draws together scattered archival and other primary
sources such as conference proceedings, polemical essays, diaries,
and contemporary guidebooks. Over the course of the last decade,
Svetlana Dzhafarova has been researching the fate of contemporary
art sent by Moscow to provincial cities; see "The Creation of the
Museums of Painterly Culture," in <i>The Great Utopia: The Russian
and Soviet Avant-Garde, 1915-1932</i> (New York: Guggenheim Museum,

"I don't think we need to build sarcophagi of treasures, to build Meccas
for worship. . . . Any collection of old stuff is harmful. . . . We
must not allow our institutions to be platforms for the past. Our
task is always to move toward the new. To live in museums is not for
us. . . . Instead of collecting all kinds of old stuff, we must organize
laboratories of a world-wide, creative, building apparatus, and from
its axes will emerge artists of living forms [<i>zhivykh form</i>],
not of dead representations of objects. Let the conservatives go to the
provinces with their dead baggage, with the lecherous Erotes of the bygone
debauched houses of Rubens and El Greco. While we will bring I-beams,
electricity and the fires of colors." Kazimir Malevich, "O muzee,"
