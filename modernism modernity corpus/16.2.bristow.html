<h1 class="sec-headA">Mew and Literary History</h1>
<p>Few modern writers have proved as hard to place, both culturally and historically, as Charlotte Mew (1869–1928), the English author whose faltering attempts at securing her literary reputation, which began in the mid-1890s, only came to fruition a generation later when her second, expanded edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> —the only book she published in her lifetime—won plaudits on both sides of the Atlantic. While scholars have frequently drawn attention to the accolades that Mew's poetry received from both established res such as Thomas Hardy ("the greatest poetess I have come across lately") and younger authors such as Virginia Woolf ("very good and interesting and unlike anyone else"), they have reached little consensus about the period or movement to which Mew belongs.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> On the one hand, critics have categorized Mew as a distinctly fin-de-siècle re whose career remains firmly rooted in the literary ethos of the 1890s and early 1900s: the decades when most of her early publications were short stories and essays that appeared in a diverse range of late-Victorian periodicals, including Henry Harland's decadent <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span>, W. E. Henley's imperialist <span style="font-style:italic;">Outlook</span>, and that bastion of middle-class taste, <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span>. On the other hand, readers have claimed Mew as a female modernist whose poetic innovations developed in the 1910s, even if her revisions of conventional prosody were not of the kind that readily linked her with Imagism: the short-lived movement that for T. S. Eliot defined the "<span style="font-style:italic;">point de repère</span>" that marked "the starting-point of modern poetry."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Such commentaries support this observation <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  by pointing out that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Egoist</span>, the journal that gave greatest prominence to Imagism in Britain, took serious interest in Mew's idiosyncratic work.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The difficulty in locating Mew's literary-historical position is evident in several important feminist studies that have contributed to the scholarly recovery of women's writing of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In her significant assessment of women's poetry written between the 1820s and the 1910s, Angela Leighton asserts that "in spirit Charlotte Mew is one of the last Victorians," mostly because the "sensibility and imagery" of her writing "looks back to the women poets"—such as Emily Brontë, Christina Rossetti, and Alice Meynell—"who preceded her."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Meanwhile, to Elaine Showalter, Mew fits more squarely within the group that she calls the "daughters of decadence."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> This cohort of <span style="font-style:italic;">flâneuses</span>, New Women, and emergent suffragists produced sexually risk-taking stories frequently issued by John Lane, the publisher who supported Harland's journal. By contrast, Celeste M. Schenck expresses discontent at the manner in which modern readers, no matter how much they acknowledge Mew's originality, "tend at the same time to censure her for her small, unoracular formalism."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> As a result, even feminist critics have been unable to "read beyond what they see as the rhythmical familiarity and rhyme to a strikingly unconventional content" whose insubordinate sexual politics makes Mew's output markedly post-Victorian.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> More recently, some researchers have sought to place Mew within an identifiable canon of modernist women's poetry (including work by Frances Cornford and Anna Wickham), one that, even if it does not break with fixed forms, is perceptibly—if not radically—"resisting femininity" of a conventional type.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Such discussions occasionally put pressure on the idea that Mew's modernism can also be heard through the echoes that several of her monologues supposedly make in T. S. Eliot's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> .<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In many respects, Mew's inimitable poetry—the at first "unintelligible" verse in "irregular but rhymed meter" that struck the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times Literary Supplement</span> in 1916 as having the "grotesque inconsequence of dream"—creates problems for literary historians because it often dramatizes situations in which her speakers experience what it means to be out of sync with, if not out of place in, their worlds.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Although her comparatively slender body of poetry contains a number of fairly conventional sonnets, ballads, and lyrics dating from the early 1900s, the writings on which Mew's reputation rests are largely the dramatic poems she completed between 1912 and 1915. More often than not, these arresting works test the limits of fixed forms by expanding and contracting line lengths in a style that enables her characteristically distressed personae to express themselves in an urgent, impulsive manner. More to the point, the "extraordinary . . . indigenous originality" that Marianne Moore detected in this group of poems is unusual because Mew's disjointed, emotionally raw poetic voices also at times recall a fairly wide range of well-known nineteenth-century precursors.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Some of the works collected in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> allude to famous lyrics and monologues by Robert Browning, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Alfred Tennyson, and they share much of these earlier writers' subject-matter, especially topics such as crises in religious faith, prostitution, and sexual infidelity. Concurrently, at the very moment when her speakers appear to be thematically linked with a literary ancestry that sometimes reaches back <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  even further to the High Romantics, her poetry takes pains to disrupt its formal ties with the outdated tradition that it references.</p>
<p>In her best-known poems, Mew presents an array of male and female personae that adopt retrospectives on their unhappy lives while imagining the impossibility of continuing their present existence. Although it is misleading to conclude that such writings anticipate Mew's decision, at the age of fifty-eight, to take her life (these are not poems in which her speakers plan to commit self-murder), it is difficult not to be struck by the visceral deathly notes that resound at the end of these poems: "I shall, perhaps, grow old and die" ("Pécheresse"), "I shall always, always be very cold" ("The Changeling"), "some day I <span style="font-style:italic;">shall</span> not think; I shall not <span style="font-style:italic;">be</span>!" ("The Quiet House"), and "I shall strike and tear / Mine [heart] out, and scatter it with yours" ("The Forest Road").<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> As these brief quotations suggest, her poetic voices emphasize the prospect of their own annihilation, and they do so because the position in which they speak remains burdened by harrowing past experiences. In other words, both in form and structure Mew's poems exert themselves in defamiliarizing, and thus modernizing, a well-established genre that her speakers have no further wish to inhabit. Given that Mew's personae are characterized by their categorical refusal to remain caught in, let alone be determined by, the dissatisfying experiences that haunt them, her writing often appears driven by a desire to step outside history, especially the literary history that her work embraces and repudiates at once. My present aim is to analyze the reasons why the distinctive poetics that Mew developed, after long delays, tend to confound the critical frameworks that seek to orient her writing to either the beginning or the latter part of the period (1894 to 1928) when she appeared in some of the most prominent publications that defined fin-de-siècle decadence, on the one hand, and emergent literary modernism, on the other hand. Furthermore, I suggest the reasons why Mew's poetry, whose irregular rhythms and rhymes direct attention to the disorderly modernity that both energizes her art and estranges her troubled speakers, draws into question critical and cultural imperatives that try to fix anyone or anything in time.</p>
<p>That Mew's personae emphatically wish not to linger any longer with troubling after-effects is evident in one of her most compelling writings: a twenty-four-line monologue that focuses on poetic success called "Fame," which first appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Weekly</span> in 1913. This poem provides a useful starting-point for exploring Mew's propensity for evoking a literary heritage that she is eager not just to undermine but escape. As its title suggests, this poem, which modulates between four- and sixteen-syllable rhymed lines, recalls John Keats's two 1819 sonnets that re "Fame" as either a gypsy-blooded "wayward girl" or a seductress who threatens to "rob" the male poet's "fair name of its maidenhood."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Similarly, this monologue reminds us of William Wordsworth's reflections in 1820 on how "hasty Fame"—which has wrongfully "many a chaplet culled / For worthless brows"—left the eighteenth-century poet John Dyer "ungraced."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Mew's "Fame" follows this line of thought, by exploring, with comparable misgivings, the fickle nature of this alluring feminine re, whose seductive beauty later emerges as the personification that titles her poem—which begins as follows: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Sometimes in the over-heated house, but not for long,<br>     Smirking and speaking rather loud,<br>   I see myself among the crowd,<br>Where no one fits the singer to his song,<br>Of sifts the unpainted from the painted faces<br>Of the people who are always on my stair</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 2).</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the implicitly (though not definitively) male speaker reveals that at times when he has indulged in his crowd-pleasing fame, he has also reminded himself of a past when he was more or less anonymous.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> As he reflects upon those days when he was just one among the many, Mew's poetic celebrity—who is now mobbed by people of fashion—recognizes that such fandom remains at odds with his art: "They were not with me when I walked in heavenly places" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 2). Simultaneously, however, he realizes that he cannot exist solely in this glorified artistic realm because his reputation is dependent on the "din, the scuffle, [and] the long stare" of the very people who throng around him (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 2). "[C]ould I spare" the "faces / Of the people," he asks, "If I went back" to this "heavenly" realm and found that "it" (his audience of devotees) "was not there" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 2)? The problem, it seems, is that he gradually sees that the nature that inspires his ostensibly Romantic poetry, such as "The folded glory of the gorse" and "the sweet-briar air," exists in a state of indifference to humanity: "the larks cannot praise us . . . knowing nothing of what we do," just as the "divine, wise trees . . . do not care" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 2). In his growing disillusionment, he eventually grasps that he can derive no satisfaction from either the acolytes in the "over-heated house" who praise him or the "old known things that are new" (that is, the things that keep reproducing themselves) in nature with which he cannot interact.</p>
<p>Little wonder that Mew's speaker decides that the time might have come to "leave Fame" behind, despite this female re's bewitching "eyes" and "bright hair!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 2). Before he bids farewell to this enticing Romantic icon, however, his mind focuses on fulfilling one last ambition, and it is here that Mew's poem changes course. At last, he wishes to depart from "Fame" and "Take in her stead / To our tossed bed / One little dream, not matter how small, how wild" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 3). Just at the moment when he recognizes that this final wish might sound both eccentric and insignificant, he states that he thinks he has found it "in a field, under a fence—/ A frail, dead, new-born lamb, ghostly and pitiful and white" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 3). What might we make of the fulfillment of his desire to exchange the sensuality of "Fame" for this stillborn creature in the slept-in bed? Why should this poem end with the speaker's yearning to nestle with the corpse of an animal whose iconography points in divergent directions to the sacrifice made by Jesus Christ, on the one hand, and to the vagaries of natural selection, on the other hand? The fact that we learn that the creature is "A blot upon the night," as well as "The moon's dropped child" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 3) prompts additional thoughts about the ways in which it is both a welcome source of disration and one of the casualties of an unforgiving nature. As Leighton says, it is hard not to think of this "new-born lamb" as a "miscarried birth."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> This striking conclusion shows that Mew's speaker embraces a creature whose premature demise makes the sexual excitement traditionally associated with the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  female icon "Fame" look pretentious, if not meaningless. By disclosing how the speaker finally wants to lie down with this dead lamb (in a gesture that echoes many parts of the Bible), Mew's poem suggests that her art finds value in thrusting aside questionable nineteenth-century aesthetic ideals in the name of treasuring what a far-from-benign nature has discarded. In other words, her speaker concentrates attention on giving artistic worth to a "frail" body, in a manner that might, like the biblical ration of Jesus Christ as the lamb of God, redeem poets from the "over-heated," egotistical ambition to receive praise from an unworthy, fashionably "painted" crowd.</p>
<p>In "Fame," however, no matter how Christ-like we might find the disring "blot" of the stillborn lamb, it remains the case that this perturbing image shows that the imaginative future into which Mew's speaker wishes to inscribe his fame-free identity is born dead on arrival. At the same time, the speaker exuberantly celebrates this "little dream" of finding a "frail, dead" creature through spirited deviations from fixed forms that destabilize, both visually and audibly, common aspects of the dramatic monologue: the well-established poetic genre, dating from the late 1820s and 1830s, in which Mew's contemporaries agreed she excelled. Yet it would be mistaken to assume that in "Fame" Mew simply amplifies the type of frantic monologist that Browning memorably featured in his early volume, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dramatic Romances and Lyrics</span> , where we see, for example, the hypocritical Bishop of St. Praxed's struggling to maintain his speech, couched in blank verse, on his death-bed. The bishop's famous wish is to have the last word on the gaudy, tasteless tomb that he wants his "Nephews" (his euphemism for his illegitimate sons) to build for him, when he knows in fact their only reason why they clamor around him is to grab whatever they can from his legacy.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Habitually, Browning's personae resemble the bishop in so far as they remain eager to delay and defer any event that might bring their often garrulous monologues to an unwanted end.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> By marked contrast, in "Fame" Mew's speaker hurtles, from one capricious line to another, toward a self-destructive climax: an implosion that occurs because he can at last obliterate the present moment in which he recognizes that his renown relies on his conceited "Smirking" and his self-important manner when "speaking rather loud." It is almost as if this ostensibly successful persona finally expresses a wish not to remain in literary history.</p>
<p>In many respects, "Fame" enshrines Mew's suspicion of the literary world that she found particularly tough to enter. Even then, when the expanded edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> benefited from a very favorable reception (Conrad Aiken, for example, applauded Mew's "fine individuality"),<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> she had already run into difficulties in holding onto some of the contacts that brought her to public attention. To be sure, the fact that several important literary res made certain that she received a civil list pension of £75 in 1923 paid testimony to the considerable reputation that she had, in some quarters, established by that year. (Mew informed Hardy, one of the three well-known petitioners for the pension, of her "gratitude" as well as her feeling of "entire unworthiness" for this award.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a>) Furthermore, in 1921, after he provided an enthusiastic notice of the American edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> (published by Macmillan as <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Market</span>), the well-known anthologist Louis Untermeyer helped strengthen <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Mew's profile for American readers, and by 1924, as a consequence of his and Mew's mutual acquaintance with Siegfried Sassoon, he was able to arrange a meeting with the poet, an event that turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences during his visit to England. Betty Falkenberg has shown that, with each successive edition of Untermeyer's <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern British Poetry</span>, Mew received ever-increasing prominence (eleven of her poems appeared in the volumes he edited under this title in 1930 and 1936).<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> But few other critics sustained such attention in Mew's work.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why interest in Mew's poetry soon waned originated in the disheartening preface that Alida Klemantaski furnished for the posthumous volume, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rambling Sailor</span>, which appeared one year after the poet's death. Klemantaski, whose involvement in London's newly-opened Poetry Bookshop had brought her into contact with Mew in 1915, paints a dispiriting picture of Mew's life that did much to undermine the standing that the poet had belatedly enjoyed. Klemantaski comments on the trying circumstances that led to Mew's demise: "no sooner was the financial burden alleviated" through the civil list pension "than her mother died, and her own health broke down."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> "Both these trials were overcome," she continues, "and all seemed ready for a return to a productive life when her beloved sister was stricken with a fatal illness and died after some months of agony." Klemantaski calls this loss the "last attack of Fate" on Mew, who "died . . . by her own hand, on March 24th , 1928." In his review of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rambling Sailor</span> in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bookman</span>, John Freeman concluded that the poet's career comprised "a story of discouragement and neglect."<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> What is more, as Freeman observes, Klemantaski's decision to include in this volume "earlier poems . . . published in half-forgotten magazines, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span>," made Mew appear even more even out of touch with the age. In any case, information about Mew's apparently grueling existence had already been circulated through the obituary that Sydney Cockerell, the curator of the Fitzwilliam Museum who made a great fuss of Mew when he befriended her in 1918, wrote for the London <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span>: "her whole life was a courageous battle with sorrows and adversities that have at last proved too much for her."<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Cockerell suggests that the civil list pension, "which was granted in the hope that it would enable her to do still better work," could not compensate for the "[i]ll-health and the cruel fate which never in her life released her from harassing and tragic cares" that "prevented" its "fulfillment."</p>
<p>Many years later, Klemantaski (now Alida Monro) did her best to give Mew renewed attention in a more expansive memoir in a fresh edition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Collected Poems</span> that enabled a later generation to explore the works of a writer whose career up to that time seemed scarcely worth recording. Monro frames her recollections by giving the impression that what matters most about the poet was not so much her work as her eccentric style of dress and, noticeably, her small stature:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>She was very small, only about four feet ten inches, very slight, with square shoulders and tiny hands and feet. She always wore a long, double-breasted top-coat of tweed with a velvet collar inset. She always carried a horn-handled umbrella, unrolled, under her arm, as if it were psychologically necessary to her, a weapon against the world. She had very fine white hair that showed traces of once having been a warm brown. Her eyes were a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  very dark grey, bright with black lashes, and highly arched dark eyebrows. Her face was a fine oval, and she always wore a little hard felt pork-pie shaped hat put on very straight. The whole time she was speaking she kept her head cocked at a defiant angle. When she came into the shop she was asked: "Are you Charlotte Mew?" and her characteristic reply was: "I am sorry to say I am."<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">From this carefully concocted picture, it is hard not to receive the impression that this petite, aging, and eccentric woman was battling against the odds with a world that tended to adopt (and often reject) her in a manner that made her feel that she did not have a proper or acceptable place.</p>
<p>Alida Monro's portrayal of Mew's diffident behavior and distinctive demeanor clearly aimed to repackage her for an audience who might otherwise believe that the poet was an unexceptional relic from the past. When Marianne Moore gave her endorsement to Macmillan of New York to issue an American edition of the British one that Alida Monro had prefaced, she observed that much of Mew's poetry was not "as Mrs. Monro seems to fear—out of style or 'dated.'"<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> The 1953 edition, however, hardly elevated Mew's work into the canon. Mary C. Davidow's 1960 doctoral dissertation, which provides a rich source of information for understanding Mew's career, did not make its way into print. By 1973, as John Newton remarks, the first <span style="font-style:italic;">Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry</span> contained none of Mew's poems.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> It took until 1981 before Val Warner gathered Mew's known writings together in one volume. In a notice of Warner's edition, English novelist Penelope Fitzgerald declared that Mew "changed very little for about thirty years of her life."<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> "She was," Fitzgerald added, "tiny, trim, curly-headed, and pale, wearing size-two boots—doll's boots."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Fitzgerald elaborated the poet's almost timeless oddity in <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlotte Mew and Her Friends</span> : an attentive biographical study that left Brad Leithauser with an overall impression of Mew as a "patchy" but gifted writer who produced "some half-dozen lyrics of unique beauty and finish" that "ought to entitle her to a small share of enduring renown."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Ever since the early 1980s, a growing body of scholarship has tended to follow Fitzgerald's lead in assuming that the task of Mew's biographer is "not so much to reconstruct her life as to account for what life did to her."<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> On this view, Mew's poetry bears witness to the emotional wreckage with which she had to contend because of the stressful circumstances of her seemingly claustrophobic home life, the mental illness that afflicted all but one of her surviving siblings, her repeatedly frustrated lesbian desires, and her halting efforts to establish her professional identity.</p>
<p>One of the consequences of the long-overdue recovery of Mew's poetry has been for critics to dwell on a dismal life story in the name of characterizing her as a victimized, marginal, and, from some perspectives, queer individual whose heartbroken death (which occurred after she lost the remaining members of her household) reveals that what success she had enjoyed, including a close friendship with Thomas Hardy and Florence Hardy, simply came too late.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> On occasion, readers have tried to fill the apparent vacuum that was Mew's career in the mid-1890s by assuming that she published under a pseudonym. Davidow maintains that the poet published two lyrics in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span> under the name of Charles Catty, an English writer whose <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  collected works appeared in 1914.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> But this is nothing compared to her speculation that as a young woman Mew conducted an affair with Hardy, an idea that remains a bizarre component in Davidow's otherwise pioneering research.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> In the mid-1990s, Davidow's hunch inspired a novel that exploits first-person narrative to make this presumed liaison into a torrid affair that began in 1893, more than twenty years before Mew was invited to Hardy's home, Max Gate, in 1918: "Hardy took my left hand and began, with infinite care, to remove the glove. Lightly, he caressed each finger through the thin black leather, for several tantalizing moments."<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> As one might predict, in this clumsily handled scene the "second glove fell to the floor."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Yet once he has undressed himself ("his pupils hugely dilated"), Hardy inspires such fear in Mew that she has to repulse his charms: "I'm in agony, too. I'm trapped between a longing for love and an invisible something that forbids it."<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> (The "something," as this particular novelist has gleaned from Fitzgerald's biography, is Mew's lesbianism.)</p>
<p>If, however, we refrain from conjecturing about what happened during the evident hiatuses in Mew's career (as Warner notes, between 1906 and 1912 "nothing is known of her life except that she published [a] poem and had holidays in Dieppe and Boulogne"),<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> then a rather different understanding of her intermittent appearances in literary history can begin to emerge. Fitzgerald's observation that Mew is a "poet of delayed shock"<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> provides a helpful clue to what is arguably central to a small but distinguished poetic canon, which begins with traditional sonnets that involve dialogues with Christina Rossetti's verse, continues with ballads that in some respects echo writings by Rosamund Marriott Watson (whose poetry appeared widely in magazines of the 1880s and 1890s), and develops monologues—such as we have seen in "Fame"—that feature speakers who eagerly insist on their own disintegration. Throughout many of these poems, the present tense serves as the time for recalling disquieting events after a hiatus. While there might appear to be some correspondence between the periodic silences in Mew's publishing history and the experiential delays that preoccupy her writings, the more important point is that from the fin de siècle to the interwar period Mew remained fairly consistent in rehearsing scenarios in which her narrative and poetic voices address the repercussions of such temporal discontinuity. By looking at the sporadic instances when Mew made an impact on the culture of her day, we can see more clearly why her enduring interest in giving voice to characters that have an acute sense of historical dislocation forges a number of literary links, though far from seamless ones, between the 1890s and the 1910s.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Mew's Discontinuities</h1>
<p>Until 1901, Charlotte Mew came before the public as a writer of prose, and her first appearance in print, at the age of twenty-four, suggests that she initially wished to present herself as an avant-garde author who belonged to a distinctly fin-de-siècle generation. Her striking story, "Passed," was included in the second issue of Harland's <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span>: the journal whose polemical life began, as Holbrook Jackson observed in 1913, as "a bombshell thrown into the world of letters."<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Not only did the hardbound <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  quarterly's yellow binding smack of decadent French fiction; Aubrey Beardsley's pro vocative cover image of a devilish-looking man leering at a busty partygoer at a <span style="font-style:italic;">bal masqué</span> was also designed, as its advanced publicity put it, "not to tremble at the frown of Mrs. Grundy." The journal aimed, as Harland's advertising stated, to depart "from the bad old traditions of periodical literature" and "have the courage of its modernness."<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Even though the London <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> acknowledged that the marketing of the periodical aimed to combine "English rowdyism with French lubricity," it nonetheless realized that the journal's claims to such insubordination were a little overstated.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> In its opinion, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span>'s inclusion of established res such as Frederic Leighton and Henry James mingled rather oddly with representatives of the "New Art" and "New Literature" such as Walter Sickert and Arthur Symons.</p>
<p>Mew's presence in the July 1894 number was remarkable for an unheard-of writer. Her story sat next to not only respected authors such as Henry James ("The Coxon Fund") and Austin Dobson (famous in the 1880s for his <span style="font-style:italic;">vers de société</span>) but also individuals who had recently come to attention, including Kenneth Grahame, whose stories—notably "The Rural Pan" —prered the success he would later enjoy with his children's classic, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wind in the Willows</span> . Moreover, Max Beerbohm established his reputation as a satirist in the first two issues of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span>. Similarly, Ella d'Arcy, who became an object of Mew's unrequited passion, contributed one of the tales that affiliated her writing with the pioneering New Woman authors, such as George Egerton, whom John Lane supported. In a memoir, d'Arcy, who became not only the journal's most regular contributor but also its assistant editor, recalled the liveliness of the evening parties that Harland hosted at his home on Cromwell Road. Mew's name appears in d'Arcy's illustrious roll-call of visitors, including Edmund Gosse, the Marriott Watsons, and George Moore.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> This is not surprising because Harland, after reading Mew's story, went so far as to inform her that he thought it "a highly remarkable piece of literature"; it was, he believed, a work eminently suited to the scandal that his journal had recently managed to generate.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> "[F]or that reason," he told Mew, "it is destined to meet with scant recognition from the newspaper reviewers; I think it destined to be violently abused; and the Yellow Book will be abused for printing it."<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>It is worth pausing for a moment with "Passed" because it explores the kinds of experiential disconnectedness that Mew would transfer, much later, into a distinctive poetics that explores how modern subjects cannot but help recall past experiences that disturb them. The jarring modernity of this impressionistic story becomes immediately evident as the first-person <span style="font-style:italic;">flâneuse</span> begins by recounting a day when she impulsively laid down her sewing in preference for the "keen air" outdoors (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 65). As she unravels her memories of an unsettling chance encounter, she leads the reader on a directionless but ever-accelerating path through some of London's poorest areas. Unlike contemporaneous tales, however, that expose the city's working-class deprivation (the unflinching realism of Arthur Morrison's <span style="font-style:italic;">A Child of the Jago</span> [1896] is perhaps the most celebrated example from this period), Mew's narrator describes the "delirium of enchanting motion" that sets her on her way through an urban world in which she seems overwhelmed by the cityscape and the inhabitants that pass in a phantasmagoric <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  pageant before her eyes (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 65). Yet the "glamour" that initially enraptures her—whether in "a girl's uncovered hair" or the "illuminated twilight" that "transre[s]" the "dim res" that populate this shifting urban scene—soon begins to wane (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 66). Rapidly, in a series of events marked by abrupt changes of movement, the narrator discovers everything in her midst is "passing" in the double sense of both moving and dying. Moreover, she grows increasingly aware of the ways in which this transforming environment is filled with distracting images that aim to manipulate passersby. Especially important is her sudden glimpse of a "large chromo" in shop window selling "[p]ictures" that seems "scarcely more inviting"—though less "odiferous"—"than the fishmonger's next door" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 67). The print in question features a "girl at prayer . . . eyes turned upward, presumably to heaven": a pose, as Mew's narrator ironically remarks, that "left the gazer in no state to dwell on the elaborately bared breasts below" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 67). Semi-clad, this apparently holy re embodies a "pseudo-purity" that proves "sensually diverting, and consequently"—in this era of high capitalism—"marketable" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 67). Revolted by the manner in which such dressed-up pornography amounts to the "prostitution" of an aesthetic ideal (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 67), she immediately follows an initiative to seek an authentically holy place, a church built by an architect who passed in 1887, which she enters, only to be unsettled by the dark "obscurity" she finds inside.</p>
<p>Just at the point when the narrator feels frustrated in her efforts to seek some purifying solace in the church, she finds herself "arrested" by a re whose "attitude" contrasts markedly with the sexualized commercialism of the "large chromo." Unable at first to make out the woman whose "lines spoke unquestionable despair," she eventually detects "importunate strength of beauty" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 67, 68). "Her eyes met mine," she recalls, as if mesmerized by this woman's presence (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 78). No sooner has the narrator returned the woman's gaze than she appears to be under her unknown companion's spell. The woman grasps the narrator's hand, and they move "with unpitying speed" to "some blind alley out of the deafening thoroughfare" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 68). Once they have ascended the "unlighted stairs," they enter a candlelit "dazzling room," in which the unnamed woman shudders "violently" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 68, 69). Several small details, including a torn letter possibly bearing a coat-of-arms, imply that the woman who inhabits the "extreme poverty" of these surroundings has been betrayed in love (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 69). At this juncture, the woman begs her companion "to stop, to stay," and, with that, she lies, with her hair "unfastened," "like a broken mechanism" in the narrator's arms, making "incoherent exclamations" about some "recently wrung promise" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 69, 70). As the candles gutter, it appears that the occupant of the room has expired: "The dark eyes unwillingly open reached mine in an insistent stare" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 71). Nursing what she assumes to be a corpse, the narrator is besieged by "phantoms of despair" that push her to the edge of sanity (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 72). Only when she resolves to escape does her sudden movement bring the woman back to life. But once the woman cries aloud, "For God's sake, stay here with me," the narrator throws her to the floor and follows her "sole instinct" of "flight' (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 74), blocking out any memory of "the two lifeless beings lying alone in that shrouded chamber of desolation" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 74). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Yet this disconcerting event, no matter how much the narrator struggles to erase it from her mind, preys on her conscience so much that she later returns to the church, as if to make religious amends for forsaking the desperate woman. As she hears the "the grey-habited nuns . . . singing a long Latin hymn of many verses," she decides that she must "renew . . . her quest," and so she tries to locate the woman once more (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 76). But, try as she might to find the half-dead re, the narrator records that "[h]unger and weariness at length sent" her "home," with "an assortment of embellished negatives ringing in" her "ears" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 76). Only long afterward, when she is taking an evening stroll through a "notorious thoroughfare" in the fashionable West End, does she witness the woman, now dressed "entirely in dull vermilion," accompanying a man who is examining a "silver case" that bears a crest similar to the device printed on the torn letter (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 76, 77). To the narrator, the spectacle of this garishly clad, perfumed individual, whose "confusion of odours" is a "vile enticement" that "outrage[s] Nature," points to the clearest of conclusions: the woman is supporting herself as a prostitute (one of the "insatiate daughters of an everlasting king") who upholds a sexually degrading patriarchy (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 76. 77). No wonder when the "man and woman" meet the narrator's gaze "with a void incorporate stare" they appear as if they share "one avenging visage" that takes pleasure in relishing a "despoiled body" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 77, 78). As she watches the couple turn their backs on her, the narrator hears "a laugh, mounting to a cry," and she is left wondering if this final clamoring sound comes from "some defeated angel," "the woman's mouth" or herself (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 78). Whatever its origins, this grating noise articulates the idea that everyone—the narrator, the man and woman, and the spirit of God—is mocking each other.</p>
<p>In sum, "Passed" represents a series of random encounters and strange recurrences that carefully retraces noticeable patterns of exclusion and estrangement. To begin with, the story counterpoints the dimly-lit sanctity of the church with the "dazzling" features of the sexualized woman's room. Similarly, while the "grey-habited nuns" praise the "Sacred Heart," the kept mistress dons the red clothing linked with prostitution. At the same time, the narrative reveals how heterosexual desire continues to exist in a vengeful, "incorporate" form, while closeness between the two women amounts to a profoundly embodied, though death-like, experience. Even more starkly, there appears to be no institution of authority or form of sociability that might redeem this alienating situation. Neither the nuns' jubilant prayers nor the narrator's considerate care can ameliorate a world in which everyone and everything, including the clang of the carriage wheels that lead the man and the woman away into the distance, creates the same grinding noise that echoes senselessly in her ears. To be sure, the narrator recognizes that "Sabbath bells peal sweeter calls" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 78). But the fact that her own voice sounds as unpleasant as her opponents' accentuates that "Passed" hardly aims at advancing the type of consoling moral familiar to earlier Victorian fiction. Instead, the judgment that Mew's narrator makes on this succession of jolting episodes reveals that it remains impossible for her to find any aesthetic, spiritual, or sexual relief from the disaffecting conditions that characterize modern urban existence. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Mew is not known to have published anything for five years after she made her literary debut with "Passed" in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span>. It appears that she submitted her Cornish tale, "The China Bowl"—a rather conventional tragedy about a man caught between his mother's and his spouse's jealous affections—to Harland, who declined it. Similarly, her story, "An Open Door" had no success at <span style="font-style:italic;">Blackwood's</span>, whose contents during this period included such distinguished works as Joseph Conrad's <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span> . A work of fairly traditional realism, "An Open Door," however, warrants attention because it focuses Mew's marked interest in exploring the ways in which individuals can become alienated from each other when they strive to maintain control over the memory of the dead. Mew's narrator tells the story of the devastating ways in which the massacre of a young woman during her missionary work abroad ultimately divides both the lover she abandoned in the name of religion and the older sister who eventually believes that it is her prerogative to preserve her sibling's "sweetest memory" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 145). The older sister informs him that the deceased probably has a "way of coming back and talking over things" through "remembrance" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 145). It is as if she has come to believe that the dead sibling's spirit lives on in her consciousness. Once the former lover hears these words, he is indignant: "What if," he thinks, "the dead <span style="font-style:italic;">had</span> memories?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 145). If the dead, he concludes, can communicate with the living through memory, then surely he has the sole privilege to relate to the soul of the woman he adored. At the end of the day, the characters are left at odds with each other as they struggle to retain some control over a departed loved one that they sense might, in some supernatural form, coexist with them still.</p>
<p>"An Open Door" eventually found a home in <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span>; this journal, established in the 1860s, helped spawn a group of magazines—such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Argosy</span> (1866–1901), <span style="font-style:italic;">Belgravia</span> (1866–99), and <span style="font-style:italic;">Tinsley's</span> (1867–92)—that set out, as its first editor put it, "to inculcate thoroughly English sentiments—respect for authority, attachment to the Church, and loyalty the Queen."<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> For the most part, <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span> served a diet of essays and stories to the on-the-rise fraction of the middle classes: those "resolute householders who," as Vincent C. de Baun observes, "had lately begun to acquire wealth and education and servants, who read Tennyson and Dickens and thought much about the state of their souls."<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> But by 1898, when the prestigious publisher Macmillan took over the periodical, sales had declined in line with changing literary tastes. Eight years later <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span> ceased publication. In its final phase, when the journal shifted away from leaving many of its contents unsigned, it tried unsuccessfully to appeal to a post-Victorian readership. The magazine featured not only one of d'Arcy's more experimental stories but also included the work of up-and-coming writers, such as E. M. Forster and E. F. Benson.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Between 1899 and 1904, Mew joined this stable of authors by publishing there no less than six short pieces of fiction, five essays, and, noticeably, six poems.</p>
<p>Few of Mew's contributions to <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span> suggest that she was the author of "Passed," and they hardly anticipate the kind of literary innovations that distinguished <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span>. Yet already it is possible to see that even in the formal conventionality of her earliest poems she had an interest in making an explicit break with her <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Victorian literary ancestors. Mew's "Song" ("Oh! Sorrow, Sorrow"), which appeared in 1902, is a self-conscious revision of poem "LIX" in Tennyson's <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memoriam</span> . In Tennyson's lyric elegy, the mournful male poetic voice apostrophizes "Sorrow" as a female personification that might comfort him in his grief. In the course of sixteen four-stress lines, he elaborates his wish to secure the greatest intimacy with her. "O Sorrow, wilt thou live with me," he asks, "No casual mistress, but a wife."<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Bound by such fidelity, he also desires her to "rule" his "blood," ensuring that he remains "wise and good." As he imagines their life together, he confidently asserts "thou art mine," as if his betrothal to "Sorrow" had already taken place. As his cherished spouse, she will at times be "lovely like a bride," and in return she will appear before the world as the "creature of" his "love," with no one guessing what her true name is. In other words, Tennyson's elegist contemplates enjoying not just an affair but also soothing companionship with a womanly form that only he knows embodies his misery.</p>
<p>In the three eight-line stanzas of "Song," Mew copies the well-paced octosyllables (though not the envelope rhyme) of <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memoriam</span> only to repudiate the marital fantasy that Tennyson's speaker wants to fulfill. Mew's female voice addresses "Sorrow" as a threatening re whose poisonous "boughs of yew" only became apparent toward the end of her childhood (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 55). Although Mew's "Sorrow" never emerges as definitively male, the masculine power with which this re destroys both innocent and joyful relationships is implicit:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Was I so dear you could not spare<br>   The maid to love, the child to play,<br>But coming always unaware,<br>   Must bid and beckon me away? (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 55)</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Mew's poetic voice reveals that not only has "Sorrow" led her away from the pleasures of childhood and intimacy but now lies in her bed "toss[ing]" a "weary head," making it impossible for her to "slumber" with such a restless spouse (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 55). Not surprisingly, she finally exclaims: "For oh! I cannot sleep with you" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 56). By turning poem "LIX" from <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memoriam</span> on its head, Mew's "Song" articulates a critical voice that reveals she has been betrayed by the very form of companionship that Tennyson's man yearns to enjoy. "Song" therefore shows that the fulfillment of Tennyson's desires has amounted to Mew's despair. One might conclude that her short poem signals not only skepticism toward intimate company but also dissatisfaction with the poetic convictions cherished by an earlier generation.</p>
<p>Seven years passed before Mew's next published poem—a fine lyric with a Tennysonian title, "Requiescat"—was included in H. W. Massingham's Liberal weekly, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span>. By this point, Mew was a forty-year-old writer with few contacts in literary London. She only gained a measure of renown some three years later when she placed "The Farmer's Bride" in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span>. This impassioned dramatic monologue, in which a lovelorn husband recalls how he captured his runaway spouse, attracted the attention of several noteworthy res. The first was Catherine Dawson Scott, also known as <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  "Mrs. Sappho": the zealous patron of contemporary writers, and eventual founder of International P.E.N., who opened her home in suburban Southall to a circle of literary enthusiasts. No sooner had Dawson Scott persuaded Mew to read "The Farmer's Bride" and other unpublished poems to this suburban company than the poet came into contact with the highly regarded novelist May Sinclair. About a year after Sinclair became friends with Mew in early 1913, Ezra Pound—at the novelist's urging—accepted Mew's substantial monologue, "The Fête," in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Egoist</span>.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Concurrently, another reader of "The Farmer's Bride" who helped bring Mew into the public eye was Alida Monro. In her 1953 memoir Alida Monro recalls that she was so impressed by "The Farmer's Bride" that she "committed" it "to memory."<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> After she came into contact with her future spouse, Harold Monro, at a meeting of The Poets' Club at the Café Monico, London, in March 1913, Alida Monro quickly shared with him her enthusiasm for Mew's work. Subsequently, as she became increasingly involved in the day-to-day operations of Harold Monro's recently opened Poetry Bookshop, located off Theobalds Road in Central London, she contacted Mew to see if the author had sufficient poems for the kind of chapbook that Harold Monro included in his own imprint, which began its list the year before the bookstore opened its doors. Moreover, after Alida Monro received a reply from Mew, she asked if the poet would like to attend a reading of her work, which would take place at six o'clock on a Tuesday evening in November 1915. Mew agreed to be there, and very soon Alida Monro and the poet formed a close friendship, which led in turn to the publication of first edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> in 1916.</p>
<p>The book, at first, was not a commercial success, even though it received some positive reviews, including one from leading Imagist, H. D. in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Egoist</span>. There H. D. remarks that "Mew has chosen one of the most difficult forms in the language—the dramatic lyric," adding that this author "has grown a new bloom from Browning's sowing, has followed a master without imitating him."<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Despite such supportive notices, at the end of 1916 Harold Monro—whom Dominic Hibberd claims "did more for the development of twentieth-century poetry" than anyone else in England<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a>—had 850 remaindered copies out of the 1,000 printed of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span>. To improve its prospects, Harold Monro tried to persuade Edward Marsh to feature Mew as the first woman writer in the series of <span style="font-style:italic;">Georgian Poetry</span> anthologies, which Monro had been issuing under the Poetry Bookshop imprint since 1912. But Monro learned that Marsh's advisor, Walter de la Mare, believed that "The Farmer's Bride" should be excluded because the rhythm was too irregular and the rhymes "rather doubtful"; moreover, he thought the speaker too changeable: "dialectical in the first stanza and literary in the last."<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> As de la Mare no doubt sensed, Mew's poem eventually balks at the four-beat common meter that appears to lend regularity to its opening lines. Instead of adhering to the pattern of conventional ballads, this idiosyncratic monologue—voiced in the dialect of a West Country farmer whose bride at one time "runned away"—randomly expands its line lengths to as many as sixteen syllables while evolving a mixed rhyme scheme (<span style="font-style:italic;">abbacdcdd</span>) in which the slight discordance of "human" and "woman" also sounds a peculiar note (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 1). Fitzgerald remarks that Mew's exclusion from the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  fourth volume of <span style="font-style:italic;">Georgian Poetry</span> "was perhaps fortunate" because "in the new post war climate" this anthology, which enjoyed enormous sales, "was beginning to seem old-fashioned," and thus "it was less of a privilege to appear in it."<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>At the same time, however, Mew lost what ground she had gained through her contact with Sinclair. While much has been made of Sinclair's disenchantment when Mew declared her love for her in May 1914 (Dawson Scott discovered from Sinclair that Mew was "evidently a pervert," and Sinclair herself reported that in response to Mew's moment of passion she "had to leap the bed five times"),<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> the tension that arose between them seems to have focused on their diverging attitudes toward poetic tradition, which came to a head the following year. Even though, in early 1915, Sinclair enthused in an affectionate letter about "the depths and depths of passion" that she found in Mew's poems, her advocacy of Imagism probably ended the close bond she had developed with Mew.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> Suzanne Raitt suggests that the diminishment of the novelist's "involvement with Mew coincided with her increasing commitment to the definition and promotion of a poetics that, unlike Mew's, heralded the arrival of 'modern' poetry."<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> In particular, Raitt observes that when Sinclair published one of her experimental poems in Aldington's "Special Imagist Number" of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Egoist</span> in April 1915, she was "identifying herself with an unpopular movement" that came under attack.<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> Monro, even if he had issued Ezra Pound's anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">Des Imagistes</span> in 1914, found it difficult to sell this avant-garde kind of work, and in his dispiriting contribution to the debates about Imagism in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Egoist</span> he dismissed these early modernists for producing "petty poetry" whose "reticence denote[d] either poverty of imagination or needlessly excessive restraint."<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>In response, Sinclair remarked that Harold Monro, "a man on a sharp fence trying to preserve a sane and dignified equilibrium," proved insensitive to the Imagists' radical innovations because he required emotional intensity where there need be none.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> "If you are sworn to admire nothing but Swinburne, or Rossetti, or Mrs. Browning or Robert Browning and their imitators for ever and ever," Sinclair adds, "you may reject" H. D.'s poetry "because there is no 'passion' in it."<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> Raitt contends that Sinclair's espousal of Imagism (she championed its "direct naked contact with reality") undermined her earlier "allegiance to the Victorian cadences of Mew's verse."<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> As a consequence, Mew accused Sinclair of making "stupid" comments when, in her own defense, Sinclair claimed she had been protecting H. D. against what she felt was "an unfair &amp; rather spiteful attack from a writer [i.e. Harold Monro] who isn't fit to lick her boots."<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> Immediately, it seems, their friendship collapsed. Thus at the very point when she had enjoyed some proximity to this modernist milieu, Mew grew estranged from a prominent writer who had turned against her because she appeared to be a remnant from a former epoch—an anachronistic re whom Sinclair's friends quaintly labeled a "lesbian poetess."<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet, if, as Sinclair plainly understood, Mew was not a poet in the same mold as H. D., did that mean that Mew could not be in any respect "modern"? As one can tell from the events that divided Mew from Sinclair's embrace of Imagism and excluded her from Marsh's traditional group of Georgian poets, she could not maintain even <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  a marginal position in these circles. In any case, if Mew's appearance in the suffrage periodical, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Englishwoman</span>, is anything to go by, then it would seem that even by 1913 and 1914 when she made some seven contributions to this journal, she still remained to some degree divided about the formalities that she inherited from her Victorian forerunners. Of the four poems that she published there, the two that she chose to exclude from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> indicate some ambivalence toward convention and innovation. The sonnet "P-érien Mer" ('Lost at Sea'), which is set in one of the French resort towns where Mew vacationed, features a ghost whose recollections of dying at sea echo some of Christina Rossetti's eeriest lyrics in <span style="font-style:italic;">Goblin Market and Other Poems</span> . Speaking as someone "newly dead," Mew's poetic voice, whose sex remains unspecified, recognizes that "the friends that stand" around the laid-out body and "speak . . . / Indulgently" have no idea how this individual perished. A storm, it seems, snatched this person's life: "suddenly the light / Of Youth went out, and I, no longer I, / Climbed home, the homeless ghost I was to be" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 61). Such lines reveals that the ghostly subject speaks, with full authority and knowledge, through the very pronoun "I" that death has necessarily negated in one sense, though clearly not silenced in another.</p>
<p>Then again, this traditionally structured sonnet that gives voice to the destitute specter is very aware of its home in literary history. If we turn, for example, to Rossetti's sonnet "After Death," then we can see immediately the ways in which "Péri en Mer" resuscitates an earlier poetic ghost, one who looks at a man gazing down upon her face in the coffin: "He leaned above me, thinking that I slept / And could not hear him." Even though the man "wept," his emotions were not deep, just as she had always suspected: "He did not touch the shroud" or "take my hand in his."<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> In her deepening remorse, Rossetti's dead speaker states: "He did not love me living." Once she has acknowledged this fact, however, she turns not to despair but to the "sweet" thought that while "he is still warm" she remains, satisfyingly, "cold." Thus in both "Péri en Mer" and "After Death," the dead retain a critical perspective on those mortals who mistakenly assume that no spirit watches them. Together, the ghosts in these two sonnets create a poetic dialogue about the triumph of death over life, one that embeds Mew's work in that of a much-admired precursor.</p>
<p>Quite the opposite is the case in "The Call," which shares the irregular line lengths that eventually distinguished Mew's efforts to break with her poetic ancestors.<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> In this short work, the speaker remains altogether less sure about maintaining any authority over the future. Here the poetic voice recalls a time spent recently drowsing "beside the fire" when "a call" made an unexpected "rattle on the window-pane" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 46). Like a ghost, it had both a "voice" and a "breath" that "Swept in and out and that was all" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 46–47). Exactly what this spirit was, "a bright or a dark angel,"remains unknown (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 47). But its presence has made an incontrovertible demand upon those who experienced it because they now know they "cannot sit here any more" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 47). In response to this unassailable higher power, the speaker says that the present company "must arise and ago" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 47). Yet where they are heading is unclear: "we do not know / Who called, or what marks we shall leave upon the snow" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 47). As <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  it moves from one irregular line to the next, "The Call" dramatizes the uncertainty of modern conditions in which one cannot languish in the rituals of domestic contentment. About to become homeless, this poetic voice is on the brink of venturing forth into a wasteland in which each and every mark seems likely to dissolve into oblivion. Here it appears that the interpellative "call" to produce a more modern kind of poetry (one that nonetheless clings to the vestiges of rhythm and rhyme) promises to erase, or at least diminish, the authority of the voice that inhabits such lines. In many respects, "The Call" points to the ways in which Mew's dislocated subjects express, with such death-driven energy, their own dissolution in many of the monologues that made <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> a <span style="font-style:italic;">cause célèbre</span>.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Belated Fame: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span>
</h1>
<p>By the end of 1915, Mew was working hard to ensure that Harold Monro issued <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> not as a chapbook but as a full-fledged collection: a format that he knew would not be profitable because the only poetry that was attracting attention during the war (as Sinclair acknowledged) was "written from the trenches."<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> In her correspondence, Mew stated that she wanted all seventeen poems to be set alongside each other in the volume because they "hang together . . . &amp; mark a period": a time in which she had been immensely, and unusually, productive.<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a> Yet one of the most widely noted of these works, the long monologue about a prostitute, "Madeleine in Church," did not make its way into print without difficulty, since Mew found it hard to complete. By early 1915, Sinclair was urging Mew: "Finish—finish your Courtesan. She's magnificent. The last verses are all there—coiled up in the lobe of your brain asleep and waiting to be waked."<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a> Mew ran into further problems when the monologue went to the typesetters because the Methodist printers whom Monro approached refused to handle its offensive subject-matter. When Monro finally secured a company that would set Mew's manuscript in type, she insisted that the length of her "abnormal lines" (many of which exceed twenty syllables) should sit, wherever possible, unbroken on each page.<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> Although Monro could not keep all of the exorbitant lines of "Madeleine" intact, he agreed to issue <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> in a format in which the pages were so wide that they looked, most distinctively, almost square.</p>
<p>One can see why "Madeleine in Church" caused some moralistic readers offense because its representation of a woman's sexually promiscuous past marks a shift away from the various Victorian poems—such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti's "Jenny,", Augusta Webster's "A Castaway," and Amy Levy's "Magdalen"—that addressed this widely debated but sensitive topic. Whereas this earlier generation of writers explored the ways in which society upheld a moralistic double standard toward the stereotypical prostitute, Mew's poem concentrates not on the sex worker's oppressive interaction with men but on her spiritual confrontation with Jesus Christ: the very re that exorcised the demons from the original Mary Magdalene. Madeleine may bear a name that sounds similar to "Magdalene" but as she stares at "in the darkness" at a crucifix, lit by "one small candle" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 22), she gradually recognizes that there are few similarities <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  between herself and the biblical woman who had a sexual history comparable to her own, as we can detect in this direct address to the Lord:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>          How old was Mary out whom you cast<br>    So many devils? Was she young or perhaps for years<br>She had sat staring, with dry eyes, at this and that man going past<br>     Till suddenly she saw You on the steps of Simon's house<br>      And stood and looked at You through tears.<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 26–27)</div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Such inquiries hardly prove comforting, especially as the savior was "alive" to Madeleine years ago when she attended her convent school (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 28). She concludes that if Mary Magdalene had not had the good fortune to fulfill "the dream of Him"—that is, meet with the redeemer who saved the fallen woman's soul—it makes one wonder whether this biblical icon "could . . . have cared so much" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 27). Not everyone, Madeleine contends, has been as lucky as this saint to have been restored to grace. When she considers her own plight, Madeleine presumes that she will never count among the millions whom the Lord has saved. Even though "His arms are full of broken things," one question is for certain: "He has never shared with me my haunted house beneath the trees / Of Eden and Calvary" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 26, 28). Madeleine's acute sense that Jesus Christ cannot shelter her soul culminates in her lasting despair that he will offer her no revelation (a thought, she recalls, that in childhood did not trouble her): "I used to think it would not hurt me too, so terribly / If He had ever seemed to notice me / Or, if, for once, He would only speak" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 28). As these closing lines suggest, Madeleine is left confronting blank silence. Already, she has contemplated that she will soon pass into a "handful of forgotten dust" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 26). Now, having lost her religious convictions, she must contend with the fact that "He" is "dead" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 28).</p>
<p>If "Madeleine in Church" flatly refutes the idea that its speaker should be able to rise from shame to grace like the nineteenth-century Magdalene, then "Ken," a fine narrative poem that editors rejected on the grounds of taste,<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> shows how another kind of stigmatized re, a man suffering from mental illness, not only experiences the denial of God's love but also expresses his anger at his irredeemable condition. The compassionate narrator of this poem observes that during his attendance at church (where he went not to pray but "to see the lights!"), Ken would remain after the service with "His eyes upon a crucifix" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 16). His intransigence discomfited his neighbors: "You could not move him from his chair—/You did not look at him as he sat there, / Biting his rosary to bits" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 16). Worse still, when Ken sought to make himself heard, his words and gestures expressed intense anger toward the godhead: "While pointing to the Christ he tried to say / 'Take it away'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 16). Yet if Ken inarticulately defied Jesus Christ, he nonetheless remained vibrantly responsive to the natural world. "Nothing" to him, the narrator says, "was dead": "He said 'a bird' if he picked up a broken wing" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 16).</p>
<p>Poignantly, this man who had such assurance in the continuance of life has been taken to "that red brick barn upon the hill": the asylum whose "twenty windows in a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  row" ensure that his existence becomes a living death (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 16, 17). In some respects, this sterile institution resembles the church where Ken chose to remain immobile. But in the asylum, we learn, "They cannot move you from your chair" because, presumably, the patients have been heavily sedated (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 17). That the narrator touchingly employs the second-person singular provides a sympathetic point of connection with a mentally ill man whose humanity has been denied through this unjustifiable incarceration. Everyone, the narrator suggests, should understand that Ken's chair is also "your chair": a place where any human being, whether judged sane or insane, might sit. But at the very moment the poetic voice dwells on the need to express compassion for Ken's plight, it becomes impossible to utter the distress that his sequestration arouses, as we can see from the suspended note on which the poem concludes:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>     So, when they took<br>Ken to that place, I did not look<br>     After he called and turned on me<br>     His eyes. These I shall see—<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 17)</div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">As Peter Howarth thoughtfully observes, here "[t]he poem breaks off, as if the speaker is choked, silenced and staring like Ken, who has also been taken away . . . by a world which claims to worship the re pinned on the crucifix."<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a> This unexpected ending is particularly unsettling because it voices anguish that in some ways evokes the helpless mumbling that has removed Ken from the social world.</p>
<p>Both "Madeleine in Church" and "Ken" plunge the protagonists into a void that evacuates the rhetorical resonances that Mew accumulates through her carefully manipulated distensions of rhythm and rhyme. The same can be said of many other poems in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span>, including "In Nunhead Cemetery," in which a bereaved young man stands next to the suburban grave of his deceased fiancée, dwelling on how her untimely death has destroyed his will to live. "Put me to sleep," he cries (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 10). His determination to "stay here," drenched in the rain with a "broken" flower in his hand, focuses attention on the insensitivity that Mew frequently associates with social and religious institutions (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 10, 8). After everyone else has left the burial site, the young man remains contemplating the impersonal conditions in which the gravedigger "fills in holes like this year after year," in one of the seven sprawling cemeteries that opened across London in the 1830s and 1840s to cope with the widespread problem of disposing of the dead (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 8). As we learn early in the poem, these vast burial grounds are usually viewed from a distance: "I have seen this place / From the windows of the train that's going past," he says (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 8). The only individuals who seem to make regular use of this public space are the mischievous "children hanging about" who poke fun at the "whole dreadful heap" of mud that needs to go back into the earth (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 8). That this isolated mourner is driven to remark that "There is something terrible about a child" undermines any hope in a rejuvenated future (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 8). Instead, the bleak drama that unfolds in "In Nunhead Cemetery" shows that the only thing that Mew's distraught modern subject desires is his interment. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Like many of her speakers, Mew could not bear any further delay in ensuring that their beseeching voices did not pass unheard. As she insisted to Harold Monro, she wanted to see <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> published as soon as possible because she sensed that her work would become one of the many casualties of the war: "the times are so abnormal that no one with any imagination can practically consider the future."<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> Yet if Mew urged Monro to publish her book in the face of what she called "the present chaotic conditions,"<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a> it is noticeable while many of the seventeen poems in her volume address death and dying, not a single one touches upon the hostilities. (She had in fact written two poems on the impact of the war. "May, 1915" and "June, 1915" did not appear until after her death [<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 42, 43].)</p>
<p>Mew's apparent indifference to publishing war poetry, even though she discussed some poems of this type that friends such as Sinclair had written, might encourage readers to assume that for the most part she remained, as one scholar puts it, "imaginatively tied to the symbols of the past age,"<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a> in so far as so much of Mew's poetry looks back on lives whose suffering originates in a former period. It is therefore significant that the only poem that Mew published during her life on World War One, a lyric elegy titled "The Cenotaph," focuses not on the 1914 to 1918 combat but on Edwin Lutyens's famous monument in Whitehall that memorializes the thousands of British lives whose remains were interred on foreign soil. By September 1919, when the poem appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Westminster Gazette</span>, Lutyens's hurriedly erected painted wood-and-plaster mock-up of the Cenotaph had already attracted immense attention during the Peace Day celebrations for which it had been specially designed the previous July. In the following year, Lutyens's full-size model, owing to its popularity, was made permanent in Portland stone.</p>
<p>In his study of the poetic tributes to this monument, Alex Moffett suggests that its distinctly modern structure, with its flat, unadorned vertical planes, suited the nation's needs well. According to Moffett, since the Cenotaph was not designed as a tomb (it does not contain the remains of any bodies), its "effectiveness . . . as a conduit for grief" was "perhaps augmented by its status as an icon of displacement."<a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a> On this view, this physically empty monument, one whose significance arose from the fact that its purpose was not to entomb the war dead, served "as a fractured symbol of a fracturing war"; as a consequence, the Cenotaph provided an outward representation of the lingering psychic wounds that in 1919 defined a profoundly "modernist moment."<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>At the start of "The Cenotaph," Mew's poetic voice confidently dramatizes the overwhelming displacement between the bodies interred abroad and the need to memorialize the dead at home:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>  Not yet will those measureless fields be green again<br>Where only yesterday the wild sweet blood of wonderful youth was shed;<br>There is a grave whose earth must hold too long, too deep a stain,<br>Though for ever over it we may speak as proudly as we may tread.<br>But here, where the watchers by lonely hearths from the thrust of an inward sword have<br>   more slowly bled,<br>We shall build the Cenotaph. (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 35–36) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">This finely executed opening moves through a series of lengthy (one is tempted to say "measureless") lines to impress the persistent, grievous losses of the war. The fact that the hostilities caused such a severe disruption becomes clear when we learn that even in the months after the Armistice the spring has not been able to regenerate the grass across such fields as those in Flanders where thousands of soldiers are buried. Assuredly, Mew's speaker knows that mourners will always be able to travel abroad to honor the dead. At the same time, however, her voice acknowledges the need for a monument that can give public form to private suffering at home: a location where the placing of wreaths of "Violets, roses, and laurel" can at least go some way toward compensating for warfare's brutal violation (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 56).</p>
<p>Yet, typically for Mew, the Cenotaph, no matter how much it serves a dignified purpose for mourning so that "God is not mocked and neither are the dead," will not retain the seemliness that the celebrations of July 1919 have afforded it (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 56). If anything, her poetic voice suggests, the monument will have a very different future: "this will stand in our Market-place" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 56). "Who'll sell, who'll buy," the poetic voice asks, contemplating a society where everyone is rapaciously "driv[ing] bargains," with no interest in paying their respects to those soldiers who have been buried on the battlefield (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 56). In such an exploitative world, these ruthless buyers and sellers will remain unaware that the dead shall stare questioningly into their faces, as the three memorable closing lines—all of which end with an identical rhyme—make plain:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>While looking into every busy whore's and huckster's face<br>As they drive their bargains, is the Face<br>Of God and some young, piteous, murdered face. (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 56)</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">By showing how the faces of the dead (including Jesus Christ's) remain etched on those of the living, Mew's haunting conclusion establishes a formal connection, by way of a deliberately strained rhyme, between the past and the present. Simultaneously, however, the fact that such a connection is likely to become undecipherable in the market-driven conditions of modernity points to the limited influence that works of art, whether in Lutyens's monument or Mew's poem, can have on the future. In other words, "The Cenotaph" implicitly suggests that her poetic observations about the complicated aftereffects of war will eventually go unrecognized.</p>
<p>And, for many years, they did. Soon after her posthumous volume <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rambling Sailor</span> appeared, Mew's work passed rapidly into obscurity, not least because that collection—with Alida Monro's dispiriting preface and the inclusion of a number of conventional poems dating from the early 1900s—suggested that she had always been out of step with her time. But once we acknowledge that the gloomy accounts of Mew's life are somewhat misleading (the poet, for example, died a wealthy woman),<a name="f79-text" href="#f79"><sup>79</sup></a> it becomes possible to see how the writer's greatest work—which took many years before it could innovate on a literary heritage that she sometimes held in skeptical regard—expresses misgivings about belonging to a specific moment, period, or movement. Attempts to categorize Mew as a Victorian, fin-de-siècle, or modernist writer cannot account for <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the defiant manner in which her best writings, with their unrestrained rhythms and overextended rhymes, reconre as far as they can the formalities of the literary past in the name of renewing her longstanding protest against modernity. Whether depicting the pornographic "chromo" in a London shop-window or the abuse that a noble monument will suffer in the market-place, Mew's writings show little interest in remaining in either the West End of the mid-1890s or the Whitehall of 1919. Maybe the most troubling result that we find in her unique poetry lies in many of her speakers' emphatic desire never to remember anything ever again. Because she insisted on giving voice to subjects that contemplate their effacement from history, it is not surprising that scholars have been divided on exactly where to place Mew in modern cultural memory. As Mew's faltering career makes plain, it took years before she could devise a distinctive poetics in which the disturbances of the past could be expressed in the urgency of the present in the name of ensuring that they should not continue to exist. Yet the negative ways in which those deferrals were presented at the time of her demise also had the unfortunate consequence of eclipsing for some time what is of lasting significance in her writing. Only now, after further critical delays, is it possible to understand that Mew was scarcely behind her age in anticipating an unwelcoming future, one in which an amassing body of writing about trauma would increasingly address the pressing need to contend with tormenting aftereffects.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f50" href="#f50-text">50. </a>In 1913, Sinclair urged Mew "to send something to the <span style="font-style:italic;">English Review</span>," which Austin Harrison had since the start of his editorship in 1909 opened to women writers ("To Charlotte Mew," 4 July 1913, in Davidow, "Charlotte Mew," 300). Later in the year, Sinclair sent five of Mew's poems to him for consideration, all of which were rejected. At the same time, Sinclair encouraged Pound to forward <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  three poems to Harriet Monroe's <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span>, none of which were accepted. These documents show that Sinclair had decided to act as Mew's mentor (if not unofficial agent), and their correspondence reveals that Mew shared with Sinclair the stories that had appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span>. "I wish you'd do more short stories," Sinclair remarked in 1915 ("To Charlotte Mew," 22 April 1915, in Davidow, "Charlotte Mew," 311). Sinclair also gave Mew extensive advice on negotiating the terms under which Harold Monro at the Poetry Bookshop should publish <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span>.
