<p>
In Oscar Wilde's <i>Lady Windermere's Fan,</i> Cecil Graham insists,
"I never talk scandal. <i>I</i> only talk gossip." When asked what
the difference is between the two, Cecil replies, "Oh! Gossip is
charming! History is merely gossip. But scandal is gossip made tedious
by morality."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
  Wilde would most likely have agreed that media publicity often
  accompanies--indeed, amplifies--the tedium of morality as a defining
  property of scandal. The scandal I want to consider, perhaps the
  most sensational scandal in Britain during World War I, suitably
  began with an announcement for a play by Wilde that appeared in the
  <i>Sunday Times</i> newspaper in February 1918:



<blockquote>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<!--_extract-->
OSCAR WILDE'S SALOME
<br />
MAUD ALLAN in private performances by
<br />
J. T. GREIN's INDEPENDENT THEATRE,
<br />
April next.
<br />
Terms of membership from Miss Valetta, 9, Duke Street.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This unassuming notice accompanies other advertisements that evoke
Britain's charged cultural atmosphere as it entered its fourth year of
war. In the paper's "Social and Personal" section, several personal
detectives advertise their services for managing the contemporary
misfortunes of "Blackmail, Divorce, Libel or anonymous letters" and for
assisting "if you require relief from an embarrassing entanglement, or
any delicate matter." The paper also boasts an array of treatments for
such modern conditions as shell shock and war neurosis, with cures ranging
from hypnotic suggestion to "Hindu Treatment." In the entertainment

<b></b>

notices Madame Taussaud advertises a wax exhibition of "Celebrities
of the PAST and PRESENT and HEROES of the WAR." The advertisement for
Wilde's play, printed just above Madame Taussaud's announcement, would
become the first document in a remarkable legal event which the press
ultimately deemed "an unprecedented orgy of scandal and disorder."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  Indeed, as the scandal over <i>Salom&eacute;</i> unfolded, it
  encompassed the peculiar realms invoked by the other advertisements:
  detected secrets, blackmail and libel, "delicate situations," the
  nervous disorders of war, hypnotic suggestion, the mysteries of the
  East, and celebrity exhibitions.

<p>
In addition to tedious morality and media publicity, a scandal also
requires colorful public personalities, a condition satisfied by the
above names. In 1918 the name "Oscar Wilde" was synonymous with infamy;
<i>Salom&eacute;,</i> written in 1891, was his only drama to be banned
from public performance in England, and its 1894 English publication
with Aubrey Beardsley's naughty illustrations kindled a minor literary
scandal of its own.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  Maud Allan was a dancer who had become one of London's most famous
  and eroticized performers a decade earlier with her scantily-clad
  and sexually suggestive modern dance, "The Vision of Salome" (<A
  NAME="1" href="9.1medd_res.html#1"> 1</a>). Meanwhile,
  her "intimate yet undefinable" relationship with Margot Asquith,
  who was rumoured to be a "sapphist," had provoked society gossip.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  J. T. Grein, the play's producer and the owner of the Independent
  Theatre, was a businessman and dramatic critic of the <i>Sunday
  Times.</i> Active in the production of modern and often controversial
  drama, Grein was the first to bring Henrik Ibsen and George Bernard
  Shaw to the London stage. In 1918, Wilde, <i>Salom&eacute;,</i> Allan,
  and Grein were all widely recognized, ideologically charged proper
  names, ripe for scandalous deployment.

<p>
Within less than a week of Grein's advertisement, the front page of a
small right wing radical newspaper called <i>The Vigilante</i> displayed
the following cryptic paragraph:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
The Cult of the Clitoris
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->To be a member of Maud Allan's performances in Oscar Wilde's Salome one
has to apply to a Miss Valetta, of 9, Duke Street. . . . If Scotland
Yard were to seize the list of these members I have no doubt they would
secure the names of several thousand of the first 47,000.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The "Cult of the Clitoris" paragraph then launched the sort of enticing
narrative that a scandal requires and also made its publisher, Noel
Pemberton-Billing, a public sensation. In a few weeks, Allan, the play's
star, and Grein, its producer, began legal proceedings against Billing
on a charge of obscene and criminal libel.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
An independent member of Parliament, Billing led the Vigilante
Society, whose mission was to promote "purity" in public life. The
Society was particularly dedicated to rooting out that "'mysterious
influence'"--the invisible German presence spreading moral degeneracy in
England itself--"which was responsible," Billing claimed, "for all the
British failures in the war" (<i>SLV,</i> 3). The "47,000" mentioned in
the "Cult of the Clitoris" paragraph alluded to a previous article by
Billing that reported the discovery of a book belonging to "a certain
German Prince." This book allegedly compiled reports from "German agents
who have infested this country for the past twenty

<b></b>

years, agents so vile and spreading debauchery of such a lasciviousness
as only German minds could conceive and only German bodies execute"
(<i>VR,</i> 451). The book's "stupefying contents" provided instruction
on "the propagation of evils which all decent men thought had perished
in Sodom and Lesbia" and included more than a thousand pages "filled
with the names mentioned by German agents in their reports. These
are names of forty-seven thousand English men and women" (<i>VR,</i>
451-2). Billing's article detailed the methods this "black book of sin"
devised for "contaminating" the whole English population through the
"carefully cultivated introduction of practices which hint at the
extermination of the race" (<i>VR,</i> 452). Homosexuality, it seems,
was the enemy's secret genocidal weapon. Most threatening to the nation
at war was the successful queer invasion of "high politics." Billing
warned, "Wives of men in supreme position were entangled. In Lesbian
ecstasy the most sacred secrets of State were betrayed. The sexual
peculiarities of members of the Peerage were used as a leverage to
open fruitful fields for espionage" (ibid.). This book even provided a
"glossary" that listed "expressions supposed to be used among themselves
by the soul-sick victims of this nauseating disease so skilfully [sic]
spread by Potsdam" (ibid.). Under the subheading "The Fall of Rome,"
Billing closed his article with a call for action that exorbitantly
merged national, imperial, moral, sexual, and gender panic:





<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
all the horrors of shells and gas and pestilence introduced by the
Germans in their open warfare would have but a fraction of the effect
in exterminating the manhood of Britain as the plan by which they
have already destroyed the first forty-seven thousand. . . . [I]t is a
terrible thought to contemplate that the British Empire should fall as
fell the great Empire of Rome, and the victor now, as then, should be
the Hun. [<i>VR,</i> 453]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, "the forty-seven thousand" belonged to a cult of sexual
depravity susceptible to the influence, corruption, and exploitation
by German agents. Since "The Cult of the Clitoris" paragraph implicated
<i>Salom&eacute;</i> and Maud Allan in the 47,000, associating her with
sexual deviance and national sedition, Allan charged Billing with the
libel of insinuating that she, her performances, and her audience, were
"obscene and indecent," "lewd[,] unchaste and immoral," and "addicted to
obscene and unnatural practices" (<i>VR,</i> 472). That is, Allan accused
Billing of implying that she was a lesbian, and that her performance
in Wilde's play would promote sexual perversions among its vulnerable
wartime audience, thereby opening "fruitful fields for espionage."

<p>
After the initial proceedings at Bow Street Police Court, Billing was
committed to trial at the Old Bailey. Six days of sensational court
drama then captured the attention of the media, and moreover, captured
the popular imagination of a nation panicked, paranoid, and exhausted by
the war. Co-opting the courtroom as a space of hystericized spectacle,
slinging accusations and fomenting anxiety about the plot of the 47,000,
Billing was ultimately acquitted by a jury of his peers and cheered as
a hero by a mob of spectators, while press editorials scolded him for
exploiting the national atmosphere of war hysteria with his outrageous
allegations. Billing claimed the last word by compiling a <i>Verbatim
Report</i> of the court proceedings for private subscription.

"In Lesbian Ecstasy": Representing the War
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
Wilde's trial and imprisonment in 1895 brought male homosexuality to the
headlines, but the Billing trial signals the first time the discussion
of <i>female</i> homosexuality obsessed the British popular press.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  Allan then may be read as a public icon of homosexual danger homologous
  to Wilde, and her failed libel suit against Billing uncannily echoes
  Wilde's own libel case against the Marquess of Queensberry that
  eventually led to his downfall. However, beyond mentioning the trial
  and Billing's outrageous accusations, social histories of homosexuality
  have provided little analysis of the relation between the trial, the
  cultural history of lesbianism, and the gender and sexual dynamics
  within the cultural history of Great War Britain.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
In the two books that deal exclusively with the trial, the question of
female sexuality is precluded either by discussions of Wilde or political
conspiracies. The title of Philip Hoare's recent book on the trial,
<i>Oscar Wilde's Last Stand</i> , indicates the study's primary
focus of analysis: for Hoare, the "cult" of Wilde and aestheticism were on
trial, imagined by Billing as the ultimate threat to the British nation
at war. Hoare construes Billing's attack on Wilde's play as a protest
against the decadent indulgences that were considered symptomatic of
the moral degeneracy and lassitude that put the British 

<b></b>

nation at risk of defeat by the Germans.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  In <i>Salome's Last Veil</i> , war historian Michael Kettle
  convincingly argues that Billing's trial was implicated in a political
  conspiracy of disgruntled British war generals who were trying to
  block alleged secret peace talks with the Germans and plotting to
  overthrow Lloyd George's coalition government.

<p>
While the trial <i>did</i> powerfully evoke the ghost of Wilde's condemned
sexuality and artistic practices and <i>was</i> deeply enmeshed in
the political exigencies of its historical moment, it also crucially
introduced the specter of female (homo)sexuality as a locus of national
anxiety. Indeed, it was the very conjunction of particular political,
literary, and sexual histories that provided the conditions of possibility
for such an intriguing utterance as "The Cult of the Clitoris" to come to
represent concerns over national security. Unprintable in news reports,
the libelous phrase was the open secret of the trial and the phrase upon
which Allan's prosecution and Billing's defense hinged.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  Combining a seductive appeal to sexual fantasy with a whiff of
  farce, the phrase presented a hermeneutical enigma that recruited
  the suggestion of female homosexuality into the service of national
  wartime paranoia. Only recently have critics begun to consider the
  lesbian significance of the trial. Such work, however, has not had the
  benefit of the full trial documents and has been primarily interested
  in the trial's deployment of sexology.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  In focusing on the lesbian accusation in the trial, I want to consider
  how a wartime crisis of reading and representation conred national
  and social anxieties through the operation of lesbian fantasy. The
  paranoid fantasies that Billing circulated encompassed and exceeded
  the concerns of Wilde's 1895 trial so that a decadent memory was
  recalled in order to portend a modern, more frightening manifestation;
  familiar moral panics were updated with international conspiracy
  and lesbian terror. Because the suggestion of lesbianism aroused a
  cultural frisson but lesbianism itself lacked a legal definition,
  it provided a salient re of sexual fantasy through which the
  nation could simultaneously condense and disperse its unrepresentable
  anxieties about national health and security.

<p>
Cultural analyses of World War I tend to agree that when the war violently
imposed a radically different structure of national and psychical
experience, it demanded new forms to represent this altered condition.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  This challenge to modes of representation was aggravated by an
  epistemological destabilization. As the editors of <i>Women's
  Fiction and the Great War</i> contend, "No one knew what was going
  on throughout the Great War. Censorship, propaganda, and the sheer
  scale and complexity of the event made it impossible to grasp what
  was happening at any particular moment."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  The rise of the daily press had stimulated the public appetite for
  information, but state intervention into reportage during the war
  amounted to what Phillip Knightley calls a "sordid conspiracy to keep
  the truth from the people."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  Under these circumstances, the British public became disillusioned
  with the press and increasingly skeptical about the integrity of the
  printed word.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  This wartime epistemological blackout was accompanied and exacerbated
  by a panic over spies "passing" in England and communicating in
  espionage codes, which raised the anxious hermeneutic question:
  how does one read or decipher identities--particularly dangerous and
  subversive ones--during a time of unprecedented uncertainty?



<p>
Jacqueline Rose argues in a more conceptual register that in war
"something about knowledge or the possibility of acquired and definitive
certainty is at stake."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  In <i>Why War?</i> she proposes that, "The familiar destructiveness of
  war represents not, as is commonly supposed, finality but uncertainty,
  a hovering on the edge of what, like death, can never be totally
  known."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Billing's plot appropriated the emerging notion of lesbianism as
  an imaginative form through which to re this epistemological
  and hermeneutic dilemma that was engendered by World War I. The
  very <i>suggestibility</i> of lesbianism, with its wide range of
  connotations and possible manifestations but without a singular
  consolidated popular image, rendered it a particularly powerful
  vehicle for ring the wartime problematic of uncertainty,
  illegibility, and (mis)representation. Not only are sexual secrets
  considered commensurate with national ones, but the wartime dilemma of
  unknowability and uncertainty finds an analogy in the highly suggestive
  but ultimately unknowable notion of female homosexuality. In other
  words, if male homosexuality functioned as a re of the "open
  secret" in the nineteenth century, as Eve Sedgwick has suggested,
  then in the early-twentieth century, lesbianism operated as a re
  of heightened suggestion and potential-but-always-foreclosed
  knowledge that enticed only to frustrate the possibility of
  disclosure or interpretation. What cannot be known or comprehended
  about the "reality" of the war is translated into a fantasy of the
  epistemologically elusive category of female homosexuality.

<p>
Why lesbianism? Just how unknown or unknowable was it? Certainly, female
homosexuality at this time admitted multiple genealogies. Literary
(and largely French) representations include the vampiric and decadent
"femmes damn&eacute;es" of Baudelaire, Swinburne, and Balzac; the
sapphic revivals of Natalie Barney, Ren&eacute;e Vivien, Michael Field,
and Pierre Lou&yuml;s; and the indiscriminate courtesan or sexual rake of
Zola's <i>Nana</i> and Gautier's <i>Mademoiselle de Maupin.</i> Medical
discourse taxonomized the female sexual invert, while sexual politics
aligned lesbianism with the self-exhibiting turn-of-the-century "public
woman," a term first applied to prostitutes soliciting on streetcorners
and actresses performing on stage that also came to include suffragists
protesting in the street and "the New Women" emerging in the public
sphere.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  Such res of female independence and homosociality, which were
  linked with anxieties about female homosexuality, became more
  pronounced during the gender disruption of World War I. In spite
  of this legacy (notably, a largely literary French one), explicitly
  scandalous female homosexuality has been considered by many sexual
  historians as having been essentially "unthinkable" to the British
  popular imagination emerging from Victoria's reign.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
  In 1918 it is the very inconceivability of scandalous female
  homosexuality, at its precise historical point of shading
  into possibility, that constitutes it as the perfect re for
  staging the sexualized "Other scene" of wartime. Billing's plot of
  homosexual invasion and its specific appeal to the emerging cultural
  recognition of female homosexuality provided a means of representing,
  through a parodic sexual fantasy, the unrepresentable catastrophe of
  history. "The Cult of the Clitoris" scandal demonstrates that it is
  the very connotative suggestibility of lesbianism and its arousal of
  the imagination that makes Billing's plot so powerfully seductive.

<!--_a-head-->
The Spectacle of the Courtroom, The Spectacle of <i>Salom&eacute;</i>
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
If the narrative leading up to the trial reads like a sensation novel,
then the scenes in the courtroom unfold as a dramatic performance that
rivals <i>Salom&eacute;</i>'s own histrionics of fatal desire. Billing
admittedly planted the libel in the <i>Vigilante</i> to attract legal
reaction and media attention, and his introduction to the <i>Verbatim
Report</i> encourages us to inherit the case as a spectacle whose
imaginative appeal exceeds its value as a legal document. He notes that
the official <i>Verbatim Report</i> does not provide



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
those keys to individual and public temper which in the familiar press
reports are usually supplied by parenthetical adjectives and nouns,
and therefore that such helps to the imagination as "(sarcastically),"
"(warmly)," "(great sensation)," and so forth, must be supplied by the
reader's own discretion. [<i>VR,</i> ix]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Beyond demonstrating Billing's scandal-mongering, this appeal reminds
us that we should read the trial not just within a legal or discursive
framework, but also according to the operations of imaginative fantasy
and interpretative possibility. As Billing writes with sweeping hyperbole,
the trial "caused the liveliest stirring of the public mind in all parts
of every continent where the English language is understood" (<i>VR,</i>
iii). Accordingly, he actively "stirred" the public imagination by acting
as his own legal representative with theatrical flare (he had four years'
experience as an actor), expanding his conspiracy plot to include every
member of the court--he accused the presiding judge and the counsel for
the prosecution of being among the 47,000--and calling a remarkable cast
of witnesses, including Wilde's former lover, Lord Alfred Douglas.

<p>
As a theatrical spectacle, the trial takes <i>Salom&eacute;</i> as its
source and inspiration. Billing contended that <i>Salom&eacute;</i> was
"an open representation of degenerated sexual lust, sexual crime, and
unnatural passions and an evil and mischievous travesty of a biblical
story" which "ministers to sexual perverts, Sodomites and Lesbians" and
renders them vulnerable to German influence and blackmail (<i>VR,</i>
476, 35). For Billing, the perversions of <i>Salom&eacute;</i> (both
text and character) are the perversions of Wilde are the perversions
of Allan are the perversions of the enemy that will destroy the British
nation. Billing and his witnesses testify that Salom&eacute;'s "climax"
in kissing/biting the lips of Iokanaan's severed head enacts Wilde's
own sexual orgasm of writing--to represent the scene in language is
to live the scene. This sexual climax is then transferred to Allan--to
represent the scene on the stage is to live the scene, and in turn Allan's
performance sexually influences the audience--to witness the scene as
spectator is to live the scene. Affective and physical experience is
mimetically relayed from one body to another through a simple circuit of
representation, performance, and spectatorship. This ease of associative
relay and substitution allowed the suggestion of lesbianism in the trial
to carry a range of seemingly unrelated wartime anxieties.

<p>
Billing's insinuation that Allan's performance is marked by a latent
lesbianism trades upon the suggestion that Wilde's own homosexuality
seeps into both his title character and the actress performing her. If
Salom&eacute; embodies Wilde's desire, then she is in effect a gay man
masquerading as a sadistic heterosexual woman. Furthermore, if in

<b></b>

Billing's reading Salom&eacute;'s violent passion for and power over
Iokanaan reverses conventional heterosexual dynamics of desire by
constructing the male body as a feminized object, then she resides
somewhere in the undefined territory of masculine female desire, a
paradox that easily slips into the shadowy realm of lesbian passion.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
  And in Billing's chain of associations, if Wilde's betrayal of
  heterosexual norms is equivalent to a betrayal of state security,
  then Allan's performance implicates her in a queer German plot that
  simultaneously betrays nation and heterosexuality: "<i>Wives of
  men in supreme position were entangled. In Lesbian ecstasy the most
  sacred secrets of State were betrayed</i>" <i>(VR,</i> 452)<i>.</i>
  Any violation of the sacred marriage bond may violate the sacred
  secrets of state, and what better re for representing such a
  double agent than the fantasy of "Lesbian ecstasy"?

<p>
Billing's deployment of <i>Salom&eacute;</i> also engages with the play's
status as a symbolist drama. While definitions of literary symbolism
vary widely, Charles Chadwick cites St&eacute;phane Mallarm&eacute;'s
characterization of symbolism as the art of "evoking an object little
by little so as to reveal a mood or, conversely, the art of choosing
an object and extracting from it an '&eacute;tat d'&acirc;me,'" a mood,
Mallarm&eacute; insists, that "should be extracted 'par une s&eacute;rie
de d&eacute;chiffrements'--'by a series of decipherings.'"
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  The object is hinted at, suggested, gradually revealed. Chadwick
  considers a companion aspect of symbolism, in which "concrete images
  are used as symbols, not of particular thoughts and feelings," but
  of an ideal world.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  As Arthur Symons rhetorically asks in <i>The Symbolist Movement in
  Literature</i> , "What is symbolism if not an establishing of the
  links which hold the world together, the affirmation of an eternal,
  minute, intricate, almost invisible life, which runs through the
  whole universe?"
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
Critics have identified <i>Salom&eacute;</i> as symbolist in its use of
suggestive, mystical, and highly aestheticized language whose incantatory
musicality crosses boundaries of dream and reality, reference and
evasion, representation and affect. However, given the wartime concern
over secret agents and codes, any implied mysteries hidden in ambiguous
language were suspect. As we will see, the idealized symbolist notion of
"links which hold the world together" finds a parodic manifestation as
political paranoia in Billing's conspiracy theory that connected the
<i>Salom&eacute;</i> production with the "intricate, almost invisible
life" of secret agents and international espionage. In other words,
Billinganchored the possibility of symbolic suggestion to history,
politics, and morality by reifying the "links" that held together Wilde's
world of art and Britain's situation in wartime.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
In this process of reification, the suggestion of lesbianism functions
remarkably like a symbol in the "symbolist" sense. It operates as a
re for revealing a state of mood and/or as a material substitute
for the intangible, floating, "minute, intricate, almost invisible"
life pervading the British cultural atmosphere of 1918. Indeed, Billing
might have turned the ultimate symbolist phrase, since "The Cult of the
Clitoris" purported to harbor an explicit referential content while
simultaneously refusing stable referentiality in favor of infinite
suggestion. It effectively symbolized a complex of affective relations
among war, sexuality, gender, art, and politics that otherwise resist
articulation, achieving this effect through a "series of decipherings,"
hints, and suggestions. In a Freudian sense, the phrase is a condensation
that "represents several associative

<b></b>

chains at whose point of intersection it is located," while in a
Foucaultian sense, it also signals a cultural dispersion with its
suggestion that deviant female sexuality is distributed throughout
discursive formations and infuses all aspects of political life.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

Sexual Sedition: 
<br />
Resurrecting Wilde, Anatomizing Allan
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
The scandal of "The Cult of the Clitoris" relied upon the scandalous--and
seditious--connotations of Wilde's name that had been established through
his own trials and imprisonment. As Ed Cohen, Regenia Gagnier, and others
have demonstrated, these trials identified Wilde's artistic production,
aestheticism, and self-fashioning with his sexual "gross indecency."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
  A rhetoric of national threat conflated aestheticism with national
  betrayal and displaced anxieties about counterhegemonic sexual
  activities onto aesthetic movements. Perhaps precisely because Wilde
  was such an icon of social danger, his presence was recalled and
  redeployed in the years between his trial and the Billing trial. Most
  notably, between the spring of 1913 and the autumn of 1914, there
  were legalbattles involving Wilde's biographer, Arthur Ransome, his
  former lover, Alfred Douglas,and his literary executor, Robert Ross.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
  With the specter of Wilde conjured up particularly close to wartime,
  his performative invocation and abjection functioned to consolidate
  national identity and "vigor." We could read Billing's trial as
  just another addition to this history of early-twentieth-century
  deployments of Wilde's ghost; however, as I have proposed, in this
  trial the threat of Wilde was supplemented and perhaps exceeded by the
  threat of lesbian sexual espionage. While Wilde's infamy certainly
  underwrote Billing's homosexual plot, "The Cult of the Clitoris"
  introduced dangerous female homosexuality as a new perversion to be
  discussed, scandalized, and rallied against.

<p>
The very phrase "The Cult of the Clitoris" combines the shock of
anatomical reference with the suggestive danger of female sexual and
political independence. With limited female suffrage imminent, the
phrase traded upon doubts and fears about recent successes in feminism,
the gathering of women in political movements and public labor, and
the constitution of the female citizen. The phrase actually grafted the
aesthetic decadence of "the cult of Wilde" onto the concern that women's
citizenship would free them from their traditional role of bearing and
raising citizens for the empire.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  Notably, the primary re of "The Cult of the Clitoris" was Maud
  Allan, the most unlikely <i>and</i> most suitable re for effecting
  this shift from Wilde's aesthetic and sexual threat in the 1890s to
  women's political-sexual threat in the late war years.

<p>
Unlike Wilde's legendary infamy, Allan's public recognition, like her
dancing that made her briefly but thoroughly famous, was a fleeting
gesture that momentarily entranced audiences, but left little trace
of its performance. By 1918 her career was in fact declining, but
the trial evoked the cultural memory of her eroticism, aestheticism,
mass cultural appeal, and high society affiliations. A North American,
Allan studied music in Berlin, then began a dancing career in Europe
and Russia; when she performed before King Edward while he was on
holiday in Europe, he encouraged her to bring her talent to England
(<i>SD,</i> 152). Subsequently, clever marketing tactics rendered her
dance "The Vision of Salome" a succ&egrave;s de scandale at London's
Palace Theatre in

<b></b>

1908, catapulting her to fame, breaking box office records, and gaining
her a position in London society. Reviewers repeatedly deployed the
metaphor of hypnosis to convey her mysterious power to seduce, but not
offend, her audience with her erotic and orientalizing dance. Those
scandalized by Allan associated her with Wilde's degeneracy,
but this hint of perversion only spiced up the gossip about her
social affiliations. With her fame, she secured the patronage and
friendship of Prime Minister Asquith and forged a particular intimacy
with his wife, Margot, a relationship which "caused talk if not open
speculation in social, diplomatic, and political circles," and which
would be exploited by Billing in the trial, given rumors of Margot
Asquith's unconventionality and lesbian-coded female coterie (<i>SD,</i>
176). Inevitably, Allan could not sustain her hypnotic spell over her
audience, particularly once a campaign of demystification was instigated
by the very media that had once promulgated her fascination.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
  A past fad by 1918, she was most likely attempting to revive
  her fame by taking her first dramatic speaking role in Wilde's
  <i>Salom&eacute;</i>; however, the very attributes which had once
  enticed the Edwardian public had been re-inscribed as national dangers
  by this time.

<p>
Certainly, Allan's artistic and erotic notoriety offended the wartime
conservatism in art and morality. Her popularization of what one reviewer
called the "sensuous, decadent, <i>macabre</i>" and her training in
Germany coded her as suspicious to a country that blamed French-inflected
decadence for the national decay that led to war, and was intolerant of
any hint of German Kultur.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  If her erotic dance had flirted with an association with Wilde's
  play--and his infamy--a decade earlier, Allan now took the risk,
  during a reactionary political climate, of foregoing any difference
  between her Salom&eacute; and Wilde's. Without a king's sanction to
  hide behind, her affiliations with the Asquiths did not help her
  reputation. Forced to resign as prime minister in December 1916,
  Asquith had proved a failure under the exigencies of war, and his
  continued association with artistic circles had only contributed to
  doubts about his ability to lead an aggressive, patriotic campaign.

<p>
By 1918, the exoticism, sexual danger, artistic innovation, and
political liaisons upon which Allan had built her earlier fame were
attached to a new female archetype: the sexually and politically
dangerous spy-seductress. Just months before Billing initiated his
campaign against <i>Salom&eacute;,</i> Mata Hari was executed in Paris
for espionage. Born Margeretha Geertruida Zelle, Mata Hari left her
notoriously abusive husband in 1904, changed her identity, embarked on
a dancing career even more risqu&eacute; and orientalizing than Allan's,
and undertook an unapologetic life as a courtesan, taking lovers of the
highest military rank, including German officials.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  When war was declared, all that Mata Hari represented came under
  suspicion: her eroticism, exoticism, refusal of domestic femininity,
  and sexual promiscuity violated the wartime mood of sacrifice,
  restraint, and conservatism. Accustomed to inventing and reinventing
  her identity, Mata Hari mixed her stories and acquaintances one too
  many times and was eventually arrested. Although little hard evidence
  was gathered against her, she was swiftly condemned as a spy, and
  her legend as the female secret service agent par excellence fed the
  propaganda machine. Her Eastern identification and sexual repertoire
  invited an easy conflation of moral laxity with national deception
  and foreign difference, and her

<b></b>

role as mistress to men in power elaborated the femme-fatale stereotype
into a re whose sexual power not only destroyed men and threatened
marriage, but also imperiled national security.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
  Such fantasies engendered in Mata Hari were directly transferable to
  Allan at a time when spy-paranoia was escalating.

<p>
The Billing trial was situated in and significantly contributed to a
volatile period of home front anxieties, manifest in anti-alien sentiment
that included both mob violence and official reaction against anything
and anyone remotely German.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
  The first months of 1918 witnessed England exhausted and pessimistic
  about the outcome of the war. The aggressive German offensive in
  March shook the nation as the stalemate of trench warfare shifted
  into a campaign of action, including air raids on England. Historians
  Trevor Wilson and John Terraine concur that as tensions between
  military leaders and the government increased, the public, denied
  clear explanations, displaced its anxiety onto a renewed campaign
  against enemy aliens.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
  Billing's conspiracy of the "47,000" further resonated with
  war propaganda that explicitly aligned homosexuality with German
  degeneracy, and the paranoid fantasy of "the enemy within" conflated
  spy fever with homophobia. Alfred Douglas promulgated this association
  in his 1915 sonnet, "All's Well with England," which concludes:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Out there in Flanders all the trampled ground
<br />
Is red with English blood . . .
<br />. . . Who will count the loss,
<br />
Since here 'at home' sits merry Margot, bound
<br />
With Lesbian fillets, while with front of brass
<br />
'Old Squiffy' hands the purse to Robert Ross.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
"English blood" is spilled "out there in Flanders" while "at home"
homosexuality is not only practiced but rewarded by a decadent
government. The next year Douglas published <i>The Rossiad,</i> which
concludes with an appeal to England:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
O England, in thine hour of need . . .
<br />
Raise up the best, hack down the worst,
<br />
Tear from thy heart the thing accurst.
<br />
Two foes thou hast, one there one here,
<br />
One far, one intimately near,
<br />
Two filthy fogs blot out thy light:
<br />
The German, and the Sodomite. [ibid.]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Douglas's conjoining of the "The foe without, the foe within" brings the
war "intimately near" by identifying the foreign enemy with the deviant
sexuality lurking within the British people.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
  This association of homosexuality, high society, national betrayal,
  andsocial decay had a long-standing history, but it was Billing's
  trial that brought such sentiments into public debate at a particularly
  vulnerable cultural moment and condensed them into the single cryptic
  phrase, "The Cult of the Clitoris." As the point of transference for
  such a range of allusions and connotations, and as the key utterance in
  the libel charge, the question of "The Cult of the Clitoris"--what it
  meant, to whom it referred, and who could interpret it--was a primary
  obsession in the trial.

<b></b>



<h3>

Reading Cults and Clits
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
The "Cult of the Clitoris" paragraph produces its distinct scandalous
effects by staging an irresistible seductive scene of reading that
initiates an elaborate sexual fantasy. The detective-reader must
sort out the allusions and decode the meaning: Who or what is this
cult? Who or what are the 47,000? And perhaps the most puzzling
question for many early-twentieth-century readers: What, exactly,
is a clitoris? The paragraph compels the reader into a sexy game of
reading and allusion--but one that, like a coded war message or a
spy-thriller novel, has (for Billing at least) a distinct secret to be
deciphered and exposed. The phrase inflames the imagination and provokes
interpretation, thus allowing Billing to intervene in the courtroom and
unveil the underlying plot. The libel achieves its impact by forcing a
convergence of deviant activities that amplifies the panic over national
vulnerability while enlisting the most undefined realm of danger, "The
Cult of the Clitoris," as the rhetorical gathering point for all other
anxieties. As we have seen, in Billing's formulation, the spectacle
of <i>Salom&eacute;</i> occasions a relay of meanings and perversions,
from author to actress to audience. Similarly, the phrase, "The Cult of
the Clitoris," conjoins the allusions and associations of immorality,
national betrayal, homosexuality, and aestheticism. The salience of the
phrase rests upon the suggestive invocation of female homosexuality,
whose lack of a recognizable popular symbolization renders it most
appealing for symbolic appropriation. It is precisely the language of
the female body--the female nonreproductive but desiring body--that
simultaneously demands and refuses interpretative attention, inciting
scandal through its very resistance to representation. Unprintable in
the newspapers, the obscene absence of the phrase "Cult of the Clitoris"
vexes interpretation. Its lesbian meaning, the prosecution will argue,
is obscenely obvious, but a cross fire of courtroom attempts to decipher
the phrase culminates in Billing literally retracting the belabored
lesbian signified from the range of interpretive possibilities.

<p>
In the police proceedings, the counsel for the prosecution, Sir Travers
Humphreys, who had also represented Wilde in his trials, introduces the
libel with a web of circumlocution. He deems it "an attack of a sort
which I hesitate to characterize in language . . . unworthy of any man
to have made upon any woman" (<i>VR,</i> 4). Guiding attention to the
newspaper, he continues, "I find words which I must read, although I
see there are some ladies in Court. I must read them aloud: 'The Cult
of the Clitoris.'. . . it is my submission the words themselves are
the filthiest words it would be possible to imagine" (ibid.). And yet,
he immediately asserts,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What they mean no one can doubt; no one can doubt who reads the words
as they are. . . . [T]he coupling of the name of anyone with that cross
heading in leaded type . . . can only mean one thing, and that is that
the lady whose name is coupled with it, either in her private or in
her professional life, approves of that which is sometimes described in
perhaps less--I do not know whether it is less objectionable--but less
gross language as lesbianism, and a more horrible libel of any woman
. . . is impossible to find. [<i>VR,</i> 5-6]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Humphreys claims that the unimaginable title and its association
with Allan's name in the paragraph are obvious in their "meaning" and
implication, thereby bypassing any interpretive process. According to
Humphreys, the "coupling" of a woman's name and a clitoral cult "can only
mean one thing," when in fact, the relationship between Allan's name and
the title--this "coupling"--hangs suspended in possibility. Humphreys
plugs up this epistemological gap with repeated assertions of the
transparent meaning of the "coupling." His conspicuous discomfort over
uttering the title in the presence of women further codes the phrase
as obviously criminally unutterable while maintaining the assumption of
female sexual innocence.

<p>
Ultimately, his evasion of interpretation culminates in syntactical
confusion and referential failure:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the meaning of that paragraph so far as I have read it is that there is
some connection between [Mr. Grein's] proposed production of this play
and that cult as it is called, which is the explanation of the paragraph,
because that is what it is. Without it, the paragraph is meaningless,
it means nothing at all. Under that heavily leaded type heading it means
there is some connection with the nameless vice between women, and the
performance at the Independent Theatre which is announced. [<i>VR,</i> 6]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The paragraph and its title achieve a singular meaning that cannot
be named, a meaning which becomes lost in wandering referents (for
example, "because that is what it is"? "Without <i>it</i>"? <i>Which</i>
"it"?). Humphreys compensates for his obscure explanation by emphasizing
the "heavily leaded type" of the graphic title (a typographical detail he
repeats in this speech), and insisting on its indelible black-and-white
obscenity. The lesbian meaning is somehow an effect of the graphic type,
so that the ink of publicity stains the reputation of those it names
as it does the fingers of its readers. As reference and interpretation
fail, words become the things that inscribe them; the materiality of the
printed letter stands in for the reference that the utterance itself
obscures. Obvious but nameless lesbian meaning occurs as the point
of conjunction among title, typeset, names of body parts, and names
of actresses.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  By referring to lesbianism as a "nameless" vice while lamenting
  the association of Allan's <i>name</i> with such a vice, Humphreys
  performs a move similar to the one that occurred in Wilde's trial,
  in which Wilde's namewas substituted for the terms "sodomy" or "acts
  of gross indecency."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  In effect, Humphreyssuggests that such a coupling of Allan's
  proper name with the suggestive but referentially indeterminate
  title scandalizes Allan's name to a greater degree than if a more
  explicit accusation had been published. Her name supplies the point
  of determinate reference that the cryptic title refuses, a coupling
  which Humphreys both criticizes and exploits.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>

<p>
In his questioning of Allan, Humphreys again asserts the paragraph's
criminal offense by evading its explanation. He refuses to repeat the
paragraph's title, but asks Allan if she regards it as a libel. "I do,"
she affirms, and then Humphreys pauses to address the ruling magistrate:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Sir John, I should like to have your ruling upon this subject. I do not
propose to ask the Witness what her understanding is of the libel. I
will not ask any further questions unless

<b></b>

there is some matter so obscure to an ordinary person--unless you desire
it, Sir, I do not think I should ask any more than I have, that she
regards that as a libel upon herself; but of course it is for you to
say. [<i>VR,</i> 17-8]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Responding, "Certainly, I agree," the magistrate halts the explanation by
admitting to "know" what Humphreys insists any "ordinary person" would
know without naming (ibid.). The magistrate and Humphreys collude in an
interpretive conspiracy of transparent meanings; as "gentlemen," they
"hesitate to characterize in language" the "meaning" of Billing's attack,
for to do so would violate gender chivalry, according to Humphreys's
characterization of the libel as "unworthy of any man to have made upon
any woman" (<i>VR,</i> 4). This unspoken agreement between magistrate
and counsel suggests a male homosocial community of knowledge about
female deviant desire, a desire whose utterance must be protected from
its very object of reference.

<p>
The positions of knowing established at the Bow Street Police Court are
reoriented in the criminal proceedings at the Old Bailey, tried before
a jury. The counsel conres the jury (who are supposedly, unlike the
learned magistrate, <i>really</i> "ordinary people") in a position of
innocent ignorance, for in this case to position them as knowing what
the coupling means would interpellate them within a community of prurient
knowledge. In the above exchange between Humphreys and the magistrate, the
two agree to share this knowledge in order to protect others' innocence
and certainly to contain interpretation. Lawyer and judge conspire in a
shared understanding that the Old Bailey proceedings then construct as
extraordinary, exclusive knowledge.

<p>
Ellis Hume Williams, now leading the prosecution for the Crown in the
Central Criminal Court, approaches the libel with the same theatrical
caution as Humphreys: "Gentlemen, I am afraid once and for all, unpleasant
as the task is--more particularly as I see that there are some women in
the court--I must describe to you (if these ladies <i>will</i> stay)
what the meaning of that phrase is" (<i>VR,</i> 57). Again, Williams
makes his point about the danger of Billing's libel by suggesting
that it threatens the sexual innocence of women. To counter Billing's
suggestion that women know more and do more in the nation and in bed
than popular culture will admit, the prosecution deliberately constructs
the female spectators in the courtroom as most vulnerable in their
ignorance. Williams trades upon and controverts Billing's suggestion
that the spectacle of <i>Salom&eacute;</i> will immorally infect its
spectators by now constructing the courtroom as a space that must be
protected from the dangerous influence of Billing's words. Williams's
parenthetical phrase "(if these ladies <i>will</i> stay)" reads as a
rhetorical aside, and yet there is a sense in which he suggests that
since the ladies <i>will</i> insist on staying in the courtroom then he
<i>must</i> describe the meaning of the libel, thereby amplifying the
threat of female homosexuality through the very act of interpretation.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>

<p>
Forced to explain the libel, Williams constructs the ability to read
it accurately as dependent upon specific knowledge which he must,
unfortunately, disclose:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
You probably may have some idea, but unless you have some physiological
knowledge you will not appreciate in its fullness what the gross obscenity
of this phrase is. . . . [Y]ou cannot appreciate the gravity of the
charge against this lady unless you appreciate what the real meaning is
of this horrible phrase. [<i>VR,</i> 57-8]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
He performatively attempts to short-circuit the paragraph's seductive
potential with the intervention of scientific facts, didactically
explaining that because clitoral pleasure is unnecessary to procreation,
it is necessarily a lesbian vice. In Williams's interpretation, if
"clitoris" operates as a metonym for lesbianism, then its utterance in
conjunction with a woman's name clearly constitutes the worst accusation
to make against any woman: that she indulges a sexual desire extraneous
to any biological or social reproduction for the state.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
  In a Darwinian language of natural science, Williams undertakes what
  must be a first in British legal history: a graphic explanation of
  the situation and function of the clitoris, and its method of arousal
  in lesbian sexual practices.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
  With rhetoric that recalls nineteenth-century campaigns against
  masturbation, Williams denounces lesbian practices as "degrading,
  repulsive, contrary to nature, and consequently destructive of
  health--practices which, indulged in to any extent, sap and undermine
  the sanity and probity and self-respect . . . of those who indulge
  in them" (<i>VR,</i> 58). Ultimately, however, in order to stabilize
  the offensive meaning of the libel, he must have recourse to male
  homosexuality:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
If this paragraph had been dealing with men instead of with women
and had been headed "The cult of the penis," it would have required no
explanation. "The cult of the clitoris" is worse; it means the deliberate
perversion of all the natural instincts that nature has implanted in
man and woman, to the practice of a filthy, enervating and degrading
vice. . . . [reads paragraph aloud] What is the meaning of that? What
is the meaning of the heading "The Cult of the Clitoris?" It can have
no other reference than to the practice of this Lesbian vice; no other
meaning is possible. [ibid.]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Much like Humphreys's argument in the police court, Williams finally just
asserts the single possible reading that the title and paragraph make
necessary, although here he provides a considerable lesson in anatomy and
natural history. His simple declaration that "The Cult of the Clitoris"
is worse than "The Cult of the Penis" is devoid of any argument as to
why. In fact, the prosecution's strategy here rests upon a paradoxical
tautology: an argument that asserts transparent moral obviousness must
not be diluted or weakened by argumentation.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
  Within the problematic of interpretation, perhaps "The Cult of the
  Clitoris" is worse because it requires such lengthy explanation and
  interpretation. Since the location and "function" of the clitoris
  is so obscure and not known to the "ordinary" individual, the need
  for an uncomfortably explicit and protracted translation culminates
  in an atmosphere of enervated, exhausted shame. Certainly Williams's
  argument from analogy attests to the phrase's resistance to cultural
  legibility; supposedly anyone would know what "The Cult of the
  Penis" means, whereas Billing has manufactured a far more disturbing
  scene of perversion precisely because it refuses immediate cultural
  comprehension.

<p>
The speculation about "The Cult of the Penis" should also remind us that
this scandal over traitorous female body parts occurred at a time when
the British male body was being mutilated and dismembered on a scale
never before experienced. Men at the front encountered the unprecedented
ability of technological warfare to blow the male body into grotesque
fragments; those injured bodies that did survive hand grenades,

<b></b>

artillery fire, shelling, and surgical amputations testified to the
inconceivable experience of modern war. As Joanna Bourke writes, "The
horror of front-line dismemberment was beyond the imagination of many
civilians in Britain. They were not, however, totally unaware of its
impact on hundreds of thousands of men's bodies."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
  The returned injured soldier provided a corporeal metonym of the
  war's unimaginable violence against male bodies and masculinity
  itself. "In war," Bourke writes, "the injured man was not disabled
  but mutilated. He was the fit man, the potent man, <i>rendered</i>
  impotent. He was mutilated and mutilator in one."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
  Bourke's use of the loaded notion of male impotence alludes to
  castration as the classic trope of damaged masculinity. Trudi Tate
  suggests that "the distressing presence of war-injured men" effected a
  gender crisis by complicating the Freudian schema of gender difference
  in which the imaginary wholeness of phallic masculinity is constructed
  in opposition to women's castration.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
  "The Cult of the Clitoris" partakes of this wartime disruption of
  gender distinction constituted upon visible difference. The phrase
  dismembers and thus diminishes the female body, but it also invokes
  the danger of female sexual difference. It gestures to the genital
  "nothing" that constitutes female sexuality and, since the clitoris
  has been historically compared to the penis, it also signals the
  threat of a phallic woman. If masculinity was constructed against
  femininity's lack, then "The Cult of the Clitoris" confronts the
  vulnerable masculine body in wartime with a particularly menacing
  feminine sexual corporeality.

<p>
While a seemingly inexhaustible range of connotations emanate from
Billing's paragraph, the law had to judge its legal meaning. Whereas
Humphreys's speech for the prosecution at Bow Street suggested a vague
"connection" or relationship of "approval" between Allan and "unnatural
practices," the specific indictment for the Old Bailey trial claimed
that the title and paragraph meant



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
thereby that the said Maud Allan was a lewd, unchaste and immoral woman
and was about to give private performances of an obscene and indecent
character so designed as to foster and encourage obscene and unnatural
practices among women and that the said Maud Allan associated herself
with persons addicted to obscene and unnatural practices. [<i>VR,</i> 472]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Billing's plea of justification then not only stated that this indictment
was "true," but further denounced <i>Salom&eacute;</i> as "an open
representation of degenerated sexual lust, sexual crime, and unnatural
passions and an evil and mischievous travesty of a biblical story"
that was written by "a moral pervert" and was particularly attractive
to the German agents' list of the 47,000 (<i>VR,</i> 476). Notably, the
prosecution--not the publisher of the paragraph--actually translated
for the court what the libel meant; Billing merely claimed that this
reading was true and justified, and added the emphasis on the underlying
German invasion plot. However, because the indictment alludes to, but
does not explicitly <i>name</i> lesbianism, it opens a conspicuous gap
of interpretive possibilities, a gap which left considerable space for
Billing to mount an attack on Allan while evading specific definitions.

<b></b>



<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Experts and Perverts
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
When questioned about the meaning of the "Cult of the Clitoris,"
Dr. Serrell Cooke, an "expert" medical witness, explained that
"Clitoris is a Greek word, it is a medical term altogether; it has
nothing to do with ordinary language; nobody but a medical man, or
people interested in that kind of thing would understand the term"
(<i>VR,</i> 259). Semi-clarifying that "that kind of thing" refers
to sexual perversion, Cooke concludes, "'The Cult of the Clitoris,'
would have been very well understood by all the perverts all over the
world. It would not have been understood by ordinary people" (<i>VR,</i>
260). With "clitoris" as a transnational signifier that unites "all the
perverts all over the world," Cooke and the defense transforms the "cult"
of the clitoris into a cult of readers who can interpret the phrase. In
other contexts, Billing referred to the "initiated" as the only readers
who could understand the title.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
  This sense of a seductive cult of reading, which recalls the
  construction of Wilde in his trial, converges with the sexological
  taxonomies that constituted the homosexual as an exclusive species
  of shared traits, including shared discourse (recall the glossary in
  the German Prince's black book). Furthermore, in the war context,
  the suggestion of secret sects or communities "all overthe world"
  sharing bonds of language, practices, and values that supersede those
  of national loyalty draws upon and exacerbates paranoid fantasies of
  spies with shared codes, secret languages, and hidden allegiances. This
  distrust of nontransparent language feeds into the wartime crisis of
  knowing and reading, and backs Billing's legal defense.

<p>
As we have seen, Allan's lawyers play a game of interpretation with the
libel, alternately insisting on the obvious meaning of the paragraph,
and then assuming an innocent ignorance of the audience whom they must
educate into an appreciation of the libel's unimaginable horror. Billing's
defense turns such constructions to his own advantage: how could Allan
be innocent if she were able to recognize the phrase as an insult,
as a lesbian allusion? In a tactic that relies upon the expert versus
pervert opposition, Billing's cross-examination of Allan links knowledge
and sexual immorality:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Billing: Did Mr. Grein explain to you where the libel was and exactly
what it meant?
<br />
Allan: I do not think it is necessary for anyone to explain that paragraph
to me . . .
<br />
Billing: You are well acquainted with the names that arise in connection
with the [alleged libelous] matter?. . . [P]articularly with that one
[i.e. the clitoris]?
<br />
Allan: Not particularly at all, Mr. Billing.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Through his questions, Billing ascertains that yes, friends of Allan
saw the libel and understood its meaning, but no, neither she nor they
are medical students. Billing then triumphantly crows, "Are you aware,
Miss Allan, that out of twenty-four people who were shown that libel,
including many professional men, only one of them, who happened to be
a barrister, understood what it meant?" (<i>VR,</i> 85).

<p>
Admitting only two mutually exclusive realms of interpreters, educated
professionals and degenerate perverts, Billing demands Allan identify
herself in one group or the other. He then collapses the language of
homosexual aestheticism with the language of the German enemy when he
takes up Allan's autobiography and fixates on her study

<b></b>

and milieu in Germany. Reading such passages as "[In Berlin] I came
in touch with a broader spirit of what I had best call bohemian
bon camaraderie," and "the German tongue was our Esperanto," Billing
insinuates that Allan was part of an international "cult" whose adoption
of German as its common language marked it as morally depraved danger
to the British nation (qtd. in <i>VR,</i> 87).

<p>
Next, Billing reads passages from <i>Salom&eacute;,</i> insisting on
their perverse sexual meaning. Allan denies such an interpretation,
maintaining that Salom&eacute; is an innocent girl whose spirituality,
not her sexuality, is aroused in her relationship with Iokanaan. Allan's
refusal to read the play as remotely erotic belies her untenable position
in facing lesbian accusations; she is more on trial than the defendant
and must maintain her claim to chastity.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
  Ultimately, Allan's promotion of the play as spiritual and artistic
  is deployed against her. Billing insists that rather than proving her
  innocence, Allan's refusal to acknowledge the play's vice betrays her
  loyalty to the "cult" of readers who find beauty in perversity. Again,
  much like Wilde's trials, in which Wilde's modes of reading were
  considered symptomatic of his "gross indecency," Billing attempts to
  discredit Allan by constructing her as an "extraordinary" reader whose
  performance of a text by the "high priest" of an "outrageous cult"
  would appeal to the initiated.

<p>
While Allan claims that neither she nor Wilde is responsible for Billing's
prurient readings, Billing re-appropriates the same strategy with the
claim, "You quite understand that I am not responsible for what you read
into the libel," which leads to an explicit comparison of the libel with
the play:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Billing: Which do you think is the most likely to pervert public morals
in this country, the witnessing of such a play or the reading of the
paragraph complained of. [sic] Which do you think likely to do most harm
to the young men and the young women?
<br />
Allan: The paragraph that you have had printed in your paper.
<br />
Billing: Will you tell me why?
<br />
Allan: Because you suggest things to them that they do not know anything
about, and the curiosity of man is such that they will go and find out.
<br />
Billing: Are there any suggestions at all in this play?
<br />
Allan: Not that I know; if there are they are so veiled as not to
be obvious.
<br />
Billing: You think that that [paragraph] title is unveiled?
<br />
Allan: I think that it is draped from the shoulder.
<br />
Billing: It was meant to be understood by those who could understand it,
but was not meant to be understood by others?
<br />
Allan: That is what you say. [<i>VR,</i> 113-4]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Allan's apt metaphor of veiled language foregrounds the trial's contest
over translation and interpretation, and implicitly evaluates the libel
according to symbolist principles. For Allan, the artistic merit and legal
defense of <i>Salom&eacute;</i> rests in its fully veiled language. Signs
and symbols are caught up in such a thoroughgoing economy of shifting
signification that no phrase holds a single obvious meaning and desire
can never be categorized. Billing's libel, however, draped from the
shoulder and only half-veiled, insinuates enough that the correspondences
it forges intend to communicate vice and trap the vicious. According to
Allan, Billing's intention that the reader of "The Cult of

<b></b>

the Clitoris" paragraph should arrive at a particular sexual and political
meaning renders Billing guilty of the very vice of immoral suggestion of
which he is accusing Wilde. Allan's suitably elusive metaphor demonstrates
the potential of rative language with the effect of exposing Billing's
attempt to appropriate the symbolist impulse. Billing wants to fasten
guilt and shame with knowledge and absolute interpretations, while
Wilde's text and Allan's testimony staunchly refuse any such equation.

<p>
Veils and draperies here are also telling. Allan's metaphor suggests that
Billing's "draping" anticipates a dramatic unveiling, exposing a final,
naked body of lesbian meaning. The phrase "The Cult of the Clitoris" cites
the perverse materiality of the body--Allan's body--with the intent of
digging up Wilde's sentenced body to prove that its criminal corporeality
subtends <i>Salom&eacute;.</i> As Robert Ross wrote in a private letter
about the trial, "Kicking the corpse of Wilde has also been a pleasure
to the English people even if they disapprove of Billing's methods."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
  Billing's methods include casting suspicion upon Allan and Grein's
  reading practices by aligning them with the perverted symbolist
  aestheticism that veils and thus signifies Wilde's condemned homosexual
  body. Constructing his defense by prosecuting modes of reading,
  Billing invokes a play of allusion and correspondences which ultimately
  relies upon and references Wilde's established perversion. Wilde's
  "corpus" thus functions as the legibly deviant body that anchors and
  underscores the illegibility of the lesbian accusation.

The Topsy Turvey Language of a Homosexualist
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
Dr. Serrell Cooke, who defined the interpretive communities capable of
understanding the term clitoris, was Billing's most important expert
witness. Although a specialist in tuberculosis, Cooke claimed to be an
expert in matters of sexual psychology because he had studied Ricard von
Krafft-Ebing's <i>Psychopathia Sexualis</i> . Supposedly, after
he attended the hearings at Bow Street, he read <i>Salom&eacute;,</i>
"consulted several well-known London doctors about the play," and prepared
"a detailed medical synopsis of the play, explaining what it was really
all about" (<i>SLV,</i> 149). Under Billing's questioning, Cooke offered
an extraordinary sexual-linguistic diagnosis that (con)fused the symbolic
weight of Wilde with the alleged plot of German queer invasion. He told
the court that Grein's testimony exhibited a "rather extraordinary"
use of language. "Things which were physical, material, he described as
spiritual, poetic, beautiful," Cooke explained, noting that such language
"is usually employed by homosexualists" (<i>VR,</i> 248, 249):



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Billing: Is it customary for sex perverts to describe as beautiful and
glorious all their perversions? . . . And is it customary for them to
read into the distinctly physical acts of sex something spiritual?
<br />
Cooke: Spiritual, poetic, beautiful, pure love; those are their
expressions. . . . It is done because they cannot help themselves. I
think it is part of their mental condition.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In addition to undermining Grein, Cooke's testimony also reflects back on
Allan's cross-examination, as it diagnoses any symbolic mode of reading as
"customary for sex perverts."
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<b></b>

This perverse mode of interpretation can be appropriated or mimicked,
regardless of the speaker's sexual activity. Much like the instructive
glossary in the German black book, the patois can be learned and
deployed. Under cross-examination, Cooke evades accusing Grein of
homosexual <i>acts</i> (and thus evades libeling Grein) by making both
an association and a distinction between modes of reading and sexual
practices. When Cooke explains that he considers Grein's language "the
language of a sodomist," "Because he describes the sadistic acts [in
<i>Salom&eacute;</i>] . . . as something beautiful, spiritual, poetic,"
Williams cautions him, "Do you realise that to bring an accusation against
a man of being a sodomist is the most terrible thing to be said against
a man?" Cooke clarifies:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Cooke: I have not brought such accusation against any man. . . . It is
a curious matter of psychology that a man should use such language in
the description of this play.
<br />
Williams: Do not you think you left the Jury and the Court under the
impression that you were intending to convey that the man who used the
language of a sodomist used it because he was one?
<br />
Cooke: No, I did not intend to leave any such impression on the
Jury. [<i>VR,</i> 263-5]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Cooke relies upon an analogy that discredits Grein while protecting
himself: Grein reads Wilde "like" a homosexual (because he reads Wilde,
likes Wilde, and reads like Wilde) but this homosexual parlance does
not mean Grein <i>is</i> a homosexual. The particular claim that to read
like a homosexual means to read inversely--physical as spiritual, vice as
beauty--insists on a hermeneutics of homosexual contrariness that requires
a straight interpreter who could re-invert the claims of homosexual
speech in order to translate them into "ordinary" speech. This logic
also assumes a foundational "ordinary language" of direct reference, in
contradistinction to the symbolist mode where interpretations proliferate
but are never resolved. Billing and Cooke's game of inverse signification
easily aligns "speaking like a homosexualist" with both the propagandist
portrayal of Germany as a morally inverted culture, and the general
panic over the secret codes of foreign agents.

<p>
This construction of Wilde's inverted language is clinched when the
"original" translator of his play, Lord Alfred Douglas, takes the stand
as witness for the defense. He represents himself as straddling the space
between ordinary and extraordinary reading, in the dual position of expert
and ex-pervert. He insists that he was "entirely under Wilde's influence"
during the writing of <i>Salom&eacute;,</i> but now recognizes him to
be "the greatest force for evil that has appeared in Europe during the
last 350 years" (<i>VR,</i> 291, 287). Claiming that, "I translated the
play from the French, and I had many conversations with Wilde about it,
and I have a very particular knowledge of what he meant by the play,"
he contends that Wilde



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
intended the play to be an exhibition of perverted sexual passion
excited in a young girl. . . . [T]here is one passage which is
sodomitic. . . . Wilde was a man who cloaked up those things in flowery
language. He never used the word "sodomitic." He would express horror
at such language. Anything like the "Cult of the Clitoris" would fill
him with as much

<b></b>

horror as it apparently does Mr. Hume Williams. . . . [Who] share[s]
the horror of coarse and vulgar expressions, calling things by their
right names. [<i>VR,</i> 286]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, calling "things" what they <i>are not</i>, and an aversion to
calling things what they <i>are</i>, indicate an inverted sense of sexual
morality and a shameful guilt. Douglas's strategy, which privileges
"right names," even casts suspicion upon Williams's earlier performance
of his offense and disgust at the paragraph title.

<p>
With all symbolic modes of reading coded as perverted, Billing and Douglas
morally denounce the play's metaphorics, particularly the dialogue's
symbolic investment in the moon:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Billing: In your opinion has Oscar Wilde used the moon as a canvas on
which to paint pictures which were almost too revolting to do in any
other way?<br />
Douglas: Yes to paint the situation of the play as it proceeded.<br />
Judge: . . . Did he use the moon in this version as a canvas on which
to paint indecent and abominable pictures?<br />
Douglas: Yes, he did. Oh, yes.<br />
Billing: Would he have considered that the most artistic way of doing
it? . . . The most intellectual?
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Douglas: To him all that sort of thing, whenever he was going to do
anything particularly horrible, it was always disguised in the most
flowery language, and always referred back to Art. That was his idea of
Art. [VR, 292]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
When asked about Salom&eacute;'s desire for Iokanaan, Douglas translates
and explicates Wilde's mode of perverse representation:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Billing: Did Wilde mean [Salom&eacute;'s desire to touch Iokanaan's body]
to be physical or spiritual?<br />
Douglas: Physical. If anyone calls it spiritual it is a pure misuse of
words and making the English language ridiculous.<br />
Billing: Would you call that language the language of a sodomite?<br />
Douglas: I think [Wilde] was referring to the language used by people
who described it as spiritual. . . . [T]hose sort of people always
refer to revolting things under pretty names. They try to disguise the
horribleness of the action by giving it such names; they say beautiful,
classic, and so on. They will not speak of it by the outspoken English
name; they disguise it.<br />
Billing: Have these people a common patois?<br />
Douglas: Yes, they have a jargon. I have not had anything to do with
them for twenty years. [<i>VR,</i> 294]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The lapse of twenty years and Douglas's conversion to Catholicism,
conservatism, and homophobia distance him from "those sort of people"
and secure his reliability, while positioning him as a privileged
interpreter. "Translating" Wilde's perverse slippage between the
physical and spiritual world, Douglas arrives at a hermeneutics of
absolute inversion:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Billing: Did Wilde . . . ever give you an idea, when you were doing your
translation, that it was anything other than a physical expression of
unnatural practices? . . . [D]id he give you to understand that it was
a poem dealing with the spiritual love of a young girl finding salvation
in the spirit of the Prophet, or a young girl seeking lustfully the body
of the Prophet?<br />
Douglas: The point is that that is exactly how he would describe it. He
probably did call it spiritual. That was part of the jargon.<br />
Billing: Do you call it spiritual?<br />
Douglas: No. Wilde would call it spiritual; he would say it was a study
in the curious passions of the human soul. That was the sort of euphemism
he would use. He never used plain coarse words at all. He was always
revolted by coarseness of expression.<br />
Judge: He would call spiritual what you call sadism?<br />
Douglas: Yes. With those sort of people evil is their good; everything
is topsy turvey; physical is spiritual; spiritual is physical, and so
on; it is a perversion, an inversion, of everything. Wilde was a man
who made evil his good all through his life. That was the gospel he
preached. [<i>VR,</i> 294-5]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
With Dr. Cooke's and Douglas's testimonies Billing composes a strategy
of inverse translation for reading Wilde, <i>Salom&eacute;,</i> Grein,
Allan, and "those sort of people." Douglas's repeated use of the terms
"disguise" and "cloaking up" again res Wilde's language and reading
as covering over the body upon which his sexual guilt is inscribed,
and it tropes upon the enemy spy who lurks beneath the disguise
of assimilation. Wilde's mode of reading for correspondences marks
him as trading in a suspicious economy of counterfeit signifiers,
an inverted code of meaning that must be decoded and exposed for its
dangerous content. Billing's primary strategy throughout the trial
was to queer and discredit Allan's, Grein's, and Wilde's hermeneutic
practices; suitably, he finally secured his "innocence" by insisting
that Allan's indictment had <i>misread</i> his paragraph. Indeed, the
ambiguity of the indictment enabled Billing, during the prosecution's
concluding argument, to deny that he had ever actually claimed Allan
was a lesbian. Throughout the six days of the trial, he allowed the
prosecution to educate the audience on lesbians and their clitorises,
thus heightening the scandalous effect. However his final disavowal of
any lesbian intent renders him innocent of leveling an unforgivable libel
against a woman, while maintaining a distinctly queer moral insinuation
against Allan and <i>Salom&eacute;.</i> Having staged a seductive scene
of reading that excites the most elaborate lesbian fantasies, Billing
can then reassert his authority and officially refuse any lesbian
reference. This disavowal, I would propose, actually consolidates
and expands the lesbian threat; its banishment from referentiality
only confirms its potential ubiquity. Without referential stability,
it flourishes in the imagination. The innominate lesbian is the re
of greatest threat precisely because she is "only" what is "read into"
the phrase "The Cult of the Clitoris." The symbolist function of "The Cult
of the Clitoris" I suggested earlier now requires reassessment to account
for Billing's belated disavowal in court. The performative absenting of
lesbian reference endows lesbianism with an even more powerful symbolic
function through its very referential negation. That is, the erasure of
lesbianism from the court record and "The Cult of the Clitoris" achieves
a more profound symbolist effect. The symbolic mode is redoubled,

<b></b>

so that the <i>absence</i> of lesbian reference acts as a re for
revealing a (national) mood or "&eacute;tat d'&acirc;me" and becomes a
<i>de</i>materialized substitute for the intangible, floating, "minute,
intricate, almost invisible" life of British anxieties in wartime.

<p>
The trial, Wilde's play, and Allan's performance then come to metaphorize,
or translate, the crisis of the war into a scene of literary and sexual
fantasy. Decadent style represents seditious codes in contrast to the
"outspoken English" of the nation; Allan's hypnotic allure is conred
as the most insidious form of traitorous influence; sexual betrayal is
mapped onto national betrayal; and the violent dismemberment of male
bodies at the front lines is reconstituted as the anatomization of
female sexual deviancy. The press reports of Billing's acquittal also
yoke together the disorder in the court and the high emotions of wartime.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
  The <i>Daily Mail</i> reports that when the "not Guilty" verdict
  was uttered



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the gallery, packed with the public rose, shouting and
'hooraying.' . . . There has never been such an excited throng in the
new Central Criminal Court, or one which gave vent to its feelings more
vociferously. In vain did the judge try to give an order to suppress the
demonstration. His lips were seen moving, but his words stood no chance
of being heard.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The voice of the law is literally struck dumb by the force of the crowd,
and as the court empties, "Outside a distant murmur of voices and a faint
cheer; inside a last hysterical giggle as a woman went and a parting
'Hooray,' deep-toned, from a soldier in hospital blue"--a scene that
conjoins feminized hysteria with national service (ibid.).

<p>
Newspaper editorials suggested that the trial functioned as a phantasmatic
substitute for the war, and even identified it as a manifestation of mass
hysteria. The <i>Times</i> wrote, "It is safe to say that no lawsuit
of modern times has attracted such universal and painful interest as
the deplorable libel action which terminated yesterday at the Central
Criminal Court"; across England "the daily reports have been read and
discussed with almost as deep anxiety as the news of the war itself."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
  The <i>New Statesman</i> lamented, "A great battle is raging; armies
  are bleeding and dying; Paris is at stake; and for a week the interest
  of the British public has been almost entirely centred upon a trial
  for criminal libel."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
  According to the <i>Manchester Guardian,</i> "Even in the
  preoccupations of war-time the Pemberton Billing trial is an arresting
  London event." The reporter specifically diagnosed the public response
  to the trial as "the most extraordinary expression we have had of war
  psychology and the feverish distortion of normal beliefs," and the
  <i>New Age</i> considered the trial a demonstration of the "mob-mind."
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
 In a letter to the editor of the <i>Times,</i> a Labour M. P. insisted
 that Billing's paranoid conspiracy undermined the psychic health of
 the nation:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
By far the most serious aspect of the case is the effect upon the great
mass of our people, whose minds and thoughts at this moment are concerned
with the fate of their loved ones at the front. . . . Reckless assertions
. . . entirely unsupported by evidence, and defaming men and women alive
and dead, may well have a disturbing effect upon a public opinion already
racked with anxiety and tense with emotion.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Such a complaint attests to the cultural work performed by the trial. With
"loved ones" at the front engaged in a war that defied representation,
those at home witnessed a sexualized scene of strife upon which they
could displace anxiety and emotion, and the lesbian suggestion afforded a
particularly effective conduit for mediating this fantasy. Consequently,
even though a lesbian insinuation started the trial, as newspaper
commentators noted, "any issue was on trial at most times except the
one which was legally at stake."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
  The trial was clearly not <i>about</i> female homosexuality; however,
  lesbianism's combination of <i>un</i>representability and potent
  suggestibility offered a sensationally effective and exquisitely
  elusive means of ring Britain's political and epistemological
  crises of modern history.

Lord Darling, the judge in the criminal case, directly requested that
the press refrain from reporting the "disagreeable details" of the case
and emphatically warned that "there is no protection for the publication
of indecent matter in any newspaper. . . . [I]f it is indecent there is
no protection simply by reason of the fact that it is a report of what
is going on in the Court of law" (<i>VR,</i> 57-8). The <i>Manchester
Guardian</i> even printed this warning from the judge, foregrounding,
like many other newspapers, the unnamable obscenity of the case. See
"Mr Pemberton Billing and Miss Maud Allan," <i>Manchester Guardian,</i>

History</i> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995) for a nuanced

and insists on the continuities of tradition in the representation and
memorializing of the war. Notably, even though Winter strongly protests
the yoking of "modernism" (revolutionary aesthetic practices) and World
War I, he calls upon a relatively caricatured notion of modernism as a
radical break with the past that wholly disregards traditional forms of
representation. My argument attempts to strike a dialogue between the
war's simultaneous reliance and innovation upon established historical
forms.

William Cohen argues that male homosexuality, the "unspeakable" crime
and most covert of sexual practices during the late Victorian period,
is the appropriate locus for an analysis of scandal, while female
homosexuality is simply beyond imagination: "While the willful effort
to deny female sexuality resulted in celebrated adultery, divorce, and
illegitimacy cases, ironically it largely precluded lesbian scandals,
which were less unspeakable than unthinkable." William Cohen, <i>Sex

Notably, although <i>Salom&eacute;</i> clearly pays homage to symbolist
drama, the play also self-consciously ironizes the symbolist compulsion in
the very moment of enacting it. Thus, Herodias staunchly, even comically,
refuses to play the symbolist game of lunar similes with the rebuff,
"The moon is like the moon. That is all." Herod likewise ultimately
realizes that "It is not wise to find symbols in everything that
one sees. It makes life too full of terrors." <i>Salom&eacute;,</i>
in <i>The Portable Oscar Wilde,</i> ed. Richard Aldington and Stanley
Wientraub (New York: Penguin, 1981), 407, 419. In this sense, as much
as the drama exploits the symbolist compulsion, it also foregrounds its
maddening potential and keeps an ironic distance from the very paranoid
associative chains of meaning that Billing forges in 1918.

In the spring of 1913 Douglas charged Ransome with libel for his
literary biography of Wilde, which referred to the expurgated sections
of <i>De Profundis</i> and largely blamed Douglas, without naming him,
for Wilde's suffering. See Ransome, <i>Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study</i>
(New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1913). Douglas lost the case when the jury
decided that the words complained of did constitute a libel, but were
true. Notably, Justice Darling was the judge presiding over the case,
the same judge who presided over Billing's case.

In fact, "The Cult of the Clitoris" not only gestures to the "cult"
of Wilde (and the Dandy as the "cult of the self"), but also to the
cult of Sappho practiced by the all-women salons of Natalie Barney and
Ren&eacute;e Vivien or represented in Pierre Lou&yuml;s's <i>Songs of
Bilitis.</i> The phrase suggestively overlaps the decadent Sappho-revival
of Baudelaire, Lou&yuml;s, Vivien, Barney, and Swinburne with the
political reaction to the successes of the feminist movement. On the
sapphic revival in Paris, see Shari Benstock, <i>Women of the Left
Bank: Paris, 1900-1940</i> (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1986)

While the journal <i>Academy</i> published an enthusiastic review of

Mata Hari fabricated an identity as a Javanese dancer, claiming to give
authentic expression to Javanese and Indian sacred dances, which she
performed in little or no clothes. Capitalizing on the same Salomania
as Allan, Mata Hari performed her own "Dance of the Seven Veils," was
constantly compared to Salome, and urged her agent to ask Strauss to
produce a <i>Salom&eacute;</i> performance for her. Julie Wheelwright,

Mata Hari was immediately mythologized and her story exploited by war
propagandists. An example of this is Henry de Halsalle's, <i>The Life
Story of Madame Zelle, The World's Most Beautiful Spy</i> (London:
Skeffington and Sons, 1917), a sensational, fictionalized account of
Mata Hari's life as a German agent.

The First Sea Lord, Prince Louis Battenberg, whose father had been a
German prince; Lord Haldane, whose German education and diplomatic
ties made him a target of public hostility; and the vice-consul in
Rotterdam, A. G. Holzapfel, who was British-born with an unfortunate
appellation, were all forced to resign because of popular anti-alien
sentiment. See John Terraine, <i>The Impacts of War 1914 and 1918</i>
(London: Hutchinson, 1970). See also David French, "Spy Fever in Britain,
1900-1915," <i>The Historical Journal</i> 21.2 : 355-70, for a
discussion of the prewar and wartime history of popular sentiment and
official legislation regarding "aliens" and spies.

Trevor Wilson speculates that the public, unable to dispense with its
political and military leaders at this time, displaced its anxiety onto
a renewed campaign against enemy aliens in Britain. Terraine concurs,
diagnosing a vehement hatred and righteous indignation against the Germans
as a desperate civilian attempt to combat the "flagging of the spirit
as the war dragged on," and which found its most explosive expression
in anti-alien activity. Terraine, <i>Impacts of War,</i> 177.

and the Most Outrageous Trial of the Century</i> (New York: Arcarde,

sedition resonates with Allied anti-German propaganda that connected
homosexuality and German moral degeneracy. Propagandist works published
during the war such as Henry de Halsalle's <i>Degenerate Germany</i>
(London: T. Werner Laurie, 1917) and de Halsalle and C. Sheridan Jones's
<i>The German Woman and Her Master</i> (London: T. Werner Laurie, 1916)
expressly aligned sexual perversity in Germany with the country's moral
degeneracy, citing in particular "the unspeakable Eulenburg affair," in
which a group of "advisers and confidants of the Emperor" were exposed
as indulging in <i>le vice allemand</i> (155-6).

Allan's position as an actress actually feeds into the lesbian
suggestion. Havelock Ellis includes the theatre along with girls'

What might be the significance that lesbianism is "nameless" and not

Here is the full passage of Williams's instructive interpretation:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
[Y]ou cannot appreciate the gravity of the charge against this lady
unless you appreciate what the real meaning is of this horrible
phrase. . . . [T]he fact is that this particular part of the female
organization is open to treatment, let us say, other than by normal means
which nature intended. And, hence, there has come into this wicked world
undoubtedly a practice. . . .--recognised as a vice which is supposed
to have originated in the Island of Lesbos where there were women
and no men--a vice by which the clitoris can be excited (<i>six words
omitted</i>) and ways other than those which nature intended. And there
do exist in the world vicious practices where men are able to gratify
their passions with men, and women with women--degrading, repulsive,
contrary to nature, and consequently destructive of health--practices
which, indulged in to any extent, sap and undermine the sanity and probity
and self-respect . . . of those who indulge in them. [<i>VR,</i> 58]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The notion of the clitoris as extraneous will not only be elaborated
by Freud, but has a history stretching back to the middle ages. On
the discursive history of the clitoris, see Valerie Traub, "The
Psychomorphology of the Clitoris," <i>Gay and Lesbian Quarterly</i>
2 : 81-113 and Thomas W. Laqueur, "Amor Veneris, vel Dulcedo
Appeletur" in <i>Fragments for a History of the Human Body, Part
Three,</i> ed. Romona Naddaff and Nadia Tazi (New York: Zone, 1989),
90-131.

<p>
<a name="FOOT42" href="#REF42">42</a>.
Notably, the <i>Verbatim Report</i> makes a point of omitting the
"sixty-one words" in which "The learned counsel explained in a very
clear manner the precise situation and function of the clitoris" and
also "six words" in which he explains how the clitoris can be excited
(57, 58). It seems worthwhile to note that Marie Stopes's <i>Married
Love</i> was first published at the end of March 1918, reviews of
which can be sometimes found alongside editorials about the Billing
trial. An accessible and immmensely popular book for the lay public
on sexuality, it proposed the ground-breaking argument that sexual
knowledge, education, and instruction were all necessary for a healthy
marriage. Stopes explicitly and simply explained the importance of the
clitoris for female pleasure and argued vehemently for the benefits of
female sexual satisfaction (beyond reproduction). The trial, then, is
poised at, and contributesto, a revolutionary moment in the knowledge
of female body parts and conrations of female sexuality.

Billing's defense at the police trial had been that his libel could
not have posed a threat to public order, as only the "initiated" or
medical experts would understand the meaning of the phrase. Either the
understanding reader would already be corrupted, or would be a medical
expert, and thus incorruptible (<i>SLV,</i> 20).

<p>

<i>VR,</i> 84-5. Jennifer Travis similarly points out how Billing
tried to use Allan's knowledge of terms as "sadism" to prove her sexual
immorality. See "Clits in Court."

<p>
<a name="FOOT49" href="#REF49">49</a>.
One of Allan's repeated tactics for deflecting a sexual reading is an
appeal to orientalism, so that Wilde's curious phrases, such as "gilded
tigers," are shifted from the language of sexuality to the language of the
East; it is the authenticity of Wilde's orientalizing play that accounts
for its indecipherability and which an ignorant reader might misconstrue
as sexual. Allan thus attempts to intervene another "expert" position, one
of cultural and artistic knowledge, to cleanse the play of inherent sexual
transgression and consign Billing's reading to prurient scandal-mongering.

My thanks to Natalie Melas for pointing out this relationship.

<p>
<a name="FOOT52" href="#REF52">52</a>.
<i>VR,</i> 249. Hoare briefly cites some of this exchange and claims,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The exchange between Billing and Cooke rehashed all the old shibboleths
of the Wildean era; only now, prejudice masqueraded as pseudo-medical
'evidence.' It was the barely cloaked philistinism of an age whose
cultural horizons were foreshortened by war and desperate blind
patriotism. In 1918--nearly two decades into the twentieth century and
the modern era--these words were a direct reversion to Victorian values
and hypocrisy. [Hoare, <i>Oscar Wilde's Last Stand,</i> 145]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
I am arguing that we cannot dismiss such exchanges, as blatantly
outrageous as they appear now, as simply philistinism. The concern
with modes of reading seems a crucial context for the trial's ability to
connect issues of artistic practices, national security, sexual practices,
and moral codes.

<p>
<a name="FOOT53" href="#REF53">53</a>.
Cooke's exchange with Billing regarding sex perverts who "describe as
beautiful and glorious all their perversions," particularly when in
a courtroom, seems to be referencing Wilde's elegant account of "The
Love that dare not speak its name" in his own criminal proceedings. For
Wilde's speech, see H. Montgomery Hyde's <i>The Trials of Oscar Wilde</i>
(New York: Dover Publications, 1962), 256.

<p>
<a name="FOOT54" href="#REF54">54</a>.
That the unimaginable experiences of war at the front found an analogue in
Billing's trial is graphically suggested by the press's juxtaposition of
photographs and reports of the trial alongside maps of the battles at the
front. See for example, the <i>Daily Mail,</i> 1 June 1918, where a photo
of witnesses "who have given remarkable evidence in the Billing trial"
is positioned directly under a map of the front and the photo headline
"Huns Gain in France and Flanders." The <i>Times</i>' report of the
trial on 3 June, "Mr. Billing's Trial," frames a map of "Great Battles
Between the Oise and the Marne," while the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>'s
report of the "Frantic Demonstrations" at Billing's acquittal borders
a map of the front lines. The <i>Daily Mail</i>'s photo of the crowd
cheering Billing's acquittal appears directly beside a photo of "The
War Council of Versailles," with a photo headline that links the two:
"Billing Trial--After the Acquittal. Versailles Council."
