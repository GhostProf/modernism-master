<p>Suspended between two gallery walls in an installation photograph of 1915, Vladimir Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">Corner Counter-Relief, no. 133</span>  dramatizes the obduracy with which his sculpture has sat with silent agitation at the heart of modern art for almost a century [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>]. Invoked at the First International Dada Fair in 1920, awarded a gold medal at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925, engaged in American serial art of the 1960s,<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Tatlin's work has been employed repeatedly within the production of art but rarely addressed on its own terms. The greater part of the artist's most rigorous sculptures and designs now exist only in coarse photographs, which, like the one before us, are slow to disclose the details of their subjects. In what we see here, taut metal cables cross through the center and frontal plane of a bulky mass of metal scraps. Curved and bent pieces of aluminum and iron have been arranged along predominately x-, y-, and z-axes and tip slightly into the gallery space. Even from the single vantage point of the camera's lens, these surfaces present a complex interaction of planes. Along the left side of the large, central sheet of metal, it appears Tatlin has applied several strokes of paint or primer to his object with a bluntness one typically finds in the broad strokes of a house painter testing a swatch of color. Then again it is likely the artist merely found the metal this way. Indeed it is precisely the rawness of these materials in general  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and their utter lack of reference to a subject outside the work that contributes to the common claim that Tatlin's Corner Counter-Reliefs are best understood as works that acknowledge real space.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> No longer in the thrall of a sublimated gaze or fine touch of the artist, these works have been taken off the sculptural pedestal and off the gallery wall to now directly address a physical existence in the world. Yet, along this line, Tatlin's critics have moved no closer to breaking the reticence surrounding these objects. To dwell only upon the immanence of Tatlin's materials to everyday objects of the world misses the demanding orientation of such material elements within the constructed work itself. This observation is no less striking when we consider the political environments in which the artist actively participated: first as a leading re in Russian avant-garde circles preceding the October Revolution, then as an official in the Bolshevik state, and finally as a founding professor of the reorganized Soviet schools of art.</p>

</div>
<p>The following study will address this apparent discrepancy between the radical form of Tatlin's art and his political activity. More precisely, it will address his art <span style="font-style:italic;">as</span> a political activity, since it will privilege neither of these terms as a ground for the other. The most original and important work of Tatlin's career spans a period beginning in 1914 when he first began making constructed sculpture and ending approximately in 1932 when he permanently turned to painting comfortable, domestic easel pictures. The period in between is marked by three major phases: constructed sculpture he called Painterly Reliefs, Counter-Reliefs, and Corner Counter-Reliefs produced before 1917; state monuments he both planned himself and supervised of others following his appointment  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to head the Moscow Department of Fine Arts (IZO) in 1918; and finally, prototypes for everyday objects such as stoves and teapots he designed in the '20s while teaching and working at several institutes of art. In what follows I will look broadly at these three periods using primarily the insights available from the work itself but also the words of others with whom Tatlin shared close intellectual and artistic concerns. Of this latter, I will place particular emphasis on the poet Velimir Khlebnikov, who shared a personal working relationship with the artist and, more importantly, whose shifting social theories resonate strongly with the turns in Tatlin's own modes of production. This is to say that what follows will look at Tatlin's art in the period 1914 to 1932 through a strategy of interrelation: that of one phase of production to the next, of objects and words, and of Tatlin's work to his tumultuous social world.</p>
<p>The larger issue for the work of Tatlin and Khlebnikov here concerns collectivity. Against the sense of a collective as an anonymous, homogenous mass of people, the works in question speak to collectivity as a means of strengthening individual expression and resolve. As suggested in Khlebnikov's lines in the epigraph above—from his "supersaga" <span style="font-style:italic;">Zangezi</span> of 1922 (which Tatlin adapted for the stage)<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup>—the poet speaks of a singular "I" as central to realizing the collective "Many." These lines are a first indication of Khlebnikov's peculiar sense of language and mathematics that I will develop in relation to Tatlin's work. Though Tatlin rarely stated his views on the individual/ collection expressly, I offer one such instance as a final point of introduction. Penned in 1919 during his time with the IZO, the following are the first six of seven theses I render here as "The Initiating Unit in Collective Creativity" (the seventh I will quote and discuss later):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>1.   The initiating unit is the collector of the energy of the collective, directed towards knowledge and invention.</p></li>
<li><p>2.   The initiating unit serves as a contact between the invention and the creativity of the collective.</p></li>
<li><p>3.   The viability of the collective is confirmed by the number of initiating units distinguished by it.</p></li>
<li><p>4.   The initiating unit is the refraction point of the collective's creativity and brings realization to the idea.</p></li>
<li><p>5.   Art, always being connected with life at the moment of change in the political system (change of the collective-consumer), and being cut off from the collective in the person of the artist, goes through an acute revolution. A revolution strengthens the impulse of invention.</p></li>
<li><p>6.   Invention is always the working out of impulses and desires of the collective and not of the individual.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p></li>
</ol>
<p>What do these theses tell us? Though more descriptive than analytical and often repetitive, these suggest that Tatlin was at least explicitly attentive to the pressing issue within the new Bolshevik state of defining individual subjectivity in relation to collective society. But this is not to suggest Tatlin speaks exclusively of persons here. Similar to Khlebnikov, Tatlin creates ambiguity over what constitutes an individual by predominately using the word "<span style="font-style:italic;">edinitsa</span>" (the definition of which means variously unit,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> mathematical unity, one, individual) and thereby leaves his theses open to describe persons, the units of a numerical system, and, of special interest here, the material units of his sculpture. Yet to extract such a reading from this short piece by no means provides a direct heuristic for his artistic objects. To follow Tatlin's sixth thesis, his statements invite the historian to reexamine the collective "impulses" condensed in the material work. As I track these impulses across the two most critical decades of Tatlin's career, I will argue that his three periods of work formulate three distinct, yet interconnected, propositions on a politics of the individual. But to begin, I turn from the explicit account of individuality in 1919 to the other side of the Revolution, to the grit and grain of <span style="font-style:italic;">no. 133</span>, to another world perhaps, but one not entirely removed from imagining the individual as a "refraction point" of the collective.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Material As Such</h1>
<p>Upon arriving in Paris in the spring of 1914, Tatlin first encountered the results of Picasso and Braque's revolutionary turn to cubist collage in 1912. Before this trip, Tatlin had worked as an icon painter, a sometime sailor, and then, after 1911, an independent artist painting in a manner inflected by recent trends in Western Europe.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> He had studied the paintings of so-called Analytical Cubism in places like the famed collection of Sergei Shchukin in Moscow, but in Paris he saw, amongst other works, Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar and Bottle</span> arranged on a wall in Picasso's studio on the rue Schoelcher [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>].<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> Characteristic of the polysemic play in Picasso's work beginning in the fall of 1912, <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar and Bottle</span> includes a mesh-silhouette bottle, flat pieces of paper acting as a table and bounding wall, and Picasso's cardboard maquette of <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar</span> , together suggesting a café scene. It is <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar</span> in particular that Yve-Alain Bois has recognized as the first in a series of constructed works by Picasso that enact an arbitrary split between signifier and signified characteristic of a linguistic system of difference, as articulated by Saussure.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar and Bottle</span>, for instance, this line of thought would seek to explain how any particular object in the work gains meaning only through the placement, orientation, and number of other objects present. Add one more piece of paper on the table and the bottom edge of the guitar might cease to double as a newspaper; remove the paper of the table itself and the entire work would lose spatial orientation as a café scene. The crucial aspect of Tatlin's encounter with this work was that soon afterwards, on May 10, he exhibited the first of his own constructed sculptures.</p>
<p>Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">Painterly Relief ("Bottle")</span> of 1914 reveals his point of departure from Picasso [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]. Seen here in a photograph pasted and labeled by the artist in 1914–15, Tatlin's work, like <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar and Bottle</span>, combines three main elements. In Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">"Bottle"</span> each element is composed of a different material: tin-plate with wire (for the silhouette of a bottle and containing a shoemaker's last), a curved piece of cardboard, and wallpaper. Each object interacts or interlocks with another element, but there is no prevailing system—whether differential or otherwise—that defines the compositional order. Although a sense of illusionism remains in the bottle form of Tatlin's constructed sculpture, the work as a whole does not cohere into a continuous scene nor do the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> elements delimit an illusionistic space, two qualities conceived with the barest means but nonetheless characteristic of Picasso's construction.</p>

</div>
<p>Maria Gough has argued convincingly that the difference between Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">"Bottle"</span> and Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar and Bottle</span> hinges on a notion of <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>—a vital concept for the Russian and Soviet avant-gardes during the 1910s.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> Typically rendered in English as either "facture" or "texture," the Russian word "<span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>" generally denotes the material quality of a work of art, encompassing both the work's final state and the process of its making. <span style="font-style:italic;">Faktura</span> in this general sense emphasizes the authorial presence of an artist to work materials such as oil paint or stone in a manner that shows the subjective markings of the artist's hand. During the 1910s, however, art theorists and artists began to use <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> to designate specific qualities of materials themselves, distinct from their treatment by an artist. As Gough argues, it is Tatlin's constructed sculpture that fully  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> realizes this new sense of the term. Each individual material element in his "Selections of Materials," as Tatlin also called these works, is used in a manner that does not alter the fundamental state in which he found it. For instance, "Tensile materials such as wire and rope were pulled taut, solid wooden planks were sawn into smaller blocks but never carved."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> In short, <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> came to denote what Gough calls "materiological determination" in Tatlin's constructed sculpture, where material itself determines its own qualities within the work. Reversing the common notion of <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>, materials in the Counter-Reliefs produce meaning independently of Tatlin's own (minimal) handling or treatment of the objects themselves.</p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Faktura</span> alone, however, does not fully account for the challenging form of the Counter-Reliefs. While it is clear that the individual elements in Tatlin's constructed sculpture do not participate in the semiotic play one finds with Picasso, the issue of composition is complex. Initially, the materiological determination of each element  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in Tatlin's work would seem to re the Counter-Reliefs in the long history of non-composition in the twentieth century. Ranging from Duchamp's readymades to monochromes to seriality in the 1960s, non-compositional strategies have been employed in a variety of ways to minimize the arbitrary decisions made by an artist in producing a work.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> While the notion of <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> would remove some degree of subjectivity from Tatlin's constructed sculpture, these nonetheless are complicated by the fact that <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> addresses only the motivation of individual units and not their arrangement into a cohesive totality. The first clue to pushing composition a step further appears in Tatlin's decision to display <span style="font-style:italic;">"Bottle"</span> as inverted in 1914–15, situated above a caption for the exhibition <span style="font-style:italic;">Moscow Artists—to War Victims</span> that took place soon after Tatlin completed the original work [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]. Scholars typically illustrate this work with the bottle set on its base, oriented diagonally above wallpaper at bottom right, but Tatlin's decision to paste the bottle with the opposite orientation shows evidence of unease over a latent illusionism.</p>
<p>Following the first Painterly Reliefs of 1914, we can track several subtle, but important, shifts in compositional tactics in the later Counter-Reliefs and then Corner Counter-Reliefs. In another <span style="font-style:italic;">Painterly Relief</span> of 1914, pieces of wood, metal, and wallpaper are again arranged on roughly hewn boards [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>]. Here Tatlin includes a cubist "sickle" (as Malevich would later call this mark) drawn on the wallpaper.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Though abstract in and of itself, this mark alters the nature of the wallpaper on which it is drawn. Wallpaper becomes a ground for the re of the sickle. And as we look to the work as a whole, there is a similar relationship for objects placed upon the wooden board registering as more significant "res" than the wooden "ground" onto which they are attached. In such a relationship, each material element cannot freely assume the independent qualities of its own <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>. In the subsequent Counter-Reliefs of 1915, we find this implicit hierarchy of re/ground approached in a number of ways: using more irregularly shaped objects, joining materials along a horizontal axis (thus avoiding the bound "picture plane" of the Painterly Reliefs), or attaching elements directly to the gallery wall. In each case, however, the problem of hierarchy is only displaced, not directly addressed.</p>
<p>Hierarchy and re/ground are more substantially reworked with Tatlin's introduction of the Corner Counter-Relief, first exhibited at <span style="font-style:italic;">0.10: The Last Futurist Exhibition</span> in Petrograd in December 1915. The photograph of <span style="font-style:italic;">Corner Counter-Relief, no. 133</span>, discussed above [<a name="1-text" href="#1">1</a>], shows this work installed at <span style="font-style:italic;">0.10</span>, its catalog number "133" visible at the back right. Also visible within the frame are two of the four total pages from a pamphlet Tatlin published on occasion of the exhibition.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> The upper page shows a detail photograph of the other Corner Counter-Relief on display, <span style="font-style:italic;">no. 132</span> [<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>], and in the bottom page we can discern <span style="font-style:italic;">Painterly Relief</span> [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>]. From these installation photographs, one notices several key points about Tatlin's use of materials by the end of 1915. Paper, which is used in nearly all of the Painterly Reliefs, is now relegated to the gallery wall. No longer rendered as a drawing surface, paper is used in two ways: as a textured, fragile surface hanging on the wall and as printed matter.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> Further, the system of wires, rope, and pulleys suspending these sculptures between  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> gallery walls eliminates the need for a planar support, as the cable in <span style="font-style:italic;">no. 132</span> creates tensile strength and linear contour in space. The bulk of the objects are now fashioned exclusively from either metal or wood, joined by suturing together punctured surfaces with hardware. While I would not go as far as to claim these works dissolve a hierarchy of re/ground, their compositional arrangement now provides greater independence and specificity to the <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> of each material. Tatlin's Corner Counter-Reliefs address even the flatness and load-bearing qualities of the gallery wall itself, while engaging the openness within the room by occupying space in midair, calling to mind Tatlin's later statement in 1921, "I can look upon the sky as concrete material."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p>The wires and ropes in Tatlin's Corner Counter-Reliefs also achieve a dramatic sense of intersection and crossing through the totality of elements. It is characteristic of Tatlin's entire run of constructed sculptures that the individual materials in each work connect to one another either through overlap or intersection.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> The typical mode of linking elements in earlier works like <span style="font-style:italic;">"Bottle"</span> occurs primarily through overlap. But beginning with the Counter-Reliefs and especially in the dramatic manner in which wires pierce the Corner Counter-Reliefs, materials in the later sculptures tend to interpenetrate and intersect one another. Even though this final observation seems a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> simple one, it is of significant import for the overall project. The insistent intersection of individual elements makes clear that units function as a totality, even if brought together according to the properties and qualities of individual materials.</p>

<p>Thus far I have primarily discussed Tatlin's constructed sculptures with respect to Cubism. Although it seems Tatlin's 1914 trip brought upon his sudden change from painting to sculpture, the direction of his work within the medium of sculpture has as much if not more to do with specifically Russian concerns than Picasso's Paris. We might look more closely at <span style="font-style:italic;">0.10</span>. During the preparation of this exhibition, a long-simmering tension between Tatlin and Malevich erupted in a standoff in which both artists and their followers refused to exhibit with the other and split the gallery space between Malevich's "Suprematists" and Tatlin's "Exhibition of Professional Artists." Malevich inaugurated the term "Suprematism" at <span style="font-style:italic;">0.10</span> by hanging his <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Square</span> high in the corner of his gallery, thereby proclaiming truth and necessity in painting by demonstrating its ultimate point of reduction, its zero degree [<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>].<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

</div>
<p>That Tatlin and Malevich both installed their most ground-breaking new works in the corner of their respective galleries at <span style="font-style:italic;">0.10</span> is no coincidence. In traditional Russian homes, the place between two walls was reserved for icons and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Krasny Ugol</span>, the "red" or "beautiful" corner, held a revered icon and designated the most important place in the house. We might read Tatlin's placement of the Corner Counter-Reliefs as a move to trump or at least match Malevich's similar placement of <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Square</span>. Yet, more significantly, Tatlin's reference to traditional Russian icons resonates with a primitivism underlying his works. His initial entry into the Moscow art scene in 1910 had been mediated through Mikhail Larionov and the "Jack of Diamonds" group, whose paintings drew imagery from traditional Russian peasant woodcuts (<span style="font-style:italic;">lubki</span>). Tatlin's were no exception. In 1923, the critic Nikolai Punin would reflect, "The Russian icon had much more profound influence on [Tatlin] than Cézanne or Picasso."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> This claim is provocative, especially as Punin was Tatlin's most ardent critical ally and worked alongside him at the IZO. However, the more telling comparison here between Tatlin and Picasso, I would propose, pertains to their approaches to primitive art in general.</p>
<p>By the time Tatlin arrived in Paris, Parisian artists had been in the thrall of African art for almost a decade.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> As Simon Gikandi has argued of Picasso in particular, the latter's encounter with African art was always, if unconsciously, in the service of visual appropriation and cultural containment. Picasso trod carefully in his dialogue with African masks only later to disavow their centrality to Cubism.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> The primitive operates differently for Tatlin. Picasso had appropriated from a culture completely removed from his own, while Tatlin's relationship to the Russian icon was more conflicted. As an urban Moscovite, his adaptation of rural Russian artistic forms set him in a similar  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> position of taking from a cultural Other; however, it also aligned his art under the same national identity as that Other. His case is perhaps more comparable to Paul Gauguin's religious pictures of Brittany. The subtle move of Tatlin's primitivism into sculptural production, then, integrates the tradition of the Russian icon without doing so iconically. These icons are notable for being surrounded by elaborate frames composed of heterogeneous materials, a fact Tatlin would have known well from his icon-painting apprenticeship as a young man. His constructed sculptures use a related material heterogeneity to transform Picasso's constructed sculpture into a contemporary Russian form. The placement of these works in the corner of galleries makes this transformation all the more explicit.</p>
<p>Another key position in ring Tatlin's exchange with primitivism appears in the linguistic theory of Velimir Khlebnikov. In 1909 Khlebnikov left behind studies in math and science to join a group of Futurist poets in St. Petersburg including David Burliuk, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Aleksandr Kruchenykh. Voldemars Matvejs has described Khlebnikov's "flowering of primitivism" in poems of 1911 as similar in kind to desires for a prehistoric natural world one finds in Larionov or the Parisian <span style="font-style:italic;">douanier</span>, Henri Rousseau.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> But Khlebnikov and his literary circle were also engaged early on in questions of materiality. In 1910 the group published an anthology printed on wallpaper. A few years later in 1913, against the backdrop of a 1912 essay by Burliuk called simply "<span style="font-style:italic;">Faktura</span>," Khlebnikov co-authored two essays with Kruchenykh, "The Word as Such" and "The Letter as Such," that theorize what might be called a phonic determinism for the individual word and the individual letter.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Without referring explicitly to <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>, the first essay anticipates the growing trend towards material specificity in the visual arts by claiming that "Henceforth a work of art could consist of a <span style="font-style:italic;">single word</span>, and simply by a skillful alteration of that word the fullness and expressivity of artistic form might be attained."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> But as Khlebnikov would soon realize, words "as such" were too diverse to securely ground a scaffolding of literary essentialism.</p>
<p>So he turned to "The Letter as Such." Presumably written later in 1913, this essay rebukes those who had adhered too closely to the authors' previous claims about the word: "No one argues any more about the word as such, they even agree with us. But their agreement does no good at all, because all those who are so busy talking after the fact about the word say nothing about the letter. They were all born blind!"<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> In less polemical texts, Khlebnikov would explain that his determinism of the letter rests on a theory that meaning arises directly from individual phonic sounds. He explains, "With <span style="font-style:italic;">m</span> begin names signifying the very smallest members of several sets of things … The <span style="font-style:italic;">v</span> name expresses an act of subtraction … K begins words that deal with death: <span style="font-style:italic;">kolot'</span> [to stab], (<span style="font-style:italic;">po</span>)-<span style="font-style:italic;">koinik</span> [deceased], <span style="font-style:italic;">koika</span> [hospital bed], <span style="font-style:italic;">konets</span> [end]."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> The viability of Khlebnikov's theory is a question I will put to the side. My interest is in the <span style="font-style:italic;">impulse</span> of this theory. Khlebnikov's search for the basic unit of language is akin to Malevich's desire to establish a zero degree in art or the use of <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> in Tatlin's art to individualize the material units of his constructed sculpture. Anticipating Tatlin's sculptural project, Khlebnikov had written a warning in "The Word as Such" against illusory uses of materials. Connecting painterly illusion with false testimony, he cautions, "a sermon  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that doesn't derive from the art itself is nothing but wood painted to look like metal. And who would trust a weapon like that?"<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>So what kind of political weapon was <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>, then? One indication appears in a statement by Khlebnikov in 1919: "Each individual word resembles a small workers' collective, where the first sound of the word is like the chairman of the collective who directs the whole set of sounds in the word."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> The following year Tatlin registered a similar observation: "What happened in '17 in a social sense had been carried out in our fine craft in 1914, when 'material, volume, and construction' were established as a principle."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Khlebnikov and Tatlin were in fact close associates, having first met when Tatlin designed a stage set for Khlebnikov's play <span style="font-style:italic;">Tsar Maximilian</span> in 1911, and one of the few images we have of Tatlin before 1917 is a portrait drawn by the poet. But to follow up on the hindsight of both artists after the October Revolution that <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> had been politically defiant all along, we must look to the interrelation of <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>, primitivism, and the political discourse on collectivity in the years leading up to 1917.</p>
<p>A recent study by Oleg Kharkhordin titled <span style="font-style:italic;">The Collective and the Individual in Russia</span> recasts the common assumption that political initiatives before and after 1917 sought to turn aggregates of individuals into unified masses. While the dialectic of individual and collective has long been a backbone of theoretical debates on Marxism, Kharkhordin's study calls attention to the specific historical moment in which early Bolshevik theory vigorously tested the positions of these debates to find a viable means of realizing the full potential of individuals in a collective society.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> The term "collective" (from the Russian <span style="font-style:italic;">kollektiv</span>) was coined in the first decade of the twentieth century by social psychologists seeking to describe a new phenomenon observed after the first Russian Revolution of 1905 in which groups spontaneously gathered in public, be they crowds or armed forces.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Following its psychological inception, a notion of <span style="font-style:italic;">kollektiv</span> then migrated into Bolshevik state planning. One leading re in this arena was Anatolii Lunacharsky, Commissar of Enlightenment for the Soviet state and, in this capacity, Tatlin's superior when he worked for the IZO. Along with Maxim Gorky, Lunacharsky had first addressed the issue of collectivity through a notion of "God-building." Following the return to power of Tsar Nicholas II after the uprisings of 1905, they published "Essays on the Philosophy of Collectivism" in 1907, arguing that Marxism and collectivism should be adopted as a new religion to bind together the proletariat. This "God-building," however, promoted collective formation by placing one's faith in the predetermined ideas of central leaders and therefore proved too similar to the social orders Lunacharsky was himself attacking. To address this problem, Bolshevik thinkers increasingly turned in the 1910s to cultivating <span style="font-style:italic;">lichnost'</span>, meaning the unique qualities of persons and their potential for action in everyday life. Following the October Revolution and his appointment to Commissar, Lunacharsky wrote "The Basic Principles of the United Labor School" in 1918 which stresses the importance of state planning that would cultivate <span style="font-style:italic;">lichnost'</span> without repeating the egoism of bourgeois individuality. "[Socialist education] does not harness individualization …," he wrote, but rather "the individual [<span style="font-style:italic;">lichnost'</span>] remains the highest value of socialist culture. This individual can develop all its endowments only in a harmonic and solidary society of equals."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>For Tatlin's constructed sculptures within the social imagination of the 1910s, these 121 works can be read as a map for staking out a new relationship between individuals and their formation in collectives. Bringing together the two significant strains of development in Tatlin's sculpture after 1914—the negotiation of hierarchy amongst individual parts and the aggressive intersection of these materials to create a single form—the social insight in the constructed sculpture, and particularly the Corner Counter-Reliefs, displays how a new collective form might emerge from the <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> of different materials uniquely arranged.</p>
<p>Thus <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> in Tatlin's work, like phonic determinism for Khlebnikov, captures how singularities might come together in an integrated and total form without diminishing the uniqueness of each individual member. In line with the investment in <span style="font-style:italic;">lichnost'</span> emerging during the 1910s, we might conclude that Bolshevik intellectuals increasingly came to view collectivity as a <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> of persons: a political formation generated by its individual members and empowered through the conjunction of these singularities. Nevertheless, to speak of empowerment among individuals in a collective steps beyond the determinism, which marks the projects of both Tatlin and Khlebnikov before the Revolution. There is no positive force between Tatlin's materials or Khlebnikov's phonic sounds, as the meaning of these individual parts must be established a priori. This is a problem Tatlin's art would take up after 1917: a search for a theory of individual and collective <span style="font-style:italic;">in process</span>.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The First Monument Without a Beard</h1>
<p>When revolution broke out in 1917, Tatlin ceased making constructed sculpture. He remained in Moscow and in 1918 took up his post as head of Moscow's division of the IZO. In this capacity, he was charged by Lunacharsky with carrying out Lenin's plan to replace Russia's old monumental sculpture with works appropriate to the new state's socialist aims. Tatlin's most famous contribution to the IZO, however, was not the structures he oversaw but his personal submission, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Monument to the Third International</span> [<a name="7-text" href="#7"> 7</a>].</p>
<p>Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>, as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Monument</span> is often called, has quite a remarkable design. It was to be enormous and dwarf the Eiffel Tower in height. Yet Tatlin's plans to realize such a towering monument never moved beyond a few drawings and a model of about three meters exhibited at the Eighth Soviet Congress on November 8, 1920. He never indicated how such a large structure would or even could be built. He did propose how the completed <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> would function. It would house the administrative body of the Comintern in four glass structures suspended within the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>'s open lattice frame. According to a 1921 essay by Punin, the lowest hall would be shaped as a cube and house the legislative body, the next level a pyramid and house executive functions, the third level a cylinder and house information centers, and the final level a half-sphere and broadcast a radio signal. In addition, each level would rotate at a different speed: the cube completing a single rotation annually, the pyramid monthly, and the cylinder daily.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p>Although the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> looms large in the history of modern art, historical accounts generally reiterate the arguments provided by Punin in 1921. He proclaimed the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>'s revolutionary importance on three counts: first, it would be a functional structure as the center of operations for the Comintern; second, it would maintain a truth to modern materials by using only metal for its structure and glass to demarcate interior spaces; and third, its dynamic spiraling lines and tilted orientation would provide a vital symbol of the Revolution.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> Tatlin originally planned to dedicate his monument to the October Revolution, but within a year it was re-dedicated to the Comintern. Yet whether nominally assigned to the Revolution or the Comintern, the structure Mayakovsky called "the first monument without a beard" was conceived under the auspices of Lenin's 1918 plan and I propose that its social efficacy is best understood in relation to this program.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup></p>
<p>In a sharp turn of events that characterized the experience of many, Tatlin's appointment to the IZO transformed him from radical outsider in his field to one of its central administrators. He was responsible for seeing through multiple criteria in Lenin's plan, including stipulations to remove Tsarist works, to mobilize and organize  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> artists, and most importantly, to work quickly. In a memorandum written in May 1918, Tatlin described the nature of the task as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Monuments should be erected in boulevards, public gardens and the like in all districts of Moscow, with quotations or maxims engraved on the pedestals or surroundings, so that these monuments should appear like street rostra from which living words should fly to the mass of the people, stimulating minds and consciousness of thought.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Yet a look at the type of work to which Tatlin refers reveals a stark difference between the tone of this letter and the projects he administered.</p>
<p>In a photograph taken on November 7, 1918 [<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>], we see the unveiling of one such work, an over-life size monument of Karl Marx by the sculptor Aleksandr Matveev. This is a typical monument in two senses: it is a prime example of the vast majority of monuments produced under Lenin's program, but also, it demonstrates the common social function of monuments as characterized by the scholar James Young. Drawing from Young's analysis of Holocaust monuments in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Texture of Memory</span>, this statue of Marx might be described as "unabashedly rative, heroic, and referential."<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Matveev's monument is also situated in a public plaza, of which Young writes, "memorials provide the sites where groups of people gather to create a common past for themselves, places where they tell the constitutive narratives, their 'shared' stories of the past."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> The Bolsheviks astutely realized that a new government sustains legitimacy only if its claim to power is provided a history in the popular imagination. Therefore they also employed a parallel strategy of re-inscribing existing statues. In 1918, for instance, the names of Marx, Engels, Campanella, Winstanley, Thomas Moore, Saint Simon, Proudhon, Bakunin, and Plekhanov were carved onto an Imperial obelisk in Petrograd, effectively overwriting that city's physical traces of memory.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>The monument Tatlin contributed to Lenin's plan looks nothing like those designed by Matveev and others. It also functions differently regarding memory. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> is not an object linking past to present, but rather, one linking present to future. Although Tatlin's decision to switch the memorial attribution of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> from the Revolution to the Comintern may well have been a bureaucratic matter of timing and deadlines, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> suits both as an object carrying forth the international revolution. Conceiving revolution as a continuous process and the Comintern as its living body, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> articulates the forward march of both entities through its constant and differentiated layers of motion. Its orientation to ongoing events of the present and future is made more explicit still in its status as a model for a monument. The difficulty of realizing Tatlin's design—or more accurately, we might say the impossibility, circa 1920—assigned his monument a life of potentiality. It never obtained a physical site amidst a community, but thrived as an <span style="font-style:italic;">idea</span> of a monument available to myriad communities. In 1925, Tatlin built a second model for the Soviet pavilion at the International Exhibition in Paris, as mentioned above. That same year, another, simplified version of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> was built (presumably not by Tatlin) for a May Day parade float. Though any object has the potential to be inscribed into new situations over time, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> addresses its  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> own condition as open-ended and thus inverts the myth of stabilizing time and place that characterizes typical monuments of heroic res.</p>

</div>
<p>The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>'s inversion of heroic individuality thus brings us back to Tatlin's essay on the "Initiating Unit," from which we might now consider its final thesis:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>7. The world of numbers, as the nearest to the architectonics of art, gives us: 1) confirmation of the existence of the inventor; 2) a complete organic connection of the unit with the collective numeral. There is no error in Khlebnikov's example. 1) "In a series of natural numbers, prime numbers, indivisible and non-recurring, are scattered. Each of these numbers carries with it its new numerical world. From this it follows that among numbers too there are inventors." 2) "If we take the principle of addition, and add one more to a thousand units, the arrival and departure of this unit will be unnoticed. If we take the principle of multiplication, then a positive singular multiplied by a thousand makes the entire thousand positive."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here Tatlin claims the initiating unit is not only essential for collective activity, but 125 in fact energizes the many. I invoked Tatlin's first six theses earlier as an initial rubric for considering the collective formation of material units in his sculpture of the teens, but the energy of the "initiating unit" to concretize <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> to set the collective in motion moves beyond the additive logic of collage and <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span> to that of multiplication. Though suggestive of the earlier work, the particular model of individual/collective in the seven theses as a whole firmly describes Tatlin's work after 1917. I would argue the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> expresses this move towards a generative notion of individualism—a unique singularity, constantly moving and being reinvented, and connected with a changing global community. In other words, as situated within Lenin's monument project, Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> represents the individual without depicting a specific, historic person. It enacts the <span style="font-style:italic;">relation</span> of the revolutionary individual to the collective. Yet to fully understand this claim, we must return the re of Khlebnikov lingering in Tatlin's final thesis.</p>
<p>Between 1915 and his untimely death from illness in 1922, Khlebnikov's ideas became increasingly complex and provocatively strange. He continued to theorize language, but this project shifted from attempting to locate an Archimedean point in phonetics to expanding this search to numerical ratios. He created various self-appellations, calling himself at one time or another Martian, President of the Planet Earth, King of Time, and of special note here, founder of the Society of 317.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Khlebnikov imagined his society would include 317 scientists, writers, and artists creating a government of time to replace the historical function of the state to govern space. Though founded in February 1916, the Society remained one of his many unrealized projects. 317 itself nonetheless serves an important role in his social theories. Based on his estimate for the median number of human heartbeats a day when multiplied by 365,<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> the number 317 was applied to find (or, more properly, invent) recurring ratios in the history of civilizations:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>If we conceive of all mankind as a string, then the most diligent and thorough study reveals that there is an interval of 317 years between soundings of the string … We observe that the Napoleonic Code came into existence 317 x 4 years after the Code of Justinian (A.D. 533). That two empires—the German and the Roman—were founded 317 x 6 years apart: Germany in 1871, Rome in 31 B.C.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Khlebnikov offered similar arguments for the human body and labor market, calling heartbeats "the monetary units of the future, in which all individuals are equally wealthy."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> Such a conception of history—no matter how creative in its calculations— was not a strategy to diminish the importance of historical change. Khlebnikov sought constant ratios in human history as a means of finding rationality in the seemingly random patterns by which societies form and disband. All of this staged, of course, against Russia's own impending upheaval. After 1917, Khlebnikov dedicated himself more ardently to enacting his social plans by lecturing to soldiers on the southern front and codifying (while further complicating) his numerical ratios in a final unfinished work, The Tables of Destiny.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Throughout Khlebnikov's struggle to ground a politics of unification, the role of the individual remained central. As he describes, "We must divide up humanity into inventor/explorers and all the rest. A class of farseeing visionaries."<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> These "inventor/ explorers" strike a distinct harmony with Tatlin's initiating unit, and likewise, Tatlin's reference to Khlebnikov in his seventh thesis stems directly from the latter's theory of historical ratios. Tatlin's individual that makes the "entire thousand positive" evokes a reciprocal relationship by which a single entity embodies the many and in turn engages, creates, and therefore constantly remakes the unity of the whole. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>, in turn, actualizes this vision not only by the fact that it would literally embody international workers for the proliferation of communism but also by its important function as a communications center.</p>
<p>The fact that Tatlin's proposed structure would broadcast a radio signal coincides with one of Khlebnikov's best-known proposals for harnessing the universal, if invisible, signals of the universe. In "The Radio of the Future" of 1921, an essay he originally titled "The ROSTA of the Future" (changed posthumously in 1927),<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> there are three main points that recommend Khlebnikov's argument to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>. First, he addresses the radio as a technology that will literally bring people together in "Radioauditoriums." Here describes a potential music broadcast: "The entire settlement has gathered around to listen … The metal trumpet mouth loudly carries the news of the day, the activities of the government, weather information, events from the exciting life of the capital cities."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> So at its most simplistic level, radio acts as a conduit for collecting crowds. Beyond this, radio also unites the minds of those listening and those broadcasting. A radio signal is present everywhere and at all times. Like Lenin's drive to spread electricity to the entire USSR in the 1920s, Khlebnikov described radio as a means to collapse the vast spaces of separation between rural populations and urban life. He describes a potential music broadcast as follows: "The Mussorgsky of the future is giving a coast-to-coast concert of his work, using the Radio apparatus to create a vast concert hall … On this one evening he bewitches the people, sharing with them the communion of his soul."<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> Similar to Lenin's famous dictum "Communism equals Soviet power plus electrification of the entire country," Khlebnikov conceived radio signals as saturating the very material of the nation and thereby concretizing the connections among members of diverse communities. The third aspect of Khlebnikov's approach to radio is a consequence of the first two. Once the populace is connected by radio, both externally and internally, by body and mind, the signal will transform processes of thought and perception. As he explains, "Every settlement will have listening devices and metallic voices to serve one sense, metallic eyes to serve the other. Finally, we will have learned to transmit the sense of taste—and every simple, plain but healthful meal can be transformed by means of taste-dreams carried by Radio rays, creating the illusion of a totally different taste sensation."<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> It is lines like these that might lead one to read Khlebnikov's radio essay as a precursor to theories of media society, which is especially tempting when he claims in another section that radio signals also transmit visual rays (akin to television). Yet there is a fundamental difference between Khlebnikov's radio society and postwar critiques of spectacle and technological saturation. Rather than totalizing its  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> collective users, this imagined radio society must be understood as yet another case of empowering and engraining the "inventor/explorer" in the collective.</p>
<p>In sum, the radio appears as one of the many terms through which we can track a dialogue between Khlebnikov and Tatlin until the former's death in 1922. Regarding the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>, it fascinates that in 1915–16 Khlebnikov wrote of "[Building] apartment houses in the form of steel frameworks, into which could be inserted transportable glass dwelling units." And further, "[Erecting] portable moving monuments on the platforms of trains."<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> But I would not claim Tatlin's <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> is derivative of Khlebnikov's bold social propositions, or vice versa. The work of both engaged similar issues and used the available means of their respective mediums to define singular but deeply interrelated responses. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> realizes various and even conflicting aspects of Tatlin's and Khlebnikov's theories of the individual, as befits its status as a potential monument, designed for a potential community. It is only appropriate, then, that in 1924 Tatlin proposed the national monument to Lenin should include "everything that characterizes our late leader as an innovator and revolutionary … 200–300 telephones for the use of visitors … a huge auditorium … an information office to let the world know of events in the Soviet republic … a powerful radio and so on."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> Like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>, this structure would memorialize aspects of the leader—his electricity plan, his leadership, his social vision—without mimetically representing the man himself. If Tatlin's constructed sculptures of 1914–17 had worked through the problem of how entities might be unified and self-sufficient within an aggregate structure, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> isolates and explores the individual unit. Opening outwards from the internal generation of meaning in <span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> operates on a dynamic relation between individuals and their collective formation. It was a model of dynamism, however, that soon began folding inwards.</p>
<h2 class="sec-headB">Objects for the Individual</h2>
<p>Unlike Tatlin's constructed sculptures, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> was a singular endeavor. Though he engaged with several projects during the period he created the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span> model, after 1920 Tatlin shifted efforts almost exclusively to designing objects for everyday use, including clothing, household tools, and furniture.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> He founded the Section for Material Culture in the Petrograd Museum of Artistic Culture in 1919, and in 1923 the Museum was reorganized into the Institute of Artistic Culture (GINKhUK). He later participated in the reorganization of the Higher Artistic and Technical Studios (VKhUTEMAS) in Moscow and taught there as a professor in the Faculties of Wood, Metal Working, and Ceramics until the independent institutes of art were consolidated in 1932 as the Union of Soviet Artists.</p>
<p>Tatlin's work on everyday objects presents a paradoxical withdrawal. In the name of working for the individual Soviet citizen, his artistic project shifts from enacting an experimental politics of individual and collective to catering literally to individual, everyday needs. In 1923, he describes his goals at GINKhUK as follows: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The main task of the Section is material culture. The work of the Section is purely practical and is the continuation of the work on material culture carried out by V. E. Tatlin since 1913… The determination of new methods and types of utilization of materials in the construction of objects for everyday life.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">It is significant, if unsurprising, that Tatlin contends his new research continues the objectives of the old. Certainly he remained fascinated by the nature of materials (<span style="font-style:italic;">faktura</span>), but the manifestation of this interest in his works remained strongly red by the cultural conditions of their making. For any conclusion to Tatlin's art in the period 1914–32, one must account for the dramatic changes in his modes of production.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> These might easily fall into the narrative structure of a rise and fall. A problem is defined in the teens, a provisional solution is formulated, this solution becomes more sophisticated in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>, and then gradually dissipates in the 1920s. Such a simplification, however, would not take seriously the complex position of Tatlin's artistic practice to the pressing claims of a social sphere that was dramatically on the move during the two decades in question. Therefore, I will bring my discussion of the individual/collective in Tatlin's work to a close by considering his objects of the 1920s with regard to the vicissitudes of his public life as an artist.</p>
<p>For Soviet art we know as Constructivism, the 1920s signaled a turn from a laboratory phase of experiments with artistic form in 1920–21 to a production phase beginning in 1921 that pushed these experiments into practice.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> Though Tatlin was never a member of the Working Group of Constructivists that carried out the most rigorous of these experiments, on occasion he is erroneously included in histories with the Constructivists and particularly since he incorrectly claimed in 1929 to be their founder.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> While not a Constructivist per se, Tatlin nonetheless did attempt to participate in production. In 1922, he founded a design studio at the Novyi Lessner metalworking factory, joining Varvara Stepanova, Liubov' Popova, and Karl Ioganson as the only Russian artists known to have engaged in the processes of mass production from within factory walls.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> Tatlin's plans for Novyi Lessner, however, were not accepted by the metalworkers. Even though he would continue to design objects for mass production, not a single one ever rolled off an assembly line.</p>
<p>On the face of things, Tatlin's designs for everyday objects fall into two groups: fluid, organic forms and stark, geometric ones. The first pole is exemplified by the sinuous lines of his 1923 sleigh frames, while the second in his design for a man's overcoat [<a name="9-text" href="#9">. 9</a> and <a name="0-text" href="#0">10</a>]. The flowing curves of this sled seem to correspond keenly to the dynamism of its rider rushing through space, matching the form of the object to the experience of its user. In contrast, the coat appears awkward in Tatlin's drawing of "Utility Clothing," like a foreign-object thrust upon the depicted re. In spite of these apparent differences, however, an article published in the popular magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Krasnaia panorama</span> (Red Panorama) in 1924 suggests a similar grounding for all of Tatlin's everyday objects.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> Among several illustrations, there are two depictions of Tatlin's overcoat: one of the artist modeling a prototype and another showing pattern pieces for making the coat oneself. Between these two depictions, there exists a sharp contrast between the artist <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">appearing as a near automaton while wearing the overcoat himself and a great deal of irregularity in the patterns that would be used to produce this highly regular object. As scholars have noted, his patterns do not follow regular, geometric schema and were perhaps better suited to handcraft.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> In addition, we also learn the practical virtues of Tatlin's coat design from the text in <span style="font-style:italic;">Krasnaia panorama</span>: its wide cut tapering at the knees contains heat, prevents fabric clinging to the body, and thereby maintains air circulation between body and coat. The text (probably by Tatlin himself) even asserts that the placement of the coat's pockets helps to maintain proper posture. Thus despite its ponderous appearance, Tatlin's design arises from and caters to the organic form of the human body. This insight applies to all Tatlin's everyday objects. Whether in the winding curves of a sled frame, staid articles of clothing, bentwood chairs measured to the skeleton of the human body, simple proportioned planks of a wooden bench, or even his would-be flying bicycle,<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> Tatlin's everyday objects reiterate a closed circle.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> They are objects made <span style="font-style:italic;">for</span> the individual worker and conceived <span style="font-style:italic;">from</span> the literal contours of the human body.</p>
<p>Throughout this essay I have tracked the ongoing dialogue in the art of Vladimir Tatlin with imagining and implementing collectivity in Russia. As one can see, his everyday objects of the 1920s do not break completely with the central question of individuality that informs both the constructed sculpture and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span>. But in literally making objects for individuals, Tatlin nonetheless left behind the more complex project of examining the relations of individuality and collectivity so crucial to the previous work. This thread of continuity would disappear completely after 1932, when Tatlin abandoned critical practice entirely by retiring to painting still lifes and nudes. The conclusion to his art, however, should not be seen as a denigration of some personal failing. In 1922 he had lost a vital interlocutor in Khlebnikov and the turn to production never returned much by way of real opportunities or ideas to the artist. In the midst of conflicted circumstances in which Lenin's New Economic Plan (1921–28) expanded economic interaction on a semi-free market while Stalin's rise to power forcefully contracted public interaction on a number of levels, Tatlin's art turned inward. These circumstances in fact highlight the precise value of his practice. Tatlin was not the kind of artist to who produced singular solutions while working in near solitude. His work depended and occasionally thrived on the exchanges available in public culture at large. The collective work of 1914–32 leaves us with little about Tatlin as an individual and instead with a few openings upon individuality in the worlds it negotiated.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f44" href="#f44-text">44. </a>In 1922 the first and only finished section of The Tables of Destiny was published. In these tables, Khlebnikov adopted exponential models of growth on a scale of 2<sup>x</sup> and 3<sup>x</sup> as the mathematical links between the "Waves of two worlds, the alternating spears of East and West, clashing through the centuries." With this final work in particular, I would point to the importance of Dmitri Mendeleev's 1864 creation of the Periodic Table of Elements as a model for Khlebnikov throughout his life. "Excerpts from The Tables of Destiny," <span style="font-style:italic;">The King of Time: Selected Writings of the Russian Futurian</span>, ed. Charlotte Douglas, trans.

ROSTA was an acronym for the Russian Telegraph Agency, for which Khlebnikov worked as a night-watchman during the winter months of 1920–21.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f52" href="#f52-text">52. </a>Tatlin did continue to design theater costumes and sets for the remainder of his career, but I have chosen to bracket these from the present study. See F. I. Syrkina, "Tatlin's Theatre," in Zhadova, <span style="font-style:italic;">Tatlin</span>, 155–79.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f54" href="#f54-text">54. </a>Of the few scholars to trace threads of continuity in Tatlin's work from the 1910s to the 1920s, I would note here Christina Kiaer's chapter "Everyday Objects," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Imagine No Possessions: The Socialist Objects of Russian Constructivism</span> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2005), 42–87. Here Kiaer follows Tatlin's primitivism into the objects for everyday life. For a discussion exclusively of Tatlin's design work in the 1920s, see Laurel Fredrickson, "Vision and Material Practice: Vladimir Tatlin and the Design of Everyday Objects," <span style="font-style:italic;">Design Issues</span> 15, no.1 (Spring 1999): 49–74.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f55" href="#f55-text">55. </a>See Christina Kiaer's excellent introduction to this period in her first chapter "The Socialist Object" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Imagine No Possessions</span>, 1–38.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f56" href="#f56-text">56. </a>Tatlin wrote in 1929: "The influence of my art is expressed in the path taken by the Constructivists, of whom I am the founder." Vladimir Tatlin, "Autobiography," in Zhadova, <span style="font-style:italic;">Tatlin</span>, 265.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f57" href="#f57-text">57. </a>Here I am excepting the widespread production of posters. For a discussion of one notable case of poster production in Soviet advertising, see Christina Kiaer, "Constructivist Advertising and Bolshevik Business," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Imagine No Possessions</span>, 143–97, and on Stepanova and Popova, "The Constructivist Flapper Dress" in the same text, 89–141. On the politics of propaganda production, see also T.J. Clark's discussion of El Lissitzky in "God is Not Cast Down," <span style="font-style:italic;">Farewell to an Idea: Episodes from a History of Modernism</span> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1999), 225–97. On Ioganson, see Maria Gough, "Red Technics: The <span style="font-style:italic;">Konstruktor</span> in Production," <span style="font-style:italic;">The Artist as Producer</span>, 151–90.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f58" href="#f58-text">58. </a>Scholars speculate that this article, "The New Everyday Life," was produced by Tatlin himself. See Zhadova, <span style="font-style:italic;">Tatlin</span>, 407; Anatolii Strigalev and Jürgen Harten, <span style="font-style:italic;">Vladimir Tatlin Retrospektive</span> (Cologne: DuMont Buchverlag, 1992), 274; Kiaer, <span style="font-style:italic;">Imagine No Possessions</span>, 278, nt. 1. The article also appears in a montage by the artist in 1924–25 and was displayed in his Section for Material Culture.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f59" href="#f59-text">59. </a>See Larissa Zhadova, "Tatlin, the Organizer of Materials into Objects," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Tatlin</span>, 142–44; Fredrickson, "Vision and Material Practice," 61–63.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f60" href="#f60-text">60. </a>As by far the least practical of Tatlin's designs for everyday life, his flying-machine, called the <span style="font-style:italic;">Letatlin</span> and completed in prototype in 1932, would seem to inhabit its own sub-category of his everyday objects. While still apart of Tatlin's larger project to provide modern goods for single individuals, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Letatlin</span> is tied to larger modern fantasies of flight and therefore raises questions beyond the available space of the present investigation. See comments by Tatlin in Zhadova, <span style="font-style:italic;">Tatlin</span>, 309–11.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f61" href="#f61-text">61. </a>Writing in 1929, Tatlin would claim of chair designs: "A contemporary furniture factory takes no account of the requirements of the human body in constructing any kind of pattern for furniture. It is interested only in external effect. But a human is an organic being, consisting of a skeleton, nerves and muscles."
