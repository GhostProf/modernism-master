During the earliest and most severe years of the Great Depression,
from 1930 to 1931, migrant laborers from Georgia to North Carolina
followed word of employment to work-camps near the mouth of a hydro
tunnel in the mountains of West Virginia. One of a series of massive
hydroelectric projects launched during the 1920s and 1930s, this
three-mile conduit had been licensed to divert water from the New
River to a nearby power plant, generating "white coal" for both public
and commercial use.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 From its inception in 1924, however,
Hawk's Nest Tunnel had been intended not as a public utility, but as
a power source for a new electrometallurgical complex--one owned by
Union Carbide and Carbon, the corporate entity that had commissioned
the tunnel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 With metallurgic processing apparently in mind,
engineers and geologists had plotted the tunnel to run through veins
of ninety-seven to ninety-nine percent pure silica.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 During
construction, these highly refined mineral concentrations were extracted
and sold to the Electro-Metallurgical Company for use in processing
steel. Large sections of the tunnel, those that contained the richest
deposits, had been widened to maximize profits from in-house transactions
(<I>HC,</I> 20, 27, 66). Licensed as a public utility, Hawk's Nest Tunnel
had been drilled as a silica mine.
<P>
Illicit dry-drilling practices, said to be three times faster than
drilling with water, sped the project toward completion, foreclosing
a possible shutdown by the Federal Power Commission (<I>HC,</I>
4-5, 59-62, 66). Coupled with substandard ventilation and
the contractor's failure to issue respirators to workers, high velocity
drilling had aggravated what industry specialists knew to be a dangerous
enterprise. During an epoch 
 
when displaced southern agricultural
workers found themselves vulnerable to industrial exploitation, racist
divisions of labor facilitated the reckless construction of an "oddly
obscure" landmark that still stands as a "marvel of engineering prowess"
(<I>HN,</I> 1, 22). Of the 2500 men who worked the tunnel's interior
between 1930 and 1931, a small percentage were white-coal miners and
laborers from the nearby town of Gauley Bridge. African Americans,
most of them emigrants from southern coastal states, made up eighty
percent of this low-paid work force; and they composed an even larger
majority of the tunnel's drillers, nippers, and muckers, workers whose
proximity to the drilling-face treated them to the highest concentrations
of silica dust.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 While it is still not known how many black
workers were killed by their exposure to the Gauley Bridge tunnel, it was
clear to many by the mid-1930s that a large number may have succumbed to
industrial disease. Living in segregated, company-owned work camps, and
earning subsistence-level wages, black migrant workers in particular
lacked the resources to resist hazards that resulted in close to 600
deaths.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
<P>
In late 1935, with rumors of mass graves in West Virginia now circulating
in the national press, the New York congressman and labor advocate Vito
Marcantonio called for an investigation into allegations of corporate
negligence in the suspected silicosis deaths at Gauley Bridge.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
A group of doctors, journalists, and former tunnel workers arrived
in Washington to testify in early 1936. At the congressional hearings
mandated by House Joint Resolution 449, a silicotic bench driller named
George Robison was asked to testify regarding the working conditions in
and around Hawk's Nest Tunnel. Robison spoke of threats and beatings
used by white foremen to coerce black workers back into the mountain
after interval dynamite blasts. Reentering the bore within minutes of
each shoot, teams of muckers and drillers could see only with difficulty
through a white haze of silica (<I>HC,</I> 58, 67). As work resumed
at the head, accelerated rounds of dry drilling forced fresh jets of
mineral straight back into the faces of workers. Pails of drinking water
carried into the shaft looked like buckets of milk. In describing the
deathly white residue that coated the tunnel's interior as well as the
"flour-sprinkled" woods around its mouth, Robison treated the white
congressional committee to an unsettling image. "As dark as I am,"
Robison told the committee chairman, "when I came out of that tunnel in
the mornings, if you had been in the tunnel too and come out at my side,
nobody could have told which was the white man. The white man was just
as black as the colored man" (<I>HC,</I> 67).
<P>
Previous federal and state trial testimony had referred to workers
lightened rather than darkened by their exposure to the dust in Hawk's
Nest Tunnel, and Robison himself had so far spoken only literally of the
whitening effects of silica (<I>HC,</I> 4, 37-8; <I>HN,</I> 46). Yet
none of the white congressmen questioning the former tunnel worker asked
Robison how a white man could be blackened by white dust. Untenable
as literal description, the image of workers blackened by silica was a
metaphor driven by tacit racial conventions. In an essay published in
1925 in Alaine Locke's anthology <I>The New Negro,</I> Jessie Fauset
described the deeply ingrained racial codes that restricted African
American contributions to drama. "There is an unwritten law in America,"
Fauset wrote, "that though white may imitate black, black . . . must never
<B></B> 
imitate white."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Fauset's observation that "grease-paint may
be used to darken but never to lighten" refers to the racial dynamics
of caricature; but a black witness such as Robison would have risked
breaching these conventions--laws that licensed blackness to whites,
withholding whiteness from blacks--by illustrating the lightening effects
of industrial contaminants. Barred from painting himself the color of
his superiors, Robison chose to switch the black-and-white terms of his
congressional testimony. In so doing, he reversed an image that might have
stood for the colorblindness of capitalist exploitation. Shifting literal
to rative description, the supernatural "blackening" of white workers
suggested that, far from being a class-based phenomenon, silicosis was a
disease of racial proportions. At the Gauley Bridge tunnel, the absorption
of white dust would have made a black man of even a white congressman
who emerged, in the morning that follows from a dark day of work, from
the opposite end of a racialized spectrum of exploitation. Within the
conventional limits of racial performance, Robison's metaphor suggested
that, if racial identities were initially written on the surface of the
body, they could be written more firmly across its invisible interior. The
idea that white men could be blackened by industrial poisons affirmed
not only that race was unfixed, but that, as a social construct, race
was central to the story of the Gauley tunnel disaster.
<P>
If conventions delimiting the performance of racial identities had
prompted Robison's shift to a metaphorical description of industrial
contamination, the striking medical imagery that surrounded Hawk's Nest
Tunnel lent a conceptual resonance to his image of white-blackened white
workers. Effecting shadowy reversals of visual and conceptual poles,
and displacing surface "appearances" with uncovered "essences," X-ray
testimonials provided an epistemological complement to the searching
conceptions of racial identity that the tunnel engendered. From the
beginning of the gradual public exposure of the disaster, X-ray pictures
had been instrumental in identifying the industrial nature of deaths
falsely attributed to pneumonia and tuberculosis. With state hearings
on the incident beginning as early as 1933, the story of the Gauley
tunnel incident had been suffused with images of dark chests illuminated
by bursts of white scars (<I>HC,</I> 4, 37-38). During the 1936
Congressional Investigation of the Health Conditions of Public Utility
Workers, X-ray pictures lent strange credence to Robison's exposure
of the hidden industrial origins of race. Robison's image of blackened
white workers at the daylit night mouth of the tunnel, for example, was
contained in the murky X-ray transparencies that specialists held up to
courtroom windows for jury inspection (<I>HC,</I> 96). What the daylight
released from these plates was an uncanny inversion of fundamental
conceptual and visual binary terms. The true industrial nature of
these workers' diseases could not be revealed through "indefinite"
symptoms; it was rather illuminated through a technology that collapsed
surface and depth, disclosing interior landscapes filled with negative
"white shadows" and the deathly "snow storm[s]" produced by dark scars
(<I>HC,</I> 27, 96). X-ray testimonials and Robison's testimony regarding
the industrial racial nature of the disaster at Hawk's Nest Tunnel were
conjoined by a shared set of visual and conceptual inversions.
<P>
Amid a series of Depression Era social documentary poems, including
Charles Reznikoff's verse renderings of southern court records , and
Mike Gold's and Tillie Olsen's poetic fashionings of letters from workers
, Muriel Rukeyser's "The Book of the Dead"  was unique in
its effort to adapt the conceptual premises of new visual technologies
to a documentary telling of the Gauley Bridge tunnel story. Plumbing the
disaster and its aftermath through trial transcripts, letters, interviews,
and descriptions of conventional and medical photographs, Rukeyser used
the penetrating gaze of the X-ray to bridge high-modernist with more
politically acute social-realist aesthetics. In her Gauley tunnel poem,
however, the poet's arcane exposure of capitalistic mechanisms of erasure
was bought at the cost of the historical racial dimensions of Hawk's
Nest. While the feminist social poet had been criticized by male peers
for promoting "unscientific" varieties of socialism in "The Book of the
Dead," her sharp portrayal of the class basis of industrial exploitation
was nothing if not doctrinaire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 In the congressional testimony
upon which Rukeyser based much of her poem, X-ray images had provided a
conceptual framework for George Robison's account of the racial makeup
of Hawk's Nest Tunnel. These same images prompted Rukeyser to envision
a gendered poetic release from industrial capitalist exploitation. But
modern visual technologies--particularly those deployed in state
photographic and radiographic campaigns--also blinded the social poet
to the black-and-white depths of the Depression Era's worst incident of
industrial poisoning. Excavating the material of class consciousness from
workers' bodies, and deciphering its encryptions through poetic methods
engendered by new visual technologies, Rukeyser restored a universalizing
whiteness to the blackened workers that Robison had summoned before the
congressional committee. Sacrificing racial to class interests, "The
Book of the Dead" illustrated that, during an epoch much celebrated for
its sweeping radical alliances, modern visual technologies could be used
to limit the spectrum that these alliances encompassed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
<P>
As a literary effort to "photograph . . . the voice" of a missing
industrial constituency, Rukeyser's tunnel poem was conceived in the
interstices of mass radiographic campaigns and the massive photographic
programs of the Roosevelt administration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Between 1935 and
1943, as mobile X-ray screening units began to circulate in England and
America, the Historical Section of the Farm Security Administration (FSA)
was "vividly demonstrat[ing] the value of the camera as [an] instrument
of government" by commissioning and exhibiting images of rural poverty
in the South and West.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Distributed to government agencies,
published in newspapers and magazines, and exhibited in museums,
schools, and libraries across the country during the late 1930s, FSA
images garnered support for New Deal social initiatives; and they
worked to restore a racially composed credibility to an administration
burdened by political and economic crises. By slanting its photographic
displays to feature disproportionately high numbers of white farmers
and laborers, the Roosevelt administration exhibited its capacity not
only to see but to circumscribe the human effects of environmental
and economic corrosion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In the racial management of FSA
photographic displays, the 
<B></B> 
humane objectives of New Deal reformers
seemed to harmonize with the universalizing class aims of more radical
contemporaries.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
<P>
Serving a range of institutional purposes, medical and conventional
photographic equipment carried vexed social and political overtones in the
late 1930s. Rukeyser portrayed the X-ray camera as a penetrating medium
that could retrieve emancipatory truths from Gauley tunnel. Displayed as
"map[s]" of a "country marked by error / and one air" (<I>US,</I> 61),
the scarred interiors of the legendary "walking skeletons" of "Silicosis
Village" provided more than empirical evidence of the human cost of
industrial production: they were potential guides to an afterlife, to an
enlightening political future.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Rukeyser derived the title
of <I>U. S. 1,</I> her 1938 collection featuring the long Gauley tunnel
poem, from a contemporaneous Federal Writers' Project travelogue called
<I>U. S. One: Maine to Florida.</I> In so doing, she cast "The Book of
the Dead" as a potent enhancement of the American Guide Series' effort
"to highlight the history, resources and points of interest in an area
of more than three million square miles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 What Rukeyser's
extension of this state-sponsored survey finally exposed, however, was
a crippling conjunction of somatic and institutional corruption.

Despite growing concerns for a nationwide epidemic of industrial dust
disease, bills to add silicosis coverage to worker's compensation met
with bipartisan opposition in the mid- to late 1930s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
Rukeyser charts this legislative failure in "The Book of the Dead" by
suggesting that, while the new medical gaze had the power to enlighten
and transform society, its emancipatory potential lay snagged in the gap
between diagnosis and cure. Versed in marxist conceptions of ideological
production, the radical poet understood that conventional photographs
and texts commissioned by the Works Progress Administration performed
a number of institutional functions. They worked to expose economic
hardships and iniquities, but they did so in a manner that placed the
solutions to social problems within the confines of corporate interests
and structures. In this sense, the reformist objectives of New Deal
documentaries dimmed the light that they shed on the national body's
interior. In her portrayal of the X-ray camera as a medium that was less
tainted and more encompassing than the conventional camera, however,
and in her suggestion that it modeled processes by which poems might
be made penetrate to real truths and identities, 
<B></B> 
Rukeyser failed to
identify the X-ray's own ideological functions. Her neglect of these
functions compromises not only her metaphor of the X-ray as map, but
also her portrayal of the Gauley tunnel incident at large. In the 1930s,
Rukeyser knew, conventional state-sponsored photographs served the
larger corporate interests of the liberal Roosevelt administration. But
the state- and corporate-sponsored medical imaging techniques that
exposed and publicized industrial abuses were themselves being used on
a mass scale to "survey" and "manage" "large populations" (<I>SB,</I>
147).
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Among these populations was a newly identified body
of silicotic miners and foundry workers. This lingering constituency
was believed to number between 100,000 and 500,000 nationwide, and its
members represented potential financial liabilities to companies that
neglected to screen them from hire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
<P>
If Rukeyser hedged in her celebration of the emancipatory power of
new medical pictures, she was sharper in her poetic condemnation of
conventional documentary images. Despite what we now recognize as the
racist nature of FSA displays and publications, the poet had praised
their capacity to "widen" social horizons in a <I>New Masses</I>
review.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 As a critic, Rukeyser was unstinting in her praise
of the work of government photographers like Walker Evans, Dorothea
Lange, Arthur Rothstein, and Ben Shahn; but in her poetry of the late
1930s, she exhibits a principled wariness toward state-sponsored social
photography. The proliferating images of glass and of cameras that
fill the opening passages of "The Book of the Dead" express a marked
ambivalence toward what Walter Kalaidjian calls the "emergent visual
culture" of New Deal America (<I>AC,</I> 166).

<P>
Noting that glass is a product of silica, the toxic mineral mined from the
tunnel, Kalaidjian suggests that Rukeyser here portrays the daily matter
of American life as tainted by the human cost of its production. Through
such a reading, the poet's references to the camera's own "groundglass"
(<I>US,</I> 10) work to implicate further the 
<B></B> 
state visual apparatus that
came to chronicle this life in the late 1930s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Identifying
the deathly material of the lens with the material of the town's
"deserted" inhabitants, the poet begins her expos&eacute; with an account
of alienation and complicity that indicts the state documentarian's
equipment. Visually undermining the town of Gauley Bridge by reducing
it to a series of refracting surfaces (doors, walls, windows, mended
roadway, race-marked skin), the poet will endeavor, in her own words, to
"widen the lens" (<I>US,</I> 71) of the New Deal documentary apparatus,
modeling her penetrating poetic gaze on the ghostly medical camera that
had become central to the exposure of the Gauley tunnel disaster.
<P>
If the early "photographic" passages of Rukeyser's poem serve to indict
state-sanctioned instruments of social investigation, later visual
images endeavor to revitalize these instruments by modeling them on
new medical visual technologies. In "The Book of the Dead," there is
a historical feminist component to the drive to bring the power of the
X-ray to the documentary lens. At a time when large numbers of American
women had already begun to participate in state-sponsored artistic and
sociological projects, medically affiliated critics discouraged the
feminist writer from entering into more strictly gendered institutional
domains.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Reviewing <I>U. S. 1</I> for <I>The New Republic</I>
in 1938, the poet-physician William Carlos Williams praised Rukeyser for
knowing "how to use the <I>language</I> of an X-ray report" (Williams's
emphasis).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Rather than "twist[ing]" her medical source
materials "in order to make 'poetry' of them," Williams wrote, the
selective young poet adhered to principles of straight presentation,
displaying her sources as artifacts, as things in themselves ("MR,"
141). It was in her faithful renderings of the language of X-ray reports,
renderings that conformed to aesthetic parameters mapped by masters like
"Pound in the material of his 'Cantos,'" ("MR," 141) that the ingenue's
otherwise "uncritical" "passion" ("MR," 142) as a social poet was tempered
and sharpened. Here, Williams's praise shored up the masculine borders
of both the medical and poetical professions. By dwelling on Rukeyser's
truthfulness to, not the content, but "the <I>language</I>" of materials
that were often gathered, but not deciphered, by female X-ray technicians,
Williams widened the gulf between apprentice and master, portraying it
as a gendered divide between physician and nurse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 What the
doctor conferred on "Miss Rukeyser" was the license to write poetry that
she would never qualify to read.
<P>
Rukeyser aspired to more than fidelity to the institutionally gendered
language of X-ray reports, however. In "The Book of the Dead," she
pointedly misread her medical textual materials, truing them to
the perceptual processes of the visual technologies to which they
referred. In a section of the poem drawn from congressional testimony,
for example, the poet edited and reshaped a lung specialist's lengthy
reading of radiographic encryptions (<I>HC,</I> 96-97). Trimming
the descriptive portions of his testimony, Rukeyser fashioned it into
a discursive descent, one that leads closer and closer to a luminous
core. "This is the X-ray picture taken last April," states an expert in
dust diseases:

<P>
In this passage, the mounting empirical precision of the scientist--"There
and there and there, there, there"--culminates and collapses in the voice
of a sufferer who grows "worse every day." In constructing this powerful
testimonial juncture, the poet burrows through layers of physical and
discursive surfaces, reclaiming the patient's experience from a clinical
illustration of the progressive stages of the disease. Here "The Book
of the Dead" elicits the human cost of Hawk's Nest Tunnel not through
straight presentation, but through a poetic approximation of the spatial
and temporal depths of modern medical visual technologies. Tunneling
through medical and personal testimonials, the poet photographed the
voice of an unburied casualty, a member of the "invisible" constituency
of the depression.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
<P>
The X-ray reports through which Rukeyser sought to recover the
hidden victims of Hawk's Nest Tunnel constituted a well fortified
discourse in the 1930s. Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison write
that the early-twentieth-century emergence of the X-ray photograph
precipitated a heightened attention to the precautions that ought to
surround the reliable production and dissemination of information from the
medium. 
<B></B> 
While appearing to penetrate to new foundations of reality, X-ray
imaging was in fact riddled with technical contingencies. Diagnosticians
had to learn first how <I>not</I> to shoot straight, mediating "the
mechanical procedure of X-raying with a knowledge of systematic deviations
between anatomy and its Roentgen [X-ray] representation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
Cognizant of the increasing juridical uses of photographs in the early
twentieth century, and frightened by the possibility of malpractice
suits based on a new visual medium that "fairly radiated authority,"
modern clinicians began to scramble for both mechanical and interpretive
control of a medium in which "the encryption of information takes place
in the technology itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Juridically minded clinicians
knew well that the X-ray presented challenges to the diagnostic and even
the semiotic authority of medical professionals.
<P>
In "The Book of the Dead," the documentary camera was shown to be
compromised by the deathly material of its lens. While the medical camera
had a greater emancipatory potential, it was still an intrinsically
complicit machine. Even the celebratory medical portions of Rukeyser's
Gauley tunnel poem contain hints of the X-ray's embeddedness in
capitalist structures of alienation. In her rendering of congressional
X-ray testimonials, for example, the shift from the specialist's voice
to the voice of the absent sufferer marks the estrangement of the
radiographed subject from his encrypted interior. The disjunctive union
of these voices dramatizes not only the physical distance of the patient
from the specialist who deciphers his X-ray, but also the discursive
remove accruing from the doctor's habit of looking and speaking through
machines.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Rukeyser's condemnation of new medical visual
apparatus was more restrained than her indictment of the documentary
camera in "The Book of the Dead," however, because X-rays finally marked
a turning of technology itself against the masculine institutions that
possessed it. Modern medicine had generated a self-encrypting machine,
one that robbed patients of the insides of their bodies as it wrested
powers of signification away from the professionals it served.
<P>
As uncertainties regarding how to see and read bodies were added to
the broader clamor of modern semiotic crisis, the defensive situation
of medical professionals came to resemble that of professional
poets.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 In an age of literary and cultural positivism, when
"unprejudiced observation" was said to have "put verbal notions out of
court," poets appeared to have lost their autonomy as readers of culture
in the way that machine-bound physicians had lost theirs as organic
readers of bodies.

charges of charlatanism with airs of hyped-up authority, dressing their
poetry with allusions and cryptic textual inscriptions. In the tradition
of Emersonians who used "Nature as [their] hieroglyphic," writers like
T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound began to unfold curative truths from mysterious
"anaglyphic" texts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 With their capacity to diagnose having
been infringed upon (in modern Britain particularly) by a new wave of
sociologists and new social-realist writers, these would-be philologists
traced debased words and customs to hidden originary reserves, mastering
Sanskritic thunder claps, and conjuring silk-and-stone visual essences
from classical Chinese ideograms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Marshaling the alienating
features of 
<B></B> 
emerging modern technologies to reactionary cultural ends,
high-modernist writers came to specialize in generating and deciphering
their own literary self-encryptions.
<P>
As a politically minded modernist poet, Rukeyser recognized that "radiant"
new visual perspectives could both blind and enlighten. On the one hand,
the infamous "Poster Girl" of proletariat literature heeded marxist
appeals to X-ray imaging as a means of enlightening the eyes and minds
of the masses.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Penetrating layers of flesh to exhume the
powerful texts buried within and among the proletariat body, the modern
medical camera united poets and workers as agents who could see, and
seek to publish, the invisible effects of capitalist exploitation. At
the same time, however, Rukeyser was criticized by radically minded
colleagues for skimming the "erudition" that surrounded the poetic trade
in arcanum.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Hidden in the allusive title of her Gauley
tunnel poem, for example, was a metaphor that mapped snowy silicotic
X-ray encryptions onto hieroglyphic writings buried with, and within,
the bodies of ancient Egyptian mummies. The lacing of the Gauley tunnel
story with prayers from amulets and papyrus rolls, however, was hardly
fashioned as an inflationary appeal to the arcane. Like mechanically
generated medical images that could serve to locate and enlighten a
poisoned industrial constituency, Rukeyser's funereal texts signified a
set of cultural practices that united, rather than separating, bodies and
signs. Prayers carved into stones to be sewn into bodies--"<I>My heart
my mother      my heart     my mother"</I> (<I>US,</I> 27)--were the mark
of a culture in which textual and physical ministerings were thoroughly
merged.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
<P>
Rukeyser's exploration of the cultural functions of bodily inscriptions
was based on contemporary medical testimony and on a plum-sized
funereal scarab exhibited at the New York Metropolitan Museum of
Art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Carved from near-black serpentine, and glinting with
fine white hieroglyphic inscriptions, the Heart Amulet of Hatnofer
was on display in the poet's own city between 1936 and 1937 ("CE,"
178-79), the years during which the poet wrote "The Book of the
Dead." Considered vital to the judgment of the soul and to its eventual
preservation after death, heart amulets such as this one were designed
to be wrapped over, or inserted directly into, the eviscerated chests of
embalmed kings and queens.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 The text on the Heart Amulet of
Hatnofer was characteristic of the texts carved into other such stones:
"Hatnofer says: Heart of my mother, heart of my mother! Heart of my
[present] form!" ("CE," 179). New Kingdom heart amulets were universally
inscribed with variants of a single small chapter from the hundreds
of papyrus rolls that make up the Egyptian <I>Book of the Dead,</I>
and it was with a translation of this chapter that Rukeyser elected to
introduce Egypt into Hawk's Nest Tunnel ("CE," 179). The snowy scoring
of the Metropolitan Heart Scarab's white-on-black encryptions, together
with the stone's location within the chest of its bearer, places this
particular textual artifact at the confluence of divergent modernist
streams in "The Book of the Dead."
<P>
Rukeyser hoped to "widen the lens" of the "paternalistic" New Deal
documentary apparatus not only by using medical visual technologies to
recover invisible texts, but 
<B></B> 
by challenging conventionally gendered claims
to the instruments of both medical and poetical seeing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
By exposing encrypted male interiors in her poem, and by foregrounding
the women--the journalist Philippa Allen, and the bereaved mother, Emma
Jones--who secured interviews, autopsies, and X-rays to uncover the
industrial truth of the tunnel incident, Rukeyser regendered her medical
reportage, restoring agency to women through a visual medium that was
conceived to erase it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The passage from the Heart Amulet
of Hatnofer, the first arcane inscription to appear in "The Book of the
Dead," paid tribute to the matriarchal aspects of a society that, at
the time of the production of the Eighteenth-Dynasty stone, was ruled
by an innovative queen, Hatshepsut, who had claimed for herself the
traditionally male role of sun god.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Rukeyser extended the
words on this amulet, a treasure stolen from the breast of the Egyptian
mother who had borne it, into the testimony of the modern West Virginia

tunnel workers' lungs:

Egyptian icons and religious texts featured powerful matriarchs like
the Heart Amulet's Hatshepsut, and prophetic goddesses like Isis who,
according to Egyptian texts, "lived in the form of a woman" (<I>BD,</I>

 Within the iconographic traditions of Western
science, on the other hand, modern women were more often the objects than
the agents of such knowledge and power. In her study of gendered imagery
in modern science, Ludmilla Jordanova finds a historical gendering
of the penetrating medical gaze in the macabre genre of anatomist
paintings. Reviewing a series of European and American paintings and
lithographs that depict scenes of dissection, Jordanova notes that
nineteenth- and twentieth-century artists broke with earlier conventions
by featuring not male or unsexed cadavers, but instead women as the
objects of the male anatomists' attention. Jordanova attributes this
appearance of the 
<B></B> 
sexed cadaver, whose once-living tissue is peeled back
like clothing, to the so-called romantic confusion of the erotic with
the deathly.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 In anatomist paintings, the male scientist's
unveiling of truth from the dead woman on the table invokes a traditional
association of women with nature's esoteric verities, providing a backdrop
for the ritualized containment of a pair of mysterious and threatening
forces.

In her own poetic unveiling of the truth of industrial poisoning,
Rukeyser's X-ray testimonials release a modern visual technology from
its historically gendered moorings. Lisa Cartwright attributes some of
the popular as well as professional fascination with turn-of-the-century
X-ray images to the same "stunning spectacle of death in life" exhibited
in anatomist paintings of the preceding decades (<I>SB,</I> 121). That
this spectacle was gendered in accordance with nineteenth-century
representations of medical dissection is suggested by Wilhelm
R&ouml;ntgen's decision to withhold from public view the first X-ray
image that he observed through the fluoroscope. What R&ouml;ntgen
photographed and published for scientific and popular consumption was
not his own hand, but rather his wife's (<A HREF="5.1kadlec_1.html"> 1</A>), with the skeletal
splay of her fingers gendered by the negative shadow of a wedding ring
(<I>SB,</I> 114-15).
<P>
In the latter years of the New Deal, mass X-ray screenings were
implemented both by public-health agencies and private corporations. In
these screenings, new visual 
<B></B> 
technologies were used to identify, and
ultimately to segregate, populations that included diseased women
and industrial workers. Insofar as women and workers were conjoined
as targets for tuberculosis and silicosis screenings respectively,
the emerging practice of mass radiography could be said to bolster
Rukeyser's feminist authority as an artist equipped to photograph the
invisible voice of the oppressed laborer. Here, X-ray screenings might
be said to trace the sources of oppression that, beginning around 1935,
forged the coalitional political alliances that made up the Popular
Front. Used by eugenically minded scientists to survey and manage those
subpopulations that threatened the political and biological integrity
of the nation, however, mass screenings were also directed at a larger
constituency, one that included many of the women and workers who were
specifically targeted. X-rays were also used to survey and manage a range
of "racial" populations that were threatening to a nation whose genetic
makeup had been altered by recent patterns of immigration. Deployed
in an effort to contain contaminating women and workers, then, mass
radiography campaigns served to cleanse "racial" and "ethnic" groups of
the very claims to identity that might enable them to identify their mass
subjugation. Penetrating visible markers of identity, X-ray screenings
hid the evidence of the racist work that they performed. The historical
erasure of this evidence casts a shadow over Rukeyser's marxist appeal
to the emancipatory potential of new visual technologies.
<P>
Beginning in the late 1930s British and American promotional films for
mass radiography--films geared toward women in particular--had begun to
portray women "as deceptive carriers of a disease that is invisible except
under the X ray, threatening the integrity of the family, the community,
and the nation" (<I>SB,</I> 146). Framing the disease as a corrosive to
both familial and national structures, these films played to lingering
perceptions of tuberculosis as an illness carried and spread not only
by women, but by foreigners and members of other "races."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
Here, the anatomist's cadaver was made to bleed into a range of modern
subjects who were perceived as threatening to the hereditarian integrity
of the "American race."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 During the 1910s and early 1920s, as
immigration swelled to peaks of close to one million newcomers per year,
racialist Americans came increasingly to echo Madison Grant, author
of <I>The Passing of the Great Race</I> , in warning against
the dilution of not only their Anglo-American cultural inheritance
but their "Nordic" American genetic makeup as well.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
The migration of African Americans from remote southern to northern
industrial centers contributed to diatribes against "mongrelization"
such as Calvin Coolidge's in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> in 1921, and it
encouraged the growth of the Ku Klux Klan in northern cities in the early
1920s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 But American racialists during the first two decades
of the century had begun to react also to the genetic threat posed by
"subspecies" of "whites."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 The vast majority of immigrants
entering the U. S. between 1900 and 1924 were newcomers of eastern and
southern European ancestry; and by popular modern racialist taxonomies
they were classified as belonging to distinctly inferior "Alpine" and
"Mediterranean" races.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 During the first decades of the
twentieth century, in forums ranging from medical conferences on immigrant
screening to prohibitionist rallies, the dilution of America's Nordic
genetic makeup 
<B></B> 
was linked to the spread of disease. African Americans
were grouped with newcomers ranging from Asians to Italians and Jews
as dangerous agents whose constitutions and habits predisposed them to
illnesses including syphilis and tuberculosis.
<P>
Sheila Rothman writes of the modern perception of tuberculosis as "a
disease of the masses," noting the upsurge during the immigrant boom
of the 1910s and 1920s in American legislation calling for involuntary
sanatorium confinement.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 In medical and legal efforts to
check the spread of immigrant diseases, the threat posed by women's
sexuality and the traditionally feminized specter of death in life merged
with the modern American eugenists' fear of racial contamination. From
a public health standpoint, there were certainly sound reasons for
implementing programs to manage large populations during the years
before the midcentury discovery of a chemotherapeutic "cure" for
tuberculosis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Still, when coupled with the historical use
of X-rays in the radiographic sterilization of women, the fact that
new medical imaging techniques were used to single out and designate
tubercular women for confinement suggests that TB screening campaigns
provided a complement to modern legislative efforts to regulate sexual
reproduction. If X-rays had been used in obvious ways to deprive women
of their social and sexual agency, however, their use against racial
and ethnic groups was a more subtle matter. Directed against the very
impoverished immigrant and African American populations that suffered
from the highest rates of tuberculosis infection, the penetrating gaze of
the X-ray performed a ghostly, essentializing function. It skinned away
markers of race and ethnicity in search of more clinical justifications
for containment and segregation.
<P>
If the gendered campaign for mass tuberculosis screenings was
undergirded by lingering racial anxieties in the 1930s, mass industrial
screenings compounded this cultural fear with a corporate fear of the new
labor-unionism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Although third-stage silicosis was usually
attended by the onset of TB, dust diseases differed from deadly infections
in that they could not be passed from host to host. As state legislatures
began to consider adding silicosis to the roster of afflictions covered
by worker's compensation laws in the mid-1930s, however, industries and
insurance companies came to fear dust disease as much as any contagion
("IMC," 198-99). Implemented in the late 1930s in major industrial
states, including Illinois and New York, industrial X-ray screenings led
to the immediate dismissal of miners and foundry workers whose chests
displayed signs of silicosis and related diseases. What these industrial
screenings unveiled was an objective criterion for protecting industries
from workers whose disease now threatened not the racial integrity
of the community or the nation, but rather the financial integrity of
the corporate body in the newly emerging welfare state. In the 1930s,
unskilled laborers were more than twice as likely as highly skilled
workers to suffer from work-related disabilities ("IMC," 196); and of
those at the bottom of the pay scale, African American and immigrant
workers were routinely coerced into performing the most dangerous
tasks. Industrial X-ray screenings demonstrated that, in industry's hands,
the medical camera could be used to peel back layers of racial identity
in order to provide an objective and essentializing ground for insulating
industries against the very bodies that it had formerly been 
<B></B> 
privileged
to waste. Here the power of the X-ray to penetrate surfaces toward buried
truths was deployed to conceal the practice of racial discrimination.
<P>
Rukeyser's rendering of the Gauley tunnel story was based on an emerging
visual technology that seemed powerful enough to overthrow its masters,
but in her displacement of race in "The Book of Dead" the poet also
partook of the essentializing premises of mass radiography. In mass
X-ray screenings, people were categorized and sorted according to visual
markers that seemed to run deeper than surface identities. Reading
identity as an encryption of "fitness," these screenings buried the
racial differences that often conditioned the entitlement to health. In
"The Book of the Dead," Rukeyser linked silica clouds with X-rays as
materials that could penetrate layers of "false consciousness" to reveal
the essential solidarity of industrial workers. This strange fusion of
visible with invisible particles emerges, tellingly, in the testimony
of an African American tunnel survivor. "As dark as I am, when I came
out at morning after the tunnel at night, / with a white man, nobody
could have told which man was white. / The dust had covered us both,
and the dust was white." (<I>US,</I> 34) Using greasepaint illicitly
to lighten rather than to darken, the "deserted Negro" from the poem's
opening stanzas describes a literal phenomenon that carries a new set
of overtones. In the context of Rukeyser's appeal to the bedrock of
class consciousness, the normative whitening of emerging tunnel workers
marks not the construction but a collapse of race itself. Adapting
George Robison's testimony to visual premises that strip the markings
of race from depths and surfaces both, the poet altered the worker's
account of the lethal dimensions of racial identity, converting it into
a specious tribute to the insignificance of skin color to Hawk's Nest
Tunnel. Here, amid the many racially unmarked tunnel workers who speak
through Rukeyser's poem, a single black survivor appears in whiteface to
eulogize the industrial solidarity of the victimized workers. Imaging a
revolutionary future in the tones of X-ray shadows and silica dust, "The
Book of the Dead" performs a service similar to that of mass radiography,
using its penetrating gaze to submerge differences central to the history
of American labor and poetry in the 1930s.
<P>
Mass screenings for tuberculosis and silicosis in the 1930s demonstrated
that the "radiant authority" of new medical visual technologies was
contingent on possession of the technology of surveillance. Cartwright's
assertion that subjects recognize themselves in terms of their
positions within "a social body" that is itself composed through
a selectively imaging "visual apparatus" suggests that identity is
profoundly conditioned by institutionalized rituals of seeing and being
seen (<I>SB,</I> 146). In the 1930s, acts of mechanical unveiling, of
peeling back layers that conceal the fitness of the core, displaced the
surface of the body as an open delineator of identity, and replaced it
with an encrypted interior that was seldom deciphered in the presence
of the subject who surrendered it. The texts inscribed on the scrolls
generated by mass radiography, like the increasingly remote texts
deciphered by modern poet-scholars in their scramble for cultural
authority, became the site of an escalating gendered and racial struggle
for the possession of the "subject," one that Rukeyser understood to
be literally waged upon and within the invisible bodies of the Great
Depression's 
<B></B> 
"negative phenomena," the "many people" who "just didn't
seem to be . . . about."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 By constructing a tale in which
modern women restore eyes to a constituency that drifts outside of the
frame of surveillance, Rukeyser sought to demonstrate that, placed in
the wrong hands, medical visual technology, like modernist esoterism,
could serve to expose the ideological nature of its construction and
use. The gaze of the modern medical camera, however, was too easily
adapted to the essentializing aims of a poet who anticipated a class-based
release from the veil of "false consciousness." Written out of Rukeyser's
brilliant exposure of corporate and state mechanisms of erasure are the
less-than-superficial racial dimensions of Gauley tunnel.

Testifying in 1936 before the house subcommittee appointed to

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Silicosis is a disease which results from silica dust in the air being
inhaled into the lungs, where it sets up a gradual scar tissue formation
. . . in spots, or nodules . . . and those gradually increase in size
until they block the drainage from the lungs, and eventually they block
the blood supply, and then they block the air passageways. While this
is going on the person suffers certain symptoms, such as increasing
shortness of breath, and can't take a deep breath. He gets pains through
his chest, and he notices that he can't work as vigorously as before. He
is very apt to develop tuberculosis, much more susceptible as a result
of this silica in his lungs [<I>HC,</I> 85-86].

Cary Nelson portrays the 1930s as a time of broad artistic and
political alliances. Placing the poetry of this decade within a larger
Left modernist tradition in which "the poetry of the feminist movement
coexists with the poetry of the unemployed . . . and the poetry of
black pride," Nelson rues the more "fractured" appeals of identity
politics in the late twentieth century (Cary Nelson, <I>Repression and
Recovery: Modern American Poetry and the Politics of Cultural Memory,
1910-1945</I> [Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989],
234-35; hereafter abbreviated <I>RR</I>). Michael Denning offers a
similar but more historically nuanced account of the Popular Front as
a "coalitional" social and artistic movement that began to crumble in
the mid-1940s under the pressure of "postmodern" "racial realignments"
and especially "gender realignments" (Michael Denning, <I>The Cultural
Front: The Laboring of American Culture in the Twentieth Century</I>
[New York: Verso, 1996], 37, 29, 34, and 34, respectively; hereafter
abbreviated <I>CF</I>). Identifying the young Rukeyser as a "Popular
Front feminist," Walter Kalaidjian reads "The Book of the Dead" as a
poem that exposes, in one progressive sweep, the history of "gender,

routine hospital admissions procedures. Mass tuberculosis screenings

FSA photographs were used to garner public support for farm
relief funds. These funds were seldom distributed fairly. In states
like Mississippi, for example, low-income white farmers received
standard rehabilitation loans at up to seven times the rate of blacks
(Nicholas Natanson, <I>The Black Image in the New Deal: The Politics of
FSA Photography</I> [Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1992],
52; hereafter abbreviated <I>BI</I>). Although the white photographers
hired by the agency did produce more or less proportionate numbers of
portraits of African Americans in the rural South, the FSA's inability to
distribute relief across the southern "color line" was reflected in the
racial composition of public FSA displays (<I>BI,</I> 69-71). "The
agency's first traveling exhibit of 1936," writes Natanson, "hailing
the march from rural slums to 'new frontiers of farm independence,'left
black frontiers all but invisible, with only one black image among the
exhibit's forty" (<I>BI,</I> 217). FSA photos of black subjects were also
missing from the federally sponsored images that appeared in newspapers
(<I>BI,</I> 226).

During the 1930s, the liberal Roosevelt Administration willingly

movements. Speaking as a prominent white "racial progressive," for
example, FSA chief Will Alexander urged students at Howard University
to become "more class conscious and less race conscious" (<I>BI,</I> 50,
54). In so doing, he implied that the Roosevelt Administration was aiming
to eradicate racism by attacking it at its economic foundations. The
failure of Alexander's own agency to distribute photos of black
subjects, however, was hardly an instance of racial sacrifice on behalf
of revolutionary political change. The directives that the head of the
FSA's Historical Section sent to his traveling photographers indicate
that class consciousness was no more an aim of the agency than was
racial awareness. "[P]ut quite a little effort in getting us good land
pictures," wrote Roy Stryker to the photographer Walker Evans, "showing
the erosion, sub-marginal areas, cut-over land. These should be taken
whenever possible, showing the relationship of the land to the cultural
decay" (quoted in Walker Evans, <I>Walker Evans at Work</I> [New York:
Harper and Row, 1982], 118-19). See also Guimond, <I>American
Photography and the American Dream,</I> 117. In linking poverty to
environmental factors like erosion and clear-cuts, Stryker encouraged
his photographers to depict economic crisis as a temporary aberration
in a natural capitalistic order. In the pictures that he called for,
reform-based recovery would be as imminent as new spring growth.

Gauley Bridge had been christened "the village of walking skeletons"
by the radical editor Frank Palmer, who directed reportage on the tunnel
disaster in the Detroit-based <I>People's Press</I> in 1935 (<I>HN,</I>
75, 81-82). Resembling the London commuters who had shuffled through
the opening passages of T. S. Eliot's <I>The Waste Land</I> , "so
many" "undone" by "death," the more literally wasted res that Palmer
invoked had become marxist harbingers by the time of such polemical poetic
plaints as Edwin Rolfe's "Asbestos" (T. S. Eliot, <I>The Waste Land: A
Facsimile and Transcript of the Original Drafts,</I> ed. Valerie Eliot
[New York: Harcourt Brace and Company, 1971], 9; hereafter abbreviated
<I>WL</I>). In Rolfe's 1933 industrial elegy, a disease-stricken asbestos
worker sinks into his corporeal deathbed, where "the posts are made
of bone, spring of nerves, / the mattress bleeding flesh" (Edwin Rolfe,
"Asbestos," in <I>To My Contemporaries</I> [New York: Dynamo Press, 1936],
10; hereafter abbreviated "A"). "[D]ead / workers" such as Rolfe's "are
dead before they cease to be" ("A," 10) not because they trade their
passions, as do Eliot's disembodied masses, for numbing comforts that
"[p]icked [their] bones in whispers" (<I>WL,</I> 69), but because their
industrial deaths are so terrible and slow. Rukeyser owes something to
both portrayals of mass-cultural and working-class malaise. She trades
on images of surviving tunnel workers who "linger" (<I>US,</I> 25) in
a netherworld that is at once social and somatic. "I wake up choking,"
states a worker who is denied compensation, "and my wife / rolls me
over on my left side" (<I>US,</I> 24). Neither waking nor sleeping, as
in Eliot, "neither / [l]iving nor dead" (<I>WL,</I> 7), he resembles
the many corpses who lie uncounted and undiagnosed in silica-laden mass
graves (<I>US,</I> 43). By highlighting the anonymity of both living and
dead victims of Hawk's Nest Tunnel, Rukeyser displays the etiology of
acute silicosis as a metaphor not only for the excesses of capitalist
exploitation, but also for the more passive social pathologies that
facilitated such excesses in the American workplace. Before the passage
of the 1935 Social Security Act, and the later passage of comprehensive
worker's compensation laws, the industrial sources of their diseases
were no more visible to stricken workers than were their languishing
families visible to the government and the public at large. Here, the
walking skeletons in Rukeyser's poem work to reconcile the corporeal
losses elegized in poems like "Asbestos" with the crises of mass identity
depicted in Eliot's modern elegy.

Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner write that, during the depression,
legislative calls for workmen's compensation for silicosis victims were
attacked from both ends of the political spectrum. The "idiosyncratic"
course of silicosis was difficult to document precisely (Gerald Markowitz
and David Rosner, "The Illusion of Medical Certainty: Silicosis and the
Politics of Industrial Disability, 1930-1960," in <I>Framing Disease:
Studies in Cultural History,</I> ed. Charles E. Rosenberg and Janet
Golden [Brunswick, N. J.: Rutgers University Press, 1992], 197-98;
hereafter abbreviated "IMC"). Anticipating mass filings by previously
exposed workers, insurance companies quadrupled their coverage rates and
forced industries to adopt preemptive screening procedures. Labor was
thus forced "to choose between health and jobs" ("IMC," 198). Faced with
mass layoffs in such sectors as the foundry industry, labor federations
sometimes sided with industrialists in support of jobs. In "The Book of
the Dead," Rukeyser documents the failure of these legislative efforts
in an ambiguously titled section called "The Bill":

array of medicojuridical screening functions in the latter part of

Calling for a national conference on America's silicosis epidemic
in 1936, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins publicized the plight of
the 100,000 workers believed to be suffering from the long-term effects
of silicosis. The Department of Labor estimated that another 500,000
workers had been exposed to dangerous levels of silica dust (<I>HN,</I>
109-10). Rukeyser inflated Perkins's estimates: "There are today
one million potential victims. / 500,000 Americans have silicosis now. /
These are the proportions of a war" (<I>US,</I> 60). After the national
silicosis scares of the mid-1930s, industries began to use X-rays in
the screening of silicotic miners and foundry workers ("IMC," 196,
197-98).

Kalaidjian links the "camera-glass" in the above-quoted passage
to another camera reference in the poem's opening lines: "[V]iewing on
groundglass an inverted image" (<I>US,</I> 10) a visiting photographer
presents a false first glimpse of West Virginia, a vista yielded to
incoming tourists: "resorts, the chalk hotel. / Pillars and fairway"
(<I>US,</I> 9-10). While the glass in both passages implicates
the conventional camera in the deadly excavation of silica, Kalaidjian
traces the photographer's mechanically inverted vision to one of Karl
Marx's early metaphors: "If in all ideology men and their circumstances
appear upside-down as in a <I>camera obscura,</I> this phenomenon
arises just as much from their historical life-process as the inversion
of objects on the retina does from their physical life-process" (Karl
Marx and Frederick Engels, <I>The German Ideology,</I> ed. C. J. Arthur
[New York: International Publishers, 1989], 47). See also <I>AC,</I>
166-68. Kalaidjian suggests that Rukeyser finally surpasses the early
materialist Marx, however. She does so by mobilizing "heteroglossic"
collage methods toward, not a class-based recovery of "historical
'life-process,'" but a richer discursive recovery of the "history of
gender, race, and class oppression" that lies hidden beneath Gauley
Bridge (<I>AC,</I> 170, 168, and 168, respectively). By invoking a
broad-based alliance among, not only the workers, but also the women
and the African Americans who are suppressed by the very conventional
ideological equipment that distorts Gauley Bridge, the poet sets right
the image on the ground glass, while at the same time critiquing the
narrowly conceived materialism that facilitates its simple inversion. I
think that Kalaidjian is wrong when he claims that "The Book of the Dead"
uncovers the "history of . . . race . . . oppression," but I agree with
his reading of the poem's conventional camera as a vexed instrument
that both produces and cures "false consciousness" (<I>AC,</I> 168,
288-89 n. 17). Kalaidjian's conception of Rukeyser's camera as a
double-edged <I>pharmakon</I> is based on W. J. T. Mitchell's reading
of Marx's metaphor of the camera obscura; see his <I>Iconology: Image,
Text, Ideology</I> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986), 178.

As a leading proletariat writer of the 1930s, Williams was familiar with
the Soviet Proletcult genre of "worker-correspondent" poetry; and he would
have certainly noted this related source stratum of Rukeyser's poem. By
suggesting that Rukeyser's skills as a poet are better measured through
her rendering of doctors' than through workers' words, Williams implies
that medical discourse is more remote from the poet than is the language
of miners. Williams seems to suggest that gender, as opposed to class,
is a divide that doctors and poets should labor to uphold. For accounts
of Mike Gold's promotion and production of "worker-correspondent" poetry

Answer. I am informed this was the X-ray picture that was taken last
April, and I would point out to you here the fact that these are the
ribs; this is the region of the breast bone; this is the heart shadow;
the heart being more or less solid, filled with blood, makes the wide
white shadows you see. The breast bone itself comes down only about that
wide. In here, of course, are the swallowing tube, or esophagus, and the
windpipe, which comes down to about this level. We note that those parts
are in this central dark shadow, and then the windpipe divides up and its
divisions go out into the lungs. These are the spaces between the lungs.

Answer. Between the ribs. These are the collar bones. This is the
diaphragm or muscle separating the chest from the abdomen. You will
notice that we are looking at this man from the rear, so that his heart
is on the left side. The diaphragm is higher over here which is his
right side, because the liver is under there, a large organ that is held
rather high, and lifts it up. The diaphragm top is lower over at this
point. You notice there is a pretty clear area between the box of the
chest and the diaphragm clear down into the corners. Now, this lung, for
our purposes in diagnosing silicosis, shows a beginning mottling in all
of these areas. It looks, as some say, like a snowstorm had struck the
fellow's lungs. They are fine in this stage, ten months ago, but they
are all about alike, that side and this side, top and bottom. That is
first stage silicosis in this period in the case. [<I>HC,</I> 96]

William Stott identifies a perception among middle-class Americans
in the 1930s that economic "depressions" were invisible because they
consisted "of things not happening, of business that was not being
done" (William Stott, <I>Documentary Expression and Thirties America</I>
[1973; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986], 67-68; hereafter
abbreviated <I>DE</I>). Stott quotes Frederick Lewis Allen, who wrote that
the crisis of the early 1930s "was . . . nearly invisible to the casual
eye (and to the camera, for that matter). To be sure, the streets were
less crowded with trucks than they had been, many shops stood vacant,
. . . and chimneys which should have been smoking were not doing so. But
these were all negative phenomena. There just didn't seem to be many
people about." (Frederick Louis Allen and Agnes Rogers, <I>I Remember

During the first decades of the twentieth century, reactionary
modern poets shared a conviction that words had grown debased over
time. This belief contributed to imagistic efforts to replace the
poetic "symbol" with the "natural object"; and it led to other more
elaborate efforts to stabilize language. In <I>The Waste Land</I>
and <I>The Cantos,</I> for example, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound each
retreated into flights of imaginary philology, tracing archaic and often
exotic words to foundational sources. In so doing, they endeavored
to combat the Western tendency toward abstraction that had caused
modern words to become self-referential (for Eliot, modern religious
rituals, too, had been lifted away from their vital sources). In <I>The
Waste Land,</I> Eliot delineated a series of overly abstract Christian
principles--"give," "sympathize," "control"--and tried to restore them to
Sanskrit terms that were onomatopoetically linked to rejuvenating natural
processes. The root word "DA," he suggested, had been distilled from
the rumbling of thunder itself, which continued to echo through variant
forms such as <I>"Datta"</I> (give); <I>"Dayadhvam"</I> (sympathize);
and <I>"Damyata"</I> (control). See Hugh Kenner, <I>The Pound Era</I>
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971), 109-10. Pound
believed that modern linguistic and economic systems had estranged
people from the very generative transactions that astute readers could
find preserved in ancient Chinese ideogrammatic compounds.

Between 1913 and 1914, Pound fashioned Imagist poets as agents who
offered organic correctives to the "mechanis[tic]" excesses of Fabian
socialist authors and the new sociologists whose studies the Fabians
admired and made use of (Ezra Pound [Bastien von Helmholtz, pseud.],
"Suffragettes," <I>The Egoist,</I> 1 July 1914, 255). Imagists combated
abstraction by adhering not to the generalized principles of social
scientists, but to the strict observation utilized by physicists
and biologists. Imagist poems were of "permanent" value to society
because they provided a better index of local conditions than did the
"universalizing" contributions of the very "theorists" alongside whom
poets seemed outmoded (Ezra Pound, "The Serious Artist," <I>The New
Freewoman,</I> 15 October 1913, 163). The latter trafficked in "chicane"
and "catchwords" (Pound, "Suffragettes," 255).

Rukeyser was tagged the "Poster Girl" of proletariat literature
by William Phillips and Philip Rahv in "Grandeur and Misery of a Poster
Girl," <I>Partisan Review</I> 10 (September-October 1943): 471. While
X-ray images per se were not commonly associated with the emancipatory
enlightenment of the proletariat, new technologies that facilitated
seeing were fashioned as politically revolutionary not only by Russian
photographers and filmmakers in the 1920s, but also by American poets
affiliated with the so-called Dynamo group in the mid-1930s. These
Russian and American artists both drew from Vladimir Lenin in associating
technological development, and electrification particularly, with social
transformation. Addressing the Eighth Congress of Soviets in 1920, for
example, Lenin declared that Russia's recalcitrant peasantry had long
dwelled in ideological darkness, and that it could be coaxed from this
darkness only if the party worked to "convert every electric power
station . . . into a stronghold of enlightenment" (Vladimir Lenin,
"Communism and Electrification," in <I>The Lenin Anthology,</I>
ed. Robert C. Tucker [New York: W. W. Norton, 1975], 495). See also
Margarita Tupitsyn, <I>The Soviet Photograph, 1924-1937</I> (New
Haven: Yale University Press, 1996), 11-15, 177 n. 15. In poems
like "Dnieprostroy" , American Dynamo poets like Sol Funaroff
echoed Lenin's call for technoenlightenment by celebrating "suns of
photo-electric eyes" and the "new love" that "burns with tigris eyes /
Billions of kilowatt hours" (<I>AC,</I> 155). See also Estelle Gershgoren

Tagg describes the Roosevelt administration as a "paternalistic"
instrument of "corporatist reform," one that "mobilis[ed] documentary

status threatened by crisis but whose renegotiation was essential if

suggests that Roosevelt's political objectives were less intrinsically
bound to the documentary modes that his administration exploited: "The
implicit conservatism, the implicit paternalism of New Deal policy-making
(creative reform seen as coming from the government, not from grass
roots activists) found its way into aspects of FSA image-making"
(<I>BI,</I> 83).

Women including the New York social worker and journalist Philippa
Allen, U. S. Labor Secretary Frances Perkins, and Rukeyser herself
played prominent roles not only in the exposure of the Gauley tunnel
disaster, but also in subsequent calls for the containment of a
national silicosis epidemic. See <I>US,</I> 13-15, 60; "IMC,"
199-200; and <I>HN,</I> 71, 85. In their respective journalistic
and poetic expos&eacute;s of the Hawk's Nest Tunnel incident, Allen and
Rukeyser both portrayed the West Virginia mother Emma Jones as the heroic
catalyst for the more than five hundred lawsuits that survivors leveled
against Rinehart and Dennis and the New Kanawha Power Company. Jones
would eventually tell her story to a national radio audience. See
Philippa Allen [Bernard Allen, pseud.], "Two Thousand Dying on a Job,"
<I>New Masses,</I> 15 January 1935, 18-19. See also <I>HC,</I> 6;
<I>US,</I> 27-30; and <I>HN,</I> 71. The lawsuits instigated by
Mrs. Jones's findings culminated in settlements ranging from $1600 to
$30 per casualty. See <I>US,</I> 29, 45; and <I>HN,</I> 22-23, 67.

Archaeologists sponsored by the Metropolitan Museum had discovered
this heart scarab on the mummy of a woman named Hatnofer. According
to archaeological notes published in conjunction with the exhibition
of this scarab in New York in 1937, Hatnofer had been buried in the
mortuary temple of Hatshepsut because her daughter had served as an
official in the court of the female pharaoh for whom the temple had
been built. See "CE," 179; and Ambrose G. Lansing and William C. Hayes,
"The Museum's Excavations at Thebes," <I>BMMA</I> <I>[Bulletin of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art]</I> 32 (January 1937): 20. For an account of
Hatshepsut's significance as one of the New Kingdom's two matriarchs, see
Quirke, <I>Ancient Egyptian Religion,</I> 36. The Metropolitan Museum's
1912-36 excavation of the temple of Hatshepsut is discussed in
David O'Connor, "The American Archaeological Focus on Ancient Palaces
and Temples of the New Kingdom," in <I>The American Discovery of
Ancient Egypt,</I> ed. Thomas, 81-84. Although Rukeyser does not
trade on its racial significance in her poem, ancient Egypt had long
been viewed by African Americans as the black African seat of Western
civilization; see Paul Gilroy, <I>The Black Atlantic: Modernity and
Double Consciousness</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press,
1993), 59-60, 207-9. During the first decades of the twentieth
century, a rash of spectacular archaeological discoveries had rekindled
debates regarding the racial makeup of the ancient Egyptians. In his
own analysis of the published photographs of newly excavated icons,
for example, W. E. B. Du Bois included Queen Hatshepsut among the New
Dynasty rulers who possessed "Negroid face[s]" (W. E. B. Du Bois, JWJ
MSS 8, box 2, folder 52, W. E. B. Du Bois Collection, Beinecke Library,
Yale University, New Haven, Conn.). A retired black worker spoke of
Egypt as a black hearth in a 1939 Federal Writers' Project collection
of oral interviews entitled <I>These Are Our Lives:</I> "The reason
[whites] don't want to give the 'Gyptians credit is cause they's niggers"
(<I>DE,</I> 205). In splicing Mrs. Jones's testimony to a prayer lifted
from a matriarchal heart scarab stone, however, Rukeyser's "Book" values
Egypt more as a gendered than a racialized source.

Testifying before the house subcommittee, Emma Jones recalled
"beg[ging] money" to pay a hospital to take "X-ray pictures" of her
dying children's lungs (<I>HC,</I> 38). Together with the diseased lungs
themselves, which she had asked doctors to extract after her sons had
died, these X-rays provided some of the first hard evidence that Gauley
Bridge tunnel workers were suffering from industrial poisoning. In
"The Book of the Dead," the West Virginia mother's stark testimonial is
only loosely based on Emma Jones's recorded congressional testimony. It
bears a stronger resemblance to Philippa Allen's earlier prose account
of the West Virginia mother in her <I>New Masses</I> expos&eacute; on
the Gauley tunnel disaster. (Allen later read from this account in her
own congressional testimony.) In Rukeyser's poem, the grieving mother's
words are taken directly from Allen's third-person account, with the
first-person pronoun used in place of the woman's name. See Allen,
"Two Thousand Dying on a Job," 19; and <I>HC,</I> 6.

Wallace Budge's 1895 translation of the Papyrus of Turin contains
the following account of Isis's curative powers: "Isis came with her
words of power, and in her mouth was the breath of life. Now the words
which she stringeth together destroy diseases, and they make to live
those whose throats are stopped up" (<I>BD,</I> 123).

Promotional films distributed by public health officials between
1938 and 1950 identified "the home" as the center of both contagion and
containment, portraying women as both sanitizing agents and as the primary
carriers of the TB virus. In making a healthy and glamorous spectacle
of chest X-rays, these films endeavored to enlist women not only as
homemakers who would check the spread of TB at its domestic source, but
also as dutiful patients who would submit to screenings and ultimately
to sanatorium confinement (<I>SB,</I> 148-49). In a small number
of these promotional films, TB had specific racial as well as gendered
affinities. Most TB screening films featured tubercular white women;
but a few, including <I>Let My People Live</I> , and <I>Another to
Conquer</I> , featured working-class African American women, and
Navajo women, respectively, as the primary carriers of TB (<I>SB,</I>
149-50, 187 n. 17). By trading on the widespread belief that Native
Americans and African Americans possessed either constitutions or cultural
practices that left them vulnerable to TB, these promotional materials
merged the disease's gendered markers with markers of class, race, and
ethnicity. In medical films and literature of the late 1930s, the female
cadaver that graced anatomist paintings was revived in a range of living
subjects whose potential to contaminate was discovered first upon and
then under their skins.

During the early 1920s, advocates of immigration restrictions invoked
apocalyptic scenarios derived from the writings of Lothrop Stoddard, a
racialist associate of Madison Grant. Stoddard wrote of the imminent
destruction of the white race by "teeming" darker races that would
gradually out-breed them. Worldwide, "whites" would soon be supplanted
by the "colored" races that they had ostensibly come to colonize. And on
American shores, whites of "Nordic," or northern European ancestry, were
now being genetically swamped by "Alpines" and "Mediterraneans," inferior
"subspecies" of whites who were immigrating from eastern and southern
European countries. See Lothrop Stoddard, <I>The Rising Tide of Color
Against White World-Supremacy</I> (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons,
1920), 298, 309. Walter Benn Michaels argues provocatively that, while
Stoddard's white supremacist views are rehearsed, sometimes earnestly,
sometimes mockingly, in such canonical modern literary texts as <I>The
Great Gatsby,</I> Stoddard's real significance to modern literature
lies less in his flagrantly racist writings than in his eventual call
for Americans to identify themselves as a body unto themselves. In
1924, immigration quotas had been implemented to stabilize the makeup
of America's white population, and it was only after the passage of
the so-called National Origins Act that the author of <I>Re-Forging
America</I>  began to foreground the criterion of racial difference
over that of racial inferiority or superiority. For Michaels, the
"nativist pluralism" of the late 1920s, the belief that Americans
should put aside universalizing racial standards in favor of the more
locally derived standard of Americanness itself, was inseparable from
the linguistic identitarian concerns rehearsed by modern artists who
were preoccupied with the materiality of their mediums. "[N]ativism and
modernism," Michaels argues, came to be powerfully united "as efforts
to work out the meaning of the commitment to identity--linguistic,
national, cultural, racial--that . . . is common to both." (Walter Benn
Michaels, <I>Our America: Nativism, Modernism, and Pluralism</I> [Durham,
N.C.: Duke University Press: 1995], 2-3; see also 14-15, 23)
Nativist pluralism, however, appears to have been engendered through a
modulation of the category of "race" itself. Insofar as modern Americans
were inclined to trade racial for cultural awareness, they did so not only
because immigration quotas made it safe to do so, but because meaningful
racial differences had already been strategically displaced into the
more manageable confines of a struggle between "subspecies" of whites
(145 n. 22).
