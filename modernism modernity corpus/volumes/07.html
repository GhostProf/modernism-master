But for all their vagueness, for all their lack of definition, these
controlling presences, these sources of power, these things with an
inner life, with their own richness of content, these beings, with the
destiny of the world hidden in their natures, are what we want to know
about. As we cross a road busy with traffic, we see the colours of their
occupants; but at the moment we are absorbed in using this immediate
show as a symbol for the forces determining the immediate future.

There are two competing aesthetics of temporality in modernism, one
"spatialized," its model of time marked by breaks and often attacked as
"static"; the other a celebration of movement and speed. Their points
of reference are competing conceptions of time. Recent commentators
on British modernism usually have seen both these philosophies as
continental. Leaving aside Martin Heidegger, whose <I>Sein und Zeit</I>
(1927 [Being and time]), while certainly one important expression of
the period's preoccupation with time, was not a direct influence on any
of the modernists writing in English, the two currents are generally
attached to Hegelianism and Bergsonism,

<B></B>

respectively. Critics have had little to say about any specifically
British philosophies of time and any controversies about time in England
in the first decades of this century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Yet an immersion in the intellectual life of the period leads to
 the discovery of a debate about time that counterposes two British
 philosophies of time, both equally hostile to Bergson. One is Hegelian
 and the other, while anti-Hegelian, could be said to incorporate
 important features of Hegelian idealism in the cause of a new realism. In
 particular, it relates a spatialized and seemingly still time to a theory
 of change. The locus of the debate was Cambridge; its protagonists were
 largely members of the Cambridge Apostles, the philosophical society
 that included Alfred North Whitehead, G. E. Moore, Bertrand Russell and,
 briefly, Ludwig Wittgenstein. The young Apostle John Maynard Keynes,
 who had attended J. M. McTaggart's lectures, delivered a paper on
 "Time" to the Society in 1903.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 The Apostles included Roger Fry, Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf, and
 E. M. Forster, which suggests that this time-thinking may have had
 repercussions beyond the immediate circle of Cambridge philosophy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To the extent that one can claim the existence of a coherent Cambridge
philosophy of time, it developed as part of the project Moore called in
1903 "The Refutation of Idealism," for there were British Hegelians,
the most preeminent of which was Oxford's F. H. Bradley. The Apostle
J. M. McTaggart, "the idealist philosopher Cambridge took seriously,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 had, like Bradley, maintained that time is unreal, which Moore found
 "a perfectly monstrous proposition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 McTaggart had published "The Unreality of Time" in <I>Mind</I> in
 1908, but 1927 saw the publication of <I>Sein und Zeit</I> as well as
 the posthumous appearance of McTaggart's account of time in <I>The</I>
 <I>Nature of Existence</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 It coincided with a series of publications at least partly addressing the
 subject of time in the wake of Einstein's general theory of relativity:
 Whitehead's <I>The Principle of Relativity</I> , C. D. Broad's
 <I>Scientific Thought</I> , Jean Nicod's <I>La Geom&eacute;trie
 dans le monde sensible</I> , and Arthur Eddington's <I>Mathematical
 Theory of Relativity</I> .
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 1927 was also the publication date of Russell's <I>The Analysis of
 Matter</I>, partly delivered at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1926. The
 debate generated interest beyond the philosophical world. Leonard Woolf
 asked Russell in 1926 to review Whitehead's <I>Science and the Modern
 World</I>  for <I>The Nation</I> <I>and</I> <I>Athenaeum</I>,
 as he had asked him to review Broad's <I>The Mind and Its Place in
 Nature</I>; both reviews discuss time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Wyndham Lewis's idiosyncratic <I>Time and Western Man</I>  on
 what Lewis calls "contemporary time-philosophy" likewise registers these
 wider repercussions, as does Forster's <I>Aspects of the Novel</I>, his
 1927 Clark lectures also given at Trinity. There Forster writes that
 "in the novel, the allegiance to time is imperative. . . . Whereas in
 daily life . . . the experience of certain mystics suggests, indeed,
 that it is not necessary."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The year 1927, then, also that of the publication of <I>To the
 Lighthouse</I>, represents the culmination of a period of intense
 interest in time. Virginia Woolf's novel was its major artistic
 expression.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Woolf's heroine in <I>Night and Day</I> , who secretly studies
mathematics and wishes to be an astronomer, decided "she would force
herself to think out the problem of the future, or some mathematical
problem,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Woolf explicitly singled out

<B></B>

and named one aspect of the problem of time, what C. D. Broad pronounces
"the hardest knot in the whole of philosophy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The problem of the future was already an ancient problem, that of the
 future contingent: "Aristotle's question whether it is now true that
 there either will be or will not be a sea t tomorrow," which is
 set forth in chapter nine of Aristotle's <I>De Interpretatione</I> and
 taken up in the Master Argument of Diodorus Cronus.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Diodorus, W. and M. Kneale write, "maintains that all true statements
 about the future are necessary" as "a consequence of what is admitted
 by Aristotle, namely the necessity of the past."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Jaakko Hintikka summarizes its usual interpretation: it will either
 be true that a sea t will take place tomorrow or that it will
 not. If it does, then it is already true. How then can tomorrow's sea
 t be contingent? "Hence the unrestricted application of <I>tertium
 non datur</I> [the law of the excluded middle] to statements about
 future events seems to commit us to holding that all future events
 are predetermined."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At stake then is the question of determinism, one more generally raised
by the debate about physical time as is apparent in the English title of
Bergson's <I>Time and Free Will</I> , translated, significantly,
by an Oxford philosopher, F. L. Pogson.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
"I have never read Bergson," Woolf wrote to Harmon H. Goldstone in 1932.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 This does not mean she was unfamiliar with Bergson's work, however. A
 letter of Lytton Strachey records her attendance "crouching" at a
 1913 Aristotelian Society meeting where Bertrand Russell's niece Karin
 Costelloe, to become her sister-in-law Karin Stephen, presented a paper
 on Bergson.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 But it was not Costelloe-Stephen's "praise of Bergson"
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 that generated Strachey's excitement; it was, he wrote, Russell's
 "pungent criticisms," along with those of Moore, "the very opposite
 of brilliant--appallingly sensible, and so easy to understand that you
 wondered why on earth no one else had thought of it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 If Woolf knew Bergson, it was through Cambridge thinking on time. The
 question of determinism and free will had its place in the philosophical
 tradition her father had surveyed in his <I>History of English Thought
 in the Eighteenth Century</I>, in David Hume's discussion of the liberty
 of the will in <I>A Treatise of Human Nature</I>, and in Thomas Hobbes's
 discussion of the problem of the future.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 As a result, the whole of <I>To the Lighthouse</I>, even its title, is
 organized around the problem of the future.

Idealism held, along with Bergson, that physical time--the time recorded
by clocks--is timeless. McTaggart represented it as "the B series,"
where the positions are related by being earlier than some and later than
others (<I>NE</I>, 2:9). But here the two philosophies parted company. The
Bergsonian version of real time was duration, the flow of interpenetrating
moments. Idealism's version, if it did not insist on "interpenetration,"
did see the movement from past to present to future represented by the
tenses as essential to temporality. Only, McTaggart argued the unreality
"of tense and of the flow of time," as D. H. Mellor puts it, that the
relations of past, present, and future are self-contradictory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 "McTaggart's proof," Mellor writes, "is very simple. Many
 <I>A</I> series positions are incompatible with each other. An
 event which is <I>yesterday</I>, for example, cannot also be <I>tomorrow</I>. . . . Everything occupies every <I>A</I> series position,
 from the remotest future, through the present, to the remotest past. But
 nothing can really have incompatible properties," so nothing can in
 reality be past, present or future (<I>RT</I>, 92-3, emphasis
 in original). E.g., a particular occasion of inclement weather may be
 represented by the propositions "it will rain tomorrow," "it is raining
 now," and "it rained yesterday," depending on when the statements
 occur. This entails that for an event to be "in time," it must possess
 "incompatible determinations," i.e., if it "is past, it has been present
 and future" (<I>NE</I>, 2:20). "It follows," McTaggart argues, "that
 there can be no change unless some propositions are sometimes true
 and sometimes false." He gives as an example "'it is now raining'"
 (<I>NE</I>, 2:15).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russell defended a position "in the middle," "pierced" on both sides,
"like St. Sebastian," by time's arrow and its flight.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 He conceded that A-series "events are not eternally past or eternally
 present or eternally future, but change in these respects" (<I>CPBR</I>,
 9:261). He agreed that "[s]uch a statement as 'it is raining' is
 sometimes true and sometimes false" (<I>HWP</I>, 588). Moore had likewise
 observed that "whenever we use the present tense in its primary sense, it
 seems to me plain that . . . we do mean something different by it each
 time we use it. . . . [a]nd similarly with the past and future tenses,"
 and that "if I say 'It will rain tomorrow,' these words have a different
 meaning today from what they would have if I used them tomorrow."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 But Russell locates this A-series characteristic in something extraneous
 to time: "past, present and future arise from time-relations of subject
 and object, while earlier and later arise from time-relations of object
 and object."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Russell "reject[s] the A series," McTaggart says in summarizing him,
 because "past, present, and future do not belong to time <I>per se</I>,
 but only in relation to a knowing subject. . . . If there were no
 consciousness, there would be events which were earlier or later than
 others, but nothing would be in any sense past, present, or future"
 (<I>NE</I>, 2:13-4). The removal of the subjective element yields
 the B series: crucially for Russell the order of the two series is the
 same, which permits them to be "correlated."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 The notion is central to Russell's claimed solution: a particular
 present event is earlier than a future one and the logical relation
 of "earlier or later than" holding between the two events does not
 change when the present event becomes past. This is the permanence of
 the logical relations of the B series: "If M is earlier than N, it is
 always earlier" (<I>NE</I>, 2:10).

<B></B>

Russell does not agree with McTaggart, however, that "if we remove the
A series" from the B series, "we are left with a series which is not
temporal" (<I>NE</I>, 2:15). It is true that time is frozen thereby into
an unchanging series, but it nonetheless represents change: "this eternal
passing and flowing," as Woolf would write,"was struck into stability."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Russell's solution will require representing contingent statements about
 the future in the same way as it represents those about the past. All
 time statements are thus endowed with the logical "necessity of the
 past," including those about the future. Logical necessity, however,
 is not determinism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
McTaggart's problem for Russell is ultimately one of language, "a
mere confusion due to the unfortunate fact that verbs have tenses"
(<I>CPBR</I>, 9:262). Assuming "past, present and future are relations,"
the problem is "to define the term to which they are to be related,
since this term must be continually changing" (<I>CPBR</I>, 9:261). This
"relatum" Russell calls "an ambiguous proper name" whose referent is
something momentary, e.g. "this" or "now" (<I>CPBR</I>, 9:262). These
are the terms linguistics calls "deictics" or "shifters." They shift
reference with each use. In "On the Experience of Time," Russell makes
"now" the key to the past-present-future series; "<I>present time</I>" is
"a class of all entities that are <I>now</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 The shifting "now" contrasts with dates, which denote fixed
 times. Absolute dates, like those famous ones Woolf inserts into
 certain texts, "the twelfth stroke of midnight, Thursday, the eleventh
 of October, Nineteen Hundred and Twentyeight"
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 or "the morning of the twenty-sixth of October 1928,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 are not given in experience. Only relative order is, because "we cannot
 point to a time itself, but only to some event occurring at that time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 As Mellor remarks, "Dates form a series . . . which is not the A-series"
 (<I>RT</I>, 19). In translating experienced into physical time, each
 "now" is correlated with a date. "I write the date, because I think
 that I have discovered a possible form for these notes. That is, to
 make them include the present--at least enough of the present to serve
 as platform to stand upon," Woolf explains of the autobiographical
 impulse that connects the two.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Mellor calls the A series "tensed" by contrast with the "tenseless"
 view of time: "'tensed statements,'" according to Robin Le Poidevin
 and Murray MacBeath, "reflect a given temporal perspective" by "the
 grammatical tense of a verb or in the use of some such term as 'past,'
 'present,' 'future,' 'now,' 'then,' 'yesterday,' 'next year,' 'the
 month after next,' 'in a short while,' 'a long time ago,' etc."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Note that these terms are deictics. Tense in this view becomes the
 essence of temporal deictics. Russell's alternative sees tense as a
 special case of the deictic's built-in subjectivity.

<B></B>

Since we will argue there are linguistic tenses with no "temporal
perspective," in Le Poidevin and MacBeath's sense, we will distinguish
"deictic" from "nondeictic" tense. Making deixis and not tense the
defining category--where deixis includes both temporal and spatial
forms--and allowing nondeictic tense to represent B-series time relations
is a version of the spatial analogy with time. Bergson, who rejects the
abstract time of physics as "spatialized," holds the tensed view.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The uniqueness of Russell's position is to defend a spatialized notion
of time not as timeless but as the goal of a knowledge of time "by
description." Since it is achieved by "correlating" the "nows" that
are directly apprehended objects of "knowledge by acquaintance" with
fixed positions in the B series, Russell's solution, like Moore's, thus
requires a language in which the "shifting" deictic terms are replaced
in propositions about time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 This includes tensed propositions. "Mr. Russell holds that such
 propositions are ambiguous, and that to make them definite we must
 substitute propositions which are always true or always false," e.g.,
 "'the fall of rain is simultaneous with this judgment,'" McTaggart
 continues (<I>NE</I>, 2:165). Russell thinks it impossible "to arrive at
 a just philosophy of time except by employing verbs in a sense divorced
 from tense." Only then can one "say that past, present, and future are
 [in a sense without tense] all equally real; what is false is to say
 that the future 'is' when 'is' means 'is now'" (<I>CPBR</I>, 9:262;
 Russell's brackets).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "is now" Moore calls "the present tense in its primary sense." It
"express[es] the idea that a given event is contemporary with our actual
use of it," i.e., with the speech act (<I>PS</I>, 136). It is a deictic
present. Russell creates a "tenseless," i.e., nondeictic present by making
it cotemporal not with a present deictic but with a fixed time adverbial,
e.g., "'It will rain tomorrow' is one of the class of propositions
'It rains at time <I>t</I>,' where t is different times." (<I>LK</I>,
255) In "[t]he statement that a thing exists at time <I>t</I>," Russell
explains, "'exists' is used without tense" (<I>CPBR</I>, 9:262). Arguing,
as he says, against William James's claim that "truths are mutable,"
Moore similarly distinguishes between "ideas" and "words" (<I>PS</I>,
134 ff.). Hence, as Mellor presents it, McTaggart's claim about the
unreality of time is really about tense: "nothing in reality has tenses"
(<I>RT</I>, 93). We only stipulate that tense means deixis. Russell's
solution requires a notion of change not dependent on deictic or shifting
tense, as put forth in his <I>Principles of Mathematics</I>, section
442. Peter Geach has called this notion "<I>Cambridge</I> changes":
"An object O is said to 'change' in this sense if and only if there are
two propositions about O, differing only in that one mentions an earlier
and the other a later time, and one is true, the other false."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Thus, if "it is raining on 1 May 1996" is true of the weather on that
 date but "it is raining on 2 May 1996" is not, the weather can be said to
 have changed. "That is to say," McTaggart comments, "there is change, on
 Mr. Russell's view, if the proposition 'at the time <I>T</I> my poker
 is hot' is true, and the proposition 'at the time <I>T</I>' my poker
 is hot' is false." (<I>NE</I>, 2:14)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russell's use of the present "exists" or "is" "without tense" represents
events in time with the same verbal form as universal truths. Universal
statements such as "All men are mortal" use the "generic" or "eternal"
present, whose "is," as Russell says, cannot mean "is now." The difference
is grammatical as well: the generic present

<B></B>

cannot co-occur with "now," nor, in English, take the progressive aspect;
we cannot say "Two plus two is now (being) four" or "All men are being
mortal" as we can "All dissidents are being arrested" or "The men are
being silly."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Moore calls it the "timeless sense of the word 'is'": "beside the things
 which have been, are now, and will be, there are many other things also
 belonging to the Universe, which are and yet are not <I>now</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Russell asserts that "it is raining" may be sometimes true and
sometimes false, he adds, "but 'two and two are four' is always true"
(<I>HWP</I>, 588). Here "always" means "for all times," i.e., in every
possible world. When, in Russell's solution, past, present, and future
statements with changing truth values are exchanged for permanent or
always true statements at time <I>t</I>, when, in other words, the
shifting "now" is exchanged for a fixed or rigidly designated instant
of clock time expressible by a numerical hour or date, which is the
same operation that exchanges names for particulars by descriptions,
their nondeictic present becomes indistinguishable from that of universal
statements. Yet the permanence or tenselessness of universals is different
from the atemporality of nondeictic time statements, as is demonstrable
grammatically. For the generic present, incompatible with shifters like
"now," is also incompatible with adverbials like "at time <I>t</I>";
"two and two is four at time <I>t</I>" is equally impossible. Universals
cannot be said to be at "any particular time," whether shifting or fixed
(<I>PP</I>, 98). Universals have being, but things in time exist: the word
"exist" is taken to mean "'being at some part of the time-series.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Herein lies the difference between the atemporal permanence of universals
 and the permanent, nondeictic, temporal relations of empirical facts. The
 latter are always true in some actual world. Moreover, being fixed
 to a time, each fact about an event enters into relation with other
 such facts, namely the relation of earlier and later that erects them
 into an ordered series, whereas generic statements are unordered with
 respect to one another. This is what it means to say they hold at no
 particular time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Russell later adopts an alternative to the nondeictic (Mellor's
"tenseless") present: "the language of physics," he says, translates "A
meteor is visible now" into "A meteor was visible at 8h. 43m. G.M.T.,"
substituting a past tense for the now-less present. The "was" Russell
characterizes as "intended to be without tense," in this, the time-bound
counterpart to the generic present.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
Unlike the latter, it refers to a fact, unchanging in that it is
independent of any subject's (or any shifting term's) relation to it
yet somewhere in the time-series. "'There was an eclipse of the sun on
April 17, 1912' expresses now exactly the same objective fact as was
expressed before that date by 'There will be an eclipse of the sun on
April 17, 1912.' The difference between these two sentences lies solely
in the time-relation asserted to hold between the subject and the event
concerned" (<I>TK</I>, 106).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The confusion arises because the "European languages," Russell says, "are
absolutely destitute of means of speaking of an event without indicating
its temporal relation to the speaker," i.e., to a "now," and therefore
"there is no way of expressing the eternity of the fact as opposed to
the transiency of the event" (<I>TK</I>, 107).
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 This "gross incapacity of the languages spoken by western philosophers"
 is not universally

<B></B>

the case, however (<I>TK</I>, 107). There exists a "historical" or
"narrative" past, like Russell's past "without tense"--our nondeictic
past--e.g. the French aorist, preterite, or <I>pass&eacute; simple</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Its uses are written, "literary";
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 it is the tense used in the French novel, that "narrative past" that
 for Roland Barthes links "writing and the novel."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 The <I>pass&eacute; simple</I>, like the generic present, cannot
 co-occur with deictics, but it can occur with time adverbials like
 "at time <I>t</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 It expresses the permanence of the relation of earlier or later without
 reference to the speaker's time. "Now one thought of it," Mrs. Ramsay
 reflects on "this night," "cleared of chatter and emotion, it seemed
 always to have been, only was shown now and so being shown, struck
 everything into stability" (<I>TL</I>, 170). Perhaps this is why
 McTaggart says of Russell's position that "if there were events earlier
 than any consciousness, those events would never be future or present,
 though they could be past" (<I>NE</I>, 2:13-14). Russell in effect
 makes all propositions about events in time statements about the past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The clear-cut distinctions permitted by the grammar of French
are detectable in English. "'Each tense,' said Neville, 'means

 In "Time Passes," the seven sets of sentences between brackets are
 translatable by the historical past: "[Here Mr. Carmichael, who was
 reading Virgil, blew out his candle. It was midnight.]" (<I>TL</I>, 192)
 "[Mr. Ramsay, stumbling along a passage one dark morning, stretched
 his arms out, but Mrs. Ramsay having died rather suddenly the night
 before, his arms, though stretched out, remained empty.]" (<I>TL</I>,
 194) "[Prue Ramsay, leaning on her father's arm, was given in
 marriage. . . .]" (<I>TL</I>, 198). "[Prue Ramsay died that summer in
 some illness connected with childbirth, which was indeed a tragedy,
 people said. . . .]" (<I>TL</I>, 199) "[A shell exploded. Twenty or
 thirty young men were blown up in France, among them Andrew Ramsay, whose
 death, mercifully, was instantaneous.]" (<I>TL</I>, 201) "[Mr. Carmichael
 brought out a volume of poems that spring. . . .]" (<I>TL</I>, 202)
 "[Lily Briscoe had her bag carried up to the house late one evening
 in September.]" (<I>TL</I>, 213) The French translation of <I>To the

 last candle at midnight, Prue Ramsay's marriage, Mrs. Ramsay's death,
 then Prue's in childbirth, and Andrew's "in battle," Mr. Carmichael's
 publication of his war poetry, and Lily Briscoe's return to the
 house. One wedding, three deaths, three insignificant acts, flattened
 in an arbitrary series. Death is revealed to be as inevitable as the

The peculiar "necessity of the past," as Russell presents it, is
expressed by the permanence of nondeictic time-statements about individual
events. Their "necessity" is not that of classic, necessary propositions
in the generic present, which is what Moore has in mind when he states
that propositions where "the distinction between 'This is' and 'This
was' is disregarded" must "involve necessity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 The latter hold for all worlds, all times. The nondeictic past, however,
 means that "such-and-such an

<B></B>

event happened at such-and-such a time" is always true and not that
"such-and-such an event happens" is always true; such statements
represent possibilities actualized in some world, i.e., at some
time. The distinction is like Hintikka's between "omnitemporality" and
"eternity" (<I>TN</I>, 83-4). Aristotle's problem, he thinks, is
that of "<I>omnitemporal</I> truth": "that statements about individual
future events have <I>always</I> been true if they are true at all,
and <I>always</I> false if false at all" and that they are "true or
false <I>necessarily</I>" but not true necessarily or false necessarily
(<I>TN</I>, 153, emphasis in original).

Russell rejects McTaggart's "contention that time is unreal" "as based
upon fallacious reasoning" (<I>OK</I>, 171). His nondeictic series
avoids the contradictions of the deictic A series. But, McTaggart
argues, it commits Russell to a timeless vision in which the future
is determined. If Russell "is right, all judgments are either always
true, or always false. Then, I maintain, no facts change" (<I>NE</I>,
2:16). Russell admits that "there is some sense . . . in which time
is an unimportant and superficial characteristic of reality. Past and
future must be acknowledged to be as real as the present, and a certain
emancipation from slavery to time is essential to philosophic thought"
(<I>OK</I>, 171).

 It is "better to allow the effect to be before the cause or simultaneous
 with it, because nothing of any scientific importance depends upon
 its being after the cause" (<I>OK</I>, 229). One can claim that "the
 future 'determines' the past in exactly the same sense in which the past
 'determines' the future" if "[t]he word 'determine,' here, has a purely
 logical significance," i.e., the "logical necessity" of Wittgenstein's

Science substitutes for "the trivial principle 'same cause, same effect,'"
Newton's "uniformity of nature," i.e., "the principle of the permanence
of laws" (<I>ML</I>, 190). The laws concerned involve the nomological
relations of the "world of universals" or of "being": "it is not in
any sameness of causes and effects that the constancy of scientific law
consists, but in the sameness of relations" (<I>ML</I>, 188)--"always the
<I>relation</I> of cause and effect, not the cause itself" (<I>OK</I>,
235, emphasis in original). One interpretation of the "uniformity of
nature" is "the irrelevance of time," the principle that "no law involves
the time as argument" (<I>ML</I>, 198). Permanence here means eternity not
omnitemporality, the eternal present and not the nondeictic past. To what

<B></B>

degree does the principle hold for the future; can one "infer the future
from the past"? (<I>ML</I>, 192) Russell admits it is possible "that
all inferences as to the future are in fact invalid" (<I>OK</I>, 225),
perhaps as a concession to <I>Tractatus</I> 5.136: "There is no causal
nexus which justifies such an inference"; and 5.13161: "The events of the
future <I>cannot</I> be inferred from those of the present." "I do not
see how such a view could be disproved," Russell concedes (<I>OK</I>,
225). But to the degree that "inferences as to the future <I>are</I>
valid, what principle must be involved in making them?" Russell asks
(<I>OK</I>, 225, emphasis in original). His answer borrows from Keynes's
work on probability, for the predictability of future events concerned
the economist.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Assuming the uniformity of nature, the future is inferred from the past
 not by the law of causality but by "the principle of induction": "an
 empirical generalisation from a number of laws which are themselves
 empirical generalisations" (<I>ML</I>, 189), it nevertheless goes
 beyond the empirical, since "the observed cases of the truth of causal
 laws afford no presumption as to the unobserved cases" (<I>OK</I>,
 225-6). "Prediction" is one name for this knowledge of the
 future. But science also makes predictions about the past for which
 memory is lacking, that covered by Mrs. Swithin's Outline of History
 in <I>Between the Acts</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 So not just <I>future</I> knowledge is at stake. The principle of
 induction permits us to "infer that any characteristic of the whole
 of the observed past is likely to apply to the future and to the
 unobserved past" (<I>OK</I>, 225). The "laws of probable sequence"
 are not necessary, however; "<I>any</I> . . . sufficiently frequent
 sequence will be causal," so, unlike Mill, "we shall not refuse to say
 that night is the cause of day" (<I>ML</I>, 187, emphasis in original).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The question of the present "existence" of the future for Russell seems
then only a special case of the existence of the unobserved. Real time
includes an unobserved but not necessarily unknown time, if knowledge
is not restricted to acquaintance or direct apprehension but allows
knowledge by description. The compact series of "instants of time"
means we "either bring in events wholly outside our experience or
assume that experienced events have parts which we do not experience, or
postulate that we can experience an infinite number of events at once"
(<I>OK</I>, 126). Broad had tried to treat the future differently from
the past, claiming that "judgments which profess to be about the future"
in fact "do not refer to any fact, whether positive or negative, at the
time when they are made" (<I>ST</I>, 73). Hence, "the Law of Excluded
Middle does not apply to all judgments," namely not to those about the
future. "Dr. Broad's theory," McTaggart objects, "would involve that 'it
will rain to-morrow' is neither true nor false," whereas "[i]t seems to
me quite certain that 'it will rain to-morrow' is either true or false"
(<I>NE</I>, 2:24). Russell's objection is twofold: future and past only
differ in the A series by virtue of its deictic point of reference and
by virtue of the differing nature of knowledge of the past and of the
future. "Mr. Broad's contention that the time-series essentially has sense
from earlier to later, rather than vice-versa," Russell thinks, "amounts
merely to the empirical fact that memory only works one way. There is
no reason, except brute fact, why we should not remember the future as
well as the past" (<I>CPBR</I>, 9:262).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The future is determined, Russell thus concedes, but only to the degree
the past is. "You cannot make the past other than it was--true, but this
is a mere application of the law of contradiction. . . . But also you
cannot make the future other than it will be; this again is an application
of the law of contradiction" (<I>ML</I>, 195). In any case, knowledge of
neither future nor past makes them what they are: "the supposed prevision
would not create the future any more than memory creates the past." The
problem is a "confusion of thought, due to the feeling that knowledge
<I>compels</I> the happening of what it knows when this is future," but
"knowledge has no such power in regard to the past" (<I>OK</I>, 239,
emphasis in original). But, Russell counters, the past could "have been
different if our present wishes had been different," concluding, "the
past cannot be different from what it was, but no more can our present
wishes be different from what they are; this again is merely the law of
contradiction" (<I>ML</I>, 196). This is the burden of <I>Tractatus</I>
5.1362: "The freedom of the will consists in the fact that future
actions cannot be known now. We could only know them if causality were an
<I>inner</I> necessity, like that of logical deduction.--The connexion
of knowledge and what is known is that of logical necessity." Freedom
lies strangely in the limits of knowledge, in agnosticism. Or, in Henry
Le Roy Finch's reading, knowledge, insofar as its connection to the world
is governed by logic, is independent of any knowing subject, but willing
is not. One cannot "know" anything that is not something there is. So
what is known has to be what there is. But there is no logical necessity
that the world is what is willed: "The world is independent of my will"
(<I>Tractatus</I> 6.373). Hence, freedom does not bear on knowledge.

The vision involves, then, a certain determinism. Mrs. Ramsay, observing
"the long steady stroke" of the lighthouse clock, repeats the future
contingent "it will end, it will end . . . . It will come," to transform
it into a fatal "what will be will be" (<I>TL</I>, 97). The early Russell
rejected the distinction between the necessary and the contingent in
holding "that all propositions are necessary."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 "Everything is in a sense a mere fact," he claimed, and "there seems
 to be no true proposition of which it makes sense to say that it might
 have been false. . . . What is true, is true; what is false, is false;
 and concerning fundamentals, there is nothing more to be said."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 In the Russellian solution to the problem of the future, the Platonism
 of the early logic is projected onto the conception of time; the
 impressionist world of existence is struck into stability by the logical
 world of universals. "In the world everything is as it is and happens
 as it does happen," reads <I>Tractatus</I> 6.41. But alongside this
 is the truth that "all happening and being-so is accidental." "What
 makes it non-accidental cannot lie <I>in</I> the world" but must lie
 "outside the world" (<I>Tractatus</I> 6.41, emphasis in original). This
 is the distanced position outside time from which the future becomes
 one with the past and the order of causality is discernable.

 What is demanded is a maximization of knowledge, to "know all," where

 For Russell, that no subject in time can adopt that perspective until
 the future is past is a "mere accident" (<I>OK</I>, 238). The observer
 outside time grasps the relations of events by a kind of predictive
 retrospect. Even "earlier or later than" are emptied of directionality,
 like "to the left of" and "to the right of." Russell's realism adopts

 of the present." Yet "past and future do not and cannot exist for us

 Russell only distances himself from Bradley in permitting no nostalgia

The problem of the future structures all of <I>To the
Lighthouse</I>. Raised in the opening sentence by the incomplete
proposition "if it's fine tomorrow," the novel's title

<B></B>

forms an element of the proposition's completion (<I>TL</I>, 9). The
opening sentence and title are only two tips of the iceberg of a theory
of time and change submerged in the book whose source is Cambridge. It
takes the form of the question of "the wetness or fineness of to-morrow,"
which we now recognize as the typical example for the future contingent:
Broad's examples--"To-morrow will be wet" or "It will rain" (<I>ST</I>,
72-3, 77)--like Moore's and Russell's "It will rain tomorrow"
(<I>LK</I>, 255), and even McTaggart's present "it is now raining"
(<I>NE</I>, 2:15).
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 The proposition occurs throughout the first part of the novel in
 various modalities: "'But,' said his father . . . 'it won't be fine'"
 (<I>TL</I>, 10). "'But it may be fine--I expect it will be fine,' said
 Mrs. Ramsay, making some twist of the reddish brown stocking she was
 knitting, impatiently. If she finished it tonight, if they did go to
 the Lighthouse after all . . ." (<I>TL</I>, 11); "it might be fine
 tomorrow. So it might" (<I>TL</I>, 50). "'Perhaps it will be fine
 tomorrow,' she said." (<I>TL</I>, 26) "If it were fine, they should go
 for a picnic. Everything seemed possible." (<I>TL</I>, 157) "'It's due
 west,' said the atheist Tansley. . . . That is to say, the wind blew from
 the worst possible direction for landing at the Lighthouse." (<I>TL</I>,
 12) In part three, "'[i]t will rain,'" James "remembered his father
 saying. 'You won't be able to go to the Lighthouse'" (<I>TL</I>,
 276). The future is the realm of the possible: "It is possible that it
 may rain tomorrow" (<I>LK</I>, 255). Only time will tell, where "tell"
 means to narrate in the time-series. Mrs. Ramsay's position at the
 transparent window is then related to the uncertainty of the future in
 the form of the weather. At the end of "The Window" the theme reoccurs
 as Mrs. Ramsay again "looked out of the window" (<I>TL</I>, 185-6).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Between the Acts</I> likewise raises the truth or falsehood of a
weather forecast at the start: "'If it's fine,' Mrs. Swithin continued,
'they'll act on the terrace . . .' 'And if it's wet,' Bartholomew
continued, 'in the Barn.' 'And which will it be?' Mrs. Swithin
continued. 'Wet or fine?' Then, for the seventh time in succession, they
both looked out of the window" (<I>BA</I>, 22, ellipsis in original).

The partial proposition about the morrow's weather hidden in <I>To

 It consists of the antecedent of a conditional whose consequent contains
 the novel's title: "'Yes, of course, if it's fine tomorrow, we shall
 go to the lighthouse'" (<I>TL</I>, 9). The "if" clause functions as
 the answer to a question posed just prior to the novel's first line, a
 question repeated later: "In a moment he would ask her, 'Are we going
 to the Lighthouse? And she would have to say, 'No: not tomorrow; your
 father says not'" (<I>TL</I>, 94-5).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In both <I>To the Lighthouse</I> and <I>Between the Acts</I>, the
deictic tensed statement "It will be fine tomorrow" and its negation
counterpose two mutually exclusive interpretations of the world. Lily
"with the Ramsays" is "made to feel violently two opposite things at the
same time; that's what you feel, was one; that's what I feel, was the
other, and then they fought together" in the mind (<I>TL</I>, 154). Both
cannot be true without violating the principle of noncontradiction. Woolf
underscores their incompatibility by making one male and the other
female. Mr. Ramsay negates the fact of light and sunshine; so also
Charles Tansley: "'No going to the Lighthouse tomorrow, Mrs. Ramsay,'
he said" (<I>TL</I>, 129); Mrs. Ramsay, however, asserts it. When Minta
and Paul are "wondering about the weather" and Mrs. Ramsay observes that
"'There isn't a cloud anywhere for miles,'" "she could feel little Charles
Tansley . . . snigger" (<I>TL</I>, 86). Hence, the weather is the subject
of the quarrel between Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay: "she flew in the face of
facts. . . . 'Damn you,' he said. But what had she said? Simply that
it might be fine tomorrow. So it might. Not with the barometer falling
and the wind due west. . . . Then he said, Damn you. He said, It must
rain. He said, It won't rain: and instantly a Heaven of security opened
before her" (<I>TL</I>, 50-1). Similarly, Mrs. Swithin hopes for
the best and her brother expects the worst: "Every summer, for seven
summers now, Isa heard the same words; about . . . the pageant and the
weather" (<I>BA</I>, 22). The series of counterposed statements take the
very form of the time series: "The same chime followed the same chime'"
(<I>BA</I>, 22).

It both rains and does not rain in the course of <I>To the
Lighthouse</I>. Hence, both judgments--"It is raining" and "It is

judgments "will become true or false when there is a fact for them to
refer to; and after this they will remain true or false, as the case
may be, for ever and ever" (<I>NE</I>, 2:23). It rains in the story of
the Fisherman and his Wife that Mrs. Ramsay is reading James: "outside
a great storm was raging and blowing" (<I>TL</I>, 93). It rains in the
night of "Time Passes" that follows part one's day and it is fine on its
morrow. Once the "downpouring of immense darkness" begins, "[n]othing,
it seemed, could survive the flood" (<I>TL</I>, 189, 191). The two forms
of conditional arguments "If P then Q; but not-P; therefore not-Q" and
"If P then Q; but P; therefore Q" are thus both demonstrated in <I>To
the Lighthouse</I>: in part two, it is not fine, therefore they don't go
to the lighthouse; in part three, it is fine, therefore they go to the
lighthouse. Rain is the prognostication confirmed by the end of part one:
"he was thinking, we are not going to the Lighthouse tomorrow; and she
thought, he will remember that all his life" (<I>TL</I>, 95). "Would
they go to the Lighthouse tomorrow? No, not tomorrow, she said, but
soon, she promised him; the next fine day" (<I>TL</I>, 173). "'Yes, you
were right. It's going to be wet tomorrow. You won't be able to go'"
(<I>TL</I>, 186). The forecast that part two confirms is the contrary
of the one that part three confirms: "Then he reminded them that they
were going to the Lighthouse tomorrow"

<B></B>

(<I>TL</I>, 222). Statement and contradiction, thesis and antithesis,
are reflected in the very movement of the waves: "Yes, yes, yes,
the tide rushed out embracing. No, no, no, it contracted" (<I>BA</I>,
215). But there is no rejection of the laws of logic because there is no
"simultaneous assertion of contradictory propositions" (<I>ML</I>, 9);
it rains and does not rain, not simultaneously, but in time. "Every
year they said, would it be wet or fine; and every year it was--one
or the other" (<I>BA</I>, 22). "'And even if it isn't fine tomorrow,'
said Mrs. Ramsay . . . 'it will be another day'" (<I>TL</I>, 42). For
the weather is "variable" over time: "'The forecast,' said Mr. Oliver,
turning the pages till he found it, 'says: Variable winds; fair average
temperature; rain at times.'" Then "they all looked at the sky to see
whether the sky obeyed the meteorologist. Certainly the weather was
variable. It was green in the garden; grey the next. Here came the
sun. . . . Then in compassion it withdrew" (<I>BA</I>, 22-3).
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 In time variability--the shifting property incorporated by the
 deictics--congeals into one particular sequence, the one James "will
 remember . . . all his life" (<I>TL</I>, 95). The question asked of the
 clouds, "Was it their own law, or no law, they obeyed?" is that of the
 nature of scientific prediction and causation (<I>BA</I>, 23).

The contradictions of the novels' sentences are not left to stand,
then. The voice Lily Briscoe hears "saying without prompting undeniable,
everlasting, contradictory things" (<I>TL</I>, 40), like "[t]he
relationship between your grandfather and mother" that Woolf describes
to her nephew Julian Bell, "the flute voices of two birds in tune
. . . only reached by rich, rapid scales of discord, and incongruity"
(<I>MB</I>, 37), with "the mold of that queer conglomeration of
incongruous things--the modern mind" (<I>CE</I>, 2:226) in which things
are "incongruously coupled"--"they blend but do not mix" (<I>CE</I>,
2:223), is the sound of clocks striking. The contradictory judgments are
resolved by their translation into fixed time statements. A plurality of
propositions becomes only part of the whole truth of history. Because in
it time passes, Woolf's art then cannot be read as embracing Bradley's
logic, which, according to Russell, concludes that "all truth is
self-contradictory."

The storm clouds of both novels also threaten war. There is perhaps an
allusion to Aristotle's sea t and an evocation of the sinking of
the <I>Lusitania</I> in "the silent apparition of an ashen-coloured ship
. . . come, gone," in the "purplish stain upon the bland surface of the
sea as if something had boiled and bled, invisibly, beneath" (<I>TL</I>,
201). For it is not the history of the weather that led Woolf to grapple
with the problem of time. It is not the dampening of a picnic excursion
that the caesura marked by "Time Passes" means to memorialize; it is
not a solely rainy morrow that divides the text into an earlier and a
later, a before and an after. The deaths it contains sever past from
future. But Woolf makes Mrs. Ramsay's and Prue Ramsay's private deaths
join, via Andrew's death "in battle," the war dead. For "[a]ll had been
part of the fields of death" (<I>TL</I>, 270). "Time Passes" divides
the prewar period from the postwar epoch. In her review of <I>Night and
Day</I>, Katherine Mansfield had accused its "real world" of being "shut
and sealed from us to-day," of being "unaware of what has been happening."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 The reason Mansfield gave Middleton Murry for the novel's remoteness
 was that for it "'[t]he war never has been; that is what its message
 is.'" Mansfield felt, by contrast, "'that nothing can ever be the
 same--that, as artists, we are traitors if we feel otherwise: we have
 to take it into account and find new expressions, new moulds for our
 thoughts and feelings.'"

 that cataclysm.

That central event arguably made something like Russell's B-series concept
of time's passing the appropriate "mould" for the postwar generation's
"thoughts and feelings," its confrontation of both past and future. In
this light, perhaps the clearest vision of the future wrested from the
view of history as a series of irrevocable events is Keynes's <I>The
Economic Consequences of the Peace</I>. Just as the <I>Tractatus</I>
was written within a world that had irrevocably passed, that of the
Austro-Hungarian empire, so Keynes's work saw "Europe before the War,"
"this economic Eldorado . . . this economic Utopia," as definitively dead.

The famous opening of the book is a kind of elegy for its passing: "the
law of diminishing returns was at last reasserting itself" against the
belief in an inevitable progress (<I>EC</I>, 25). "What an extraordinary
episode in the economic progress of man that age was which came to an
end in August, 1914!" (<I>EC</I>, 11) The past was evoked in order to
discern in it a future that could only start from the acceptance of
what had come to an end. "The clock cannot be set back" (<I>EC</I>,
37). The means of foreseeing how the future might be was first sought
in the future unforeseen by those within that paradise now lost, the one
already past in August, 1914, without "[t]he inhabitant of London" still
"sipping his morning tea in

"Time Passes" (<I>EC</I>, 12). For

 Mr. Ramsay's dogmatic predictions for the morrow's wet weather aim
 for this granite-hard quality that Leonard Woolf attributes to the
 "Stephenesque." There was, he explains, "something marmoreal or lapidary
 about their way of expressing those opinions, reminding one of the Ten

Commandments engraved upon the tables of stone, even when they were only
telling you that in their opinion it would rain tomorrow."

 But the commandment--the negation of "it will be fine
 tomorrow"--seemingly enforced by "the arid scimitar of his father"
 (<I>TL</I>, 60), turns out to be only the law of the uniformity of
 nature to which the father too is subject, as powerless to alter as
 the mother. So also the war, a man-made phenomenon, is subject to laws
 that escape the law-making fathers who initiated it. They set in motion
 events without a concern for the future, as if the past could always be
 revoked or undone. The language of Woolf's account of Keynes's reaction
 to the Paris Peace Conference is marked by this sense of the partial
 determinism of events set in motion in time:

Tragedy is the literary expression of this view of time. The key text
is the Apostle F. L. Lucas's <I>Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's</I> Poetics, published by Virginia and Leonard Woolf in 1928.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 Tragedy, according to Lucas, yields physics' god-like omniscience of past
 and future, "If the gods alone, as the adage says, can be spectators
 in the world, the spectators in the world of the theatre should be for
 the nonce as gods,

<B></B>

knowing all or almost all," writes Lucas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Looking on the drama's future as Mrs. Ramsay looks back over the
 threshold, the spectators see it menacing the blind protagonists. "It
 is a mere accident that we have no memory of the future," Russell
 insists (<I>OK</I>, 238); it is simply "that natural human weakness
 which is unable to foresee the future," Lucas echoes (<I>TR</I>,
 97). "We might--as in the pretended visions of seers--see future
 events immediately in the way in which we see past events," Russell
 says. "They certainly will be what they will be, and are in this sense
 just as determined as the past" (<I>OK</I>, 238; also <I>ML</I>, 197).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "tragic" dimension arises in the difference, supplied by the
subjective element, between the A and B series, in what Whitehead calls
"[t]he contrast between the comparative emptiness of Presentational
Immediacy and the deep significance disclosed by Causal Efficacy," the
dissociation of moment and series, which he pronounces in Aristotelian
terms "at the root of the pathos which haunts the world": "'Pereunt et
imputantur' is the inscription on old sundials in 'religious' houses:
'The hours perish and are laid to account.' Here 'Pereunt' refers to the
world disclosed in immediate presentation, gay with a thousand tints,
passing, and intrinsically meaningless. 'Imputantur' refers to the world
disclosed in its causal efficacy . . . with its own individuality." The
one is the impressionist moment, "gay with a thousand tints"; the
other the B series, "where each event infects the ages to come, for
good or for evil." "Almost all pathos includes a reference to lapse
of time," Whitehead concludes (<I>S</I>, 47). This is the contrast
between the present and the inevitable sequence of moments constituting
the uniformity of nature, between the characters caught in the moment,
unable to see beyond it, and the fate that unfolds before our eyes. That
fate, in Whitehead's words, is a "primitive experience," one "heavy with
the contact of things gone by, which lay their grip on our immediate
selves," which gain "a sense for the fate from which they have emerged,
and for the fate towards which they go" (S, 43-4). For Whitehead,
"[t]ragedy becomes the order of nature in modern thought," the aesthetic
response to the confirmation by the crucial experiment of scientific
prediction--his example is an eclipse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In what way is the contrast also between the contingent and the
necessary? History is the realm of the contingent; what happens in it
could always have been otherwise and hence is not necessary. Yet, once
events occur, they cannot be reversed. Their historical character is
that of "an irreversible temporal sequence," Franco Moretti writes. It
"is dominated by the perception that there is no going back, which is
epitomized in the act of <I>dying</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>
 This irreversibility is precisely that necessity Aristotle assigns to
 the past. Once events happen, they cannot be otherwise. The element of
 chance or contingency is the mark of their empirical reality; their
 irreversibility gives them their necessary order. Tragedy is more
 philosophical than history by making apparent the necessary dimension
 in the actualization of a contingent possibility. Tragedy, Victor
 Goldschmidt writes, represents facts or deeds "that seem due to chance
 and that nevertheless . . . appear to be produced by necessity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 Its language is the past. "The past is indeed the most tragic of the
 tenses," Lucas writes

<B></B>

(we need only add that the tragic past is the nondeictic past). "If it
was happy, it is no more; if it was disastrous, it cannot be undone"
(<I>TR</I>, 80). "Yes, that was done then, accomplished; and as with
all things done, became solemn" (<I>TL</I>, 170).

The series of sequentially adopted shifting points of view from which
"[w]e can look backwards to past ages, or dimly divine the future"
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
 provide the positions <I>To the Lighthouse</I>'s characters occupy
 on the eve of "Time Passes": "'Well, we must wait for the future to
 show,' said Mr. Bankes, coming in from the terrace. 'It's almost too
 dark to see,' said Andrew, coming up from the beach. 'One can hardly
 tell which is the sea and which is the land,' said Prue" (<I>TL</I>,
 189). From within the moment, nothing beyond is visible, for the
 "enjoyment of immediate sense-data notoriously inhibits apprehension
 of the relevance of the future" (<I>S</I>, 42). "Tragic heroes are
 always conspicuously blind," Moretti writes (<I>STW</I>, 58). They
 are blind to the pattern that permits the outline of the future to
 be discovered in the past. But once "the lamps were all extinguished"
 and the subjects scrutinizing the night have shut their eyes in bed,
 the future, never directly apprehensible, becomes known, but only to
 the "eyeless." For the novel also recounts future events that unfold
 unbeknownst to those sleeping through the night of time, some of whom
 remain in the dark about the morrow. It contains the "series spread
 out and simultaneously viewable," in Geach's description, "successive
 approximations to the truth" (<I>ML</I>, 108) whose implacable logic
 reveals, with hindsight, from the tragic perspective, the future's
 inevitability--such is its narrative omniscience, one belonging to no
 one in the novel but rather shown by the text.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this way, the novel for Woolf gives the tragic perspective on time
seen from eternity, the one Augustus Carmichael, assuming the posture of
"an old pagan god" adopts at <I>To the Lighthouse</I>'s  conclusion
(<I>TL</I>, 309). In the tableau in which he and Lily Briscoe watch
Mr. Ramsay's tiny boat reach the lighthouse, poet and artist become
observers of a pageant, the "procession . . . past, present, future"
(<I>ND</I>, 447-8) translated into the B series, of a destiny whose
conclusion they can do nothing to alter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 In the novel, as in tragedy, "a terrible inevitability is gained by
 beginning, not at the very beginning, but just before the catastrophe,
 when the tragic mistakes have been made and are beyond God Himself to
 undo" (<I>TR</I>, 79). We recognize "the power to create the tense,
 overcharged atmosphere before the storm, to 'pile the dim outlines
 of the coming doom,' that forms no small part of the impressiveness
 of Aeschylus," according to Lucas (<I>TR</I>, 86). The backdrop of
 twilight, the fading of day, endows those caught in time with that
 "ethereal" quality that in "the failing light" the res on the lawn
 take (<I>TL</I>, 111). Within "this profound stillness" (<I>TL</I>,
 158), there is no time: "no tears, no sense that this sunny day is
 perhaps the last," as Woolf says of a Vanessa Bell painting.
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>
 Part one of <I>To the Lighthouse</I> shows us the characters with no
 sense of the tragedy that "Time Passes" will contain, no certainty that
 it <I>will</I> rain, while from the retrospect of part three Mr. Ramsay
 sails to the lighthouse as to his destiny. (Even a dramatic unity of
 place is observed, as in <I>Between the Acts</I>; the novel's unity
 of time only revises the classical drama's rules requiring two days,
 with the space of a night between.) And, as Russell's statements about
 events are in the past, so the novel's statements are characteristically
 in the past. "'He has landed,' she

<B></B>

[Lily] said aloud. 'It is finished'" (<I>TL</I>, 309). This <I>consummatum
est</I> pronounced, like that at the end of "The Death of the Moth,"
Mr. Carmichael, "shading his eyes with his hand" (<I>TL</I>, 309), looks
out to the sea over which the guns of August are earlier heard--"there
came later in the summer ominous sounds like the measured blows of
hammers" (<I>TL</I>, 200). He becomes one with the res of the mothers
of the world, like Mrs. Pascoe "shading her eyes and looking out to sea"
(<I>JR</I>, 53) or the "elderly woman" <I>Mrs Dalloway</I>'s "solitary
traveller" encounters, "coming to the door with shaded eyes, possibly to
look for his return, with hands raised, with white apron blowing" and
appearing "to seek, over a desert, a lost son; to search for a rider
destroyed; to be the re of the mother whose sons have been killed
in the battles of the world" (<I>MD</I>, 87).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The encounter takes place in a "village street where the women stand
knitting and the men dig in the garden, the evening seems ominous; the
res still; as if some august fate, known to them, awaited without
fear, were about to sweep them into complete annihilation" (<I>MD</I>,
87). Here Woolf "imagines some village, in a remote part of the country,
near the sea" that she says furnishes the background of Greek tragedy
and that, aside from the climate, "[is] to be found in the wilder parts
of England" (<I>CE</I>, 1:1). The maternal re, whether Mrs. Ramsay
or the grey nurse who "resumed her knitting" over Peter Walsh's nap that
triggers the solitary traveler episode is a Greek Fate (<I>MD</I>, 85). "I
see her knitting on the hall step while we play cricket," Woolf writes
of her mother; "she seemed to watch, like some wise Fate, the birth,
growth, flower and death of innumerable lives all round her" (<I>MB</I>,
84, 34). The vision Augustus Carmichael, whose name connects him to the
"august fate," has and Lily Briscoe has had by the novel's end is that of
"the spectators in the world of the theatre . . . as gods, knowing all
or almost all"; it is that of Mrs. Ramsay "return[ing]" in memory to

of that story, since it had happened twenty years ago, and life, which

Seen from eternity, the river of time crystallizes into a still series of
such momentary pools, yielding the tragic vision. It is articulated in
Augustus Carmichael's statement in the future perfect, "They will have
landed," indicative that neither Lily nor he can see the landing but
also that it is accomplished, achieving the perfection of the tragic
past--"he was surveying, tolerantly and compassionately, their final
destiny" (<I>TL</I>, 309). With the future perfect, the incompleteness of
the novel's title is completed, the event already takes its place with
the past in the theory of Cambridge changes: "The sights we see and the
sounds we hear have none of the quality of the past; nor have we any share
in the serenity of the person who, six months ago, stood precisely where

<B></B>

we stand now. It is only when we look at the past and take from it the
element of uncertainty that we can enjoy perfect peace" (<I>CE</I>,
4:164). Mr. Carmichael achieves such certainty, "surveying . . . their
final destiny" as the novel closes, with "the trident (it was only a
French novel)," with its series of preterites, "in his hand," by this
substitution of the god's symbol, desacralizing their history, for what
could be more secular than a French novel (<I>TL</I>, 309)?

"Instead of manipulating reality so as to conform to the libido," Fry
says, the novels that have endured "note the inexorable sequence in life
of cause and effect, they mark the total indifference of fate to all human

of fate an altogether different kind of pleasure--the pleasure which

 As <I>Tractatus</I> 6.374 comments on 6.373, "Even if everything
 we wished were to happen, this would only be, so to speak, a favour
 of fate, for there is no <I>logical</I> connexion between will and
 world." Fry's enduring novels accomplish what we recognize as "the task
 of tragedy," which Russell says, in "The Study of Mathematics," is "[t]o
 reconcile us, by the exhibition of its awful beauty, to the reign of
 Fate--which is merely the literary personification" of "alien forces"
 (<I>ML</I>, 65). They capture the property of the "great torrent" of
 life--"its complete indifference to the individuals, whom it swallowed
 up and rolled onwards" that fills Katharine Hilbery "with at least
 a temporary exaltation" (<I>ND</I>, 439). "So people stop short at
 natural laws as at something unassailable," Wittgenstein writes,
 "as did the ancients at God and Fate." "And they both are right and
 wrong," he goes on. "But the ancients were clearer, in so far as they
 recognized one clear conclusion, whereas in the modern system it should
 appear as though <I>everything</I> were explained" (<I>Tractatus</I>
 6.372). So Whitehead links the Greeks' "vision of fate, remorseless
 and indifferent," to "the vision possessed by science."

The stark stillness of a time with a relational, nondirectional, spatial
geometry imparts to Woolf's novels their "almost Greek severity of
form" (<I>TR</I>, 76). This "Greek" aesthetic underlies the Bloomsbury
modernism that was worked out first in the visual arts under the name of
"Post-Impressionism." It is not far-fetched to call the latter "Greek"
as a particular case of the "Mediterranean." Quentin Bell writes that
"C&eacute;zanne . . . signalled a new interest . . . in what [Duncan
Grant] would have called 'Southern' art," which, according to Bell, is
"tied to architecture." This connected it to geometry--C&eacute;zanne
"assumed the existence of and still needs a cubic and rectilinear
environment with vertical walls and horizontal floors."
<SUP><a NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">88</a></SUP>
 Its geometry was inspired by what Russell called the "sharp outlines
 and definite separations such as the landscapes of Greece afford" that
 "[l]ike the philosophers of ancient Greece, I prefer."
<SUP><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></SUP>
 Its was "the beauty of form," of "Mediterranean harmony"
<SUP><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></SUP>
 like Mrs. Ramsay's beauty, "very clearly Greek, straight" (<I>TL</I>,
 47). Impressionism, by contrast, was a "Northern" art, born of the
 atmospheric "muddle" of that climate--English "light," Fry claimed,
 "was full of vapour. Nothing was clear."
<SUP><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></SUP>
 Northern art "grew up amidst coloured windows and darkened interiors,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></SUP>
 Bell says, although Woolf's contrast between the Greek "out-of-doors
 manner" and the "introspective melancholy of people accustomed to live
 more than half the year indoors" makes the <I>plein air</I>

<B></B>

school half a Southern one (<I>CE</I>, 1:2). Russell's mathematical world
of being is Greek; his "fleeting, vague" world of existence, Northern
(<I>PP</I>, 100). The point, for Russell as for Fry, was to combine
the two schools. So, to imagine Sophocles in the English village, Woolf
says that "we must annihilate the smoke and the damp and the thick wet
mists. We must sharpen the lines of the hills" (<I>CE</I>, 1:2).
<SUP><a NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">93</a></SUP>
 We must substitute for English unpredictable weather the relentless sun
 of the South and become not just empirical but as "logical as the sun."
<SUP><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></SUP>
 We could hear in Woolf an assent to Leslie Stephen's statement that
 "[t]he strong point of the English mind is its vigorous grasp of facts;
 its weakness is its comparative indifference to logical symmetry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></SUP>
 Her espousal of Fry's aesthetic aspired to a grander architecture than
 that enclosed by the house of "The Window," one containing both window
 and lighthouse with the vast and vaulted spaces of "Time Passes" in
 between, an architecture based, like the Parthenon, on "a network of
 strokes" or "a mathematical diagram" (<I>JR</I>, 169). Yet, if the
 geometry of the novel forms, like the "strokes" of Lily's painting,
 a temporal, "rhythmical movement," it is nonetheless struck into the
 static conration of time as space Bergson finds so objectionable
 (<I>TL</I>, 236). The "whole series of uncomplimentary epithets" by
 which, according to Russell, Bergson "condemns"--as "static, Platonic,
 mathematical, logical, intellectual" (<I>HWP</I>, 810)--the position
 Russell defends could thus be summarized as "Greek," understood as
 non-Heraclitian. Bergson's is "the revolt of the modern man of action
 against the authority of Greece, and more particularly of Plato,"
 Russell writes (<I>HWP</I>, 792).
<SUP><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></SUP>
 A formally static and nominally "timeless" universe--"the stable,
 the permanent" are Woolf's adjectives for the Greeks (<I>CE</I>,

 Forster's--Fry would find in C&eacute;zanne's Proven&ccedil;al geometry
 and Poussin's classicism.

A hasty assumption might pronounce acquiescence to time as fate a form
of quietism, the refusal of engagement and action. Yet Russell, for one,
never exempted himself from involvement in politics. The context in which
he speaks of reconciliation to the "reign" of fate puts forward a more
complex relation between acquiescence and action. "The contemplation of
what is non-human," Russell writes,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the discovery that our minds are capable of dealing with material not
created by them, above all, the realisation that beauty belongs to
the outer world as to the inner, are the chief means of overcoming the
terrible sense of impotence, of weakness, of exile amid hostile powers,
which is too apt to result from acknowledging the all-but omnipotence
of alien forces [<I>ML</I>, 65].

It is the "task of tragedy," Russell says, "[t]o reconcile us" to the
all-but-omnipotence of this "reign of Fate." Tragedy thus becomes the
literary expression of the study of mathematics, the intellectual pursuit
that permits Russell to find the point where the universal quantifier
ceases to apply to the power we confront. The question of freedom is
raised from the very perspective of necessity. For, Russell goes on,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
mathematics takes us still further from what is human, into the region
of absolute necessity, to which not only the actual world, but every
possible world, must conform;

<B></B>

 and even here it builds a habitation, or rather finds a habitation
 eternally standing, where our ideals are fully satisfied and our best
 hopes not thwarted. It is only when we thoroughly understand the entire
 independence of ourselves, which belongs to this world that reason
 finds, that we can adequately realise the profound importance of its
 beauty [<I>ML</I>, 65].

Mathematics yields not only the vision in which future becomes past. In
revealing the limits imposed by the world of universals, it also defines
the realm of possibility that allows the future to be affected by the
past. Russell, it is worth recalling, was in prison for "statements
likely to prejudice the recruiting and discipline of His Majesty's forces"
<SUP><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></SUP>
 during the war when he wrote that "Pure logic, and pure mathematics
 . . . aims at being true, in Leibnizian phraseology, in all possible
 worlds, not only in this higgledy-piggledy job-lot of a world in which
 chance has imprisoned us" and invoked "a certain lordliness which the
 logician should preserve."
<SUP><a NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">99</a></SUP>
 Circumstances had forced upon him a position outside the struggle in
 which he had been engaged and from which he could see at once the course
 of events and the limited extent of his power to stop them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Freedom lies in this position's dualism, what Russell describes as
"the independence" of ourselves and the world of mathematics. "Not
only is mathematics independent of us and our thoughts, but in another
sense we and the whole universe of existing things are independent of
mathematics" (<I>ML</I>, 65). Dualism also means the incessant return
to "daily life" from this position outside time (<I>ML</I>, 18). This
is the character of Bloomsbury's modernity. Woolf had always given
a special, positive value to the term "modern"--unlike T. S. Eliot,
for instance. Our exposition shows that modernity for Woolf was the
"correlation" of the present moment--contemporaneity--and a vision of
history in which all time is ultimately past. The dualism inherent in it
defines a critical difference between Bergsonian futurism and Russell's
Greek time. For Bergson's dualism is the prelude to the rejection
of one side. Such is "the philosophy which has become associated
with . . . evolution . . . exemplified by Nietzsche, pragmatism, and
Bergson," Russell writes. He rejects it, thinking "time ought not to
enter into our theoretical philosophical thought," whereas the idea of
"<I>progress</I> . . . admits the difference between <I>earlier</I> and
<I>later</I> into the very citadel of its contemplative outlook." "[T]o
see the world truly" one must "overcome the difference of attitude towards
past and future." "Something of Hellenism . . . must be combined with
its [Bergsonism's] hurrying Western self-assertion" (<I>ML</I>, 21,
emphasis in original). The distance from one side to the other of the
dualism creates the position from which the actual moment we occupy can
be criticized. The "lordly" position Russell counseled could thus be
seen as the logical conclusion of the politics that had propelled him
to oppose the war; rather than plunge headlong into its prosecution,
as had Whitehead, who was influenced by Bergson and Gilbert Murray, his
opposition to it required a critical distance. The god-like perspective
from which all events appear as past is one that crucially permits this
distance from the realm of action, one that makes it possible to seize
what might be its consequences. "A reciprocal

<B></B>

liberty must thus be accorded: reason cannot dictate to the world of
facts, but the facts cannot restrict reason's privilege of dealing
with whatever objects its love of beauty may cause to seem worthy of
consideration" (<I>ML</I>, 66).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Cambridge theory of time takes its place in a larger history
of time-thinking. Russell's "idealist apprenticeship" connects this
thinking, perhaps surprisingly, with Hegelianism, while at the same time
separating itself quite explicitly from the latter. It was Hegelian in
that it conceived of history in terms of breaks; it was a revolutionary
theory of history, in that sense. Hegelian time-thinking's aesthetic also
accords a privileged status to tragedy. Its conception of tragedy has its
origins with the Greeks, but it has been altered to make it the expression
of modernity. The pre-Bergsonian Gy&ouml;rgy Luk&aacute;cs's 1910 essay
"The Metaphysics of Tragedy" shows the elements of the time theory
that shape Woolf's novels. "A drama is a play about man and his fate,"
Luk&aacute;cs begins his essay, "a play in which God is the spectator."
<SUP><a NAME="REF100" HREF="#FOOT100">100</a></SUP>
 In the modern tragic world, "God must leave the stage, but must yet
 remain a spectator" ("MT," 154). The Greek ideas of "fate" and "destiny"
 are refashioned to permit another concept of human essence than the
 one that currently res in the term "essentialism," an essence that
 requires time, for a destiny can only "unfold" ("MT," 164). It is a
 revolutionary time, when, as Luk&aacute;cs says, "everything changes in
 a flash, everything suddenly becomes essential when the fateful word
 is spoken at last," "when enigmatic forces have distilled the essence
 from a man, have forced him to become essential," "his essential, true
 nature becoming more and more manifest" ("MT," 159, 155). It is "at the
 point" where "the miracle of accident has raised a man and his life,"
 Luk&aacute;cs writes, that "tragedy begins" ("MT," 155). What it raises
 him to is the realm of necessity. In thus passing from the "now" to the
 irrevocable series, tragedy "incorporate[s] accident into its world
 forever" ("MT," 155). The flash, the unforeseen change, hardens into
 what can never be otherwise. "This sense of necessity is not the result
 of the inescapable workings of causality," however ("MT," 157). It is
 omnitemporal necessity, governed by the law of the uniformity of nature:
 "Tragic drama has to express the becoming-timeless of time" ("MT," 158).

Lucien Goldmann's Luk&aacute;cs-inspired notion of "the tragic vision"
in his study of Jansenism and its perhaps surprising linkage of Pascal
and Racine to Hegel, Marx, Luk&aacute;cs--"all tragic and dialectical
authors"--demonstrates that "quietism," the withdrawal from the world
of action, can at certain moments in history be a revolutionary act.
<SUP><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></SUP>
 The appearance of Goldmann's book in 1955 as one of the early signs of
 the "new criticism" in France can be linked not just to Barthes's book
 on Racine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF102" HREF="#FOOT102">102</a></SUP>
 Goldmann's "tragic vision" is not limited by him to the classical
 tragedy. So, when Barthes in <I>Writing Degree Zero</I>  says of
 the situation of the bourgeois writer post-June, 1848, "Thus is born a
 tragic predicament peculiar to Literature," the word "tragic" betrays
 a wider debate (<I>WDZ</I>, 60). Here it refers most particularly if
 not exclusively to the novel--earlier Barthes had predicated the word
 "tragic" on the novel's style, which he defines partly in terms of
 the preterite, i.e. the historical past tense, which he labels "one
 of the most obsessive signs of this tragic aspect of writing which was
 born in the last century" (<I>WDZ</I>, 38). It is a "fateful gesture"
 (<I>WDZ</I>, 40).

<B></B>

In the writing of history and of the novel, which share this tense,
"the preterite is the very act by which society affirms its possession of
its past and its possibility," part of a style adopted "in proportion as
existence becomes fate" (<I>WDZ</I>, 33, 36). Finally, Flaubert's sense
that "the bourgeois state is an incurable ill which sticks to the writer"
Barthes finds "the essence of tragic feeling" (<I>WDZ</I>, 64). In the
literary history he traces, "the purest" among writers "return" to the
"'Flaubertization' of writing" "as to an acknowledgement of their fate"
(<I>WDZ</I>, 66). As a response to Sartre's voluntarism, Barthes finds a
"necessity" in writing as well as a "freedom" (<I>WDZ</I>, 87). Writing
must acknowledge and acquiesce before what is the case, in the process
discovering what Luk&aacute;cs calls "the historical possibility of
tragic epochs" ("MT," 154).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The thesis implicit in these pronouncements is that the modernist novel
inaugurated by Flaubert is structured by the "tragic vision" in its
very language. Now this thesis has an alternative, the one set forth by
Franco Moretti in <I>Signs Taken for Wonders</I>. Moretti inherits the
very tradition Barthes does; they only differ on the novel's inclusion
in it, which could be a factor in Moretti's making <I>Ulysses</I> the
paradigmatic modern novel. Without denying it that role, one could observe
of it what Katherine Mansfield said of Woolf's <I>Night and Day</I>,
that for it "'The war never has been.'" Perhaps the explanation lies with
Joyce's Irish nationality and with his having spent the greater part of
the war in neutral Switzerland. What Moretti writes of Luk&aacute;cs--that
"between 1910 and 1920" "[f]orm coagulates into a cruel a priori--extreme,
tragic, opposed to life"--could also be said of <I>To the Lighthouse</I>
(<I>STW</I>, 11, 12). The opposition between life and form worked out
in Lily Briscoe's painting is a response then to a succession of events
a generation was powerless to prevent and even more powerless to reverse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If an important strain of British modernism saw the consequences of
the Great War with something like the vision of Greek tragedy, it was
not just to reconcile itself to these consequences. It was also to
understand the future via this terrible past. The strikingly similar
role of prognostications about the morrow's weather in both <I>To the
Lighthouse</I> and <I>Between the Acts</I>, one a postwar retrospective,
the other written on the eve of another war, yet both written in the
past tense, reveals the significance of the refusal to admit "the
difference between <I>earlier</I> and <I>later</I>." Yet the future
is placed differently in the two novels. The war divides past and
future in the first. The future the matchmaking Mrs. Ramsay attempts
to predict and affect does not turn out as planned: the marriage she
makes ends in divorce in the postwar world. She does not foresee her
own nor her children's deaths. But she in some sense divines even
those unforeseen events, achieving the calm acceptance of what "will
be" as if it had already achieved the perfection of the past expressed
by Augustus Carmichael's future perfect. But <I>Between the Acts</I>
ends with the characters in the position of those on the eve of "Time
Passes," confronting the war that was one of the "consequences of the
peace" Keynes had foreseen, gazing once more out the window at what
"was too dark to see" (<I>BS</I>, 214), going over the past to discern
the future, recording that day's "weather, which was perfect, save for
one shower" and recalling "'last year it rained.'" "'This year, last
year, next year, never . . .'" Ida repeats

<B></B>

(<I>BA</I>, 214, 217). The novel ends with a sequence of statements in
the historical past, e.g., "The paper crackled. The second hand jerked
on. M. Daladier had pegged down the franc. . . . The clock ticked"
(<I>BA</I>, 216-7). Meanwhile, "[t]he darkness increased" as
Mrs. Swithin reads her Outline of History: "'England,' she was reading,
'was then a swamp. Thick forests covered the land. . . .'" Once again,
the window gives on time passing. But "[t]he great square of the open
window showed only sky now. It was drained of light, stone cold. Shadows
fell" (<I>BA</I>, 218). The future in the fading light, just before the
curtain on the last act is raised, has become indistinguishable in its
darkness from the unobserved past: "It was night before roads were made,
or houses" (<I>BA</I>, 219). Nonetheless, against its uncertainty the
novel moves to seize the relentless pageant of English history precisely
in order not to give in to the feeling of impotence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here the contrast with the Futurist and Vorticist celebration of a blind
thrust forward could not be greater. There is much yet to be said about
the difference between the historical thinking we are qualifying as
tragic and Bergsonism, so often connected to modernism and also taken
over by various fascist ideologies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></SUP>
 But one thing is clear. Conceiving of time as a series of fixed events
 operating with a kind of fateful necessity, determining which future
 events are possible and which are impossible, is in no way incompatible
 with the attempt to change their course. Luk&aacute;cs's "gods of
 reality, of history," flattened to the force of events, "want not
 only to be the spectators of the fulfillment of revelation, but also
 to direct and accomplish that fulfillment. Their hands tug wilfully
 at the enigmatic yet obvious tangle of the threads of fate" ("MT,"
 154). For the sequence of events is marked by "something dangerous":
 "the great moment, the miracle," as Woolf puts it, the chance permitting
 its direction not to be reversed but to be altered. That cannot be
 accomplished by moving with the times in a celebration of progress--what
 is ultimately more acquiescent than that? It cannot be accomplished by
 erecting the meaningless, bare sequence into a story, a fiction--"we
 may again hope for the coming of tragedy," Luk&aacute;cs writes, only
 "once all the dancing shadows of a friendly order, which our cowardly
 dreams have cast upon nature to allow us a false sense of security,
 have entirely disappeared" ("MT," 154). It is precisely one of those
 accidents of history in which tragedy erupts--the "intrusion into a
 scene calculated to stir the most sublime reflections and lead to the
 most comfortable conclusions" of the "ashen-coloured ship"--that in
 "Time Passes" made it impossible "to continue . . . to marvel how beauty
 outside mirrored beauty within" (<I>TL</I>, 201). Instead, "the mirror
 was broken"; the illusion was shattered. In the interval, Mr. Carmichael
 brought out his volume of war poetry.

There has been a considerable literature on this debate since World

clear the problem was being debated; see Bergson, <I>M&eacute;langes</I>

In <I>The Problems of Philosophy</I> (1912; London: Oxford University

"correspondence" of "the <I>relations</I> of physical objects" with
"the relations of sense data." Later he uses the term "correlation"
both for "the transition from perception to physics" (<I>The Analysis
of Matter</I> [1927; New York: Dover, 1954], 333). See also Bertrand
Russell, <I>Mysticism and Logic</I> (1917; Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday,

of different private times" and of the private being "correlated" with
the physical, both in time and space.

"I believe Hebrew and Chinese are preferable in this respect, but

Williams makes an argument similar to ours for the "historical present,"

Even among critics exploring the political stakes of Anglo-American
literary modernism--or, more narrowly, of Virginia Woolf's literary
production--Woolf's 1931 novel, <I>The Waves</I>, has been read
persistently as a highly aesthetic (and therefore apolitical) experiment
in the representation of consciousness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
The much commented upon experimental nature of the text is, of course,
evident from its opening pages: the disembodied narrative voice of
the first italicized interlude, with its abstract and highly ral
description of an unlocatable landscape, gives way in the first chapter
to the cacophony of the personalized yet significantly indistinguishable
voices that emanate from within the unstable circumferences of individual
characters--or, perhaps more accurately, are attached to proper names
that designate different but overlapping spaces of enunciation. Yet
even as we immediately are confronted by the formal properties that
arguably constitute the apogee of Woolf's narrative innovation, the
opening interlude introduces a ral trajectory that draws us beyond
the purview of the aesthetic, narrowly conceived. Describing a seascape
at dawn, Wolff posits an original state of relative undifferentiation,
in which "the sea was indistinguishable from the sky, except that the
sea was slightly creased as if a cloth had wrinkles on it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 The sun rises and sunders this undifferentiated state; "the air," we are
 told, "seemed to become <I>fibrous</I> and to tear away from the green
 surface flickering and flaming in red and yellow <I>fibres</I> like the
 smoky fire that roars from a bonfire" (<I>W</I>, 3; my emphasis). This
 state of fibrous differentiation is, however, only momentary, for we
 immediately read that "gradually the fibres of the burning



bonfire were fused into one haze, one incandescence." This unity
is itself quickly qualified by the statement that this incandescence
"lifted the weight of the woolen grey sky on top of it and turned it to
a million atoms of soft blue" (<I>W</I>, 3). The opening interlude thus
frames the novel by drawing our attention to a conceptual movement from
undifferentiation to individualization to a renewed form of wholeness or
collectivity that is understood as a state of fusion that paradoxically
maintains or supports a constellation of discrete atoms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is, broadly speaking, this trajectory that Michael Tratner takes
up in the chapter of <I>Modernism and Mass Politics</I> devoted to
<I>The Waves</I>. Arguing the need to resituate British literary high
modernism in the context of a variety of collectivist projects that were
widely influential in the early part of the twentieth century, Tratner
understands the text as an exploration of a politically Left collectivism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Tratner turns primarily to the group psychology of Gustave Le Bon,
 Sigmund Freud, and William McDougall as the historical frame within which
 to approach the tension between individualism and collectivism in Woolf's
 text. I, however, shall contend that the text identifies a different
 terrain upon which to explore structures of collectivity. Though Woolf
 is undeniably interested in questions of psychology, I shall argue
 that she elaborates her understanding of collectivity or community
 not preeminently in terms of the mind, whether of the group or the
 individual, but rather that she turns instead to the bodily categories
 provided by neuroscientific discourse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 To that end, it will be crucial to interrogate the text's preoccupation
 with what it describes as "the raw, the white, the unprotected fibre"
 of the human nervous system and to explore the various registers in
 which this re functions (<I>W</I>, 178). As we have noted, the
 text's opening page inaugurates this re in a nonphysiological mode
 through the repeated description of the process of differentiation
 as one of increasing fibrosis. I will pursue the trajectory suggested
 by this initial interlude in arguing that the text quickly redeploys
 this naturalistic metaphor and takes a different sort of fibre, that
 constituting the human nervous system, as the context within which to
 explore a movement from differentiation to fusion, from individualization
 to the fashioning of collectivity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This situation of the human body as the term around which forces of
individualization and structures of collectivity circulate constitutes
three problematics--historical, literary critical, and theoretical. In
an historical frame, attention to the relationship between Woolf's
text and neuroscientific discourse provides a means of exploring the
interanimation of literary modernism and other, contemporaneous forms
of cultural production. Without discounting the linguistic and formal
experimentation that is a defining characteristic of modernist literature,
and of which <I>The Waves</I> is a key example, my analytic approach
draws attention to both literary and medical/scientific language's
particular material history. Given that language simultaneously operates
in different cultural domains whose borders are relatively permeable,
attention to specific signifying clusters (in this case, those associated
with the fibres of the human nervous system) will allow me to examine the
processes through which communitarian cultural formations are produced in
the interactions of discursive domains of literature and medical science.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 To the extent that instances of linguistic contamination or

<B></B>

cultural proximity are insufficient to establish relations of strict
and unidirectional historical causality, my approach seeks neither to
identify a determining historical context for Woolf's literary corpus
nor to adduce its sociological or historical conditions of possibility
or intelligibility. This is not to say, however, that I seek simply
to demonstrate the radically transformative effects of her literary
practice upon other forms of cultural practice. Rather, I will approach
the transactions marked by the traces of linguistic contamination
as indicating a space in which different cultural regimes come into
contact in a variety of ways. This attention to what I have called the
material history of Woolf's language provides a means of addressing
the sociohistorical relations in which her language is embedded and
of grasping those relations as more than a narrowly determining set
of conditions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Interrogating Woolf's nervous tropology in relation to contemporaneous
neuroscience extends and complicates, in literary critical terms, the
sort of historicist analysis practised, for example, by Tratner. Whereas
his reading convincingly draws out thematic continuities between the
novel and the work of various theorists of collectivity, including Harold
Laski, Leonard Woolf, and R. H. Tawney, attention to the text's engagement
of neuroscience makes <I>The Waves</I> legible as more than a literary
presentation of social problems that simultaneously find articulation
in other modes of intellectual work. Gillian Beer has argued that Woolf
"was fascinated by communities" and that "the deep value which she accords
to communality . . . has to do with her practice of writing out of the
mass and out of the body."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 My contention is that by conceiving of community through the bodily
 categories of neuroscience, Woolf theorizes not only possible forms of
 collectivity but also the mechanisms through which communitarian projects
 of the early twentieth century literally incorporate themselves. The body
 becomes, in this context, more than merely a re either for society
 or for those affective elements of experience that are markers of the
 intensely individual. In addition to its resonance in these ral
 registers, the body must be considered rather more literally, as it
 is constituted as the object of inquiry by a variety of increasingly
 prestigious bioscientific disciplines. By raising the question of the
 social body in this way, Woolf's text insists that we approach bioscience
 as a particularly powerful means of accessing and comprehending the
 individual bodies that communitarian projects inevitably seek to grasp as
 their objects. To the extent that <I>The Waves</I> asks us to consider
 how historically extant structures of collectivity are incorporated
 in their bioscientific grasp of individual bodies, it simultaneously
 demands that we theorize the communitarian implications of a body that
 resolutely refuses to be assimilated by the language and procedures
 of bioscience. In exploring this affective body, a body that opens up
 and exposes the interiorized, subjective space of the neuroscientific
 body, I attempt to re-mark the limit at which an ethical, communitarian
 impulse announces itself.

"Bright Arrows of Sensation" and the Habituated Body
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the opening interlude of <I>The Waves</I> frames the text's overarching
trajectory when it describes a movement from brute undifferentiation
to individualization to a renewed state of indifference in fusion,
the opening chapter takes up the first phase of that movement in a
psychological register. Commencing with a series of short declarative
sentences conveying basic sense-data--"I see a ring," "I see a slab
of yellow," "I hear a sound" (<I>W</I>, 5)--the text introduces the
characters as young children whose phenomenological existence initially
is limited to rudimentary sense perception. Still within the confines of
its first page, the chapter quickly represents a move from sensation to
cognition, and the short declarations are supplanted by comparisons: "The
leaves are gathered round the window like pointed ears," Susan tells us,
and Louis chimes in with the observation that "A shadow falls on the path
. . . like an elbow bent" (<I>W</I>, 5). This progressive differentiation
of perceptual objects leads in turn to some measure of differential
identification on the part of the speaking subjects themselves, and by the
third page Louis defines himself in relation to the presence or absence
of others, suddenly realizing that, "Now they have all gone . . . I
am alone" (<I>W</I>, 7). The text's opening pages, in short, present
an extremely compressed developmental schema that takes the characters
from a stage of barely developed perceptual consciousness to a level of
significant cognitive ability and individualization. If the language of
the first chapter mimetically parades the characters through a process of
psychological development, the chapter concludes with a scene so crucial
that it will have been revisited four times by the end of the novel. This
scene thematizes the inevitable procession towards individuality and
recounts the moment at which the characters "troop upstairs like ponies
. . . stamping, clattering one behind another to take [their] turns
in the bathroom" where Mrs. Constable awaits, "girt in a bath-towel"
and brandishing her water-soaked, "lemon-coloured sponge" (<I>W</I>,
19). Submitted in his turn to this embodiment of the Law, Bernard
tells us that, "holding [the sponge] high above me, shivering beneath
her, she squeezes it. Water pours down the runnel of my spine. Bright
arrows of sensation shoot on either side. I am covered with warm flesh"
(<I>W</I>, 19). In interesting contrast to post-Freudian models, Woolf
understands the processes leading to individualization not primarily in
visual or linguistic terms but in terms of the physiological mechanisms
that produce the "bright arrows of sensation." Her interrogation of
individualism, that is, takes place in close proximity to the corporeal
model articulated by turn-of-the-century neuroscience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To indicate briefly the salient features of this model, I refer primarily
to the widespread reductionist impulse evident in the psychology of
the period. Technological developments that allowed the bioscientist
to decompose the body into ever more minute constituent components
and to establish the chemical and mechanical relations between these
components frequently resulted in the assumption that questions of the
mind could be answered through appropriately scientific attention to
the body. Programmatically encapsulating this orthodoxy, for example,
Henry Maudsley's <I>Body</I> 

<B></B>

<I>and Mind</I> demands, "Surely it is time, we put seriously to ourselves
the question whether the inductive method, which has proved its worth
by its abundant fruitfulness wherever it has been faithfully applied,
should not be as rigidly used in the investigation of mind as in the
investigation of other natural phenomena." Indeed, shifting from the
interrogative to the declarative, he asserts that "To begin the study
of mind with the observation of its humblest bodily manifestations is
a strictly scientific method."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 This drive to apply the principles of physical science to the
 psychological realm is manifest, moreover, in the work of res
 as diverse and influential as Sigmund Freud and William James. Freud
 opens his prepsychoanalytic <I>Project for a Scientific Psychology</I>
 with the avowal that it is his "intention to furnish a psychology that
 shall be a natural science: that is, to represent psychical processes
 as quantitatively determinate states of specifiable material particles,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 and James introduces <I>The Principles of Psychology</I> with the dual
 claims that "a certain amount of brain-physiology must be presupposed
 or included in Psychology," and that the "psychologist is forced to be
 something of a nerve-physiologist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The model of the nervous system made available by neurology and
neurophysiology is that of a series of relays conducting impulses from
the bodily periphery to the center and then to the periphery again,
with the central nervous system functioning as a switching station
between sensation and motivity. Afferent nerves are understood to
carry sensory excitation to the central nervous system, which then
discharges the quantum of nervous energy to the periphery in the form
of motor activity. Most contentious in this schema was the role of the
central nervous system in determining by which path, among a multitude of
possibilities, any given nervous impulse would be discharged. Suspicious
of appeals to volitional categories in the explanation of this
decision-making process, and in many cases attempting to account
for supposed acts of will in physiological terms, neuroscientific
models turned instead to the physical characteristics of the nervous
system. Fairly representative in this respect is James's description of
the "plasticity" of nerve tissue and the notion of habit that becomes
its predicate:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
<I>Plasticity</I> means the possession of a structure weak enough to
yield to an influence, but strong enough not to yield all at once. Each
relatively stable phase of equilibrium in such a structure is marked by
what we may call a new set of habits. Organic matter, especially nervous
tissue, seems endowed with a very extraordinary degree of plasticity
of this sort; so that we may without hesitation lay down as our first
proposition the following, that <I>the phenomena of habit in living beings
are due to the plasticity of the organic materials of which their bodies
are composed</I> [<I>PP</I>, 110, emphasis in original].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Insisting that "the philosophy of habit is . . . in the first instance, a
chapter in physics," and that habit is "at bottom a physical principle,"
James suggests that the nervous system is physically altered by the
nervous energy it transmits (<I>PP</I>, 110). Once a given type of
afferent impulse is discharged via a specific motor pathway, the system
is altered such that subsequent impulses of that type will be more likely
to be discharged in the same way. Repeated patterns of transmission and
discharge literally

<B></B>

"leave organic impression[s]" on the fibres of the nervous system, and
James goes so far as to suggest that, "it is not simply <I>particular
lines</I> of discharge, but also <I>general forms</I> of discharge,
that seem to be grooved out by habit in the brain" (<I>PP</I>, 116,
130, emphasis in original). Beyond emphasizing the deterministic
implications of this model, according to which patterns of behavior
are physically scored into the nervous system, it is worth noting that
James is also fairly representative in the conclusions to which his
psycho-physiological model leads. In his account, the "physiological
study of mental conditions is . . . the most powerful ally of hortatory
ethics." "The hell to be endured hereafter, of which theology tells," he
warns, "is no worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this world by
habitually fashioning our characters in the wrong way. Could the young
but realize how soon they will become mere walking bundles of habits,
they would give more heed to their conduct while in the plastic state. We
are spinning our own fates, good or evil, and never to be undone. Every
smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its never so little scar"
(<I>PP</I>, 130-1). Habit is, for James,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the enormous fly-wheel of society, its most precious conservative
agent. It alone is what keeps us all within the bounds of ordinance, and
saves the children of fortune from the envious uprisings of the poor. It
alone prevents the hardest and most repulsive walks of life from being
deserted by those brought up to tread therein. It keeps the fisherman
and the deck-hand at sea through the winter; it holds the miner in his
darkness, and nails the countryman to his cabin and his lonely farm
through all the months of snow; it protects us from invasion by the
natives of the desert and frozen zone. It dooms us all to t out the
battle of life upon the lines of our nurture or our early choice, and
to make the best of a pursuit that disagrees, because there is no other
for which we are fitted, and it is too late to begin again. It keeps
different social strata from mixing [<I>PP</I>, 125].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The model of the nervous system exemplified by James's psychology, thus,
has dual implications. In the first instance it provides a physiological
ground for the formation of moral character and the production of
individual subjects. In the second instance, it differentiates individuals
from one another through the maintenance of a rigid social structure
that extends from the narrowly communal to the global. The nerves and
the forms of habit they facilitate provide the key to understanding both
the mechanical formation and functioning of individual subjects and the
ways in which such individuals are integrated as distinct constitutive
components into the machinery of larger-scale social bodies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is precisely these twofold ramifications of the neuroscientific body
that <I>The Waves</I> interrogates. For if Bernard's individualizing
encounter with Mrs. Constable is initially represented as the source
of a vaguely pleasurable ambivalence, as the narrative proceeds, its
rememoration and rearticulation increasingly cast it in a different
light. By Bernard's summation in the final chapter, he revisits that
event and its myriad subsequent analogues and is led to conclude that
"Sometimes indeed, when I pass a cottage with a light in the window
where a child has been born, I could implore them not to squeeze the
sponge over that new body" (<I>W</I>, 200). This desire to protect the

<B></B>

infant is indicative of Woolf's analysis of the bodily regime in
which Mrs. Constable's sponge is only the first step. The end of the
process inaugurated by Mrs. Constable, in contrast, is articulated
by Neville. "Change is no longer possible," he laments, "We are
committed. Before, when we met in a restaurant in London with Percival,
all simmered and shook; we could have been anything. We have chosen
now, or sometimes it seems the choice was made for us--a pair of tongs
pinched us between the shoulders. I chose. I took the print of life not
outwardly, but inwardly upon the raw, the white, the unprotected fibre"
(<I>W</I>, 178). Or, as Bernard suggests in a similar vein:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It was different once. . . . Once we could break the current as we
chose. How many telephone calls, how many post cards, are now needed
to cut this hole through which we come together, united, at Hampton
Court? . . . We are all swept on by the torrent of things grown so
familiar that they cast no shade . . . and in this unconsciousness attain
the utmost freedom from friction and part the weeds that grow over the
mouths of sunken channels. We have to leap like fish, high in the air,
to catch the train from Waterloo. And however high we leap we fall back
again into the stream [<I>W</I>, 180].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In both these cases, Woolf articulates the threat posed by
Mrs. Constable's sponge with direct reference to the language of
neuroscience. Both Neville and Bernard represent the consequences of a
deterministic bodily mode. For Neville change and choice are no longer
possible because he has been pinched between the shoulders, taken
the print of life on the fibres of his nervous system, and Bernard
feels at the mercy of the unassailable torrent of the familiar, the
habitual. Drawing on the commonplace neuroscientific trope of the nerves
as riverbeds whose channels are progressively deepened by currents of
nervous energy, Bernard describes a freedom that is not of choice, but
rather a freedom from choice produced by habit. Moreover, Bernard's
statement makes manifest an antagonistic relationship between this
model of embodiment and the possibility of community. Aligning the
habitualized body with forces of individuation and differentiation,
he suggests that only to the extent that the frictionless flow of the
familiar can be resisted is community possible, can the characters
"come together, united."

Unsettling the Habitual--A "Great Society of Bodies"
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is, however, precisely this possibility of coming together that Woolf
seeks to explore. She is not content merely to replicate positivist
science's mechanical model of the body, a body in which, as Bernard
puts it, "Muscles, nerves, intestines, blood-vessels . . . make
the coil and spring of our being, the unconscious hum of the engine
. . . [that] function[s] superbly. Opening, shutting; shutting, opening;
eating, drinking; sometimes speaking--the whole mechanism seem[s]
to expand, to contract, like the mainspring of a clock" (<I>W</I>,
217-8). Throughout the text, she is equally at pains to articulate an
alternate model of embodied subjectivity that is most clearly represented

<B></B>

in her characterization of Jinny. Early in the text we are given an
account of Jinny's participation in a tennis match, after which she
states:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I must throw myself on the ground and pant. I am out of breath with
running, with triumph. Everything in my body seems thinned out with
running and triumph. My blood must be bright red, whipped up, slapping
against my ribs. My soles tingle, as if wire rings opened and shut in
my feet. I see every blade of grass very clear. But the pulse drums so
in my forehead, behind my eyes, that everything dances--the net, the
grass; your faces leap like butterflies; the trees seem to jump up and
down. There is nothing staid, nothing settled, in this universe. All is
rippling, all is dancing; all is quickness and triumph [<I>W</I>, 31].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reveling in the connective force of her pulsing blood, Jinny resides
triumphantly in her body. Standing in stark contrast to both the
rigidifying and ordering effects of Jamesian habit and Bernard's clockwork
body, Jinny's subjective mode is defined by her body's vitalistic capacity
for spontaneity. Both her self-perception and her perception of the world
around her are shaped by the dance of her blood: "there is," as she says,
"nothing staid, nothing settled, in this universe." By countering the
neuroscientific body in this way, Woolf's representation of Jinny's
form of embodiment is consonant with a well-established tradition of
vitalistic reaction to the deterministic effects of positivist science--a
tradition that, among Woolf's contemporaries, prominently includes Edward
Carpenter, Henri Bergson, and D. H. Lawrence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Consistently represented through this metaphorics of dance, Jinny's
vitalistic mode of embodiment is extended to articulate a structure of
collectivity. For Jinny there is "a great society of bodies" that, when
they come into contact, call out to one another (<I>W</I>, 49). "Our
bodies communicate," she claims, and the form of this communication
finds its example in dance:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We yield to this slow flood. . . . In and out, we are swept now into this
large re; it holds us together; we cannot step outside its sinuous,
its hesitating, its abrupt, its perfectly encircling walls. Our bodies,
his hard, mine flowing, are pressed together in its body; it holds us
together; and then lengthening out, in smooth, in sinuous folds, rolls
us between it, on and on [<I>W</I>, 82-3].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The form of community predicated upon Jinny's embodied subjectivity is,
thus, less a form of relation between fixedly discrete individuals than
a process of merging in a dynamic flow of a corporate body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the type of flow exemplified by both Jinny's blood and the dance
stand in contrast to the ever more strictly and efficiently channelled
flows of nervous energy in the habitualized body, Woolf's challenge to the
individualizing and deterministic discourses of neuroscience becomes overt
during the two dinner party scenes in which the six characters literally
come together in a community. Explicitly appropriating the language of
neuroscience, Woolf has Jinny respond to Rhoda's observation that "one
thing melts into another": "Yes . . . our senses have widened. Membranes,
webs

<B></B>

of nerve that lay white and limp, have filled and spread themselves and
float round us like filaments, making the air tangible and catching in
them far-away sounds unheard before" (<I>W</I>, 110). No longer limited
to their role as long-fixed relays between sensation and action, the
nerves, in this articulation, become an extensive web that structures
the melting of one thing into another and makes new forms of sensory
experience possible. Extending this reration of the nervous system,
Neville supports Louis's claim "that these attempts to say, 'I am this,
I am that,' which we make, coming together, like separated parts of one
body and soul, are false" by representing the nerves as the basis of an
encompassing communal architecture (<I>W</I>, 112). Shifting abruptly
from his sense that "change is no longer possible" because he has taken
"the print of life . . . upon the raw, the white, the unprotected fibre,"
he declares, "I am merely 'Neville' to you, who see the narrow limits of
my life and the line it cannot pass. But to myself I am immeasurable; a
net whose fibres pass imperceptibly beneath the world. My net is almost
indistinguishable from that which it surrounds. It lifts whales--huge
leviathans and white jellies, what is amorphous and wandering" (<I>W</I>,
178). No longer functioning to individualize and separate, the nerves
as Neville imagines them mark a collective space not dissimilar to
what we have seen Jinny describe as the "perfectly encircling walls" of
the dance. Within this space, the lines that divide one character from
another, or the characters from the world that surrounds them, are no
longer distinct.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is important to note the extent to which Woolf predicates
this possibility of collectivity upon a mode of vital, affective
embodiment. Whereas the novel consistently associates forces of
individualization and differentiation with taxonomic and traditionally
narrative linguistic modes, the affective body remains unassimilable
to the ordering regimes of such representational projects and as such
provides a basis for community. Louis presents perhaps the most obvious
example of the taxonomic language of the individual. Armed with his
businessman's red pen and ledger book, he is driven to locate all aspects
of life on their proper line and column, literally to account for the
world in which he finds himself. Even the trivialities of day-to-day
existence are submitted to this drive, and he insists that "With my
Australian accent I have sat in eating-shops and tried to make the
clerks accept me, yet never forgotten my solemn and severe convictions
and the discrepancies and incoherences that must be resolved" (<I>W</I>,
167). His use of language aims at classifying and fixing that which is
both without and within; perceptual processes, for instance, become the
occasion for representational ordering, as when he announces, "This
I see for a second, and shall try tonight to fix in words, to forge
a ring of steel" (<I>W</I>, 30). Insistently differentiating him from
and situating him in relation to what surrounds him, Louis's endless
taxonomies culminate in the moment at which he tells us, "on the letters
in the wire basket I sign my name, I, I, and again I" (<I>W</I>, 141). In
so doing he exemplifies the process through which "All the furled and
close-packed leaves of [his] many-folded life are now summed up in
[his] name; incised cleanly and barely on the sheet" (<I>W</I>, 138).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The text suggests that this reiterative solidification of the "I" through
which incoherences, negations, and multiplicities are compressed and
unified within the subject--

<B></B>

a sort of linguistic analogue to the habitualizing and individualizing
force of repeated patterns of nervous discharge-- must be overcome if the
possibility of community is to be realized. The two dinner party scenes
once again provide the clearest instances of such an overcoming. On the
occasion of the first dinner, Louis himself is led to claim that:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It is Percival . . . sitting silent as he sat among the tickling grasses
when the breeze parted the clouds and they formed again, who makes
us aware that these attempts to say, "I am this, I am that," which we
make, coming together, like separated parts of one body and soul, are
false. Something has been left out from fear. Something has been altered,
from vanity. We have tried to accentuate differences. From the desire to
be separate we have laid stress upon our faults, and what is particular
to us. But there is a chain whirling round, round, in a steel-blue circle
beneath [<I>W</I>, 112].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the face of the individuating and qualifying force of language--the
insistently compelling claims of "I am this, I am that"--Louis posits
the possibility of an underlying state of unifying commonality, beyond
all particularity, red by the perfect symmetry of a "whirling
. . . circle." If Louis can only posit this form of collectivity, Neville
reminds us of its grounding in the affective body. Taking up Louis's
theme, he muses:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

these roaring waters . . . upon which we build our crazy platforms are
more stable than the wild, the weak and inconsequent cries that we utter
when, trying to speak, we rise; when we reason and jerk out these false
sayings, "I am this; I am that!" Speech is false.
<P>
But I eat. I gradually lose all knowledge of particulars as I eat. I
  am becoming weighed down with food. These delicious mouthfuls of roast
  duck, fitly piled with vegetables, following each other in exquisite
  rotation of warmth, weight, sweet and bitter, past my palate, down my
  gullet, into my stomach, have stabilized my body. I feel quiet, gravity,
  control. All is solid now. Instinctively my palate now requires and
  anticipates sweetness and lightness, something sugared and evanescent;
  and cool wine, fitting glovelike over those finer nerves that seem
  to tremble from the roof of my mouth and make it spread (as I drink)
  into a domed cavern, green with vine leaves, musk-scented, purple with
  grapes. Now I can look steadily into the mill-race that foams beneath

Another instance in which the nerves come to re an encompassing,
organic, communal architecture, this passage makes explicit the embodied
basis of community. Describing the sequence of events through which he is
gradually drawn from the realm of reason, language, and identity to that
of affective embodiment, it is only with the complete abandonment of the
former that Neville can access the dynamic collective source of stability
that subtends his existence. Eschewing language and its primary function
of individuation and particularization, he loses a sense of individuality
as he sinks into a gastronomically induced affective state in which he
"gradually lose[s] all knowledge of particulars." Positing this tension
between language, reason, and particularity on the one hand, and affect,
embodiment, and unity on the other, the text is once again consistent
with a tradition of vitalistic thought. To reinvoke

<B></B>

Bergson, Carpenter, and Lawrence, it is worth noting that despite
significant differences that are especially apparent in terms of
their communitarian implications, their projects all articulate an
understanding, shared by this aspect of Woolf's text, of the vital order
as a fundamental unity in relation to which supposedly discrete units
or identities are viewed as the distorting, if necessary, effects of
intellectual operations.

If, then, Woolf turns the language of neuroscience against itself in an
attempt to think and write of community, the question remains, How are
we to assess the vitalistic form of community her text articulates? In
order to approach this question it will be necessary to reframe slightly
Woolf's engagement of the neuroscientific body and to distinguish more
sharply the modes of community the novel presents. One such mode, as
Jane Marcus has argued, is the patriotic English nationalism and its
supporting "myth of individualism and selfhood" that <I>The Waves</I>
criticizes ("BR," 137). Michael Tratner makes a similar point when he
draws on Leonard Woolf's understanding of imperialism as the principle
of individualism transposed into the geopolitical realm to argue that
Virginia Woolf's critique of individualism goes hand in hand with
her critique of nationalism and imperialism. Given this alignment of
individualism with a particular form of nationalist community, Woolf's
interrogation of the individualizing function of the neuroscientific body
would seem to support the line of argument advanced by Marcus and Tratner.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 By extension, then, the turn to the affective body and the form of
 community that becomes its predicate (a community not grounded in
 the individual) can be seen as an attempt to imagine a more desirable
 structure of collectivity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When, however, we return to the scene of the first dinner party as the
fullest articulation of this alternate communal mode--and in so doing,
it will be necessary to differentiate more carefully between the two
dinner parties than I have so far--it becomes clear that this affective
community is itself not unproblematic. If the text's reration of
the nervous system is attractive insofar as it provides the basis for a
communitarian project that ostensibly stands in opposition to nationalist
community and its cult of the great individual, the model of community
at which it arrives remains dangerously close to what Jean-Luc Nancy
has described as "organic community." Suppressing social difference
and leaving no place for an experience of being-together in which the
enclosed totalities of individual subjects are exposed at the limit of an
unshareable alterity, this form of community is corporatist and manifests
itself either in the subsumption of individual members under the re
of a leader whose body signifies the unity of all those in whose place
it stands, or in the sacrifice of individual subjectivity in an act of
fusion that forms the higher-level totality of the community as Subject.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Organic community is, for Nancy, "not only intimate communication
 between its members, but also its organic communion with its own
 essence. . . . [I]t is made up principally of the sharing, diffusion,
 or impregnation of

<B></B>

an identity by a plurality wherein each member identifies himself only
through the supplementary mediation of his identification with the living
body of the community."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Perhaps his most succinct definition of this communal form is one
 governed by "the goal of achieving a community of beings producing in
 essence their own essence as their work, and furthermore of producing
 precisely this essence <I>as community</I>" (<I>IC</I>, 20). Important
 here is the polyvocal sense of "work," for if organic community is the
 product of its members' <I>labor</I>, the form of that product is a
 work of art, understood as the self-enclosed, remainderless totality
 of the <I>oeuvre</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 The imperative of the work governs the form of community that the
 first dinner party works to produce, an imperative encapsulated in
 the characters' projective creation of Percival, the absent center
 around which the text revolves. Absent from the text except in the
 memories and thoughts of the other characters, Percival exists only
 as the product of his friends' imaginative and identificatory labor;
 in working to fashion the social space enabled by the proper name
 "Percival," the characters produce him as the essential embodiment
 of their being-in-common. Percival, as Louis reminds us, "makes [the
 characters] aware that these attempts to say, 'I am this, I am that,'
 which [they] make, coming together, like separated parts of one body and
 soul, are false" (<I>W</I>, 112). And if Louis declares the realized
 work of community with his announcement, "Something is made," Jinny
 gives form to this vague "something" when she implores, "Let us hold
 it for one moment . . . this globe whose walls are made of Percival"
 (<I>W</I>, 118-9). The communal space that has hitherto been
 articulated with recourse to the language of the affective body is, in
 this instance, substantially embodied by "Percival," a mythic production
 of the characters in which they initially recognize idealized versions
 of themselves and that ultimately constitutes the collective identity to
 which their individual selves are sacrificed. To return, in this context,
 to Tratner's linking of individualism and imperialist nationalism, it
 will be important to distance ourselves from his somewhat too hasty
 valorization of collectivism as a sufficient countermeasure. For in
 sacrificing their particularity as individual subjects to merge in a
 form of collective consciousness, the form of collectivity the characters
 fashion remains subjective.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Though the community achieved in the first dinner party counteracts
 atomistic individualism, it does not escape the logic of the Subject,
 a logic all too compatible with both nation and empire.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the mythic fashioning of Percival is initially emblematic of
the problems inherent in the structure of collectivity to which the
novel turns, by the occasion of the second dinner party he, or more
precisely, his death, will have become central to Woolf's response to
these problems. Percival's death is, of course, literally central to the
progression of <I>The Waves</I>; occurring midway through the text, it
is announced by the short shocking statement, "He is dead" (<I>W</I>,
124). While Percival's death is key to Woolf's satirical attack on what
Marcus calls "the cultural narrative of 'England' . . . created by an
Eton/Cambridge elite who (re)produce the national epic . . . and elegy
. . . in praise of the hero," his ignominious demise should not be read
as merely ridiculous or pathetic ("BR," 137). Notwithstanding the irony
of having Percival, knight errant and imperial champion, meet his end
in an accidental fall from the

<B></B>

back of a flea-bitten mare, his death initiates a critical reconsideration
of both the affective body and the structure of collectivity it
enables. Following quickly on the heels of the first dinner party,
Percival's death calls the characters to ask what is at stake in the
representational schema that fashions him. Having produced the myth
of Percival as the myth of community, they must now reflect upon the
ramifications of their labor and its product.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In speaking of Percival's "mythic" status, it will be important to
recall Nancy's understanding of "myth" or "fiction" as those linguistic
modes that do the work of organic community and produce the community
as their work:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Absolute community--myth--is not so much the total fusion of individuals,
but the <I>will</I> of community: the desire to operate, through the
power of myth, the communion that myth represents and that it represents
as a communion or communication of wills. Fusion ensues: myth represents
multiple existences as immanent to its own unique fiction, which gathers
them together and gives them their common re in its speech and as
this speech [<I>IC</I>, 57].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Myth is, thus, distinguished not primarily by its referential status but
by the extent to which it <I>operates</I> to produce community. Rather
than representing community to a group of individuals or communicating
some information about community that its members then hold in common,
mythic speech is itself the operation of community--it is through the very
act of mythic speech that community takes place. Given this tautological
loop in which <I>myth</I> and <I>community</I> are locked--whereby
myth can be said to communicate only itself as the taking place of
community--it becomes impossible to think of community without myth
or blithely to pursue a project of demythologization. If, in Nancy's
formulation, all community necessarily takes place through the operation
of myth and that operation is independent of myth's referential function,
efforts to establish an unmythic form of collectivity through the
exposure of a given myth's suspect referential status will gain no social
purchase and will only perpetuate the operation of an adversarial mythic
community. In this context the limitations of a reading that understands
<I>The Waves</I> as simply engaged in satirizing imperialist, nationalist
community--what Marcus characterizes as Woolf's "merciless parody" of the
"myth of individualism and selfhood" and of the re of the imperial
hero that is its manifestation--become evident because the force of satire
or parody lies in its ability to ridicule, or demythologize, its object
("BR," 137).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's text undoubtedly engages in this sort of satire, the height of
which is the circumstances of Percival's death, and in so doing critiques
the ideological ramifications of the historically particular form of
community he represents. It does not, however, limit itself to this
critique, and the sheer event of Percival's death allows it to pursue
the logic of mythic community to the point of what Nancy calls its
"interruption."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Beyond her demythologizing tactics, Woolf develops a mode of writing
 that gives voice to this interruption and re-marks a limit at which
 the work of community--its individual member subjects, and the logic
 of the Subject itself--is

<B></B>

opened up and exposed by the interactions of singular beings that
cannot be put to work in the operations of myth. This "voice of
interruption" is most audible in the characters' reactions to Percival's
death. Uninterested in what the myth of Percival represents and unable
to find language adequate to the fact of Percival's death, Rhoda, for
example, is led to ask, "'Like' and 'like' and 'like'--but what is
the thing that lies beneath the semblance of the thing? . . . Now that
lightning has gashed the tree and the flowering branch has fallen and
Percival, by his death, has made me this gift, let me see the thing"
(<I>W</I>, 134). No longer the "something [that] is made" in the work
of mythic community, he is, in death, merely "the thing" to which myth
is inadequate and that constitutes its interruption (<I>W</I>, 118).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Faced with the unthinkable event of Percival's death, Rhoda rejects
Louis's response, aware that "If we submit [Louis] will reduce us to
order . . . [and] smooth out the death of Percival to his satisfaction"
(<I>W</I>, 132). She decides instead to go to a music hall, and her
description of the vocal performance she witnesses is extraordinary:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
swollen but contained in slippery satin, the seagreen woman comes to
our rescue. She sucks in her lip, assumes an air of intensity, inflates
herself and hurls herself precisely at the right moment as if she saw
an apple and her voice was the arrow into the note, "Ah!"
<P>
An axe has split a tree to the core; the core is warm; sound quivers
 within the bark. "Ah!" cried a woman to her lover, leaning from her
 window in Venice. "Ah, ah!" she cried, and again she cries "Ah!" She has
 provided us with a cry. But only a cry. And what is a cry? [<I>W</I>,
 133]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Unwilling to "smooth out" Percival's death in the process of
representation, narration, or mythologization, Rhoda recognizes,
nonetheless, her obligation to bear witness to the "thing" he has
manifested to her, and in the moment of the vocal performance, she finds a
means of understanding her obligation. Instead of the "'like' and 'like'
and 'like'" of representation, she is confronted with the "'Ah!' and
'Ah!' and 'Ah!'" of the vocalist's "cry," an utterance that returns
Rhoda to the affective body without allowing that mode of embodiment to
become the basis of a communitarian myth. The affective charge of the
singer's cry is pregnant with a significance that it cannot signify, and
as such it allows Percival's death to open onto an alternate communal
mode. The language of the cry refuses to qualify his death, to make
it comprehensible through the memorializing production of a communal
fiction; it does, however, inarticulately indicate the sheer fact of his
death, a fact that the characters share even as they are confronted by
the painful insistence that they can neither properly make Percival's
death their own nor make it the ground of a shared subjective space.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a parallel moment, Bernard responds to Percival's death with a visit
to the National Gallery. Equally scornful of Louis's desire to "smooth
things out," he insists:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
but I still resent the usual order. I will not let myself be made yet to
accept the sequence of things. I will walk; I will not change the rhythm
of my mind by stopping, by looking; I will walk. I will go up these steps
into the gallery and submit myself to the influence of minds like mine
outside the sequence. There is little time left to answer the question;

<B></B>

 my powers flag; I become torpid. Here are pictures. Here are cold
 madonnas among the pillars. Let them lay to rest the incessant activity
 of the mind's eye, the bandaged head, the men with ropes, so that I
 may find something unvisual beneath. Here are the gardens; and Venus
 among her flowers; here are saints and blue madonnas. Mercifully these
 pictures make no reference; they do not nudge; they do not point. Thus
 they expand my consciousness of him and bring him back to me differently
 [<I>W</I>, 104-5].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rejecting the sequentializing effect of the phrases he constantly
produces, Bernard finds solace in the affective quality of the pictures he
views. The paintings make no appeal to the representational faculty of his
"mind's eye" but present him with something "unvisual." Antireferential
and nonindexical, the images do not inscribe Percival within a fiction
of unity and foundational stability but "bring him back to [Bernard]
differently." This difference produced by Bernard's affective experience
pertains not only to Percival but to Bernard himself. If Bernard's
experience in the gallery brings Percival back differently by manifesting
the persistent necessity of remembering him before and beyond the work of
memorializing fiction, it also installs a difference within the subject,
the "me," to whom Percival returns. Exposing the individual to the
singularity of an otherness that it can neither incorporate within the
closure of the subject nor render the basis of a higher subjective mode
(a "We") to which it can sacrifice itself, the demands of remembrance
thematized by Bernard's experience are also the demands of an impossible
community. This community is based not in the undifferentiating fusion
of its individual members in a transcendental whole but precisely in
their common exposure to, their sharing of, that which properly can be
neither communicated nor shared.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Turning from the affective body as a vital principle of integration and
organic unity to an understanding of the affective body as manifesting
the limit re-marked by the singularly unrepresentable "thing" that the
characters hold in common but can never properly share, by the second
dinner party, <I>The Waves</I> insists that the desire for community
must be negotiated in a very different register, and in a different
language, from that of the characters' first "coming together." Closing
in Bernard's voice, Woolf refuses the mythologizing narrative of the
"summing up" that would be proper to an organic notion of community
(<I>W</I>, 199). Instead, she has him articulate a series of questions:
"What is the phrase for the moon? And the phrase for love? By what name
are we to call death?" (<I>W</I>, 199) Bernard responds:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I do not know. I need a little language such as lovers use, words of one
syllable such as children speak when they come into the room and find
their mother sewing and pick up some scrap of bright wool, a feather,
or a shred of chintz. I need a howl; a cry. When the storm crosses the
marsh and sweeps over me where I lie in the ditch unregarded I need no
words. Nothing neat. Nothing that comes down with all its feet on the
floor. None of those resonances and lovely echoes that break and chime
from nerve to nerve in our breasts, making wild music, false phrases. I
have done with phrases [<I>W</I>, 246].

Forcing us to conceive of community in terms of the demands of the
"broken words, inarticulate words" (<I>W</I>, 161), of a "howl" or a
"cry," Woolf rejects the totalizing fiction of organic community and is
able to exclaim with Bernard, "Heaven be praised . . . we need not whip
this prose into poetry. The little language is enough" (<I>W</I>, 219).

My somewhat anachronistic use of "neuroscience" is intended to encompass

articulation of this tension in his understanding of the relationship
between individual selves and what he calls the universal Self of the
vital universe. In Carpenter's view humanity resides predominantly in a
state of consciousness (closely associated with the operations of the
intellect and a scientific temperament) that emphasizes identity and
distinction and thereby renders inaccessible the realization of a vast,
vital connectedness that underlies such distinctions. In a passage whose
similarity to Neville's ration of the nerves as a web that subtends
and unifies all of existence makes it difficult not to read it as Woolf's
source, Carpenter imagines the overcoming of this intellectual state
of consciousness:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
This body, in fact, is the expression and grows out of those great
creative feelings of which I have just spoken. Through Love it becomes
a body built into the lives of others, and positively sharing their
organic life and vitality. Since Faith and Courage inspire it, it is
well based, firm to stand the shocks of Time and Accident; extending
its domain over the elements; incorporating in itself the sea and the
wild creatures, and so unafraid of them; surrounding Chance and taking
it captive. Its consciousness of immense Extension in time and space
indicates its ethereal character; its consciousness of Power indicates
its strongly material composition; its consciousness of Knowledge,
the penetrating subtle quality of it. And so we forebode, beside and
within the very local body which we know best (and which is expressive
of our more local selves), another body expressive of our more universal
nature--a body built of swift, far-extending ethereal elements, subtle
and penetrating, yet powerfully massive and material; closely knit in
itself, not easily disturbed or dislocated, enduring for &aelig;ons;
yet sensitive in the highest degree, and twining its nerves and fibres
through all Creation--sharing the life of all creatures [Carpenter,

Beyond articulating the individualizing function of the habitualized body,
neuroscientific discourse itself makes the link between individualism
and an explicitly conservative, communitarian project. In James, the
habitualized body preserves both class distinctions between "the children
of fortune" and the "envious . . . poor," and racialized distinctions
between a presumably civilized white readership and the hostile "natives
of the desert and frozen zone" (<I>PP</I>, 125). Unsurprisingly,
Maudsley's project supports, indeed presupposes, a similar social
model. In outlining his "inductive" approach to the "investigation
of mind," he contends that "we ought certainly to begin our inquiry
with the observation of the simplest instances--with its physiological
manifestations in animals, in children, in idiots, in savages, mounting
by degrees to the highest and most recondite facts of consciousness"
(Maudsley, <I>Body and Mind</I>, 148).

Writing of an alternate model of community, Nancy suggests that:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Community is the community of <I>others</I>, which does not mean
that several individuals possess some common nature in spite
of their differences, but rather that they partake only of their
otherness. Otherness, at each moment, is the otherness of each "myself,"
which is "myself" only as an other. Otherness is not a common substance,
but it is on the contrary the nonsubstantiality of each "self" and of its
relationship <I>with</I> the others. All the selves are related through
their otherness, which means that they are not "related"; in any case,
not in any determinable sense of relationship. They are together, but
togetherness is otherness [Jean-Luc Nancy, <I>The Birth to Presence</I>,

Modernist literary and cultural criticism has dominated the study
of English literature throughout the greater part of the twentieth
century. Only in the last ten or fifteen years have literary critics
developed an alternative set of tools to probe the ideological
underpinnings of modernist criticism itself. With these tools, a number
of scholars have suggested that modernist criticism defined itself and
the art it championed in opposition to mass culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 In the wake of such proclamations, a few scholars have attempted to show
 that critics such as T. S. Eliot were in fact profoundly influenced by
 mass-cultural forms like jazz or the music hall.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Clearly the relationship between mass culture and modernist criticism
 was more fluid and more complicated than we have yet to recognize. As
 I will show, modernist critics I. A. Richards, F. R. Leavis, and
 T. S. Eliot appropriated the very techniques attributed to mass-cultural
 consumption--shock and sensation--into their lexicon of high-cultural,
 aesthetic values while simultaneously decrying the effects of the
 "sensational" media. In doing so, their modernist critique reversed the
 central project of Kantian aesthetics, the dominant aesthetic practice
 of the late nineteenth century, to validate as fine arts only those
 arts that invoke disinterested contemplation rather than a sensuous
 interest on the part of the reader. Interestingly, however, modernist
 criticism furthered one aspect of the Kantian project--to bring the
 body and its senses more overtly into the ethical and social realm,
 what the early-twentieth-century critics called "cultural health." The
 modernist criticism of Richards, Leavis, and Eliot

<B></B>

advocates an aesthetic practice that made way for the representation of
bodies in art in addition to a mode of aesthetic reception that included
the body as integral to forming aesthetic judgments. While making room for
the body, modernist critics continued to promote the Kantian aesthetic's
effort to objectify, rationalize, and make intelligible the body and its
irrational sensuousness. Ironically, they did so by appropriating the
very consumption strategies that they accused mass culture of creating.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernist criticism emerged in the early decades of the twentieth century
as the first practical criticism of English literature produced from
its new institutionalized status in the university.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
The individual aims of Leavis, Richards, and Eliot, the three critics I
will focus on in this essay, were part of a larger project not only of
making English literature a subject of serious study at university but
also of making it the moral focus of a public debate about individual
sensibility and the "health" of culture at large. The "problem" or
"decline" of culture, as they saw it, was imputed not just to the
abundance of poor-quality, mass-media entertainment that purportedly
numbed its audiences into automatic response but more importantly to
the subsequent inability detected in the majority of the population to
respond to the "real" works of culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 If mass culture was an encroaching illness that fostered "cheap
 mechanical responses"
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 and transformed its participants into senseless automatons, then "real"
 or "elite" or "minority" culture, as it was variously labeled by its
 champions, was mass culture's antidote. Through the "direct shock
 of poetic intensity," in T. S. Eliot's words, "real" culture would
 revitalize not only the individual but eventually the entire culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Eliot's language here is an important clue to the nature of the modernist
 critical agenda with regard to the mass-culture debate. It reveals
 a rhetorical sleight of hand that makes possible the incorporation
 of certain mass-cultural forms into high art. By championing the
 "shock" to "sensibility" that could only be experienced by "true" or
 "high" culture, modernist critics appropriated the very labels that
 had been reserved previously for mass-cultural practices. Modernist
 criticism not only made a place for the body of the reader of cultural
 works in its notion of sensibility, by which it meant the connection
 between sensations, emotions, and cognitions, but, in its use of the
 "invigorating shock" of real culture, it made a place for the very kind
 of aesthetic reception that had previously been attributed to readers
 of sensational thrillers or pornography.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Sensation and feeling, once the province of mass culture, became its
 antidote. While in Kantian practice bodily sensation had no place in the
 "true" aesthetic interaction, modernist criticism championed "organic
 sensation" as one of the most positive virtues of the sensitive reader,
 a new sign of the authentic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This acceptance of sensation under the rubric of the aesthetic
opens the way for a positive revision of the place of a number of
mass-cultural practices in art, most notably written and visual
pornography. Throughout this essay I stress the importance of the
incorporation of the pornographic in twentieth-century art and its
acceptance by the critical establishment because they provide dramatic
examples of the shift in dominant aesthetic practices. The pornographic
brings with it a set of assumptions about its own consumption that always
involves an engagement or incitation of the

<B></B>

reader's or viewer's body, thus explicitly acknowledging the mind-body
connection that modernist critics championed through their notion
of sensibility. Within dominant aesthetic practices, the shift from a
disinterested intellection, which rested on the removal of the body from
the aesthetic interaction, to an aesthetic consumption that included the
body as an integral, indeed foundational, part of the interaction not
only made way for pornographic representations in works that aspired
to high-art status but equally informed how those works would come
to be read. Modernist critical reading practices began to incorporate
mass-cultural patterns of response just as modernist works themselves
had appropriated the tropes and images of mass culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Leavis, Richards, and even Eliot, the critical project of valuing
and responding to "culture" was one that promoted unity among citizens
not on the basis of certain class affiliations or external coincidences
but rather on the understanding of their most intimate subjectivity,
the emotions and thoughts produced in response to aesthetic objects. To
understand how these critics went about trying to create this "unified
sensibility" on the basis of appropriate responses to cultural phenomena
and how this in turn led to an accommodation of the pornographic
in literature, I want to examine their thoughts on mass culture and
aesthetic reception.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The defining impetus behind modernist criticism is that mass-produced
forms of cultural entertainment, such as fiction, radio, and films, are
destructive to the quality of individual lives and hence the fabric of
society as a whole. In the tradition of Matthew Arnold's claims for
the civilizing and spiritualizing effects of culture, the criticism
of Richards, Eliot, and especially that of Leavis, attempts to define
a rationale for concretizing and preserving, as Pamela McCallum has
phrased it, "the ethical efficacy of cultural phenomena" (<I>LM</I>,
3-4). But in order to claim that a specific body of cultural
artifacts (what we have come to call "the canon") is central to the
social whole, an argument has to be made against the forces that appear to
threaten or work in opposition to this cultural body. Modernist criticism
thus mounts a defense of ethical culture. Ethical culture is threatened
in terms of production, where the masses of printed media threaten to
relegate "classic" English poetry and literature to the margins of social
interest, and in terms of consumption, where mass-cultural consumers
demonstrate passive consumption strategies based on certain horizons of
expectation that have to be defeated in order for high-cultural phenomena
to be prioritized. Literary criticism of the 1920s and 1930s attempts to
identify and attack mass-cultural incursions into the realm of culture
through a rhetoric of high-cultural hysteria, punctuated quite clearly
in the now famous <I>Scrutiny</I> manifesto of 1932, which not only
declares that "the age is illiterate with periodicals" and that "the
general dissolution of standards is commonplace," but indeed notes,
"Many profess to believe (though fewer seem to care) that the end of
Western civilization is in sight."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Part of this the-sky-is-falling frenzy is provoked by Eliot's influential
notion of the "dissociation of sensibility" as expressed in his 1921
essay, "The Metaphysical Poets." Eliot's idea that "in the seventeenth
century a dissociation of sensibility set in, from which we have never
recovered" creates a truly potent myth of the divided personality of both
"the mind of England" and the individuals within it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 F. R. Leavis forms his own view of English literary and cultural history
 on Eliot's foundation, and he furthers Eliot's idea with his own notion
 that the Shakespearean era represents the last "organic community"
 England has known.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Since then, according to Leavis, industrialized capitalism has begun to
 make irrevocable and regrettable changes to the previously-whole fabric
 of English culture. A striking factor in Eliot's chronology of the idea
 that thought and feeling, mind and body, are rent asunder is, as other
 critics have noted, that he places the origin of this so-called modern
 crisis in the English Civil War period, thus associating it with the
 first articulations of opposed class-interests by popular revolt.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Part of the project of modernist criticism--to reintegrate the
 body with the mind into one unified sensibility--should be read
 analogously, then, as a desire for the reintegration of divided class
 sensibilities. Modernist works such as <I>Ulysses</I> or <I>Lady
 Chatterly's Lover</I>, which introduce sexually explicit bodies into
 their larger, multiperspectived frameworks, enact this reintegration by
 setting the pornographic, or bodily representations/incitations, into
 a dialogue with the other discourses that enter the text. By allowing
 what is perceived as a lower-class discourse into high art, a social
 reintegration of representational types occurs on the page whether
 this bodily discourse is controlled by the "high-cultural" aesthetic
 techniques that deploy it, is subversive of the aesthetic it joins, or
 enacts a pluralist model of representation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot makes the political function of this reintegration quite overt in
his 1920 essay "Philip Massinger," where he writes, "The Elizabethan
morality was an important convention; important because it was not
consciously of one social class alone, because it provided a framework
for emotions to which all classes could respond, and it hindered no
feeling. It was not hypocritical and it did not suppress."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 The Elizabethan era provides a social and psychological model of
 "wholeness" and "integrated sensibility" for Eliot and Leavis, as
 well as for Q. D. Leavis, whose published thesis, <I>Fiction and the
 Reading Public</I> , contributed to the hyperbolic tone of the
 mass-culture debate. Rhetorically maintaining the strict class boundaries
 that he seems to want to overcome, F. R. Leavis remarks in an essay on
 Joyce that Shakespeare belonged "to a genuinely national culture, to
 a community in which it was possible for the theatre to appeal to the
 cultivated and the populace at the same time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Though Eliot's association of this prelapsarian state of culture
 with the body is only implicit, Leavis makes his association explicit
 through an appeal to philological authority. Describing the "popular
 basis of [Elizabethan] culture" as "agricultural," Leavis says that the
 philologist "Mr. Logan Pearsall Smith shows how much of the strength
 and subtlety of English idiom derives from an agricultural way of
 life." Quoting Smith, he concludes that "when we examine these phrasal
 verbs, we find that by far the greater number of them also render their
 meanings in terms of bodily

<B></B>

sensation. They are formed from simple verbs which express the act,
notions, and attitudes of the body and its members."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Thus to Leavis's mind a "whole" or "organic" society is one that
 expresses and represents bodily sensation in language, or where language,
 body, and thought are so close as to be identical expressions of one
 another. Leavis equates language with culture, and therefore this ideal
 compression of body and language demonstrates a desire primarily to
 integrate the stratified people of the social body into one culture
 but also to experience one's own body more fully. Of course the primary
 influence on Leavis's work is the author he championed throughout his
 life, D. H. Lawrence. Leavis advocates an aesthetic that validates
 Lawrence's writing and ought to be recognized as having originated
 there. Both on a physical level in terms of experiencing the body
 through culture (the bodily sensations you receive as a reader) and on
 a political level in terms of representing the body politic, the myths
 of unified sensibility and the organic society help create a mode of
 aesthetic understanding that supports the works of modernist artists
 who incorporate mass-cultural tropes and images, most notably those of
 pornography, into their topoi. Though critical assessment of Eliot's
 and Leavis's concepts of a lost unity have tended to follow Raymond
 Williams's pronouncement of Leavis's version of history as "myth
 in the sense of conjecture . . . a surrender to a characteristically
 industrialist, or urban, nostalgia," these ideologies powerfully shaped a
 unified sense of loss and subsequently a purpose for culture, especially
 for English literature studies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the notion of a lost wholeness rallies belief in the purpose and power
of literature and culture to restore the loss, the degradations of mass
culture are an even more potent galvanizing tool. Mass culture can be
framed as a contemporary enemy that cannot be defeated, but it must be
countered by a subject whose sophisticated reading and viewing practices
serve as a defense against its cheapening or deadening effects. Teaching
readers how to respond appropriately to cultural material, or, in the
context of the study of English literature, how to "read" poetry and
novels, works to ensure that a specific kind of response toward the
text in question is formulated. The problem of mass-cultural media
as identified by modernist critics is the low level of sensitivity and
responsiveness required from their audience. In <I>Principles of Literary
Criticism</I> , Richards suggests that "At present, bad literature,
bad art, the cinema, etc. are an influence of first importance in fixing
immature and actually inapplicable attitudes to most things. . . . Against
these stock-responses the artist's internal and external conflicts are
fought, and with them the popular writer's triumphs are made."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Q. D. Leavis, a pupil of Richards's at Cambridge who uses the ideas
 above as the foundational concepts of her own work, extends his argument
 with the idea that writers of cheap, mass-produced fiction "work upon
 and solidify herd prejudice and . . . debase the emotional currency by
 touching grossly on fine issues." Further, they foster "cheap mechanical
 responses" to circumstances that ought, in her opinion, to be more finely
 discerned because "The training of the reader who spends his leisure in
 cinemas, looking through magazines and newspapers, listening to jazz
 music, does not merely fail to help him, it prevents him from normal
 development partly by providing him with a set of habits inimical to
 mental effort" (<I>FRP</I>, 67, 74, 224).

<B></B>

These sentiments are echoed relentlessly throughout F. R. Leavis's
work, as, for example, in his pamphlet "Mass Civilisation and Minority
Culture" where he suggests that "When we consider, for instance, the
processes of mass-production and standardisation in the form represented
by the Press, it becomes obviously of sinister significance that they
should be accompanied by a process of leveling-down." The concepts of
mass-production and standardization apply "more disastrously" to films
because their influence is more potent; "they provide now the main form
of recreation in the civilised world; and they involve surrender, under
conditions of hypnotic receptivity, to the cheapest emotional appeals,
appeals the more insidious because they are associated with a compellingly
vivid illusion of actual life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 One gathers from the characterizations above that the typical
 mass-culture consumer in the 1920s and 1930s is assumed to be an
 emotionally stunted, passive receptacle with an endless capacity to be
 filled with cheap, standardized media that reproduce in its readers and
 viewers (in a mode assumed to be nondialogical) standardized or stock
 responses. The mass-culture consumer is essentially the imprint of all
 he or she consumes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The class location of the mass-culture consumer appears at this time to be
in flux, sometimes attributed by modernist critics to the middle class,
often to the working or lower classes. The fact is that mass culture in
its various forms was reaching into pockets of all classes. Eliot, in
an essay on the music hall entertainer Marie Lloyd, definitively places
the passive consumption strategies within the middle class, which he
sees as slowly absorbing all classes of society:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
With the decay of the music-hall, with the encroachment of the cheap
and rapid-breeding cinema, the lower classes will tend to drop into the
same state of protoplasm as the bourgeoisie. The working man who went to
the music-hall and saw Marie Lloyd and joined in the chorus was himself
performing part of the act; he was engaged in that collaboration of the
audience with artist which is necessary in all art and most obviously in
dramatic art. He will now go to the cinema, where his mind is lulled by
continuous senseless music and continuous action too rapid for the brain
to act upon, and will receive, without giving, in that same listless
apathy with which the middle and upper classes regard any entertainment
of the nature of art. He will also have lost some of his interest in life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What this essay and this passage show is that Eliot's notion of culture,
unlike Leavis's and Richards's, is inclusive of a broad variety of social
practices at every level of society. Indeed, his later works, <I>The
Idea of a Christian Society</I> and <I>Notes towards the Definition of
Culture</I>, suggest that by culture he means the spiritual fabric that
pervades and motivates all social practices. Eliot's sentimentalizing
of the working man's interactive aesthetic receptivity as shown above
corroborates Richards's and the Leavises' notion that mass culture tends
to pacify its audience into a state of pure receptivity. Significantly,
he suggests that all art is a necessary collaboration between audience
and artist requiring mental effort. Q. D. Leavis supports his notion even
though her language codes a class bias that locates passive, mass-cultural
consumption practices within the lower classes. Her concept of culture
is more closely circumscribed

<B></B>

by literary culture, and she romanticizes a time when the majority of the
population was illiterate and uneducated and therefore "did not complicate
matters by creating a separate semi-literate public to interfere with
the book market." The advantage of such a time was that "the rate of
absorption of the lowest class into the middle class was slow enough to
prevent any lowering of standards" (<I>FRP</I>, 146). Not surprisingly,
her ideal era for literary culture is the eighteenth century, before,
she believes, capitalist industrialism thoroughly penetrated subject
formation and when the bourgeois sector of the public assimilated
itself to the dominant aristocratic culture by adopting and mimicking
aristocratic antimaterialist ideals. The coded language of the following
assertion reveals her class biases: "The difference between the popular
novels of the eighteenth century and of the nineteenth is that the new
fiction instead of requiring its readers to co-operate in a sophisticated
entertainment discovers 'the great heart of the public.' Whereas Sterne's
successors at any rate represent a cultivation of the emotions founded
on a gentle code, Dickens stands primarily for a set of crude emotional
exercises" (<I>FRP</I>, 156). The "gentle" or gentrified code that is
"cultivated" in the organic cultural style of the eighteenth century
is replaced, in her mythology, by "crude," i.e. <I>lower-class</I>,
exploitation of the labile emotions through repetitive "exercises."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
More than the other modernist critics, Q. D. Leavis fulfills Andreas
Huyssen's suggestion that "to reduce all cultural criticism to the
problem of quality is a symptom of the anxiety of contamination."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Q. D. Leavis demonstrates this anxiety when discussing the circulation of
 cheap fiction. Acknowledging that the current taste is for "thrillers,"
 she says, "the reading habit is now often a form of drug habit. In
 suburban side-streets and even village shops it is common to find a
 stock of worn and greasy novels let out at 2d or 3d a volume; and it is
 surprising that a clientele drawn from the poorest class can afford to
 change the books several times a week, or even daily; but so strong is
 the reading habit that they do" (<I>FRP</I>, 7). Q. D. Leavis's anxiety
 focuses on circulation, and specifically the circulation of pleasure (for
 whatever the outcome of taking drugs, the impetus is always the pursuit
 of pleasure), amongst the lower classes, and it is continuous with a
 fear of contamination (note the description of the novels as "greasy")
 <I>by</I> the lower classes. The suburban location is significant in
 that it indicates a <I>rising</I> lower-middle class. However, while it
 is true that modernist criticism demonstrates a high level of anxiety
 with regard to the potential evils of mass-cultural contamination, both
 of society at large and of high-cultural products, it is also true that
 no prior period of English literary criticism was as influenced by
 such a force. With various forms of mass culture such as newspapers,
 penny novels, and pornography gaining great momentum in the second
 half of the nineteenth century, their identification as mass culture
 is an effect of the attempt to segregate what had already begun to
 penetrate the sphere of dominant high culture. Works typically labeled
 high modernism, such as Joyce's <I>Ulysses</I> or Eliot's <I>The Waste
 Land</I>, give us clear evidence of this fact in their incorporation of
 popular music, sentimental fiction, and pornography within frameworks
 that, as modernist critics would have us believe, are larger than the
 sum of their individual parts.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot's and Q. D. Leavis's differing placement of mass-cultural
consumption practices aside, their terminology of reception agrees. Mass
cultural consumers are "lulled" into "listless apathy" by a "set of crude
emotional exercises" that take the form of a "drug habit." Conversely,
consumers of "real" culture "co-operate" on a level with the artist;
they engage in a "collaboration of the audience with artist" that
participates in their "interest." Strikingly, receptivity is reinscribed
into an active role. Where prior to modernist criticism apprehension
of cultural objects was described by "stasis" as opposed to motion and
interest, here such modes are positively described. Continuous with
post-Kantian aesthetic practices, motion and interest were behavioral
patterns negatively associated with lower-class or mass-cultural patterns
of cultural consumption and especially with pornography. What appears
to have occurred is a reversal of tropes by which modernist criticism
effects an appropriation of mass-cultural consumption strategies. The
effect of such an appropriation dramatically reshapes notions not simply
of proper modes of cultural consumption but, in concert with this,
of what constitutes an artistic experience consonant with provoking
the correct mode of receptivity. To phrase the transition in Kantian
terminology, if the nineteenth century was the century of the beautiful,
a time that favored an aesthetic mode of receptivity that set the mind
into "restful contemplation," the twentieth century is the century, as
Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard has told us, of the sublime, favoring an
aesthetic mode of receptivity that "sets the mind into motion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Training for this specific mode of receptivity is the project of
 modernist criticism.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The training of sensibility, or responsiveness, was I. A. Richards's
primary project, and his work in this area deeply informs the Leavises'
work. Richards took a moral stand with regard to aesthetic reception
by declaring, "Bad taste and crude responses are not mere flaws in an
otherwise admirable person. They are actually a root evil from which
other defects follow. No life can be excellent in which the elementary
responses are disorganised and confused" (<I>PLC</I>, 62). Richards
here provides the other side to the mass-culture debate. If the crude
and vulgar are defined by their dulled consumption of mass culture,
so the refined, indeed the morally superior, are given shape through a
keen receptivity and organized response to the conflicting impulses of
genuine art. Art possesses the capability of raising and organizing
the level of response. If, through the onslaught of mass culture,
art should disappear, Richards claims "a biological calamity of the
first order will have occurred . . . the raising of the standard of
response is as immediate a problem as any, and the arts are the chief
instrument by which it may be raised <I>or lowered</I>" (<I>PLC</I>, 234,
emphasis in original). Seven years later, the <I>Scrutiny</I> manifesto
echoes Richards's sentiments and, in a characteristically shrill tone,
declares that "there is a necessary relationship between the quality of
the individual's response to art and his general fitness for a humane
existence," humane in this instance working tautologically in cooperation

<B></B>

with the quality of response as a way of redefining the socially elite,
"polite," or "humane" studies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 In the same issue of <I>Scrutiny</I> F. R. Leavis makes his homage
 to Richards's teaching overt by stating that, with regard to the
 literary mind, "the defect of intelligence is a default on the part of
 sensibility; a failure to keep closely enough in touch with responses
 to particular arrangements of words." In order to avoid this defect
 "Everything must start from and be related to the training of
 sensibility, the kind of training of which Mr. Richards has been
 a pioneer."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Eliot, this sensibility is mostly psychological. Poetry, he remarks
in <I>The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism</I>, "may make us from
time to time a little more aware of the deeper unnamed feelings which
form the substratum of our being, to which we rarely penetrate; for our
lives are mostly a constant evasion of ourselves, and an evasion of the
visible and sensible world."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 This "self-realizing" capacity in accessing high-cultural products is
 central to modernist criticism's ability to persuade a generation of
 readers of a specific mode of "close" reading. The irony of course is
 that the cultural distinction earned through applying specific reading
 practices to literature enacts the very same subject formation supposedly
 gained through reading specific works. The process, not the product,
 informs the subject. Reading oneself into distinction is a circular and
 self-confirming process. While the readerly stance masquerades as a form
 of complete receptivity, a personal void awaiting cultural fulfillment,
 its proactive stance toward that form of receptivity belies the nature
 of reading as an already-formed performance of self that is a set of
 attitudes brought to the text under the name of "receptivity." When
 Leavis declares that "The education of sensibility implied in my phrase,
 'English' as a discipline of thought', aims at fostering the completest
 receptivity that can be attained," his concept of receptive openness
 is not in fact a specular emptiness, as consumers of mass culture
 are conceived, but rather a "disciplined" vessel of sensibility, the
 twentieth-century reconration of Kantian "taste." "Sensibility,"
 Leavis says, "is more complex in its ambiguity than 'taste'."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Conceived as a reader's full mental and sensual dialogic relation with
 a text, sensibility is supposedly "more complex" because it allows
 not only a fuller reciprocity between subject and object but also a
 more complete subject, whose aesthetic judgment is not confined to the
 cognitive faculties but rather to a more complete "sensibility." This
 theory, however, enforces an absolute moral distinction between works
 of high and low literature and puts a premium on originality as that
 which can "shock," rather than "lull," a reader into fresh reception.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernist critics perceive a dialogic relation between text and reader,
and in turn they begin to incorporate shock and invigoration, the senses,
into the consumption practices of highbrow literature. Q. D. Leavis,
for example, differentiates high from low by suggesting that readers of
best-sellers "mistake the relief of meeting the expected, and being given
the desired picture of life, for the exhilarating shock that a novel
coming from the first-class fully aware mind gives." Further she notes,
"The peculiar property of a good novel . . . is the series of shocks
it gives the reader's preconceptions . . . a conration of special
instances which serve as a test for our mental habits and show us the
necessity of revising them" (<I>FRP</I>, 74, 256). Shock here is

<B></B>

conred as a positive experience, as that which sets the reader
into dialogic engagement with the text. It is thus curious to note that
shock in the sensation-literature debate of the 1860s, or shock in the
mass-culture debate of the 1920s and 1930s, is seen as the simple tool
of emotional exploitation, as that which provokes a nonintellectual
response. Yet in high culture this invigoration of mental and emotional
lassitude is a common rallying point in modernist critiques of the
cultural dilemma; only "real" cultural phenomena can arouse the mental
acuity that accompanies shock. Robert Graves and Laura Riding corroborate
the Leavises' ideas in their assessment of modernist poetry that seems
to their "plain reader," or middle- and lowbrow consumer, "to be only
part of the game of high-brow baiting low-brow."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 In their pseudoempirical survey of the difficulty of modernist poetry,
 Graves and Riding conclude that if they are able to find value in the
 difficult and abstruse poetry of the modern day, then their beleaguered
 reader "must admit that what is called our common intelligence is the
 mind in its least active state: that poetry obviously demands more
 vigorous imaginative effort than the plain reader has been willing to
 apply to it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 As is the message throughout modernist criticism, superior and
 "true" cultural media demand an interactive response from their
 audience. "Real" culture demands a full sensibility in all of its
 disciplined ambiguity. Interestingly, the approach to cultural texts
 advocated by modernist critics differs little from the approach to
 pornographic texts taken by readers of pornography who engage their
 "bodily consciousness" or sensibility in a "disciplined" dialogue with
 the text in order to receive a specific, sexual form of invigoration
 from it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In stressing the idea of sensibility, the modernists were resolutely
making a place for the body in cultural consumption and as such were
specifically going against the Kantian aesthetic ideal and the trend of
more than one hundred years of literary criticism. Kant tried to remove
the body from the pure, aesthetic interaction, separating the agreeable,
which could provoke a pleasurable sensation, from the beautiful, which
was a product of mind as opposed to body. In his third <I>Critique</I>
Kant notes that "The universal communicability of a pleasure involves in
its very concept that the pleasure is not one of enjoyment arising out of
mere sensation, but must be one of reflection. Hence aesthetic art, as
art which is beautiful, is one having for its standard the reflective
judgement and not organic sensation" (<I>CJ</I>, 166). Richards's
project is to a large extent a reversal of this notion, specifically
in his insistence that "the Mind-Body problem is strictly speaking no
problem," that mind and body react to stimuli in concert, and that a
purely mental reaction is an impossibility. Directly speaking to this
issue, Richards says:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The identification of the mind with a part of the working of the nervous
system, need involve, theology apart, no disturbance of anyone's attitude
to the world, his fellow-men, or to himself. . . . The nervous system
is the means by which stimuli from the environment or from the body,
result in appropriate behaviour. All mental events occur in the course
of processes of adaptation, somewhere between a stimulus and a response
[<I>PLC</I>, 85].

<B></B>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Richards's psychological training introduces into literary criticism the
idea that the mind and body form one sensibility and that the experience
of literature is the experience of the sensibility in dialogue with the
text. Much in line with D. H. Lawrence's thinking as exemplified in
<I>Lady Chatterley's Lover</I>, Richards suggests that consciousness
is formed in part by a bodily consciousness. "The effects in the body
of almost all stimuli of whatever nature are extraordinarily numerous
and varied," Richards claims. "A lump in the throat, a yearning in the
bowels, horripilation, breathlessness, these are their coarser and more
obvious forms. Usually they are less salient and fuse with the whole
mass of internal sensations to form the <I>coenesthesia</I>, the whole
bodily consciousness" (<I>PLC</I>, 85). Eliot's thinking accords with this
(and simultaneously alludes to Joyce's elaborate bodily scheme for the
chapters of <I>Ulysses</I>) in his notion that a writer of the modern
age is without Sir Philip Sidney's prerogative simply to look into his
heart and write. Rather, "One must look into the cerebral cortex, the
nervous system, and the digestive tracts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Allowing the body to enter the reading (or writing) process is a
 technique already begun by pornographic texts; indeed, pornography
 played a key role in the formation of the idea of a bodily consciousness
 in that it encouraged a reciprocity and cooperation between body and
 mind within the reading framework. Its incorporation via the field
 of psychology into high-cultural reading practices makes way for the
 introduction of the pornographic into high art.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Richards goes further toward positioning a reading practice in opposition
to Kantian principles. He notes that with regard to a Kantian judgment
of taste and "the special form as it is usually described--in terms
of disinterestedness, detachment, distance, impersonality, subjective
universality, and so forth--this form, I shall try to show later, is
sometimes no more than a consequence of the incidence of experience,
a condition or an effect of communication" (<I>PLC</I>, 15). Richards
rejects here the notion that a peculiar aesthetic attitude leads to
a peculiar aesthetic value or a pure art value. Instead, he emphasizes
that the value is to be found in the experience of aesthetic apprehension
itself. Richards, as John Needham has suggested, wants to defeat those
who go to poetry looking for a message.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Instead his work implies that the "meaning" of a poem is what one
 goes through in reading it. The realization produced by a complex
 use of language plays a moral part in the production of the reading
 experience, for what one is realizing in the end is, just as Eliot's
 criticism implies, oneself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Through the self-realizing or subject-forming capacities of culture,
modernist criticism further veers away from a Kantian heritage. Instead
of focusing on the "subjective universality" (to use Richards's
characterization of the Kantian stance) of the aesthetic experience,
Eliot, Richards, and Leavis each stress the individual particularity of
every aesthetic interaction. Where seeking a universal consensus was an
important part of the Kantian project, indeed one of the foundational
reasons for his aesthetic critique, universality in the modernist era
comes to be associated with mass culture and, as such, is seen as a
negative. In fact, for Eliot, good poetry evokes feelings or a response
that cannot be universally communicated. This is an absolute reversal
of Kantian aesthetic philosophy whose very grounds of judgment rely on the

<B></B>

communicability of such experiences in order to promote community. The
response of modernist criticism to the seemingly universal appeal of mass
culture is to stress the particular and the individual. Paradoxically,
these critics use the individualist, capitalist ethic to t what they
see as capitalist incursions into the soul. Leavis is a fierce defender
of particularity and sees in D. H. Lawrence a model for both writer and
critic. "Without a sustained, tense and living relation with the concrete,
with the particulars of experience," Leavis says, "the respectability
and the erudition are barren. D. H. Lawrence had a genius for it, and
his importance as a 'thinker' is that he could command the concrete by
creative art" ("LM," 28). The critical assessment, like the creative
production, should lead to the particular, not to the universal. If the
critical act of assessing art is to be instrumental to self-realization,
it will need to lead to sensuous and material particularity in
order to fall into accord with the individualist ethic of consumer
capitalism. Reading becomes as constitutive of individual identity as
buying a car (and not so different). "Judgement" is reconred from the
Kantian norm as "not a matter of abstraction," but "involv[ing] particular
immediate acts of choice," and this choice is dependent on the "free and
delicate receptivity to fresh experience" that forms one's sensibility.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sensibility is then apotheosized into a replacement for the famous
Kantian concept of genuine aesthetic interaction leading to the "free
play of reason" (<I>CJ</I>, 39, 58, 88, 107). Leavis declares instead
that aesthetic apprehension should lead to "the free play of sensibility."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The free play of sensibility is in turn a concept that accommodates,
 perhaps even mimics, the kind of bodily incitation/interrogation provoked
 by the pornographic. This mode of aesthetic apprehension is indeed a
 consumption practice, epitomized in Leavis's quite famous notion that
 the critic's task "is to enter into possession of the given poem (let
 us say) in its concrete fullness, and his constant concern is never
 to lose his completeness of possession, but rather to increase it. In
 making value-judgements (and judgements as to significance), implicitly
 or explicitly, he does so out of that completeness of possession and
 with that fullness of response."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Here Leavis's critical approach, a model of appropriation and
 consumption that like Richards's is a "reductive hermeneutic wherein
 human consciousness moves towards its own completion through the mere
 possession of a cultural object," demonstrates not just its complicity
 in accommodating the acquisitive practices of modernist literature in
 its appropriation of pornographic tropes and images but indeed a mirror
 image of that impulse (<I>LM</I>, 182). The appropriative impulse is
 one of the defining characteristics of both modernist literature, in
 its incorporation of mass-cultural works including pornography into
 an aesthetico-moral framework, and of modernist criticism, in its
 notion that the reader literally incorporates his reading into his
 morally evaluative person. The pornographic or bodily impulse of the
 mass-cultural consumer is acknowledged by modernist criticism only to
 be subsumed into its larger, ethical scheme.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernist criticism quite significantly evokes, and/or mimics, the forms
it evaluates in Eliot's and Richards's similar concepts of irony and
complexity. Richards's theory of irony and disinterest is one of the
centerpieces of his literary theory and is

<B></B>

evocative of the very techniques used by James Joyce and Aubrey Beardsley
in incorporating an explicit sexual aesthetic into their works. Richards's
theory begins with the concept that every reader is the subject of certain
impulses triggered in response to the stimuli generated by whatever he
or she is reading.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Irony is a favored mode because it orders impulses in such a way
 that they provide their own system of checks and balances. "Irony,"
 Richards says, "consists in the bringing in of the opposite, the
 complementary impulses" (<I>PLC</I>, 250). In poetry of the highest
 order, says Richards, "the most obvious feature is the heterogeneity
 of the distinguishable impulses," which are "more than heterogeneous,
 they are opposed" (<I>PLC</I>, 250). This opposition is necessary to a
 moral and physical sense of balance, which is described by Richards as
 <I>disinterest</I>, a response brought about most effectively through
 the oppositional impulses of irony:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The equilibrium of opposed impulses, which we suspect to be the
ground-plan of the most valuable aesthetic responses, brings into play
far more of our personality than is possible in experiences of a more
defined emotion. We cease to be oriented in one direction; more facets
of the mind are exposed and, what is the same thing, more aspects of
things are able to affect us. To respond, not through one narrow channel
of interest, but simultaneously and coherently through many, is to be
<I>disinterested</I> in the only sense of the word which concerns us
here. A state of mind which is not disinterested is one which sees things
only from one standpoint or under one aspect. At the same time since
more of our personality is engaged the independence and individuality
of other things becomes greater. We seem to see "all round them," to
see them as they really are; we see them apart from any one particular
interest which they may have for us. Of course without some interest we
should not see them at all, but the less any one particular interest is
indispensable, the more <I>detached</I> our attitude becomes. And to say
that we are <I>impersonal</I> is merely a curious way of saying that our
personality is more <I>completely</I> involved [<I>PLC</I>, 252-3].

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here Richards helps to articulate more fully the self-actuating principles
behind Arnold's impulse to "see the object as in itself it really is."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Interestingly, Richards's desired outcome for the reader is that any
 impulse toward action be stifled by the competing impulses so that
 the reader remain in a state of engaged but static detachment. As he,
 C. K. Ogden, and James Wood state in <I>The Foundations of Aesthetics</I> , the superabundance of expression "produces an equilibrium
 of impulses, which prevents the fundamental tendency from breaking
 forth into overt action."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 In that most of his work appears between the two world wars, Richards's
 concern for preventing the canalization of interest and any subsequent
 selfish action can be seen to enact a political analogy. Richards
 himself makes that analogy clear in references throughout his works
 to the political events of the time. Thus the need for an ironic
 equilibration of impulses is given stronger impetus by the reminder
 that "The extent to which reference is interfered with by needs and
 desires is underestimated even by those who, not having yet forgotten
 the events of 1914-1918, are most skeptical as to the independence
 of opinions and desires. Even the most ordinary and familiar

<B></B>

objects are perceived as it pleases us to perceive them rather than as
they are" (<I>PLC</I>, 263-4). And so he suggests:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Our impulses must have some order, some organization, or we do not
live ten minutes without disaster. In the past, Tradition, a kind of
Treaty of Versailles assigning frontiers and spheres of influence to the
different interests, and based chiefly upon conquests, ordered our lives
in a moderately satisfactory manner. But Tradition is weakening. Moral
authorities are not as well backed by the beliefs as they were; their
sanctions are declining in force. We are in need of something to take
the place of the old order. Not in need of a new balance of power, a
new arrangement of conquests, but of a League of Nations for the moral
ordering of impulses; a new order based on conciliation, not on attempted
suppression.

Like many of the eighteenth-century philosophies of taste or the
aesthetic, this model is alert to the dangers of one's self-controlling
or self-starting impulses. Art offers a neutralization of these impulses
by putting them into a complex network of competitive relationships
so that any selfish, impulsive action that might endanger the whole
is preempted. Richards clearly reveals here the social and political
ideals at stake in his notion of irony and complexity. His stress on
the ironic equilibrium of contending forces provides a model, as Steven
Connor has noted, "not only of the well-adjusted person, but also of
the well-balanced liberal state."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 The balancing of pluralistic impulses creates an irony that Linda
 Hutcheon describes as used to set up "an egalitarian, indeed,
 democratizing tension between emotions and even meanings."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In contrast with Eliot and Richards, F. R. Leavis does not favor irony. As
Schwartz claims, he distrusts it on the basis that it "suggests a lack
of seriousness or intensity towards oneself or one's subject matter."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Instead of seeking an equilibrium based on complex and competing
 impulses as arranged by the author, Leavis looks for a unity based
 on the consciousness of the reader. Thus in his critique of <I>The
 Waste Land</I> he approves of the "rich disorganization" of the poem
 on the basis that "The unity the poem aims at is that of an inclusive
 consciousness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 That consciousness, Leavis admits, is an elite one. "The poem in any
 case exists," Leavis says, "and can exist, only for an extremely limited
 public equipped with special knowledge." The limited audience of <I>The
 Waste Land</I> is a symptom, Leavis argues, "of the state of culture
 that produced the poem. Works expressing the finest consciousness of
 the age in which the word 'high-brow' has become current are almost
 inevitably such as to appeal only to a tiny minority."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 This minority is, however, central to Leavis's solution to what he
 sees as the social problems of his day. They have a duty to work toward
 "controlling the machine."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 The minority, as he conceives it, will be cultivated in the universities
 and upon them will depend "the implicit standards that order the finer
 living of an age."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Demonstrating the will to order that he shares with Eliot, Leavis outlines
the university as the center of the "unified sensibility" against "the
machine" that will in turn provide an ordering center to society as
a whole:

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

There can be no control [of the machine] without (to revert to the
metaphors of "organism" and "mind") a higher coordination. An urgent
necessary work, consequently, is to explore the means of bringing the
various kinds of specialist knowledge and training into effective relation
with informed general intelligence, humane culture, social conscience and
political will. Indicated here we have the function that is pre-eminently
the university's.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his notion of controlling centers, whether the human psyche controlling
or integrating sensible consciousness or the university acting as the
controlling center of the sensibility of a civilization (two allegorical
models of the mind-body paradigm), Leavis reverts to championing writers
whose works demonstrate the complexity of the modern situation in a
resolute order. This is perhaps one of the major reasons why Leavis so
fervently endorses D. H. Lawrence's work throughout his career. Lawrence's
work, according to Leavis, "is an immense body of living creation in
which a supreme vital intelligence is the creative spirit--a spirit
informed by an almost infallible sense for health and sanity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 One can see in the language here the political paradigm set up in his
 philosophy of the university's role in society. The vital intelligence,
 or the minority, university-educated culture, is responsible for
 ordering or giving shape to the "immense body of living creation" that
 is the masses. In Leavis's model the entire organism, or social body,
 is represented but only under the ordering force of the "supreme vital
 intelligence," minority culture. Leavis's metaphysic is fully informed by
 Lawrence's, and each distrusts the abstractions of intelligence. Thus by
 "vital" Leavis means to imply intelligence's debt to the entire organism,
 their interconnectedness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Leavis's sensuously empirical approach to literature (what Terry Eagleton
has famously called "<I>Scrutiny's</I> naive sensuous empiricism"
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
), his idea that criticism is a matter of "sensibility, of responding
sensitively and with precise discrimination to the words on the page,"
accords with Lawrence's work in that this sensuous empiricism is given
ontological status.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Through his work with Lawrence, Leavis comes to privilege being
 over knowing, and from this springs his zealously antitheoretical
 attitude. Stressing the empirically concrete, Leavis praises Lawrence,
 "His gift lay, not in thinking, but in experiencing, and in fixing and
 evoking in words the feelings and perceptions that seemed to him the
 most significant. Lawrence's commentary on experience, his doctrine,
 must be approached by way of the concrete, the successful art" ("LM,"
 26). Leavis, too, shies away from the abstract or ideological in
 favor of the concrete. Yet as Terry Eagleton has noted, "To combat
 'ideology,' <I>Scrutiny</I> pointed to 'experience'--as though that,
 precisely, were not ideology's homeland."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
Leavis attempted to avoid the ideological by focusing on the particular
and the concrete. He nevertheless supported these incursions with
the notions of health and vitality that were eventually to become
as self-confirming as any ideology. Leavis's approach, then, like
Richards's, is a synthesized amalgam of idealism and empiricism in which
"The inherent contradictions converge in the difficulty of comprehending
a living interrelatedness through a hybrid form which is polarized, on
the one side, towards the observation of crude facticity or the content
of empirical reality and, on the other

<B></B>

side, towards the atemporal conceptualisation of human capacities"
(<I>LM</I>, 7). This contradiction is borne throughout Leavis's work
and is in many ways indicative of the powerful hold over his thinking
that Lawrence's work exercised. The "vital" and "organic" originality of
Lawrence's work is contrasted by Leavis to "the contrivances of Joyce,"
whose "insistent will and ingenuity"
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 create a literature in which "the spurious, mechanical manipulation
 is pervasive," and the "cosmopolitan" (i.e., not agriculturally based
 and therefore corrupt) project is "so far from promising a revival
 of cultural health, [it] is (it does not need Lawrence's nostril to
 detect) a characteristic symptom of dissolution."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Leavis consistently chooses Lawrence's work over Joyce's as an example of
 moral and social health that he sees as the critic's duty to safeguard.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All three critics take the concept of cultural health quite seriously, and
the definition of "health" enables each to develop his literary theory. To
Richards, "The critic is as closely occupied with the health of the mind
as the doctor with the health of the body. . . . the healthiest mind
is that capable of securing the greatest amount of value" (<I>PLC</I>,
35). His concern is rooted in his psychological training, and his method
is to keep the mind so actively engaged through disparate impulses that it
brings into play all of the bodily consciousness. It is at once a personal
and yet deeply social prescription, as his use of irony made clear.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot's notion of cultural health, as displayed most prominently in
his concept of the "dissociation of sensibility," has a good deal to
do with divided class sensibilities. In <I>Notes towards the Definition
of Culture</I> he says that "class itself possesses a function, that of
maintaining that part of the total culture of the society which pertains
to that class. We have only to keep in mind, that in a healthy society
this maintenance of a particular level of culture is to the benefit not
merely of the class which maintains it, but of the society as a whole."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Under what might be called the "separate but equal" policy, Eliot
 confirms that each class has its own individual culture that contributes
 to the "healthy society." This separateness is the result of a split
 Eliot places in the beginning of the middle-class rise to dominance
 after the English Civil War. He notes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
What I see, in the history of English poetry, is not so much daemonic
possession as the splitting up of personality. If we say that one of
these partial personalities which may develop in the national mind is
that which manifested itself in the period between Dryden and Johnson,
then what we have to do is to re-integrate it: otherwise we are likely
to get only successive alternations of personality.

The reintegration, Eliot's criticism intimates, must be brought
about through the amalgamation of disparate physical, intellectual,
and social experience through which a "unified sensibility" can be
reconciled. Part of this reintegration, then, is in reconciling disparate
class aesthetics. The modernist aesthetic, with its integration of
low-cultural, pornographic representations into higher-cultural discourses
of varying intellectual, social, and moral import, enacts this very
process. It allows the mythologized, "whole," social personality/body
to be represented. One aspect of Eliot's

<B></B>

approval and lifelong critical endorsement of Joyce is the high
profile given to order in <I>Ulysses</I>. Eliot's strong advocacy of
sensibility in reading, i.e., of the part played by the body and emotions
in the reading process, is a signal of the effect that pornographic and
mass-cultural reading practices were having on high-cultural practices. It
is also a determining factor in the continuing validation of the modern
reading experience's consonance with those practices.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As with other modernist critics, Eliot both participated in creating
and was created by a platform for the subsumption of the pornographic
into the aesthetic. The circular process of literary criticism gained
particular momentum in the first half of the twentieth century, however,
as university study of English became not just a standard but a strong
part of the university and, hence, the middle-class establishment. Just
as literature itself received a central place in the university, even
as it was being marginalized by culture at large, so criticism began
to enjoy a powerful, if imaginary, relationship with the literature
it critiqued. By the 1950s and 1960s, the education of aesthetic
reception was so widespread that the medical and legal regulation of
obscenity that dominated the century from the 1850s to the 1950s began
to be dismantled in favor of trusting a reader's own ability to judge
and handle an explicit sexual representation. The Obscene Publications
Act of 1959 revised English obscenity law to say that "publication of
the article in question is justified as being for the public good on
the ground that it is in the interests of science, literature, art or
learning, or of other objects of general concern."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 The admissibility of literary merit as one of the criteria for obscenity
 marks a revolutionary shift in the boundaries between pornography
 and art in the United Kingdom, a shift quickly mirrored in the United
 States. This is in large part due to the successes of university literary
 critics and literature programs in making reading practices that include
 the body part of an ethical exploration as opposed to a simple, sexual,
 physical exploration.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
F. R. Leavis played a large part in identifying a reader's sensibility,
or bodily consciousness, with ethical exploration. "Literary criticism,"
Leavis says, "enters overtly into questions of emotional hygiene and
moral value--more generally (there seems no adequate phrase) of spiritual
health."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Leavis's concern for cultural health, as his attitude towards mass
 culture indicates, has a good deal to do with the ability of individuals
 to respond keenly and fully to the representations of literature. A
 reader's receptivity, as opposed to the Kantian model of aesthetic
 interaction in which the body is marginalized, ought to include,
 according to Leavis, a "full-bodied response." The reader must embody,
 or take into the body, the text: "Words in poetry invite us, not to
 'think about' and judge but to 'feel into' or 'become'--to realize a
 complex experience that is given in words. They demand, not merely a
 fuller-bodied response, but a completer responsiveness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 This technique, which incorporates the body into the reader's
 imaginative reflections, I would argue, is little different from the
 bodily interrogation/incitation that is the technique of the reader of
 pornography. The body, and a bodily response, is a necessary constituent
 of the modern reading practice. To avoid a purely pornographic reading,
 then, the body must be attached to a greater ethical project, and that
 project is both the equation of sex with health (a project that

<B></B>

Leavis overtly rejects, but in which he nevertheless participates) and
the reconciliation of the body with the intellectual, moral, and social
aspects of existence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 The body is incorporated in a way that diminishes its power while
 increasing its visibility through the other faculties.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The creation of a "unified sensibility" touted by modernist critics is
both this integration of faculties and a greater project of educating
the sensibilities of as many members of society as possible in order
to create a cultural consensus among people on the basis of their own
intimate subjectivity. The project works against class on the idea that
all members of society have a right to claim and develop their sensible
faculties, and indeed occasionally in his work Leavis speaks out against
class discrimination. In fact, Leavis's role in the establishment of
institutionalized literary studies and the increasingly prevalent view of
him as the century has progressed as a conservative elitist has tended to
blur the fact that his stance was, in the early decades of this century,
quite liberating. As Peter Miles and Malcolm Smith have commented,
"To, for example, the university-educated grammar school product of
mid-century Britain Leavis meant the possibility of participation in
authority through a route which seemed dependent on mind and sensibility
rather than class, inheritance or institutional background."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 Leavis was involved in the development of a mode of cultural distinction
 separate from the traditional routes of the nineteenth century, and
 again, part of that cultural distinction was based on the ability of
 individuals to organize a new relation to themselves, one that required
 them to identify, differentiate, intensify, and harmonize the sensuous
 and the moral/reflective faculties.

Late-twentieth-century readers have unknowingly adopted reading
strategies that in the nineteenth and even the beginning of this
century were attributed to mass-cultural and pornographic reading
practices: they have learned to read with their bodies. This is in part
the work of the omnipresent but subterranean pornographic discourse
since its mass-cultural emergence in the eighteenth century. Readers
of pornography were the first to expose their bodies to a personal
interrogation/incitation, a dialogue with their own bodily consciousness,
even as Kant was writing against the admissibility of the body into
any "true" or "pure" aesthetic interaction. That pornographic reading
and representational practices made their way into high-cultural
modernist literature and criticism in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth century is a tribute both to pornography's (as one example
of a mass-cultural medium) ability to exert pressure on high-cultural
aesthetic practices, and to modernist writers' and critics' ability to
appropriate such practices in a way that subsumed them within, or at
least reconciled them to, high culture. Just as the lines between the
pornographic and the aesthetic have been softened and redistributed in
this century, collapsing many of the distinctions set up between them in
the eighteenth century, so the lines between mass and high culture have
become blurred. Due in part to the efforts of modernist criticism and
the project of English literature studies in general, the site of social
accountability has been transferred from the realm of production to the
realm of consumption, from book to reader, from canvas to viewer. The
project of literary studies in our century is rooted in the ironic belief
that if we know how to read, then

<B></B>

what we read cannot affect us. Obscenity, in a paradox that asserts a
complicated victory for Kantian aesthetics in its effort to translate
sensations into cognitions, is regarded as merely a state of mind, a
reading practice.

The most notorious of such scholars is John Carey; his <I>The
Intellectuals and the Masses</I> (Boston: Faber and Faber, 1992) claims
that the project of modernism in general is one of distinguishing
between the masses and the elite. Andreas Huyssen, <I>After the Great
Divide: Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism</I> (Bloomington: Indiana

culture as simply as Carey but does focus on the tensions created between
different cultural practices associated with high and low culture.

While the tradition of belles-lettres has been a long one and literary
history advanced quickly both in the United States and England in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the professionalization
of literary criticism as a discipline and its enfranchisement in
the university are relatively new developments. Beginning in the late
nineteenth century at Cambridge University (the central theoretical force
of English literature studies through the middle years of this century),
these developments did not truly gain momentum until after World War
I. I. A. Richards, F. R. Leavis, and William Empson, together with
T. S. Eliot, established the intellectual basis of English teaching in
England throughout much of this century. Among these prominent critics,
Leavis is generally recognized as the re who formed the standards
of university teaching in English; see Barry Cullen, "'I Thought I
Had Provided Something Better'--F. R. Leavis, Literary Criticism and
Anti-Philosophy," in <I>The British Critical Tradition</I>, ed. Gary Day
(New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993), 188. Eliot, an honorary fellow
of Magdalene College, was the only member of the group not to teach
at Cambridge, having declined an offer from Richards to do so. He was,
nevertheless, a celebrated force there, delivering the Clark lectures in
1926, and his poetry and criticism were studied seriously with all the
zeal that Leavis's teaching could bring to them; see Bernard Bergonzi,
<I>Exploding</I> <I>English: Criticism, Theory, Culture,</I> (Oxford:
Clarendon Press, 1990), 43-4. Leavis himself enjoyed a tenuous
relationship with Cambridge, which for many years placed him on its
fringes; while he characterized his own work as in opposition to the
academic establishment, it is important to remember that by the 1950s, if
not before, he was "the new establishment" (Pamela McCallum, <I>Literature
and Method: Towards a Critique of I. A. Richards, T. S. Eliot, and
F. R. Leavis</I> [Dublin: Gill and MacMillan Humanities Press, 1983],
155, hereafter abbreviated <I>LM</I>). One measure of Leavis's impact on
reading in this century can be found in <I>Roget's Thesaurus of English
Words and Phrases</I>, ed. Susan M. Loyd (New York: Penguin Books, 1982),
266, where the word "Leavisite" is listed as a synonym for "interpreter."

By the word "culture" in this context I am referring to both society
at large as well as the body of cultural artifacts viewed as valuable

its maintenance.

Modernist critics are responsible for augmenting the meaning of
sensibility in this century. Whereas before sensibility had primarily
meant the power of sensation or emotion as distinguished from cognition
and will, Eliot's reconration of the term in his phrase "dissociation
of sensibility" implied the conjunction of thought and feeling. In
Eliot, Richards, and Leavis the term almost always implies an organic
relationship between the body's senses and the mind's faculties.

Richards explains impulses in <I>Principles of Literary Criticism</I>
as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The process in the course of which a mental event may occur, a process
apparently beginning in a stimulus and ending in an act, is what we have
called an impulse. In actual experience single impulses of course never
occur. Even the simplest human reflexes are very intricate bundles of
mutually dependent impulses, and in any actual human behaviour the number
of simultaneous and connected impulses occurring is beyond estimation
[<I>PLC</I>, 86].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Richards a stimulus

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
must not be conceived as an alien intruder which thrusts itself upon us
and, after worming a devious way through our organism as through a piece
of cheese, emerges at the other end as an act. Stimuli are only received
if they serve some need of the organism and the form which the response
to them takes depends only in part upon the nature of the stimulus, and
much more upon what the organism "wants," i.e. the state of equilibrium
of its multifarious activities [<I>PLC</I>, 87].

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hart Crane had an infuriating way of writing a poem. Typically, after
drinking copiously, he would put a 78 on a hand-cranked Victrola and play
it "a dozen, two dozen, three dozen times" while alternately banging away
on a typewriter and loudly declaiming the same line of verse repeatedly.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 To his friends' horror, the Victrola was indispensable--Crane claimed
 it gave him "intimacy with la Muse"--and he peremptorily refused
 every polite request to change his habits or at least to confine his
 cacophonous writing sessions to daylight hours (<I>V</I>, 173). Quite
 the contrary. He forced those around him to adapt. While a house
 guest of Harry Crosby's in France, for instance, he one day greeted
 his reluctant patron with an ukase. "Columbia, loud! ! !" he snapped,
 presuming that the millionaire Crosby would instantly go fetch him new
 phonograph needles (<I>V</I>, 584).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hart Crane's phonograph fetish has received only passing attention from
his many critics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 This oversight is unsurprising. In his day, Crane was infamous for such
 antisocial eccentricities as throwing typewriters out of windows and
 brawling with taxi drivers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The anecdotes about Crane and his Victrola that appear in such places
 as Harry Crosby's diaries may be vivid, but they vie for a reader's
 attention with a host of other memorable incidents featuring Crane's
 wild, dissipated antics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Indeed, Crane's self-destructive behavior (he ultimately committed
 suicide in 1932 at the age of thirty-two) has secured him

<B></B>

the popular reputation of an American <I>po&egrave;te maudit</I>, as
notable for his biography as for the quality of his verse. R. W. B. Lewis
long ago pointed out that this reputation has tempted unwary critics to
misconstrue Crane's intent and accomplishments; since Lewis's magisterial
1967 monograph on Crane, scholars have been loath to dwell upon the
details of Crane's life without carefully justifying their introduction
of such material.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Lewis's cautions would seem apropos in the case of Crane's Victrola. Why
 should Crane's gramophone obsession matter any more than his other
 striking but ultimately rather trivial habits, such as cossack dancing
 at parties or cruising waterfront gay bars under the name Christopher
 Marlowe?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Over the last decade, thanks in large part to a number of influential
scholarly works dating from the early 1990s, academics have become
increasingly aware of the complex relationship between innovative acoustic
technologies--such as radio, the telephone, and the phonograph--and
gradual but profound shifts in sound's role in modern literature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Specialists in twentieth-century poetry have displayed particular
 interest in this emergent branch of scholarship since it offers an
 appealing, historically grounded alternative to the many, aridly
 formalist treatments of sound in poetry currently available. Several
 recent studies have gone so far as to posit that the "aurality" of
 a poem is not an ahistorical characteristic that can be adequately
 or exhaustively described by traditional schemes for scanning
 verse. Instead, aurality ought to be understood as an attribute that
 undergoes constant modification in its nature and function from period
 to period and from writer to writer.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 In other words, such stock-in-trade formulas as "anapestic,"
 "alliteration," and "slant rhyme" should be seen as revealing little
 about a given poem unless one has first established the precise place
 that sound occupies in its author's poetics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When viewed in the light of these developments in the study of poetry,
the fact that Hart Crane, a self-styled "Pindar of our machine age,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 invariably wrote to the accompaniment of a "machine that sings"
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 suddenly appears much more significant than heretofore
 appreciated. Indeed, I will be arguing that Crane's singing machine, the
 Victrola, left a profound mark on all aspects of his poetry, that is,
 on everything from the microtexture of his verse to its transcendental
 aspirations. Moreover, insofar as most secondary literature treating
 the links between literary experimentation and innovations in acoustic
 technology has concentrated on the impact of radio,
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 this article, by singling out Crane's writing ritual for commentary, will
 demonstrate the need to consider the influence of <I>all</I> aural media
 if we are ever fully to understand modernism, that curious interlude
 in American letters that occurs after the invention of the phonograph
 but prior to the widespread availability of television and the LP.

Hart Crane did not write poems in a linear fashion. He wrote them
piecemeal, "pell-mell" (<I>V</I>, 363). While "intimate with la Muse"
he composed individual phrases that, only afterwards, when sober, would
he slowly, with great difficulty, begin to

<B></B>

assemble into discrete lyrics. Malcolm Cowley recalls a moment during
the gestation period for what would eventually become the opening lines
of Crane's lyric "Passage." During a Fourth of July party at his friend
Slater Brown's, Crane

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
sat by the lilacs in the dooryard, meditatively pouring a box of salt
on the phonograph. . . . One of the wives, pregnant and stark sober,
heard him repeating time and time again: "Where the cedar leaf divides
the sky . . . I was promised an improved infancy."

Crane would sometimes hang on to a gem of a phrase for months before
finding a home for it, or multiple homes, as in the case of a phrase like
"The everlasting eyes of Pierrot, / Or, of Gargantua the laughter," which
appears in both "The Bridge of Estador" (<I>CP</I>, 175) and "Praise
for an Urn" (<I>CP</I>, 8). Although these particular phrases may have
transparently literary origins, Emerson and Rabelais respectively, more
often than not, according to Crane's biographer John Unterecker, the

 Sometimes critics have been alert to this fact, as in the case of Crane's
 poem "Virginia," which reworks the 1920s hit "What Do You Do Sunday,

What would such an investigation teach us? We would have a better sense of
Crane's indebtedness to particular sources as well as an improved sense
of how Crane went about transforming such source material into lyric
poetry. Kenneth Rexroth, for instance, reports that while living in the
basement at 45 Grove Street, in an apartment immediately below Crane's,
the poet drove him nearly to distraction by playing Bert Williams's
campy Prohibition satire "The Moon Shines on the Moonshine" nonstop.

Crane has reproduced the distillery scene from the song's chorus,
albeit oddly inflected. Knowing that he has reworked Bert Williams's
tune, we have a valuable opportunity, through a close comparison, to
reconstruct Crane's involuted thought process much more fully than usually
possible. (Such opportunities are rare because of Crane's characteristic
compression, intensity, and obliquity. Although Crane once claimed that
his poetry operated by a consistent "logic of metaphor," Lee Edelman
has shown that this "logic" in practice results in a thicket of poetic
tropes so snarled, so dense that one can despair of ever comprehensively
analyzing its purpose and function.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While listening to Williams, Crane seems to have fixated upon the
words "the moon shines on the moonshine." That line's wordplay hinges
upon breaking one word, "moonshine," back down into its components,
"moon" and "shine." Alternatively, one could say that a compound word
"dissolves" into its constituent elements--an especially apt metaphor,
given that "moonshine," or distilled alcohol, is itself a solvent
(like "benzine"). In his poem Crane reflects this notion thematically
by describing the world outside the "mills" as a world "dissolved"
by moonlight. He further pursues this train of thought by mimicking
the linguistic process of "dissolution" evident in the song. That is,
taking his cue from the line "the cobwebs cob" in his source text, he
juxtaposes words so as to suggest that the larger ones are decaying
into smaller ones: "whitely" loses the <I>t</I> and <I>y</I> to become
"while"; "dissolve" drops its fore and aft phonemes leaving simply the
word "all"; "machinery" is distilled down to the word "sure."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One might say that the shining, liquid moonlight that opens "Lachrymae
Christi" signals a poetic process of decreation in which words lose their
integrity and begin to operate otherwise than as "sure machinery." Words
are thereby restored to a kind of virginal purity (a "whiteness"), or
rather, an uncontaminated, raw materiality subject to the poet's artful
rearrangements or reconstitution.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 This poetic fantasy of escape from conventional restrictions on
 language use, red as standing outside industrial "mills" in a
 nighttime landscape of word-magic, finds its license and inspiration in
 Bert Williams's song. That is, while listening to "Moon Shines on the
 Moonshine," Crane discovered a bundle of age-old poetic <I>topoi</I>
 deployed in a thought-provoking fashion: inebriation, metamorphosis,
 escape from regulation ("far from . . . cops"), and the dream of
 the blank slate. He then elaborated, baroquely, upon these implicit
 ideas. Much like Joyce throughout the Sirens episode of <I>Ulysses</I>,
 Crane seizes upon an ephemeral product of mass culture and, sensing
 beneath its glossy surface a wealth of expressive possibilities, lovingly
 transforms it to suit his own ends.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This example suggests that if one knew when Crane listened to which 78s
and if one could then match that playlist with a detailed chronology of
when he was writing which lyrics, the result would undoubtedly be a much
better explanation of why he wrote what he did. Would such a large-scale
project be feasible, however? We do have a general sense of his musical
preferences for his all-night writing frenzies. On

<B></B>

the one hand, he favored grand, even bombastic, classical music: excerpts
from Richard Wagner, C&eacute;sar Franck's <I>Variations symphoniques</I>,
and Antonin Dvor&#157; &aacute;k's <I>New World Symphony</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 On the other hand, he listened to popular songs from musicals like
 <I>Hit the Deck</I> or by stars like Sophie Tucker.

 He was particularly fond of "torch songs."

 Apparently, much of the final draft of his long poem and masterpiece
 <I>The Bridge</I> was prepared while listening to her music, and in

 records of hers over and over at such volume that visitors were unable
 to carry on conversations.

Unfortunately, we lack the necessary, precise timelines to link these
various artists, composers, and pieces with particular Crane poems. Hard
evidence, as in Rexroth's account, is scarce. Moreover, since Crane
wrote only disconnected verses while listening to his Victrola, not
entire poems, the prodigious archival work required would likely yield
only scattered insights and further, local close readings. There would be
cumulative benefits, of course, insofar as we would learn more about the
various ways in which Crane's verse operates, but there is no guarantee
that we would be able to arrive at global interpretations of complete
Crane lyrics, let alone of his poetry <I>in toto</I>. "Lachrymae Christi,"
for instance, after the lines that I have been analyzing, veers into
a macabre description of flowers on a hillside that bears little or no
obvious relation to "The Moon Shines on the Moonshine":

One can detect hints here of a musical subtext. The adjective "Twanged"
and the possible pun on "trilling" in the awkward phrase "Are trillion"
might indicate that Crane is attempting a synaesthetic experiment in which
the image of a profusion of red flowers represents a visual equivalent
to a vivid, brassy passage in a musical piece. What that piece might
be, though, is anyone's guess. Even if we knew what it was, we would be
only a small step closer to understanding one of Crane's most recondite
poems. Thirty further lines remain, including such inscrutable statements
as "Let sphinxes from the ripe / Borage of death have cleared my tongue"
(<I>CP</I>, 19). However fascinating the direct connections between
Crane's poems and the specific songs or compositions to which he listened
while writing them, a different starting point than the purely inductive
is necessary if we are to understand why recorded music mattered so much
to Crane and, in turn, how it affected all, not some, of his verse. Absent
the raw data necessary for genetic criticism of the kind that has proved

<B></B>

so informative in the study of <I>Finnegans Wake</I>, we will have to
take a more roundabout approach.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What does Hart Crane himself have to say on the subject of music and
poetry? He not only frequently expressed a desire to model his poetry
on the most advanced music of his day, he was also given to describing
his verse in musical terms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 For instance, he labels his early lyric "The Marriage of Faustus and
 Helen" a "pseudo-symphonic construction toward an absolute beauty"
 (<I>OM</I>, 93), his long poem <I>The Bridge</I> "a symphony with an
 epic theme" (<I>CPSL</I>, 254), "Harbor Dawn" "a legato" (<I>CPSL</I>,
 249), and "Cutty Sark" a "fugue" (<I>CPSL</I>, 252). Such tags had real
 force and knowledge behind them--as Samuel Delany and Michael Sharp
 have shown, Crane was not merely using them to pay lip service to the
 Paterian tenet that all poetry aspires to the condition of music.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 We even know where and when he first involved himself seriously in study
 of the art form. While living in Cleveland after his first stint in
 New York (1920-23), Crane's chief connection to the international
 avant-garde was via the Cleveland Orchestra, then under the direction
 of the world-famous conductor Ernest Bloch. From Bloch, Crane learned
 to relish the latest in European music.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 He became an ardent admirer of such composers as Vincent d'Indy, Erik
 Satie, Aleksandr Scriabin, and Igor Stravinsky. Later in life, wherever
 he traveled, Crane continued to seek out innovative music of whatever
 kind, whether it be Times Square jazz or the microtonal, percussive
 compositions of Edgar Var&egrave;se.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 From his Cleveland days onward--that is, during his poetic maturity,
 during the years in which he wrote the bulk of the poetry for which he
 is remembered--modern music remained a constant touchstone for Crane's
 achievements in his own medium, verse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given this background, one can conclude that Crane had definite reasons
for insisting upon writing with a Victrola's accompaniment. Moreover,
those reasons are likely to be found by looking beyond his usual
playlist. In the 1920s, recordings of avant-garde music were
difficult to purchase commercially. Despite his intense admiration
for contemporary experimental composers, when Crane sat down to write
poetry, he usually had to settle for less esoteric fare. The repetitive
playing of a 78, <I>any</I> 78, seems to have been the <I>sine qua
non</I> of his writing ritual. If he had to forego the delights of,
say, Var&egrave;se's <I>Ionisation</I> in favor of "Moon Shines on the
Moonshine," so be it. (This does not mean, of course, that Crane chose
78s indiscriminately. As we have already seen, he displayed a marked
preference for certain genres. Rather, he simply selected the most
promising 78s from the pool of available options at a given location.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To establish why Crane needed a gramophone in order to write poetry,
the best procedure might be to hunt for something of a paradox: a 78 by
one of Crane's favorite innovative, contemporary composers that would
nonetheless have been readily obtainable during his lifetime. Such a
78 might permit us to appreciate both what Crane saw in modern music
and how it could be adapted for his own, writerly purposes. In the
next section of this article, I concentrate on a unique case that fills
this bill, Maurice Ravel's popular but somewhat bizarre orchestral work
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>. I examine both <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> itself as well
as how it would have been altered as Crane

<B></B>

"performed" it on his Victrola. We will thereby begin to distinguish what
attracted Crane to certain kinds of music as well as how he endeavored
to isolate and accentuate those qualities. We will also begin to discern
that Crane's madness had a method, that he played selected music in a
particular way so as to promote definite poetic ends.

Late in Hart Crane's career, Maurice Ravel's <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> seems
to have become one of his favorite accompaniments for his poetry-writing
marathons.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Crane believed that it provided him with the raw stuff of
 inspiration. "At times dear Gorham," he wrote his friend Gorham Munson,
 "I feel an enormous power in me--that seems almost supernatural. . . . I
 can say this now with perfect equanimity because I am notoriously
 drunk and the Victrola is still going with that glorious 'Bolero'"
 (<I>OM</I>, 92).
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> has an undeserved reputation for being nothing
more than an expression of mounting excitement as one nears the
climactic moment of orgasm/death. Crane, one might conjecture, loved
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> for no better reason than that it conjured up
images of lithe toreadors engaged in the kind of life-or-death athletic
struggles that he found powerfully erotic. He was, after all, the sort
of man who went to boxing matches not because of sport--he considered
the game itself often rather "boresome"--but because the spectacle of
"sublime machines of human muscle-play" got him "very heated" (<I>OM</I>,
35). Ravel, however, is not a simple composer, and, as I have said,
Crane had extensive, intimate knowledge of contemporary European music.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> is a fifteen-minute orchestral piece written in
3/4 time. It consists of eighteen repetitions of an initial theme and
countertheme, gradually and steadily increasing in volume from barely
audible to deafening. Two measures of percussion interrupt the melody
after every second countertheme. Ravel signals the impending conclusion
of the piece by suddenly modulating the tonality. The last countertheme
segues into a thunderous, dissonant crescendo.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his classic analysis of <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, Claude
L&eacute;vi-Strauss argues that it attempts to work through a basic
opposition between symmetry and asymmetry. The rhythm is ternary, but its
melodic structure of theme and countertheme is binary. L&eacute;vi-Strauss
lays out the intricate, subtle ways in which, over the course of
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, both its rhythm and melody endeavor to bridge that
gap. There is no need to recapitulate L&eacute;vi-Strauss's structural
analysis here beyond noting that he successfully demonstrates that every
strategy intended to camouflage ternaries as binaries (and vice versa)
produces further, often higher-order oppositions between asymmetry and
symmetry, which must then, in turn, be overcome. Caught in this sand trap,
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> cannot progress but only repeat itself, futilely
intensifying its efforts with every iteration. L&eacute;vi-Strauss argues
that the final modulation and crescendo represent a "mythic" solution
to the piece's fundamental self-contradictions. That is, instead of
"reconciling" the contraries, they are "cast out," like a scapegoat. The
silence that follows their

<B></B>

abrupt banishment only <I>feels</I> satisfying to an audience, as
if the quiet were "consecrated to a task well done," when in reality
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> is more or less conceding defeat.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
L&eacute;vi-Strauss's account of <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> depends upon one
fundamental assumption: that its audience listen to the piece continuously
from beginning to end. Hart Crane, however, would not have been able to
listen to <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> in this manner while writing. A ten-inch
78 played on a Victrola lasts no more than five minutes. When Decca
released <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, they had to put it onto two separate
disks. To simulate a live performance of Ravel's piece, Crane would have
to have stood over his Victrola and been poised to flip or switch the 78s
as necessary. But we know that he did nothing of the sort. In the heat
of composing a poem, he always played "the same record grinding over
and over through its five-minute cycles" (<I>V</I>, 253). Crane would,
therefore, have listened to <I>one part</I> of <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>
incessantly, most likely the final third, but not necessarily.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Played in this way, Crane's <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> would have been
very different from the harshly linear work that L&eacute;vi-Strauss
explicates. Instead, Crane's suspended, ever-repeated, partial
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> would have approached the condition of such
1960s minimalist works as Philip Glass's <I>Music in Fifths</I>
and Terry Riley's <I>In C</I>. That is, the original teleology
of <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> would, as in minimalist music, have become
degraded, or irrelevant. Like Glass and Riley, in his "performance" of
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, Crane aims not for a single, completed musical
gesture but a continuous auditory environment. Under these circumstances,
<I>Bol&eacute;ro's</I> crescendo would have had much less "mythic"
impact than in a concert hall--how could it be otherwise, after three
dozen or more repetitions? Crane seems to have sought out, and prolonged
indefinitely, the tension, or "oscillation" as L&eacute;vi-Strauss puts
it, between ternary and binary, asymmetry and symmetry, in Ravel's work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The resulting variant on <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> was, again like a
minimalist work, something of a closed system, or, more grandly, an
attempt at instantiating a timeless, utopian space. Within the endless
loop of Crane's <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, the melody would have remained
powerfully expressive and the pronounced martial rhythm viscerally
stirring, but they also would have remained untainted by the strong
narrative impulse subtending earlier romantic uses of such devices in,
say, Tschaikovsky's <I>1812 Overture</I> or Beethoven's <I>Eroica</I>. The
music thereby marks out a "time" that is "timeless" in the sense that
"What next?" never becomes an issue. One of the most famous pieces of
minimalist music is John Adams's whimsically titled <I>Short Ride in a
Fast Machine</I>. Crane, in constructing his <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>-world,
seems to have pined after a <I>Perpetual Ride in a Fast Machine</I>:
symmetry and asymmetry forever in dynamic imbalance; the volume
downshifting only to return to the same level, again and again; a listener
caught up in a perpetual driver's high with no Hegelian synthesis or
transformative epiphany possible. A joyride into eternity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This ride would also have required Crane's active, physical
involvement. Victrolas were spring-operated. A user had to hand-crank
them every once in a while to keep the turntable rotating. According to
Gorham Munson, Crane periodically had to "race" to wind his up so as to
keep constant the musical accompaniment to his writing

<B></B>

marathons (<I>V</I>, 252-3). Crane's <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>-world was
both mechanical and muscle-powered, the product of human and machine
labor. Moreover, as I have already pointed out, when not cranking
away, Crane would have been sitting at a table, pounding away at a
manual typewriter, or going through "loud trial readings" of a line
and all its possible variants (<I>V</I>, 253). Poet-with-typewriter and
poet-with-gramophone were structural equivalents for Crane. Both brought
audible art into being. And those heady sounds, repeated, created the
utopian space that sustained the human will and drive required to produce
yet more sound--again, we discover a (theoretically) closed system. In
his poem "Cutty Sark" Crane writes apocalyptically of a "white machine
that sings" (<I>CP</I>, 72). The phrase could be a kenning for typewriter,
Victrola, and poet alike.

Before I can go further, I must again concede that <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>
is only one of many 78s Crane played when, to quote Robert Browning,
"a palace of music [he] reared."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
Yet all of Crane's preferred 78s--whether Dietrich-style torch songs
or bombastic classical music--seem to have shared one fundamental
trait. They exhibit Eros in its most theatrical guises, ranging
from aggressive triumph to jaded melancholy. And, as in the case of
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, Crane, by playing these emotional roller coasters
nonstop, would have stripped the music of implied teleologies, whether
narrative, psychological, or otherwise. Crane would have prolonged
indefinitely seduction's dramatic tension. At the start of my discussion
of <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, I set aside the question of Eros because I
did not want to broach the subject prematurely. Now, however, we can
address that issue with greater sophistication, and we can use it as a
launching pad for moving toward a broader understanding of how Crane's
verse functions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Crane's compositional regimen bears all the hallmarks of a libidinal
ritual. He insisted that things be just so and that they stay that way. He
fantasizes a physical fusion of man and machine that releases a flood of
creative energy. An early poem, "Episode of Hands," shows us the erotic
charge that this fantasy held for Crane. He retells an incident in his
father's candy factory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 An unnamed machine injures a worker's hand. Amidst "factory sounds and
 factory thoughts," "the factory owner's son" takes the worker's hurt hand
 into his own and studies it before bandaging it. "The gash was bleeding,
 and a shaft of sun / That glittered in and out among the wheels, / Fell
 lightly, warmly, down into the wound" (<I>CP</I>, 173). Significantly,
 the speaker here so identifies with another man's violated flesh that
 he imagines that he becomes the other person, able to feel the "warmth"
 of the sunlight in the "gash." Celestial light washes indifferent across
 machine and men, transring them, sanctifying their erotic communion,
 removing them from time and space.

Crane projects bestial, blind, raw Eros onto machinery in a factory. This
libidinal energy ("glee") is both constrained ("confined") and permitted,
frictionless ("oilrinsed"), to expend itself with abandon ("whirl"). The
male bodies left (nominally) integral in "Episode of Hands" here dissolve,
like Osiris, into partial objects that pursue their circumscribed yet
blissful course. In both these poems, note, Crane's symbol for this
mechanical-eternal <I>jouissance</I> is the turning wheel ("wheels,"
"whirl," "axle," "oilrinsed circles"). I would argue that these symbols
thematize the very real turning wheel, the Victrola turntable, that
preexists them and that as a material precondition for their existence
as poetry can even be said to bring them into being. Poems like "Episode
of Hands" and "Cape Hatteras" are, forgive the pun, <I>records</I> of a
utopian, Dionysian-Bacchic state that Crane induces through a precise
blend of repetitious music, alcohol, frenzied physical activity, and
noisy machinery.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Inserting machinery into his scene of desire by insisting upon a
<I>mechanized</I> variant of the poet's divinest madness, Crane clearly
participates in what Caroline Jones, in <I>The Machine in the Studio</I>,
calls "the technological sublime."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Whereas Edmund Burke's classic definition of the sublime emphasizes
 encounters with the natural world, for many twentieth-century artists,
 Jones argues, "Machines, not nature . . . provide the terrible forces to
 be encountered, engulfed by, and transcended in the studio" (<I>MS</I>,
 203-4). Yes, "in the studio"--Jones has in mind not poets but
 postwar visual artists like Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Smithson, and
 Andy Warhol, who grapple with how to integrate machines, the mechanical,
 and the mechanistic into their artistic processes. As Jones sees it,
 that wrestling match puts the artist's very humanity at risk. I would
 argue that Crane's writing ritual depended upon the creation of a similar
 arena, a space of a Jacob-and-the-angel erotic combat between the human
 and the non- or superhuman.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Jones credits the "technological sublime" to an implicit analogy between
an artist's work space and industrial production. The artist encounters,
then battles or submits to, the titanic, impersonal forces propelling the
march of capitalism. In essence, Jones is extending Fredric Jameson's
argument that "euphoria" results when a subject "consumes" a (false,
ideological) image of the capitalist market as a totality, omnipresent
and omnipotent.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Jones builds on Jameson by investigating some of the practical,
 artistic consequences of that "euphoria" or feeling of sublimity. As
 "Episode of Hands" and the factory passage from "Cape Hatteras" have
 demonstrated, Crane, like Jones's Warhol and Rauschenberg, finds
 "euphoria" in contemplating the

<B></B>

loss of self as mechanical processes supplant, or rend, the integrity of
the individual. While living in Akron--an industrial boomtown in 1919,
famous as the birthplace of the rubber tire--Crane told an interviewer,
"living as we do in an age of the most violent commercialism the world
has ever known, the artist cannot remain aloof from the welters without
losing the essential, imminent vitality of his vision."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
Capitalism, for Crane, is orphic. In its "violence," its "welters," one
beholds raw power. In the factory, not the sanctuary, one undergoes
a theophany: "Power's script,--wound, bobbin-bound, refined-- / Is
stropped to the slap of belts on booming spools, spurred / Into the
bulging bouillon, harnessed jelly of the stars" (<I>CP</I>, 79).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Caroline Jones criticizes Andy Warhol for too readily identifying his
artistic procedures with the logic of an assembly line.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 One could make a similar statement about Crane. In 1918 Crane
 worked at a munitions plant in Cleveland. His job was tightening
 bolts on machine parts. He "watched a seemingly endless procession
 of objects pass before him on a conveyer belt" (<I>V</I>, 113). His
 writing utopia would later reproduce the essentials of this wartime
 labor: repetition, mechanization, timelessness, circularity, the
 production of interchangeable parts. One could validly claim that
 Crane shares the industrial capitalist's dream of production by
 rote, ad infinitum. Moreover, his individual phrases are like parts
 manufactured in one place--<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>-land--and then shipped
 elsewhere--Sobriety City--for assembly into functioning wholes. Crane's
 reliance on the "technological sublime" in his poetry and his proclivity
 for references to factories and machines seem to prere Warhol's
 compromises with the capitalist market.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Crane enters his "writing factory" for artistic, not economic,
reasons. Unlike Warhol, he would never confuse Business and Art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 The sublime in its technological guise remains for him "the highest order
 of <I>aesthetic</I> experience" (<I>MS</I>, 20, emphasis added). How
 could it have been otherwise? Crane associated capitalism at its
 crudest with his father Chester Arthur, the candy magnate who invented
 Life Savers&#153; yet forced his son to work for his keep as a manual
 laborer or lowly salesclerk.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Crane's choice to be a poet was a calculated rejection of his father's
 world and worldview. He dropped his given name Harold and adopted in
 its stead his mother's maiden name, Hart. And he quite proudly wrote
 his mother that he would have to endure poverty and hardship:

I expect I'll always have to drudge for my living, and I'm quite willing
to always do it, but I am no more fooling myself that the mental bondage
and the spiritual bondage of the more remunerative sorts of work is worth
the sacrifices inevitably involved. If I can't continue to create the
sort of poetry that is my intensest and deepest component in life--then
it all means very little to me, and then I might as well tie myself up
to some smug ambition and "success" (the common idol that every Tom Dick

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given the potent confluence of oedipal and economic protests that these
gestures imply, it is hardly surprising that Crane's conception of the
poet-as-writing-machine

<B></B>

is no more than a strategic, partial capitulation to the dehumanizing
tendencies of capitalism. By singling out one portion of the capitalist
mind-set--the open-ended desire to produce--and utterly rejecting
another--the desire to reap profit from production--Crane consciously sets
himself against the economic "machinery" of his day. He takes technologies
devised by big business for use in the office (the Remington) and for
passive entertainment (the Victrola) and perversely employs them toward
idiosyncratic, noncapitalist ends. Crane is thereby able to liberate
and redeploy the raw, libidinal <I>energy</I> bound up in the nation's
collective drive to industrialize, to produce.

 This redirected Eros is then free to power Crane's incomparably
 high-voltage verse.

I wish to draw this section to a close with a simple observation. Hart
Crane has begun to sound strangely "prepostmodern" as I have explored the
ramifications of "his" <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>. An astute reader is likely to
be thinking of a range of intertexts: J. G. Ballard's <I>Crash</I>; Gilles
Deleuze and F&eacute;lix Guattari on psychoanalysis and capitalism; Paul
Gilroy on hip hop DJs' manipulations of LPs; Katherine Hayles's <I>How
We Became Post-Human</I>; etc.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Crane's poetry has never before kept such company. More often than
 not he has been read as a belated romantic whose closest affinities
 are with such res as William Blake, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and
 Walt Whitman. In the next section of this article, I will undertake a
 reading of Crane's poem sequence "Voyages" in order to demonstrate the
 practical consequences that stem from my proposed new approach to his
 verse as well as to bring out more distinctly the "prepostmodern" side
 of Crane's poetics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The prose is <I>echt</I> Crane. He blends mysticism ("Word made Flesh")
with sentimentality ("tears"), "ecstasy" with melodrama ("never with
another"). He throws out trite phrases ("most beautiful in the world"). He
abuses metaphors ("dances I have walked"). He even touches genius:
"sex was beaten out"--a resonant phrase, summoning thoughts of drumming,
annealing, and pummeling. It is, in other words, an appropriately orphic
triad of music, metallurgy, and masochism that complicates the passage's
seeming Platonism. Crane speaks of so indulging in "sex" that it becomes

<B></B>

something other, its physicality <I>preserved</I>, not abandoned, as one
moves "upward" on the Platonic ladder. Crane, naturally, consecrates this
(un)holy, clunky, glorious love story by setting it smack in the middle of
the Machine, here represented by Washington Roebling's Brooklyn Bridge,
whose "cables enclos[e]" the lovers and lift them out of themselves
into rapture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two months later, in June of 1924, Crane writes the poet Jean Toomer
to tell him, too, about Opffer. To give a sense of his "exaltation,"
Crane includes a draft of a poem that he tentatively christens "Voyages"
(<I>OM</I>, 193). He also tries to explain that his poetry is an "effort
to describe God." "Only the effort," he hastens to add, "limitless and
yet forever incomplete" (<I>OM</I>, 192). In the April letter to Frank,
Crane was already happily confusing Opffer and Christ. By June, Crane's
gleeful idolatry was producing its own Gospel.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The one poetic "Voyage" that Crane sent Toomer soon grew into a sequence
of five. Crane then took an old piece of his, "The Bottom of the Sea Is
Cruel" , prefixed it to the others as a kind of proem and declared
the set of six lyrics a single work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Crane would later give pride of place to "Voyages" in his first book,
 <I>White Buildings</I> . It delivers the final, knockout punch,
 coming after two oft-anthologized works, "For the Marriage of Faustus
 and Helen" and "At Melville's Tomb."

"Voyages" exhibits an eerie blend of the familiar and the strange. There
is no doubt after the magnificent <I>volta</I> of the "And yet" that
opens "Voyages" II that we are reading love poetry of the most venerable,

On the one hand, an educated reader immediately recognizes the rolling
pentameter, archaic diction, and near-manic use of consonance ("samite
sheeted processioned"). These tried-and-true devices announce that
"our love" is worthy of the Grand Style. On the other hand, words such
as "wrapt," "wink," and "leewardings" fail to yield straightforward
sense. "Wrapt inflections"? "Wrapt" as in "wrapped"--if so, by
what? "Wrapt" as in "rapt attention"? Or as in "rapture"? In what sense is
the ocean a "wink of eternity"? Are we to imagine the waters of the globe
as God's closed eye? If so, why does Crane almost immediately proceed to
speak instead of the ocean's "vast belly"? "Voyages" II somehow manages
to be rhetorically effective, sweeping a reader, giddy, onto glorious
terrain, even though (or perhaps <I>because</I>) its semantic meaning
remains indeterminate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Crane's implicit model for his oddly potent rhetoric is the Elizabethan
sonnet sequence. Throughout "Voyages," Crane's imagery, like that of
Renaissance love

poets, is Petrarchan, featuring storms, tropic heat, arctic cold, ships,
pirates, and dreams. So, too, is his rhetorical topos, an enamored
poet's tone that veers unpredictably between despair and ecstasy as
he uses the occasion of his love to express himself in increasingly
convoluted res.

Crane's achievement in "Voyages" lies in his having "made new" the
Elizabethan legacy. Many modernist writers, of course, shared similar
aims, among them Djuna Barnes, T. S. Eliot, and James Joyce. What marks
Crane, and "Voyages," as unique is Crane's belief that reviving the
Renaissance's rhetorical grandeur would serve <I>musical</I> ends. More
precisely, he held that poetry, if it wished to equal or surpass the
achievements of contemporary composers, would have to find original
ways of deploying the heaviest armaments available in the English
literary tradition. In one of his letters he speaks of the need to
"<I>ransack</I> the vocabularies of Shakespeare, Jonson, Webster
(for theirs were the richest)" if he is to be a "modern artist" on the
order of "Strauss, Ravel, Scriabine [sic], and Block [sic]" (OM, 137;
emphasis in original). "Voyages" is exhibit A of what Crane means by
"ransacking." Not only does it echo Renaissance verse, as I have already
asserted, but, as Lee Edelman has shown, it borrows pell-mell

<B></B>

from Renaissance texts. "Voyages" VI, for instance, shamelessly includes
phrases lifted from <I>The Tempest</I>, <I>Richard II</I>, and Milton's
<I>Samson Agonistes</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Throughout "Voyages," Crane so packs his verse with Elizabethan-esque
 diction, tone, and phrasing that, in passages such as the
 following, one seems to be reading a reckless cento of sixteenth- and
 seventeenth-century verse: "Shall they not stem and close in our own
 steps / Bright staves of flowers and quills today as I / Must first be
 lost in fatal tides to tell?" (<I>CP</I>, 37)

In lines such as these, the stylistic anachronisms come so thick and
fast that one is left uncertain whether to categorize these lyrics as
homage, parody, or pastiche. Crane seems to have in mind now one text,
now another, freely "ransacking" their vocabulary to craft his own idiom.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Voyages" does not aim to bring its Elizabethan crazy quilt into a
finished form. Instead, it delights in its half-intelligibility and its
inconsistencies. "Voyages" I, V, and VI appear to describe seaside scenes
whereas "Voyages" II-IV seem to describe actions taking place in or
under the open sea. The setting for the final two lyrics, however, is
too vague, too changeable for a critic confidently to characterize the
sequence as a circular narrative of journey out and return. The first
lyric, written in 1921, does offer a relatively straightforward Blakean
song of experience--it describes innocent children gamboling beside an
ocean symbolizing sexuality and death--but the next five "Voyages,"
all from 1924, are not so easily paraphrased. They recount hermetic
anecdotes about a visionary "I" and a sometimes-living, sometimes-dead
"you." This pair journeys among, or to, islands across, or within, a
"sceptered" goddess-ocean (<I>CP</I>, 35). Along the way, the pair seems
to consummate their passion twice ("Voyages" III, IV) as well as quarrel
("Voyages" V). These uncertain actions are submerged beneath a wildly
lush, recalcitrant linguistic surface:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From "region" to "wreathe," from "our" to "hour," from "portending"
to "port" to "portion," Crane's poetry slides associatively from one
aural echo into another. The verse can thus be said to progress "Madly
. . . logically," satisfying a reader's intuition, perhaps, but rarely
satisfying her or his rage for order.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mystified by how to speak in generalities about such a disparate,
confusing, yet compelling compendium of lyrics, some critics, such as
R. W. B. Lewis, have thrown up their hands. Crane, Lewis writes in a
Pyrrhic retreat, gives us access to a "poetic utopia," "some boundless
domain of splendid un-reason where opposites consort and nameless forces
or disembodied pulsations dance out their uninterpretable allegory"
(<I>PHC</I>, 151). A few recent critics, like Lee Edelman and Eric
Selinger, have persevered, Edelman undertaking a deconstructive analysis
and Selinger a Kristevan reading.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Indeed, the language of "Voyages" II-VI is so inflated, so
 quintessentially, so memorably Crane at his best and worst, that the
 poetry does indeed invite readings that focus on the violence and
 queerness of its tropes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I would argue that, however fascinating the results, the recent
theoretically informed readings of "Voyages" have erred in presuming
that the lyrics follow a linear progression, that is, that they work
toward the solution of a philosophical, rhetorical, or generic problem.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 If, however, Crane deliberately avoids teleology and favors the creation
 of a timeless, ecstatic state, then "Voyages" VI should not be given
 greater weight than any of the other five lyrics. Each "Voyage" presents
 a window onto eternity. The circumstances, intensities, affect, and means
 of expression might vary, but the ultimate referent remains constant.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The love story everywhere perceptible in "Voyages," like that in John
Ashbery's <I>Three Poems</I> or in Roland Barthes's <I>Fragments d'un
discours amoureux</I>, has been broken up, rered, and transred
in such a way that one cannot say "it begins here" or that "it ends
here," let alone who the lovers are. Love is no longer an episode in
a biography but an ahistorical state and a way of speaking into which
the poet enters at will. He or she utters an "And yet!," as Crane does
to begin "Voyages" II, and escapes into a realm of artifice insulated
against the sound of time's chariot. In the workaday world Crane did,
of course, eventually break with Emil Opffer. That lover's plot played
itself out rather predictably, including a final round of betrayals and
angry recriminations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 <I>In the poem</I>, however, that love, purified of any specifics,
 persists, untainted by nostalgia or history, rendered as a procession
 of intensities that one can reexperience with each perusal. Crane
 treats his romance with Opffer in the same manner that he treated
 <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>. He could play selected bits <I>ad infinitum</I>
 and never fall prey to the deadening incursions of narrative.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The poem as an escape from time is an old idea. "And yet to times in
hope my verse shall stand / Praising thy worth, despite [time's] cruel
hand," Shakespeare concludes his sixtieth sonnet.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Also old is the impulse to purify and elevate a particular

<B></B>

love into art by ridding it of any historical specificity. "One form shall
rise above the wreck / One name, Ianthe, shall not die," Walter Landor
writes in "Past Ruined Ilion," lines of verse whose fame and pathos in
no way depend upon concrete details about Ianthe's identity or physical
"form."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 What marks "Voyages" as new is the <I>way Crane writes</I>, which is
 recognizably the product of his mechanized/eroticized writing regimen. I
 will demonstrate this fact by looking closely at the grammar and lyrical
 texture of the most commented-upon of the "Voyages," the third.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Voyages" III perceptibly breaks down into fourteen discrete units, which,
following the precedent of classical oratory, I will call cola. The
logical and grammatical connections among Crane's cola vary widely in
stability and in coherency. I would divide the lyric according to the
following scheme.

Other divisions are possible. For instance, one could claim that two and
three or five and six ought to be considered indissoluble units; what
matters for my purposes is to make visible the process of <I>suturing</I>
that Crane has applied to relatively distinct statements treating a common
topic. Consider the second and third verse paragraphs. Cola 7 to 13 are
punctuated as if they were part of a cohesive sentence, yet this unity
is an illusion. Colon 7 is a participial phrase expressing completed
action. Colon 8 is a prepositional phrase giving a location. Cola 9
and 10 are parallel noun absolutes. Eleven is a subordinate clause, and
twelve, like seven, is a participial

<B></B>

phrase. Thirteen is another trailing noun absolute, unless, perhaps, one
construes "transmemberment" as the subject of this unwieldy sentence, with
an "is" elided. If so, anacoluthon seems to have occurred since colon
7. That is, "admitted" would seem, logically, to require the "I" from
colon 4 as its subject, not "transmemberment," in colon 13--although,
it must be conceded, one can hardly apply spatial or temporal logic
to a neologism like "transmemberment" since we can have only a vague,
contextual sense of what it means in the first place. Given these mounting
ambiguities, one must conclude that Crane has used punctuation marks
such as dashes and commas not to indicate cumulative development either
of syntax or argument but rather to <I>substitute</I> visual stitchery
for such progress.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The many gaps in the poem's syntax coexist with a remarkable degree of
self-sufficiency on the part of the individual cola. Colon 9--"Light
wrestling there incessantly with light"--is a particularly good
example. The phrase is rich in consonance (l's) and assonance (short e's
and i's). The caesura occurs naturally between the second and third feet,
but it also symmetrically divides the line into two three-word units.

<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="symbols/7.1reed01.gif">

<BR>
The same word, "light," begins and ends the colon, a classic gesture of
completion. Moreover, Crane concisely indicates time ("incessantly"),
place ("there"), agent ("light"), and action ("wrestle"). Colon 9 of
"Voyages" III possesses the inevitability of a hexameter by Racine. Each
of the other cola in the lyric likewise, if not so transparently, conveys
the impression of a self-contained rhetorical gesture, partly through
internal sound-play and partly by establishing enough coordinates (who,
what, when, where, why) that one feels confident projecting a context
within which the fragmentary utterance could belong. Each colon possesses
what R. W. B. Lewis calls Crane's "quality of encompassing finality"
(<I>PHC</I>, 404 n. 16).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Oddly, despite its "bad" grammar and its imperfect suturing of well-turned
phrases, "Voyages" III does not <I>feel</I> disjunctive. We have a general
sense of a maritime scene (even if the action seems to oscillate between
the surface of the sea and the ocean floor). Barely concealed literary
subtexts--Milton's "Lycidas" and Ariel's song "Full Fathom Five" from
<I>The Tempest</I>--provide some narrative purchase, too. We can guess
that "you" are undergoing a sea change, a "transmemberment," through the
agency of love and song. We can also conjecture that "I," like Orpheus or
Odysseus, have traveled through chthonic portals ("black swollen gates")
to witness this moment wondrous and strange. (We won't dwell on the fact
that "I" and "you," when last glimpsed in stanza one, seem to have been
swimming side by side.) Two formal features of the stanza reinforce these
impressions of the setting and dramatic action. First, the constant iambic
pentameter works as a catena that cuts across the syntactical ambiguities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Second, the rich sound-play evident in each individual period spills
 across the sutures dividing them. Colon 9, for example, does not carry
 on the heavy alliteration of p's in colon 8, but it does seem to echo
 the stressed short e of "pediment," even as "lithe" reappears in a new
 guise, as "light." Crane's second, "sober," phase of poetry composition,
 during which he painstakingly revised and knit

<B></B>

together isolated phrases written during his "ecstatic" phase, results in
verse that <I>does</I> possess linkages and continuities, but these links
are haphazard, partial, nonlinear, and unpredictable, only half-obedient
to decorum and logic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yvor Winters first noted Crane's uncanny ability to appear to be writing
coherent verse when under inspection those verses would dissolve into
a sequence of unrelated, nonsensical assertions. Winters labeled this
feature of Crane's writing "pseudo-reference."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 It merits a less pejorative, more precise label that takes into
 account the <I>grammatical</I> basis for Crane's slipperiness. Much
 poetry criticism since Hugh Kenner's <I>The Pound</I> <I>Era</I> has
 explored the fact that the dominant mode of modernist experimentation
 with syntax is <I>paratactic</I>, that is, investigating the use of
 "and" or asyndeton to link successive clauses or other linguistic units.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 By juxtaposing disparate materials without logical or hierarchical
 connectives, parataxis increases writerly economy, semantic
 indeterminacy, and textual heterogeneity. Achieving results comparable
 to collage in the visual arts, the parataxis in works such as the
 <I>Cantos</I>, <I>Paterson</I>, and <I>The Maximus Poems</I> tends
 to break down generic distinctions by introducing nonpoetic, even
 nonliterary, material in a relatively nonprejudicial fashion. Crane's
 starkly different mode of syntactical experimentation could more
 properly be called attenuated hypotaxis. His cola in "Voyages" III are
 not discrete collage-nuggets nor are they items in a catalog strung
 together by conjunctions. Instead, "Voyages" III is made up of tenuously
 interconnected clauses (3, 4, 6, 11); participial phrases (5, 7, 12);
 prepositional phrases ; and noun absolutes (9, 10). Here as elsewhere,
 most everything in a Crane poem can be construed hypotactically, that
 is, as a series of grammatical units (cola) possessing some relation of
 subordination to another element. But Crane also blurs those connections
 and inhibits the formation of clear, neat, larger units. For example,
 in "Voyages" III the only two grammatically complete sentences (as
 opposed to faux-sentences indicated by punctuation) are cola 1 and 14,
 which serve primarily as bookends for the disorienting grammar-play
 between. Crane's verse explores the wide-open poetic terrain between
 complete disjunction and crystalline order.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The strangely centrifugal, disorderly syntax in "Voyages" was largely
unprecedented when <I>White Buildings</I> was first published. To such
contemporaries as Yvor Winters, Crane understandably appeared error-prone
and given to thoughtless gush.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 Experimental poetry since 1970, however, has proved Crane
 prescient. Among the many writers who have employed Crane-like attenuated
 hypotaxis are Robert Creeley, Larry Eigner, Lyn Hejinian, Tom Raworth,
 and Rosmarie Waldrop. Perhaps the poet whose anomalous syntax most
 resembles Crane's is John Ashbery. Ashbery habitually writes sentences
 that, like Crane's, refuse to add up linearly even as they convey the
 impression of "concatenation":

Although the verse texture here is somewhat smoother than Crane's--as
one might expect of a poet writing in the age of videotape and word
processors--Ashbery, in this extract from "A Wave," has employed a
process of suturing noticeably similar to Crane's.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 The "as" between cola 1 and 2 creates a link that violates the sequence
 of tenses ("you look" does not agree with "Would refresh"). Cola 3
 and 4 contain contradictory adverbial similes ("Like sliding up" and
 "like a bubble") modifying the same verb ("bursts"). Colon 6 is an
 ambiguous participle, perhaps a dangling modifier of "Toys," perhaps
 a modifier of "books." Colon 7 contains a pronomial subject, "this,"
 with no clear antecedent. Seven also switches to "us / All," after
 colon 2 had addressed "you," and colon 6 had mentioned "my hip." The
 cumulative effect of these connected-yet-disjunct phrases is readerly
 disorientation. Can I, you, or we all find stability in the swiftly
 altering landscape? Or do we accept flux itself as the grounds of "our"
 (non)identity?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The poet-critic Charles Bernstein has provided a name for the general
composition strategy evident in Crane and Ashbery: "dysraphism," the
Frankensteinian stitching together of disparate "embryonic" elements in
order to see if a viable poem develops.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Dysraphic poets are dissatisfied with the limitations imposed by
 the rigors of collage. They do not wish to constrain their artistic
 activities to selecting, categorizing, and arranging found texts. They
 permit themselves to invent, borrow, rework, and suture whatever
 materials they wish, however they desire. They delight in asymmetry,
 non sequiturs, and shifts in tone. They are less interested in global
 features of a poem than in its local ones: the way specific statements
 connect (or fail to), the way certain series of sounds hit the ear,
 the way one feels rough and smooth textures as lines and phrases segue
 one into the other. Witnessing the procession of words, rent or whole,
 conveys much of the work's "meaning." Referentiality is secondary to
 the spectacle of what T. S. Eliot, writing about A. C. Swinburne, once
 called the spectacle of "language, uprooted."

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The world of Swinburne does not depend upon some other world which
it simulates; it has the necessary completeness and self-sufficiency
for justification and permanence. . . . [T]he object has ceased to
exist, because the meaning is merely the hallucination of meaning,
because language, uprooted, has adapted itself to an independent life
of atmospheric nourishment. . . . Only a man of genius could dwell so
exclusively and consistently among words as Swinburne.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot rightly downplays Swinburne's agency, an insight that applies
equally to the poets whom I have been discussing. "Language" and "words,"
not the writers in

<B></B>

question, possess "an independent life" within a "self-sufficient
world." These poets merely "dwell" in this "hallucinatory" linguistic
utopia. Poetry, for Swinburne's dysraphic descendants, opens out into an
"independent," that is, autonomous, realm that the poet, like a reader,
inhabits.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ashbery refers to this exploratory venture into the world of words by
using phrases like "just walking around," "skating," and, above all else,
"flow."
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 He implies that he, and the reader, must be ready to set aside
 predetermined goals in order to perceive the actuality and value of
 the verse as it ebbs and flows, courses and floods, in accordance with
 rhythms and laws that far exceed the compass of one person's reason or
 imagination. Crane, too, speaks of the deliberate cession of control
 that must precede the creation of poetry, and, like Ashbery, he uses a
 marine metaphor: "One must be drenched in words, literally soaked with
 them to have the right ones form themselves into the proper pattern at
 the right moment. When they come . . . they come as things in themselves;
 it is a matter of felicitous juggling!; and no amount of will or emotion
 can help the thing a bit" (<I>OM</I>, 72). Immersed in the currents
 of language as in the sea, the poet is ready to cede "will" and let
 "words come" and shape themselves "into the proper pattern." About
 "Voyages," Crane would later write, "the sea has thrown itself upon me
 and been answered" (<I>OM</I>, 187). These poets' persistent urge is
 to escape from the autonomous self into the free play of language. They
 drown so as to undergo "the silken skilled transmemberment of song."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The result is a synecdochal poetry. Its forms and verses are broken,
dismembered, unraveling, incomplete. We are to read each poem as a
maimed piece of an absent, ungraspable whole. Crane would call that whole
God. Ashbery, like most postmodern writers, is more circumspect in naming
this totality. He has used many words, each tested, then discarded. Among
his favorites have been "weather" and "diagram."
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 Regardless, in the variegated, uneven texture of a poem's
 phrase-suturing, in what Ashbery calls its "architecture of desire," a
 reader senses the dynamic gaps, leaps, and twists in grammar that lead
 not into the mind of a poet but outward, into possibility, into language.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 "Language has built towers and bridges," Hart Crane writes, "but itself
 inevitably is as fluid as always" (<I>CPSL</I>, 223). The "gates,"
 "pillars," and "pediments" that form in and from the sea in "Voyages"
 III are like Crane's verses, artifice brought forth from the "fluid,"
 indefinable reaches of the non-, in-, and superhuman potentiality of
 the word.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I began by stating that, as a consequence of the pioneering scholarship
of the 1990s, scholars of poetry would have to be much more careful about
discussing the aural dimension of a writer's work. My analysis of Crane
permits us to see why this is the case. In his otherwise brilliant piece
"Hart Crane and Poetry," for instance,

<B></B>

Allen Grossman makes the seemingly reasonable assumption that although
Crane's content and diction are insistently up-to-date, his rhetoric and
form are patently "antimodernist," indeed, "not fundamentally different
from those of Keats, Patmore, and Swinburne."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Grossman is surely correct that, at first glance, Crane's form does
 appear rather conservative for the 1920s. Instead of <I>vers libre</I>,
 he writes poetry with predictable accentual-syllabic meter, usually
 iambic tetrameter or pentameter. When not writing blank verse, he turns
 out orderly stanzas, often complete with end rhymes. One can sit down
 with a Crane poem and scan it just as one would a poem by Alexander
 Pope or Christopher Marlowe.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As we have seen, however, simple prosodic analysis cannot begin to
account for the role that sound plays in Crane's poetics nor can it be
relied upon to judge the "modernity" of his poetic form. Crane's basic
aural unit is not so much the foot or line as it is what I have been
calling a "colon," an individually composed, lapidary phrase. Regular
meter becomes a tool for mechanically stitching together disparate cola,
a centripetal force to counter the centrifugal force of the fractured
syntax. The result is, as Crane once put it, a "long-scattered score /
Of broken intervals" (<I>CP</I>, 160). When held up against the writers
that Grossman cites--John Keats, Coventry Patmore, Algernon
Charles Swinburne--Crane's "broken" verse <I>does</I> appear qualitatively
different. It often reads as if Keats's odes or Swinburne's paeans to the
Lady of Pain had been excerpted randomly, pared down, and strung together
with little regard to organic wholes or integral gestures. Which is, of
course, how Crane would have played Richard Wagner, C&eacute;sar Franck,
and his other nineteenth-century favorites on his Victrola: the choicest
excerpts strung together or repeated at whim.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
True, Crane's literary aspirations were somewhat <I>retardaire</I>
in comparison with the goals of such other American modernists as
Gertrude Stein and William Carlos Williams. Crane's quest to reveal
God in verse, for instance, deserves to be read in the context of the
<I>longue dur&eacute;e</I> of the lyric poem where one can compare
him to William Blake, Emily Dickinson, and Henry Vaughan, instead of
juxtaposing him with his more skeptical contemporaries. Crane's faith
that repetitious sound could lead one into mystic and physical transport
is positively shamanic, with many analogues in traditional oral poetries
practiced around the globe. The Victrola nonetheless inflected these
enduring themes in such a way that Crane's verse is indelibly a product
of a particular era, post-Edison but pre-LP. The Victrola therefore
marked every aspect of Crane's poetry as "modern": how he wrote, what
he wrote, and why he wrote. Crane's form <I>is</I> "modernist" insofar
as it represents an innovative transformation of older poetic models to
accord with 1920s realities.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I would like to close with a thought experiment: How might "Voyages"
differ if Crane had had access to a CD player and digitally remastered
works by his preferred composers? Would pushing buttons instead
of turning a Victrola's crank have changed his attitude toward the
materiality of poetry? Would being able to repeat <I>entire</I> pieces of
classical music have persuaded him to think differently about narrative
teleology? Alternatively, what if Crane had had access to music more in
line with his tenuously sustained <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>-utopia, perhaps
1990s industrial and house music

<B></B>

with their ambient textural overlays, driving rhythms, and complete
disregard for melodic progression? I pose these questions because,
as I implied above by pairing "Voyages" with John Ashbery's "A Wave,"
Crane's strategies and style remain important touchstones for evaluating
contemporary writing. Many of the last few decades' most impressive long
poems--among them A. R. Ammons's <I>Sphere</I>, John Ashbery's <I>Flow
Chart</I>, Amiri Baraka's <I>Wise Why's Y's</I>, and Susan Howe's
<I>Articulation of Sound Forms in Time</I>--resemble Crane's <I>The
Bridge</I> in their epic ambition to transre American history. Such
digital-age efforts at poeticizing the United States deserve to be
thought through, as I have "Voyages," as historically specific responses
to their contemporary soundscape. Poets, after all, listen to the world
around them. Their verse records not only what they hear but how they
hear it. The job of the critic is to unpack the interdependency of that
"what" and "how" in the name of achieving a more accurate account of
the poetry, its genesis, and its significance.

characterized as book-length justifications of their own biographically
informed readings of Crane's poetry. Hammer situates Crane's futile
efforts to make modern poetry a paying job within a Bourdieuian
sociological frame; Yingling approaches Crane within the context of the
then-nascent discipline of queer studies. Hammer characterizes Crane's
vatic, recondite style as a product of the poet's sense of pursuing an
otherworldly vocation; Yingling excavates a hidden stratum of homosexual
content beneath the extravagant, obscure surface of Crane's writing. By
daring to introduce biographical material, both studies have advanced
the study of Crane's poetry immeasurably, which, as Hammer comments, had
until the 1990s consisted largely of explication upon explication with
little or no sense of cumulative development toward a complete account
of Crane's project.

In thinking about the "energy" coursing through America's industrial
heartland in these years, contemplate the fact that Akron, in the year
before Crane moved there, had increased industrial output by twenty-five
percent. Crane's Ohio years coincide with one of the biggest industrial
expansions in world history--the kind of regional transformation that
would have made Soviet planners in the 1930s giddy to contemplate; see

Crane, significantly, anticipates by six decades the DJ revolt
of the 1980s and 1990s that Paul Gilroy analyzes in <I>The Black
Atlantic</I>. Like a hip hop DJ, Crane takes "the basic units of
commercial consumption in which music is fast frozen," and, through
"supplementary creative input," "transres" them, reasserting
individual aesthetic agency in the age of mechanical reproduction (Paul
Gilroy, <I>The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What is modernism? To me, there are two chief features. First, a tendency
to extremes, a testing of the limits of aesthetic construction--if
nineteenth-century art often seeks a safe center where the artist and
the audience can be comfortable together, modernist art often seeks the
freakish peripheries of the artistic experience, regions of discomfort
and confrontation. Jean Cocteau liked to say that tact in audacity
was knowing how far to go too far; but much modernist art consists of
tactless aggression, aggressive overload of the sense organs, aggressive
transgression of taboos, aggressive density of event, aggressive
technicality, aggressive monotony, aggressive matter-of-factness, even
(in the case of Satie) aggressive reticence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Second, a certain sense of dwelling inside paradox, since aesthetic
 extremes tend to converge: when T. S. Eliot, in 1921, first heard
 Stravinsky's <I>The Rite of Spring</I>, he wrote that the music seemed to
 "transform the rhythm of the steppes into the scream of the motor-horn,
 the rattle of machinery, the grind of wheels, the beating of iron and
 steel, the roar of the underground railway, and the other barbaric
 noises of modern life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 In other words, the most up-to-date factory noises were audible within
 an evocation of pagan Russia: the australopithecine and the man with the
 jackhammer inhabit exactly the same acoustic space, make the same sort
 of cry. Twentieth-century music is full of convergences of opposites:
 the line between excessively expressive and excessively <I>sachlich</I>
 music can be thin; it is even true that music generated by purely
 random procedures can sound similar to music generated by the most
 rigorous precompositional system. The aged Stravinsky complained that
 "What I cannot follow are the manic-depressive
 
<B></B>

 fluctuations from total control to no control, from the
serialization of all elements to chance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 And if the distinction between chaos and cosmos is hard to make out,
 what hope is there for keeping other artistic polarities separate?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to these notions of modernism, the ideal modernist composer
is Adrian Leverk&uuml;hn, the fictitious composer whose music is audible
only within Thomas Mann's novel <I>Doktor Faustus</I> . In chapter
21 the narrator explains:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The always-dominant element in him was a will to go to extremes of
expression, together
with the intellectual passion for harsh order, the linearity of the old
music of Netherlands. In other words: in his work, heat and cold held sway
alongside each other, and sometimes, in moments of his greatest genius,
they forced themselves into each other, the <I>espressivo</I> seized
the strict counterpoint, the objective blushed with feeling.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Leverk&uuml;hn's music is impatient with all that is finite and temporal,
always rushing off toward the far reaches of noise and silence, an
apocalypse where heaven and hell are constructed out of identical
musical materials. Extremity and the convergence of extremes have no
finer example.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By the standards of Leverk&uuml;hn, it would seem that an agreeable
composer such as Kurt Weill, careless of posterity, eager to give
pleasure, even familiar pleasure, to a wide audience, has no business
among the modernists. In fact, it would seem that Thomas Mann himself has
no business among the modernists: Mann's novels were accepted by the Book
of the Month Club, and he wrote books that argue more strongly for basic
bourgeois values (one of the mottos of his story "Das Gesetz" is that you
should wash your hands before eating) than for the values of ferocious and
disdainful aesthetes. Mann and Weill both found Stalin a less attractive
leader than Franklin Delano Roosevelt (praised in Mann's <I>Joseph,
der Ern&auml;hrer</I> and Weill's <I>The Ballad of Magna Carta</I>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But I think that both Mann and Weill were not only modernists,
but central res in the development of modernism. Both red
out that within the radical modernists' strenuous repudiation of
nineteenth-century affability and good-naturedness there lurked danger:
an art contemptuous of Dickens and Max Bruch might disable through its
sheer fury of rejection of familiar pleasure. To avoid this, Mann and
Weill worked out (independently of one another, of course) a new kind
of irony, which seems to me a triumph of Modernist art.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mann complained that people considered him a frigid, thin-lipped sort of
ironist, whereas in fact he felt that the proper response to his comic
scenes was warm belly-laughter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 But it is surely an astonishingly sophisticated sort of irony, this
 irony that inhabits a threshold space between derision and warmth. I
 said a moment ago that the convergence of extremes was a characteristic
 of modernism; and so the proper irony for the modernist movement is an
 irony pushed so far that it converges with straightforward discourse--an
 irony that is ironic about its own ironicalness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The concept of irony, not as a stray re of speech but as a continuous
mode of discourse, comes from Greek comedy: the e&iacute;ron, or
understater, was a character who

<B></B>

said less than he knew; his opposite was the alaz&oacute;n, the
over-stater, who continually boasted of his glorious deeds. The
alaz&oacute;n was typically a soldier, whereas the e&iacute;ron was a
cunning slave--and irony was originally a slave's sort of discourse,
in which the speaker had to conceal his true meaning because he was
at everyone's mercy. But what is socially a position of weakness is
artistically a position of power: to understate is to overload with
meaning. The boaster speaks empty words, words that mean less than
he says; the ironist speaks words that mean more than he says. In
every age where semantic concentration has been an important virtue
in art--Horace's Rome, Swift's England, the whole modernist period in
Europe--irony has flourished.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To show how advanced an ironist Weill could be, I will compare his
practice with that of the official arch-modernist Schoenberg. In the
song "Gemeinheit" in <I>Pierrot Lunaire</I> , Schoenberg offers
a brilliant caricature of the expressionist composer: Pierrot drills a
hole in the skull of Cassander, fills it with tobacco, and smokes this
human pipe--a pipe that fumes away with a tiny piccolo cry. This is a
self-parody, in that the huge orchestral resources of shrieking that
Schoenberg had developed in <I>Erwartung</I>  have dwindled to
a puppet's little peep. For another example of Schoenberg as ironist
I turn to a letter that Schoenberg wrote to Mann on February 17, 1947,
offering him an extract from the <I>Encyclopedia Americana</I> of 1988
(!), stating that the twelve-tone system had been invented by Thomas
Mann, who tolerated its appropriation by the thievish composer Arnold
Schoenberg.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Schoenberg was vexed by Leverk&uuml;hn's expropriation of dodecaphy,
 and wanted credit--this explains why every copy of the novel ends with a
 patient, grudging little note explaining Schoenberg's property rights. In
 these examples, Schoenberg shows his real gifts as a traditional ironist:
 self-depreciation turns itself inside out into an oblique self-praise.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Weill sometimes made use of this traditional irony. For example, in
<I>Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny</I> , the ninth number
begins with a piano playing a sentimental turn-of-the-century tune,
<I>The Maiden's Prayer</I>--Jakob comments, "Das ist die ewige Kunst"
(That's immortal art!). This gives the audience a pleasurable thrill of
sarcasm: <I>we</I> might say that the only immortal art is the art that
makes fun of art. If Weill had gone further down this road, he might
have come to the paralysis of Mann's Leverk&uuml;hn, who despairs of
art itself: "Why does almost everything have to seem to me like its own
parody? Why does it have to appear to me that almost all, no, all the
means and customs of art <I>were today only fit for parody?</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 <I>Pierrot Lunaire</I> also seems to be headed in this direction--there
 are a good number of relations between the real Schoenberg and the
 fictitious Leverk&uuml;hn. But elsewhere in Weill's work we find a
 subtler irony, both more insidious and more humane.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For example, the "Zuh&auml;lter-Ballade" ("Ballad of the Pimp") in <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper</I>  is a magician's hat with a seemingly endless
supply of false bottoms. Weill and Brecht seemed to have conceived the
operations of its irony in rather different terms. Brecht felt glee at
the thought of the audience of <I>The Threepenny Opera</I> swooning over
a romantic duet: "The tenderest and most intimate love-song in the play
[the "Zuh&auml;lter-Ballade"] described the everlasting, indestructible
affection between a pimp

<B></B>

and his best girl. Not without feeling, the lovers celebrated in song
their little home, the brothel."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 This is an effect difficult to achieve with either poetry or music
 alone: it requires a deliberate misapplication of (sentimental) music to
 (low-life) text. The proper response to the "Zuh&auml;lter-Ballade" is
 not to remain detached and derisive, as the text might suggest; it is
 not to gush with warm sticky feelings for pimp and whore, as the music
 might suggest; it is first to gush, then to dislike oneself for beings
 such a gull or ninny--to feel, and then to criticize one's feeling. The
 bourgeoisie should learn the inadequacy of its own Pavlovian responses to
 the theater: to salivate identically over reminiscences of starry-eyed
 young love in a brothel and in a well-chaperoned middle class parlor,
 might suggest a certain skepticism concerning the value of saliva. The
 interior tension between text and music generated an intriguing sort
 of ironic music theater.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Weill used language fairly similar to Brecht's in describing the effect
of this number: he wrote in 1928 to his publisher that "the appeal [of
the "Zuh&auml;lter-Ballade"] lies precisely in the fact that a somewhat
risque text . . . is composed in a tender, pleasant manner."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 But Weill seems a good deal more comfortable with the tenderness than
 Brecht. Perhaps Weill was content to equivocate; he allows the song
 to dwell in a sort of limbo between an ironic (that is, Brechtian)
 artifact of revolution, and a regular <I>Schlager</I>, hit tune. Brecht
 was uneasy about the popularity of the opera with the bourgeoisie: what
 does a revolutionary do when the tyrant himself keeps cheerfully singing,
 Down, down, down with tyranny? But Weill evidently enjoyed providing a
 combination of pointed pleasure and pointless pleasure. Brecht denounced
 those artists who provided delight as a middle-class commodity for
 whoring after lies; Weill tried his hand as something more difficult,
 namely whoring after truths.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Weill achieved this effect in the "Zuh&auml;lter-Ballade" by providing
music that simultaneously pleases and finds ways of undoing or dismissing
that pleasure. Its Latin-American rhythms place it in a fairly large
class in Weill's canon--the class of tango and semi-tangoid tunes that
preen themselves in their own facetiousness, in their inadequacy of
response to the dramatic situation. Weill's tangos usually pertain to
some idyll of abundance and sexual languor, <I>luxe</I>, <I>calme</I>,
<I>et volupt&eacute;</I>; in other words, tangos are appropriate for
some place where you are not. Tangos are at once delusory and edifying,
a species of music that whispers in one ear about a faraway land of
delight while whispering in the other ear that you can't get there, or
had better not get there. In <I>Der Lindeberghflug</I> , a tangoish
rhythm accompanies the song of "Sleep", who tells the exhausted aviator
that the night is over, and it's time to relax his vigil and crash into
the sea; in <I>Happy End</I> , the "Matrosen-Tango" conjures up
first a sailors' <I>Schlaraffenland</I> of endless whisky, fine cigars,
and cheap movies, then the sinking of the ship and the drowning of all
hands--the tango dispels its own untruths; in <I>Marie Galante</I>
, the lyric that Fernay devised for Weill's orchestral tango
("Youkali") erects a self-consciously flimsy paradise, a tiny island at
the end of the world, where a fairy will take you for a guided tour of
the country where all your desires are gratified. A tango is, for Weill,
a kind of music that dreams while mocking its dreaminess, while

<B></B>

insisting on the tinselly-meretricious quality of its own catchiness. This
is how Weill tries to tell the truth: by writing music that lies, but
that confesses, at least subliminally, its lying character.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the possibility is never quite lost, that there might inhere a
deeper truth in the dream of luxury and ease than in the sordor of our
normal lives; Weill, unlike, Brecht, assigns no particular privilege to
discomfort and foulness, or even to skepticism. Weill is too comprehensive
a modernist to discount the romantic force of wishing. Brecht wishes
violently to strike out all lies, and shove our noses in the truth;
but Weill sets up the real and the unreal on a single artistic plane,
and allows us to choose what we will. We can laugh and weep, or we can
hate ourselves for being the dupes of artistic illusion: Weill leaves open
both a sentimental response and an ironic one, and therefore provides a
kind of heuristic theater, in which the audience is free to confront an
intellectual challenge, or to lose itself in escapist dreams, as it sees
fit. Weill seems instinctively to subvert Brecht's carefully contrived
didacticism, by providing a curiously unsettled music drama, in which
irony can bite the spectator who wishes to be bitten, or in which irony
can de-ironize itself, turn against itself, like a snake that swallows
its own tail.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I'd like to discuss one other way in which Weill shows a strikingly
modernist spirit. In the world of nineteenth-century opera, there was
an official term, abuse of the minor, used to describe the practice of
writing too much sustained music in the minor mode--this explains, for
example, why the witches in Verdi's <I>Macbeth</I> sing a good deal of
cheerful-sounding music. In the twentieth century, the issue is greatly
broadened: not abuse of the minor, but abuse of the artistic medium;
and in the domain of modernism, abuse of the medium becomes, strangely
enough, a species of excellence. When Duchamp takes a factory-made urinal,
titles it "Fountain," and signs it "R. Mutt," the medium of sculpture is
abused, but also made problematic and intriguing; when Brecht clams that
drama shouldn't be drama, but instead epic, the medium of the theater
is similarly abused and stimulated. In the old days, one could either
read a book or watch a drama--the two media were quite distinct. But
suddenly, in the domain of Brechtian theater, watching a drama turned
into an event that was a kind of reading--the stage is littered with
texts of all sorts, chapter headings, billboards, moralistic banners,
paraded around or dropped from the flies, as if a play were simply a
book with live illustrations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Weill, of course, cooperated with Brecht's vision of a text-theater in
many ways, especially in <I>Die sieben Tods&uuml;nden</I> (<I>The Seven
Mortal Sins</I>), a piece of surrealist theater in which artistic media
are deformed and flogged in all sorts of ways; but I want to emphasize
one particular direction in which Weill abused his artistic medium, by
constructing a sort of music designed to be read. This is one of the most
remarkable sorts of abuse to which the medium of music could possibly
be subjected: it's questionable that music has any semantic content
whatsoever--to imagine a <I>legible</I> music seems almost completely
preposterous. We read with our eyes, we hear with our ears--everything
conspires to deny to music any hope to transform itself into a visible
text.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And yet, I think that in <I>Der Jasager</I> (<I>The Yes-Sayer</I>,
1930)--which seems to me his most controlled, sustained, and imaginative
experiment in writing music-theater--Weill achieved just that. Weill
thought that the ultimate resource of music-drama, the basic element
of the art of the composer, was the <I>gestus</I>, the musical gesture
that defined an attitude, a contortion of the body, a significant
shape. In <I>Der Jasager</I> Weill achieved a number of extremely potent
<I>gestus</I>, but <I>gestus</I> that are so remote and cold that they
seem more like written text than like speech. It is an opera constructed
of musical hieroglyphs.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

that account, the mother doesn't want to let the boy go. Also the teacher
advises against it. The boy goes, however, in order to help his mother. On
the way, when they've come to the most dangerous place, he becomes weak
and therefore endangers the whole band of travelers. They put to him
the decision: should they turn back or should they follow the old rite
[<I>Brauch</I>], which commands that the sick must be thrown down into
the valley? The boy decides for the valley-hurling. "He has said Yes,"
sings the chorus. Some of the text is motivated differently by Brecht,
compared to what is offered in the original Japanese text. . . . we've
considered that students should also <I>learn</I> something from a
didactic play [<I>Lehrst&uuml;ck</I>]. For that reason, we've brought
in the sentence about
acquiescence [<I>Einverst&uuml;ndnis</I>], namely: "The important thing
to learn is acquiescence."
Students should learn that. They should know that a community to which
one is joined demands that one actually bears the consequences. The
boy goes the way of the community to the end, when he says Yes to the
valley-hurling.

Though Brecht wrote an alternate text with a different ending, <I>Der
Neinsager</I> (<I>The No-Sayer</I>), the whole musical style of <I>Der
Jasager</I> forecloses all paths except the path of saying yes. Far from
being sensitive to the psychic torment of a boy faced with an unbearable
decision, Weill composed the most unpsychological music of his life,
music written exclusively from the point of view of the community, not
the individual. There is no fork in <I>Der Jasager</I>'s road: it is a
study in inexorability, in a forced simplicity that precludes alternate
behavior of any sort. It is Weill's supreme work of <I>gestus</I>, in
that the motor rhythms, the inflexible melodic shapes, fix the domain
of doing and feeling so precisely that the characters are mere puppets
driven, so to speak, by the mechanical tracker action of the music. The
<I>Ja</I>-hieroglyph in the music is deeply incised, unmistakable;
it can't mean <I>Nein</I>, for it has no ambiguity whatsoever.

This work is spare on every level. The photographs of early performances
show children in ordinary school-costume, as if it were a perfectly normal
thing for uncooperative children to be thrown of Bavarian Alps--I wonder
whether the commonplace dress might not have heightened the eeriness of
the ritual sacrifice, as in Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery." Furthermore,
the stage set was as Spartan as possible:

It can be played in the school auditorium. In front, on the platform,
is the stage. The chorus sits on or in front of the platform. In the
middle of the platform a circle is drawn; in the middle of the circle
is a door (the mother's room). In the second act the door is

<B></B>

taken away, off to one side of the circle there's set up a platform with
a staircase, which represents the mountain. You see, simplicity is the
principle of this school opera. Also in the musical part. The orchestral

A play, any play, requires a series of entrances and exits, and a plot,
any plot, entails some difficulty that must be overcome. In this sense,
the bare essentials of theater are  a door, and  a mountain. Samuel
Beckett's stage settings--a pair of garbage cans, a tree in various states
of blossom, an ash heap--are Zefirellian extravagances compared to this
economical sort of drama. But Beckett's plays, like <I>Der Jasager</I>,
are investigations of nakedness, <I>th&eacute;&acirc;tre pur</I>,
the kind of drama that is left when everything non-dramatic has been
rigorously pared away.

Weill's musical methods can be profitably studied in the eighth of the
ten numbers of the score, near the beginning of the second act. Here the
expedition reaches a way-station on the mountain climb, and decides to
rest; the boy announces that he feels unwell; the other children tell
the teacher, who says that he's probably just exhausted from climbing;
but everyone knows that the path above the hut follows a ledge, too narrow
for carrying anyone, and it is possible that the sick boy will have to be
flung down the cliff-side. This number is pieced together from a handful
of pattern-units, of which the most important is that of the opening two
bars: the notes D-F-D, followed by a chord with G in the bass and D<SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/7.2albright01.gif"></SUB> and
E<SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/7.2albright01.gif"></SUB> in the treble--that is, a sketch of D minor, followed by a 6/5 chord on
E<SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/7.2albright01.gif"></SUB>, a kind of Neapolitan (<A HREF="7.2albright_1.html"> 1</A>). In
the following two-bar sequences, the first bar keeps steadily tromping
its D-F-D, but this re terminates in other chords: A
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
, then E<SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/7.2albright01.gif"></SUB>7; after this, the re of the first bar opens outward to
D-A-D, and still wider to B<SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/7.2albright01.gif"></SUB>-A-B<SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/7.2albright01.gif"></SUB>. The re keeps straining towards
cadence, but never achieves such gratification in a meaningful way;
and finally it returns to exactly the same form it took in the first two
bars. This pattern-unit is, I believe, a representation of a determined
laborious ascent, an icon of trudge. It has a certain melodic and
harmonic flexibility, but flexibility within narrow limits; Weill has
constructed its changes not to illustrate a particular harmonic direction,
but simply to illustrate a kind of pushing and pulling within the re
itself, a kind of interior tension. The re dilates itself without
developing, then contracts to its original shape: monotony is evaded
without compromising the purity and isolation of the gesture.

This is what <I>gestic</I> music looks like when freed from all
non-<I>gestic</I> elements. At the beginning of the piece, the resolute
re (scale degrees <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/7.2albright02.gif"></SUB> in the minor) doesn't extricate itself
from the rest of the music: it <I>is</I> the music. What exactly is the
<I>gestus</I> here, besides the physical motion of making your way over
difficult terrain, taking three steps forward (<SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/7.2albright03.gif"></SUB>), then planting
your right foot on a stone that gives way, flattens beneath your weight
(<SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/7.2albright04.gif"></SUB>)? Perhaps the re itself contains a clue to its own meaning. In
Gluck's <I>Orfeo ed Euridice</I> --the great reform opera, itself
a "prototype of opera"--the chorus of the Furies blocks Orpheus's way
through Hades, and attempts to terrify him with the darkness, the mists,
the howling of Cerebus (<A HREF="7.2albright_2.html">2</A>). This chorus, in C Minor, begins with
a bar in which the chorus, in unison, sings the notes <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/7.2albright05.gif"></SUB>; then,
moving to the dominant, G major, their first note in the second bar is
D--yielding a striking <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/7.2albright06.gif"></SUB> re. Although Gluck's harmony is
more conventional than Weill's, the Furies' re and Weill's re
bear several strong points of relation: a near-identical melodic shape
in 3/4 tempo, a hell-waltz.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the infernal scene of <I>Orfeo</I>, Gluck discovered an
important--perhaps the most importan--way of creating a musical form
for tragedy. For Gluck, and arguably for Sophocles and Euripides as
well, tragedy is ultimately a matter of fists beating against walls:
mankind struggling with and crying against the limits of the human
condition. Gluck's scene in hell offers an extremely powerful musical
representation of both the wall and the cry, as Orpheus pleads, with the
simplest, most elegant pathos, against the barrier of the iron-hearted
Furies--until at last they weep, the gate swings open, and Orpheus is
allowed to proceed. Gluck's discovery that a tragedy could be conceived
as a huge <I>ritornello</I>, in which a savage and implacable refrain
was interrupted by the miseries of a solo voice, has had incalculable
consequences in subsequent opera. It is easy to find wall-vs.-plaint
oppositions everywhere, in Leonora's "Pace, pace", in Verdi's <I>La forza
del destino</I> , and the end of Stravinsky's <I>Oedipus Rex</I>
, in the fishwife's role in Dessau's <I>Die Verurteilung des
Lukullus</I> .

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The <SUB><IMG SRC="symbols/7.2albright02.gif"></SUB> re in <I>Der Jasager</I> seems a spare sketch of
a musical wall. Its <I>gestus</I> isn't simply walking, but also
the necessity to walk, or else to be thrown down the side of the
mountain. This re is the musical equivalent both of the impulse
that pushes the expedition forward, and of the old rite that demands
that those unable to proceed must be killed. The harmonic frustration
keeps dilating, without resolving: it thrusts

<B></B>

the boy forward onto the path too narrow for him to walk. If there is a
subliminal allusion here to Gluck, it is perfectly appropriate, for the
boy's teacher, the boy's classmates, are for him, even if they have the
best will in the world, Furies.

But in the Gluckian tragic structure every wall must be balanced by a
plaint. The plaint in <I>Der Jasager</I> is the controlling pattern-unit
of the first part of the tenth number (<A HREF="7.2albright_3.html"> 3</A>). Over incessant repetitions
of this re, the teacher gives to the boy a formal and explicit
reading of the law: one who gets sick on a mountain journey must be
thrown into the valley; his companions must ask him if he wants them to
abandon the journey and return home, on his account; and he must answer,
"You shall not return." And the boy does indeed cry out, "You shall
not return." The two-bar musical re underneath most of this lecture
and response consists of two chordal suspensions that (in the case of
the first appearance) might be understood as a kind of frustrated i-V
half-cadence from A minor to E: in the first bar, a chord of the notes
(reading from bottom up) A, D, and E, a 4-3 suspension over A--but for
an instant the D dips down to C, producing a glimpse at exactly the
sort of clear, root-position triad that this re is never going
to rest upon. The second bar consists of a static chord of the very
widely spaced notes E, B, and A--a complicated version of yet another
4-3 suspension, this time over E. It would be easy to make this chord
cadence solidly on E, but that is exactly what Weill didn't do; instead
the re keeps repeating itself, with various spread-out harmonies in
the second bar. I speak of suspensions, but harmony suspended in such
a manner is clearly never going to fall: the sonority is cool, spare,
detached, a set of pure acoustic objects generated from fifths. The
re is not an expression of pain but a hieroglyph of pain. Here is
an isolated bit of naked expressivity--a succession of 4-3 suspensions
that not only don't cadence, but that <I>mean</I> the absence of cadence,
a state of permanent unhappy irresolution.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I think of this double-suspension re as a freeze-dried lamentation. A
lamentation is, by nature, expansive: overwhelming wretchedness wishes
to expatiate on itself. But this is a clipped, truncated lamentation,
a lamentation with little blood in it. The more the re is repeated,
the less pathetic it becomes: all semantics depend on systems of
differentiation, and in the absence of a context any re, no matter how

<B></B>

potently charged, will become drained, a kind of fossil of meaning,
or a pickled embryo presented coolly with forceps. (This is a potential
danger with all musical hieroglyphs: it is impossible for any acoustic
object to retain a steady significance, for the mere act of repetition
tends to alter or remove the context that provided the meaning in the
first place--the hope for a reliable dictionary of music-res can
never be fulfilled.) The double-suspension re in <I>Der Jasager</I>
is less a lamentation than a kind of semaphore for a lamentation that
isn't taking place; a stand-in for an uncomplained complaint.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The boy is not so self-indulgent as to protest his fate; so the music
indicates what he might have said, but didn't. If musical tragedy tends
to comprise a wall and a plaint, this strange re might be conceived
as both wall and pliant in one: suitable both for the teacher's quotation
of the law, and for the boy's consent to it. It is the ideal hieroglyph
of acquiescence: quietly implacable and coldly sad. To listen to the
music is to read about suffering; someone else's suffering, not our own.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Weill's American musical plays, we sometimes find similarly
chilled res, musical ghosts of res that might have once been
expressive. For example, the central character in <I>Lady in the Dark</I>
(1941, with lyrics by Ira Gershwin) is Liza Elliott, a magazine editor
who tells her analyst her fears of personal inadequacy; in a dream scene,
set in a circus, she justifies her indecisiveness by singing "The Saga
of Jenny," concerning a cheerful, self-indulgent woman who creates havoc
by making quick decisions:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The choral refrain, "Poor Jenny, bright as a penny," is sung to a re
of mock lamentation--the term "poor" is obviously inappropriate for this
brassy dame, but Weill's music is full of stylized sighs, organized
around harmonic scrunches (produced by the simple means of stressing
the seventh in dominant-seventh chords). One of the most remarkable
features of Weill's whole career is the quality of musical irony in
his later works, the way in which his ear re-mapped the stock res
of American popular music as elements of a sophisticated European
semantics. The eighteenth-century satirist Jonathan Swift sometimes
used a rhetorical re that corresponds to irony in the same way that
irony corresponds to normal speech: that is, he would say exactly what
he meant, but in such a way that the reader would suspect that he meant
something completely different--for instance, when he recommended that
the court should make virtuous conduct a matter of good manners, so that
courtiers would behave honestly under the same pressure of etiquette that
compelled them to use the right fork at table. Weill, too, developed
a manner of expressing what he believed in a way so literal that it's
hard to take him seriously. I believe that "Poor Jenny" is, finally,
less a mock lamentation than a mock mock lamentation, an expression of
Weill's sense of the emptiness of the life of a rich, amoral hedonist
such as Jenny. This Jenny might be conceived

<B></B>

as Pirate Jenny's great-granddaughter, a far more successful pirate,
triumphantly rapacious. "The Saga of Jenny" like "Seer&auml;uber-Jenny"
but in a far lighter manner, exposes the desolation at the heart of her
wishing. But this simple meaning is so feathered with a fringe of ironic
possibilities that Weill evaded all responsibility for it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Weill died in 1950, and the music-philosopher Theodor Adorno, perhaps
ashamed because he had once defended Weill's music, wrote a venomous
obituary:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

Weill considered himself a kind of Offenbach  of his century, and with
respect to speed of social-aesthetic reaction and to sketchiness, the
analogy is not unreasonable. But the model is not to be repeated. The
horror of reality has become too overwhelming for a parody to reach up to
it. . . . Indeed he had something of the genius of the great milliner. The
capacity was given him to find the proper melodies for the year's display,
and this completely transitory thing may last.

Clothes are relevant to Weill: <I>The Threepenny Opera</I>, for
example, is a story about clothes, in that Peachum is the beggars' main
haberdasher, and Lucy wears a false belly to feign pregnancy; so perhaps
Adorno was in a sense right in conceiving Weill as a musical Chanel or
Balenciaga. But I think of Weill as a composer who was able to put on any
clothes--ranging from Protestant chorale to Jewish melisma to Euro--tango
to Schoenbergian atonality to Ricahrd Rodgers' popcorn--precisely because
he was so confident that he had centered his art on the fundamentals of
expression: on legible music-res. He was not a fake, but a serious
composer adept at wearing any sort of frivolous musical drag. Perhaps
the simplicity of <I>Der Jasager</I> is as much an artifice as any of
his other styles, but I'm tempted to see it as the closest approximation
of Weill <I>in sich</I>, Weill without his dazzling polystylisms, Weill
examining the basic tool-kit of his art: <I>Der Jasager</I> is music
expression performed with flint axe and blade of horn, not much like such
gorgeous, glossy devices as <I>The Threepenny Opera</I> and <I>Lady in the
Dark</I>. And yet, even when Weill pretended to be Offenbach, or worse,
his music relies on the old semantics as stated and refined by Monteverdi
and other great res. The sometimes fashionable cut of Weill's clothes
masks the extraordinary historical force of his language--as responsive
to the whole tradition of Western music as to the language of Stravinsky
or of Adorno's beloved Schoenberg. Weill, like Joyce in <I>Ulysses</I>,
made his art a total art, by appropriating every resource that history
provided: behind any of Weill's stage pieces, opening out onto everything
from the <I>The Play of Daniel</I> to Rodgers' <I>Carousel</I>. To learn
what is the common property of all music theater, listen to Weill.

Many versions of Weill's life are told from this Faustian point of view:
Weill sold out fame, for money, through relentless expansion of the
kingdom of the banal. But Weill faced the same dilemma that Schoenberg
and Webern and Mann's Leverk&uuml;hn faced: after one had concentrated
one's art to the limits of sobriety, without development or fancifulness
of any sort, what did one do next? That didactic masterpiece, <I>Der
Jasager</I>, shows a musical art that has stopped being pretense and
play, and has aspired to become knowledge. But the world cannot subsist
on professorial lessons alone; and it is a testament to Weill's richness
of imagination that he could use every resource of musical art, from
Bach to the most meretricious <I>chanson</I>, to convey his strangely
urgent critiques of expression. Leverk&uuml;hn, of course, really did
sell his soul to the devil; but Weill did something far more modern,
far more radical: he sold his soul to Broadway.

For modernism, the legacy of Enlightenment modernity was both necessary
and annihilating, like Virginia Woolf's Angel in the House:
without her, there would have been no Woolf and yet <I>with</I> her,
there almost was no Woolf--so strict was the Angel's discipline of
self. Just so, modernism was continually caught in a deconstructive
dilemma. It aimed to break the disciplines of Enlightenment ideology
on which it simultaneously depended, including, I will argue, a racial
narratology. Among its other paradoxical acts, modernist fiction deflated
the dream of transcendent objectivity while realizing the strangely
complementary dream of a subjectivity so pervious and sensitive that it
absorbs whole worlds in single moments. This tricky relationship to
<BR>
Enlightenment sensibility finds a parallel in modernism's relationship
to Enlightenment history: while modernism's critique of depth, "real"
history, and dimensionality as coherent conditions with a "good"
telos moved it toward an aesthetic of flattening and fragmentation,
that aesthetic entailed nonetheless a curving back, an engagement in the
history it critiqued--even a desire <I>for</I> that history. The collage
"M" in the title of this journal captures exactly this ambivalence:
a double orientation toward the rounded and the flat, history's curve
and contingency's crisscross, the weight of tradition and the flight of
transgression. Modernism wants <I>both</I> terms--the life-giving angel
and the

<B></B>

murdered angel, so to speak. And race, exactly because of its commerce
with the angels of English narrative and history, shapes modernist
fiction's very practice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For in the modern West at least, race and narrative are joined at the

(to borrow William Wordsworth's trope), imaged implicitly as the angelic

 Gertrude Stein understood this entanglement of race and narrative even
 as she used it to shock and attract her white readership by in effect
 shouting racial epithets in her stories. In the process, however,
 like other modernists Stein was teasing apart, as if it were a knotted
 rootball, the problem of race. As John Whittier-Fergusen has recently
 argued in these pages, the relation between Stein's "politics" and her
 aesthetics is too often oversimplified, given how embedded it is in a
 long and winding cultural history.

 Stein's work can serve to reveal the surprising ways that, indeed,
 modernism flowers perversely in the soil of modernity due to the mineral

My argument highlights the origin of Western racial narrative not
in imperial practices or travel narratives but rather in English
revolutionary history. To start here gives insight into the hidden
hybridity of racial discourses, their joining of revolutionary and
imperial impulses. In the wake of England's revolutionary period in the
latter half of the seventeenth century, historical, sentimental, and
"realistic" narrative gave shape to crucial self-fashioning "root" myths
for "Britain" and, in turn, "America." Stein's fiction, in particular
<I>The Making of Americans</I> and <I>Three Lives</I>, insistently
reiterates the tropes of sentiment, virtue, race, and reproduction that
infuse these racial myths and nurture subjectivity in the West--allowing
her at once to water and wilt the flower of modernity.

What is race, after all? Race is a narrative concept. Whether or not
it becomes the basis for social hierarchy or gets conred in binary
oppositions, "race" is at base the idea that characteristics are passed
from one generation to the next through time; it is the claim that
behavior in the present and future is predictable because it is based on
characteristics inherited from ancestors who lived in the past. Races
or species may evolve, as scientists have argued for a century and a
half, but to say so only reinforces the diachronic principle on which
race depends. Yet within both narrative and the notions of race as
they have developed in the West there lies a sharp tension, or paradox,
between pastness and futureness, history and progress, reproduction and
production--a tension which Stein and other modernists fully exploit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some of Edward Said's early work on the novel throws light on
this tension. In <I>Beginnings</I>, Said argues that, with the
eighteenth-century rise of the novel in England, narrative in the West
may be characterized by its fictionalization of origins or "beginnings."
In other times and cultures, Said explains, narrative is most often
a retelling of authorized or familiar stories, serving to reinstate
cultural referents even as it reconres them; but, with the rise of
the novel and the idea of individuality, Western

<B></B>

narrative obsessively sought to tell <I>new</I> stories of unknown
individuals, to make a question and an "original" plot of the
protagonist's beginnings. In the process the novel recreated the story
of culture--a point that Nancy Armstrong and other critics of the novel
have more recently elaborated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet in his early essay "On Repetition," Said also recognizes a necessary
tension in Western narratives, which he identifies as a tension between
production and reproduction. He first of all compares the conservative,
stabilizing function of repetition in cultural forms (such as in laws,
rituals, and myths) to the similarly conservative role of marriage and
biological reproduction. Reproduction, like ritualization, reflects the
will to repeat, to create a new generation that will carry on the forms
and customs of the old. He furthermore suggests, without developing
the idea, that many laws and rituals operate to reproduce the norms of
heterosexual reproduction and contain its members' anarchic, nonrepetitive
impulses toward "anti-social" individuality or non-reproductive
sexuality. Said argues that modern re-writers of Western narratives of
culture, such as Vico and Marx, resist this investment in repetition
and yet remain caught in a tension between production and reproduction,
for even while they champion the virtues of production and argue for
social transformation they fall back, as Said sees it, on metaphors of
biological reproduction to imagine these innovations into being.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I suggest that we can more precisely historicize Said's claims, both about
the English plot of origins and about the tension between reproduction
and innovation, when we consider this plot in relation to the emergent
racial and gender mythologies of the late seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. The rise of the English-language novel, with its stories of
self-generated beginnings, coincides importantly with the codification
of a new plot of origins for English culture, a racialized plot in which
sexuality and marriage are the necessary instruments of both progress
and reproduction. The conventional stories of a family's progress,
a reformed foundling, or a virtuous servant or merchant-class woman
who marries a nobleman, all support the ideological transition from a
racialized critique of Stuart monarchy and the "noble" class, to a new
racial imperialism legitimated by the idea of a democratically "noble"
English sensibility. While they are shaped by plots of new beginnings
and novel alliances--in other words, of the production of new social
arrangements--these stories also remain invested in and dependent on the
trope of reproduction, of the perpetuation and stabilization of these
social arrangements <I>through</I> reproduction, which is in fact an
implicitly racialized reproduction. To establish this point, I'll refer
to arguments I have made elsewhere about race narratives in early modern
England, specifically pre-imperial narratives involving the Anglo-Saxon
"race," which extend the work of a number of intellectual and cultural
historians.

As early as the Elizabethan period, with the founding of the Society
of Antiquaries, scholars began developing the notion that pre-Norman
codes and customs formed the true "common-law" basis for English
institutions. Yet it was in seventeenth-century revolutionary England that
such ideas took root most powerfully. Dissident groups invoked a rhetoric
of the "Norman Yoke" to defend the claims of the "native" Anglo-Saxons
against the Norman monarchy. In challenging the powers of the papacy and

<B></B>

the throne, lawyers, craftsmen, and religious reformers alike built
on the growing scholarship in "Saxonism," that is, in pre-Norman,
Saxon language, laws, relics, and customs. As is well-known, Edward
Coke supported his influential "common law" interpretation of English
government and property rights with evidence from the <I>Archainomia</I>,
a recently available compendium of Anglo-Saxon laws.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 His agenda was less radical by far than that of the famous Leveller
 pamphleteer and religious radical Gerard Winstanley, but they both
 mounted arguments that would have been inconceivable without the new
 material about pre-Norman feudal law among the Anglo-Saxons. Pamphleteers
 among the Leveller and Digger movements expanded these materials into
 a counter-myth of English history. Winstanley argued in his "Law of
 Freedom" letter to Oliver Cromwell that "When the Norman power had
 conquered our forefathers, he took the free use of our English ground
 from them" and furthermore that "all Kings from his time to Charles,
 were successors of that conquest, and all laws were made to confirm
 that conquest" (22, 23).
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 No doubt this myth of Norman against Englishman gave special resonance
 to Sir Henry Holcroft's 1653 translation of Procupius' <I>History of
 the Warres of the Emperour Justinian</I>, with its proclamation that
 "No government . . . be conferr'd upon strangers in blood/but such only
 have the place, to whose race it did belong" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 As historian Trevor Colbourn puts it, such views made it possible to
 argue that in England "[l]iberty did not have to be created; it only
 needed to be restored" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 History proved, in other words, that "liberty" was the <I>natural</I>
 state of the English nation, a state that was now being recovered and
 <I>reproduced</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This reconception of English identity as Gothic-Saxon and infused with an
impulse to liberty was gradually codified in a spate of eighteenth-century
histories of England by writers from David Hume to Catharine Macaulay. It
also shaped a range of linguistic and aesthetic projects, including
Samuel Johnson's <I>Dictionary</I>, in the Preface of which he proclaims
that "The whole fabric and scheme of the English language is Gothick or
Teutonick," and then argues that it has unfortunately been "deviating
towards a Gallick structure and phraseology, from which it ought to be
our endeavor to recall it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Such accounts of the English language set the stage for the founding
 of an <I>English</I> literary tradition (on which foundation it would
 expand to become a <I>British</I> tradition that claimed the literature
 of Scotland and Ireland).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Thus the move toward innovation and resistance to the reigning powers
 entailed a narrative of recuperation, specifically of a kin-distinct
 lineage characterized by its native virtue and its impulse toward
 liberty. This is the generating tension that catalyzes the West's romance
 with race all the way into the twentieth century: it gives cultures
 <I>traditional</I> authority for historical <I>change</I>--including,
 ultimately and ironically, imperialistic extensions of power that
 reinstate new hierarchies of race in colonial locales from Ireland
 to America, from India to Australia to Africa. Racialized accounts of
 history are able thus to propel revolution <I>and</I> imperialism. Race
 at once revolutionizes "national" history and naturalizes "manifest"
 destiny.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This double function of the racial idea unfolds most ironically in the
American Revolution. As Trevor Colbourn, Reginald Horsman, and others
have shown, the notion

<B></B>

that "Saxons" had a special sensibility and love of liberty was
enthusiastically imported to the colonies by the radical Whig interpreters
of English history, including Thomas Jefferson who imagined the American
experiment in self-government as potentially true to the early Anglo-Saxon
legacy that King George and Parliament had betrayed. Jefferson explicitly
invoked libertarian Saxon "sentiment" as the compelling impulse of the
revolution and named the supposedly Saxon model of self-governance by
a federation of small landowners as a prototype for the new American
experiment. Thus did the Saxon myth face off against itself in the
American Revolutionary War--with revolutionaries fashioning themselves as
the true Whigs whose mission was to challenge the corrupted English Whigs
as well as the Tories--an historical irony prepared, I am suggesting,
by the hybrid impulses of race ideology in the first place. And, as they
accused the moderate English Whigs of doing, these radical American
Whigs were simultaneously reconsolidating hierarchies of power, for
they considered their Saxon will to liberty as the character trait that
distinguished them from others, specifically Africans, and justified
their power over these others.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 This is the typical racial turn, by which humble nature re-emerges from
 oppression to become a noble culture that deserves to rule others. Modern
 Western ideologies of race arise as narratives of revolution claiming
 recuperation which, exactly because of the double allegiance to pastness
 and futureness, natural hierarchies and cultural transformation, lend
 themselves to an apparently innocent chauvinism--or, as we move into
 the realm of culture, a nostalgic experimentalism: in other words,
 a past-seeking modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thus the paradox at the heart of racialism is also the paradox at the
heart of modernism and modernity: its investment in the past is its ticket
to the future. The regular reappearance of "romantic" or
"essentialist" or "folk" racial myths among revolutionary groups emerges
in this light as a phenomenon that re-plays the conflict of interests
propelling modernity. Whether in race, gender, or class myths, whether in
rationalist thought or technology, modernity creates a naturalized "given"
to justify acts of innovative making--and re-hierarchizing. Specifically,
race lends a principle of narrativity by which the ancient culminates in
the modern: modernists from Mina Loy and William Carlos Williams to Woolf,
Faulkner, Joyce, and Stein apprehended, reworked, inflated, deflated and
in any case unavoidably engaged with this racial narratology. Accordingly
does Stein adopt the idea of "bottom nature" as catalyst for a radical
reconception of "character." Modernists, like modernity, often depend
on a myth of racial history to transcend history.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this light, we can glimpse new ways in which the novel operates as a
magnetic power. Beginning in the eighteenth century, it gathers together
the dispersed and incoherent impulses of change-through-tradition and
resolves them into psychologized narratives, as Nancy Armstrong has noted
in terms of class and gender struggles. But I am emphasizing that the
novel's often epic narratives of sensibility also implicitly form the
inscape of a new epic version of history in their minute fashioning of
modern English <I>character,</I> fictional and lived. This is not only
a making-innocent of what is political, as Armstrong rightly points out,
but it is also a politics of innocence achieved through narration--through
narration of a phoenix-like rising out of the past which

<B></B>

cleanses the self for a new orientation toward the future. Herein do
the lives of non-aristocratic and common characters, so integral to
the novel's plot of origins, take on interest and <I>unfold</I> as
<I>naturally</I> "noble"--a word originally aligned with aristocratic
"noble-blooded" races but appropriated by writers portraying the
middling classes to connote a humble and exquisitely other-sensitive
sensibility. Such is the appeal of <I>Robinson Crusoe</I>, whose honest
yet apparently crude sensibility finds cultivation on the island through
a private, recognizably Protestant relationship with God, and then is
ultimately secularized into his Englishman's practice of industry and
generosity in business. The eighteenth and nineteenth century foundling
plot epitomized in <I>Tom Jones</I>--in which the disenfranchised, kinless
orphan proves to be the salt of the earth, vibrant in sensibility, and
at the same time having a hidden or usurped noble heritage--provides
a virtual allegory of the mythical fall and rise of the "Saxons." Such
novels tell the story of the innocent's return to power as if it were
a story of sentimental transformation: the history of a nation written
as the recuperation of a righteous self--a latter day pilgrim's progress.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The racialization in these narratives is sometimes quiet--embedded for
instance in references to Mr. Allworthy's Gothic-styled estate with
its native landscaping--and sometimes more structurally supported--as
in the fact that Crusoe's evolution toward a man of sensibility finds
prompting in his encounter with "Friday." It is against the background of
"savage" Friday that Crusoe's reflective and civilized identity comes
into relief (although unstably); but it is also through his supposed
acts of generosity and open-mindedness (as rendered by Defoe) towards
Friday that Crusoe comes into his own as an English type. Again here we
see race's doubleness in play, in that a character's ability to embrace
a "friend" across racial boundaries comes to signify the nature of his
superior racial identity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
    The chain of influences linking Samuel Richardson and his intimate
    friend and doctor George Cheyne to that proto-theorist of sensibility,
    Isaac Newton, gives a small hint of this early confluence of
    racial currents of thought and the novel of sensibility. As
    G.J. Barker-Benfield has shown, Newton's work influenced Cheyne's
    theories of sensibility, which in turn informed Richardson's vision
    of character.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In his <I>Principia</I> (1687, though not translated from Latin
 until the 1720's) and especially <I>Optics</I> (1717-1718, 2nd
 edition), Newton pioneered study of the ways our "little sensoriums"
 are manifestations of God's "boundless uniform Sensorium" via a "most
 subtle spirit" highly attuned to "Vibrations" transmitted along the
 "solid Fibres" of the optic and auditory "nerves." Yet even for Newton
 this conception differentiated Western Protestant culture from other
 cultures: Newton contrasts the divinely sensitive self to that
 of "the Heathen" whose panoply of "false Gods" "blinded" him to these
 subtle internal extensions of God. Newton thus quietly initiates a
 yoking of sensibility and ethnocentrism that strengthens with each
 passing decade. Yet meanwhile, under Newton's influence, Cheyne develops
 the idea of the "Sentient Principle" of the self whose nerves are like
 "<I>Keys</I> which, being struck on or touch'd, convey the Sound and
 Harmony to this Sentient Principle, or <I>Musician</I>"; and these
 notions find full epic fictional expression in Richardson's <I>Clarissa,</I> whose title character exquisitely embodies them. In fact I would

<B></B>

argue that the epic stature of Clarissa in the imaginations of Richardson
and his readers derives from her embodiment of an ideal type of <I>English</I> womanhood, one whose <I>natural</I>, sentient nobility both precedes
and transcends her class nobility. The ethos of sentimentality is thus
an incipient racial ethos and the novel's stories of sensibility are,
I argue, emergent racial stories even when they don't say so, even
sometimes involuntarily because of their inculcation in a deep stream
of racialized historical consciousness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If this is true, the English-language modernists' flattening-out or
endless folding-over of the plots of "sensibility" and their experiments
with the everyday, psychological realism that had characterized the novel
has everything to do with their simultaneous explorations of sexual,
racial, class, and colonial identities. Earlier authors had, of course,
challenged sentimentality and novelistic forms in a variety of ways,
but a critical mass of authors interested in overt experiments with
these forms emerges in the early twentieth century, perhaps because
of the forces of historical change that were bringing ideologies of
race, gender, sexuality, and class to a crisis point. As Degrotte Eby
has shown in his book <I>The Road to Armageddon: The Martial Spirit
in English Popular Literature, 1870-1914</I>, the potential for,
or even inevitability of, a "war of the races" increasingly haunted the
imaginations of English citizens.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 And this state of things apparently came to haunt the imaginations of
 young turn-of the century novelists. In the case of Joyce, for example,
 the epic narratives of race at first attracted and then repulsed and
 outraged but always permeated his imagination.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Although intricate intersubjective plots or bizarrely repetitive
 texts might seem far removed from the West's colonialist history and
 racial imaginary, the evidence above indicates that modernists writers'
 experiments are compelled by the very cultural myths, histories, and
 above all the <I>narrative logic</I> that had brought England and other
 Western countries to this critical point of a sexual, colonial, class,
 and in particular, racial stand-off.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gertrude Stein is among the authors most engaged with this problematic of
race, sex, identity, and narrative. Her early preoccupation with German
and perhaps Jewish immigrant res and other racialized characters
indicates both her suppressed autobiographical involvement in the question
of sensibility and her awareness of the racial structure of Anglo-American
plots. And while Stein rarely foregrounded her German-Jewish identity,
one may nonetheless understand her experimental writing as impelled
by a desire to unfix the imperatives of all such culturally narrated
identities--an idea that in effect she herself theorized in identifying
herself with the "Oriental" infiltration and disruption of western habits,
as Shawn Alfrey has suggested.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Maria Damon and Charles Bernstein have furthermore pointed out that,
 in an era when racial identities were so rigidly prescribed, such an
 impulse would seem almost unavoidable, and preferable to embracing any
 identity locked into western categories of Jew or German or white.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Meanwhile, however, the seductive stabilization of identity that race
offers enthralled Stein as it did so many others in this period. Stein
rushed to fix and essentialize some identities in the process of, and
almost as if it were a necessary means to, dissolving and dislocating
others--in this sense repeating the double finesse typical of racial
rhetoric

<B></B>

in the modern West. While Stein is arguably one of the most radical
innovators in early twentieth century literature, her work at the
same time contains some of the most openly racist descriptions of
characters. Especially since Sonia Saldivar-Hull's important essay
critiquing white feminists' blindness to Stein's racism, critics
interested in discussing the radicalism of Stein's experiments have
struggled to reconcile these two aspects of her fiction, sometimes
feeling forced to choose between appreciation and condemnation of this
text or that.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But to praise some of Stein's work and deem some of it racist only
obscures the ways race is more inherent to her fiction and to Western
narrative as a whole in the ways I have been sketching. As recent
work on modernism corroborates, the modernists' racializing of language,
characters, and plots is of a piece with, rather than an unfortunate
diversion from, their literary innovations. And within this complicated
project, the racist effects, if not intentions, of Stein's and others'
characterizations of blacks continue to perpetuate white discursive and
bodily violence against blacks. In this light I would like to take Sonia
Saldivar-Hull's call to critics to acknowledge this fact as a call also
to understand it: not in order to deny the problem but in order
to move <I>into</I> it, as a step toward moving ourselves historically
through it.

Throughout her career, Stein was preoccupied with the drama of
generational repetition and transgression as it got recast within
western narratives of progress. Stein enters an inherently racialized
Anglo-Saxon narrative tradition, in which economic progress, humble
"feminine" sensibility, and honest virtue are the compelling tropes,
and, in <I>The Making of Americans</I>, she reveals this tradition's
simultaneous counter-investment in conservative hierarchy and patriarchal
authority. More specifically, <I>Making</I> exposes the way this
contradiction trips up those later immigrants--including the narrator
of this novel--who aim to assimilate into this culture through their
own narratives of progress and goodness. Finally, the novel unveils the
part that "men" and "women" and the "virtuous" relations between them
play in the reproduction of this faulty progress narrative, including by
its foregrounding of a weeping heroine-narrator, betrayed and undone by
her own belief in the "bottom natures" of her characters. This tragic
epic of a "family's progress" stands as a kind of grotesque modernist
companion to Richardson's <I>Clarissa</I>.

Reading <I>Three Lives</I> in the context of Stein's project in <I>Making,</I> as I will do in the final section of this essay, does not

goes well beyond using minority characters as vehicles for writing about
"deviant" desire--the typical view of this relationship.

Stein signals her awareness of the narrative tension between repetition

the opening anecdote of <I>The Making of Americans, Being a History of

<B></B>

an early thirty-five page story by the same name (between which two

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Immediately Stein captures the paradox of reproduction and progress
embedded in the generational drama: for the son to drag the father is
both a transgression that dishonors the father and a repetition that
emulates him. Meanwhile this narrative of progress--this dragging
"beyond" a certain point marked as the arrival point by previous
generations--is also a narrative of a family's failure, its violence:
bodily as well as psychological "dragging" is the action at the heart
of the story. The story hints that even if the son (not the daughter,
I presume) were to obey and drag no further, his obedience has already
visited the patriarch's force upon the patriarch: this reversal of power
is the price the patriarch must pay to insure reproduction of his power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In short, narratives of tradition that purport to conserve the past entail
a moment of "progress" or change when the son turns the tables on the
father; and likewise narratives of progress that purport to supercede the
past entail a "repetition" in which the son becomes the father. There is
no pure progress narrative and no true traditional narrative. It is in the
nature of narrative to repeat with a difference. It is in the nature of
culture--at least modern culture--to "make" its "being" again and again,
with something new--someone <I>other</I>--added by historical time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact Stein herself borrows and repeats this very tale, perhaps playing
off the eugenical spirit in which it was published.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 And so we enter Stein's repetitive revision of the novel--of that
 tradition of "histories" of a family's "progress" which she understands
 as an assimilation narrative whose claim to inclusion depends on
 exclusion of less-sensitive others.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Priscilla Wald has fully explored the ways Stein creates her book as
a revisionary version of the contemporary American immigrant tale,
beginning with her title echoing that of the popular immigrant-story
novel by Jacob Riis, <I>The Making of an American</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 After the opening anecdote, the narrator turns to the grandfathers who
 "came across the water" and the grandmothers who "carried these our
 fathers and mothers into the new world inside them" (<I>Making</I>,
 3). At the same time, I am emphasizing, this ethnically-shaped immigrant
 narrative gets framed within the eighteenth-century English trope of a
 "family's progress," which Stein highlights by referring to "this history
 for us of a family and its progress" three times within the first two
 pages of the novel. In bringing together the founding tropes of the
 immigrant American and the classic English novel, Stein foregrounds and
 engages the ethnic substructure of the progress narrative they have in
 common--a structure she challenges in more direct and concentrated, as
 well as more offensive, form in <I>Three Lives</I>. In this first novel,
 as in the stories of <I>Pamela</I> or <I>Pride and Prejudice</I>, "a
 family's progress" has everything to with its reclamation of the "noble"
 via the Saxon virtues of humility, honesty, liberty, and sensibility.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Throughout <I>Making</I>, Stein invokes and repeats the same Saxon
 virtues that we find in the eighteenth-century historical accounts of
 the Saxon's native character as well as in popular eighteenth-century
 novels of sentiment from Henry Fielding's <I>Tom Jones</I> to Henry
 MacKenzie's <I>The Man of Feeling</I>. She makes them the core of her
 characters' feelings in this history of "feeling" and "being," this
 "history of every man and every woman," and in effect identifies them as
 criteria for assimilation into white Protestant culture (<I>Making</I>,
 175). Grandfather Dehning, the first-generation immigrant, is introduced
 as "just a decent honest good-enough man to do ordinary work," "a decent
 well-meaning faithful good-enough ordinary man" (<I>Making</I>, 6). The
 repetition of phrases (which continue in this vein) and the omission
 of commas (especially in the early twentieth century) tend to expose
 these traits as an ideological seme, or a common unit of meaning in the
 social mythos. Because the men in the Dehning family were "generous
 decent considerate fellows, frank and honest," the daughter Julia
 Dehning assumes that all men are "good strong gentle creatures, honest
 and honorable and honoring" (<I>Making</I>, 19, 29). These qualities
 must be highlighted within the immigrant narrative, as they are again
 and again, exactly <I>against</I> accusations that immigrants did
 not fit the profile of a straightforward, upright, simple yet decent
 Anglo-Saxon Americans--of good "fellows."  The narrator hints at the
 hidden racial-national valuation at stake in these "simple" values when
 she turns in this context to the "great question . . . of washing"
 (a motif that also signifies racial identity in <I>Three Lives</I>):
 "The French tell me it's the Italians who never do any washing,
 the French and the Italian both find the Spanish a little short in
 their washing, and the East finds all the West a pig . . . . And so
 it goes"(<I>Making</I>, 16). But she assures us, repeatedly, that the
 eldest Dehning son "was not at all foreign in his washing" but on the
 contrary was a "sporty cheery well washed" young man (<I>Making</I>, 17).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"You see," the humble narrator explains helpfully, "it is just an
ordinary middle class tradition we must use to understand this family's
progress. There must be no aspiring thoughts inside us, there must be a
feeling always in us of being in a kind of way in business always honest,
there must be in a kind of ordinary way always there inside us the sense
of decent enough ways of living for us" (<I>Making</I>, 34). Though
introducing an immigrant cast of characters at a time of growing
fears about the new and large waves of immigration of "lower stocks"
(including lower stock Germans, as made clear in "The Good Anna"), the
narrator, by her use of an unspecified "us," slyly fails to distinguish
German immigrant from "regular" American values. This sleight of hand
meanwhile allows her to include herself in both of these groups. "Us"
is made quite porous. And the ironies thus proliferate insofar as,
on the one hand, these late-arriving Germans are supposedly the root
race for the Anglo-Saxons who now hold precedence in the U.S. and, on
the other hand, the untouched question of whether these Germans are
Jews or Christians leaves the reader unable to identify comfortably
in either direction. Given the centrality of "business" to <I>this</I>
difference, the mention of "a feeling always in us of being in a kind
of way in business always honest" further strains the question of
identification--all in a seemingly happy and innocent account of the
feel-ings of the Dehnings. Indeed the narrator works hard to disallow
any distance or

<B></B>

dis-identification here even as she coyly raises all of these
questions. True to sentimental practice, she implicitly insists on the
identity of all of "us" while covertly referencing divisions within this
"us."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The narrator even boldly eschews the educated middle class habit of
dissociating themselves from the middle class economy (exactly the
phenomenon that Jane Garrity put her finger on in the Bloomsbury group
in a recent issue of this journal).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 First, she declares: "I believe in simple middle class monotonous
 tradition, in a way in honest enough business methods" . Though it
 is risky to equate Stein with her narrator or assume her audience did,
 it is reasonable to claim that in the heightened racial/ethnic atmosphere
 of the early twentieth-century both Stein and many of her readers entered
 this book with an awareness of Stein's Jewishness and her identity with
 the tale of German immigrants. This awareness, lurking just under the
 level of consciousness perhaps, would raise a question for the reader
 about how to respond: is this a Jewish narrator slapping the wrist of
 her Protestant middle class compatriots who consider it bad manners to
 talk in public of money and trade, or is this a good solid American
 expressing pure American feeling, as implied in the manipulative use
 of "us"? Ambiguously referring to her "friends," she suggests that,
 by owning up to her investment in these "business" virtues, she is more
 honest--more American--than her Protestant Anglo-Saxon reader-friends:

"We are to be democratic and aristocratic": while teasing the literate
reader, Stein pierces to the heart of Saxonism, touching directly, even
if unconsciously, on its historically conditioned yet contradictory claim
to both democratic humbleness (as the hearty  people of English soil)
and aristocratic sovereignty (as the wronged nobles of England and the
true Whigs in America).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Next she makes one of her characteristic twists, first of all turning the
righteous innocent voice on the complacent, superior reader ("yet I am
strong, and I am right, and I know it, and I say it to you") and then
identifying herself with the very assumption of superiority over the
rest of the world that these literate, perhaps non-Jewish middle-class
readers quietly cherish for themselves (the middle class "from which has
sprung . . . the very best the world can ever know, and everywhere we
always need it"). Listen to the echo between this last passage and the
1920's President of the U.S. National Institute of Immigration, whose
words simply repeat a clich&eacute; of the first decades of the twentieth
century: "We have bred more than sixty millions of the finest people

<B></B>

the world has ever seen. Today there is to surpass us, none." He goes
on to conclude that "Therefore any race we admit to our social body is
certain to be more or less inferior."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 I suggest that Stein understood perfectly that her narrator is strutting
 through a social minefield, a racial minefield, but her narrator can
 survive this dance because Stein has her mimic the moves of the elite;
 the apparently "forthright" narrative's turns and tropes conform to the
 "native" Anglo-American idea of innocence, honesty, sensibility, and
 liberty. While at first her relation to sentimental tradition remains
 implicit and sly, eventually, though still slyly, the narrator "openly"
 confesses her preoccupation with the nature of sensibility and the
 workings of sentiment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sentimental feeling preoccupies the narrator but also seems to elude
her. Apparently she manifests sentimental feeling in her intense interest
in understanding others, yet the more she repeats her desire to understand
sentimental feeling, the more the possibility seems to recede and the less
she seems to be one of "they" who feel it. She divides most sharply from
this sentimental group on the "feeling" of "certainty"--"knowing certainty
inside them"--which she stipulates as an element of sentimentality
along with "feeling, imagination, thinking, . . . and virtuous feeling
in them." She repeatedly includes certainty among other, more commonly
recognized, uplifting traits of the sentimental: "some have a sentimental
sense of the beauty and the loveliness and the truth of certain feeling
and it is so lovely and so noble and everybody is so good and so beautiful
. . .These are many ways of being sentimental" (<I>Making</I>, 450).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact her particular fascination with "certainty," and (as
we learn later) her failure to achieve it, gets dramatized in
the prose's repetitiveness.  Here as in much of her writing,
Stein institutes the principles of repetition and reproduction yet
meanwhile enacts their implosion via the inevitable temporal principle of
<I>difference</I>--thus, through, repetition, unfolding the contradictions
of sentimental narration of an organic self. Like the deconstructive
theorists who would later philosophize (perhaps partly under Stein's
belated influence) about the decentering effects of this apparently
stabilizing principle of repetition, Stein shows that repetition always
manifests a difference from one instance to the next, despite its driving
desire for a sameness organized around an anchoring original. Say a
word twice and the second time around it expresses a difference if only
because it now echoes the first saying. "Yes" is different from "yes,
yes." The second yes, while reinforcing the first, at the same time
turns against it, or puts it in question by displaying the felt need to
insist on it. Cultural or narrative repetition likewise enacts "stress"
in both senses of the word.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's narrator pushes further yet, however, to give just a hint of
a "gay" feeling under--and under cover of--this righteous, virtuous
feeling. Philip Redfern epitomizes one typical kind of "virtuous being,"
who "was to himself a man simple, sensuous, and passionate. . . from whom
chivalry demanded he should be always yielding when he himself was not
active in feeling."  And after all, he is like those others who "make
a principle to free them, from the weakness in them" (<I>Making</I>,
446). Yet key allusions suggest that his principle is a decoy for his
gay "sexual emotion," for "he was of the kind of them and perhaps Lord
Byron and Oscar Wilde were this kind of them, he was of them who become
romantic, heroic, beautiful, saintly by the weakness in them that is
there always acting" (<I>Making</I>, 445). While Stein covertly tells us
Philip could have loved men, Philip simply feels that "every one could
hold him by suggesting to him by the sensitive suggestibility in him and
this was his great weakness in him and he made of it the principle of his
living to himself in his talking, thinking, feeling" (<I>Making</I>, 445).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Stein scrutinizes here is the way the insistence on a structure
of self-truth, of identity with oneself that allows for certainty in
virtuousness, aims exactly to contain a volatile difference within
oneself. She further explains that within this dynamic "Sensitivity
turns into suspicion, cleverness, self-protection. . . . These then
all of them have it inside them that everything turns inside them
to suspicion, to cleverness, to self-protection, to sexual emotion,
to sensibility of a kind that is a thing that is called sentimental"
(<I>Making</I>, 566). If "sexual emotion" in particular compels this
posture that is called sentimental then the following joke takes on a
double valence--one that both incriminates and explains the middle class
obsession with honest decency: "There are some who have not any feeling of
virtue in them. There are not very many of them" (<I>Making</I>, 444). In
"Melanctha," "wisdom" is code for gay sexual knowledge; here "virtue" may
be the same--though layered slyly underneath  all the "normal" meanings
of virtue so that this sexual virtue is what "decent" virtue harbors.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet again, although Stein thus seems to critique the sentimental
novelistic tradition, we should recall that it has been our narrator's
ambition exactly to come clean in a sentimental way and get to the
bottom of "every kind of men and every kind of women and every way any
one can think about them" (<I>Making</I>, 175). Her very pulling back of
the layers of sentimentality to expose a gay feeling is a sentimental
project: it wants a self, a self with a history that has "everything
included" (<I>Making</I>, 335). Importantly, however, and <I>perhaps</I>
intentionally, her project fails; she cannot keep each one separate
from her self and whole unto himself or herself. Instead it "gets all
mixed up to me all mixed up in each one . . . and then sometimes all
of a sudden I lose the meaning out of all of them I lose all of them"
(<I>Making</I>, 335). About halfway through the novel she laments,
"Perhaps no one ever will know the complete history of every one. This
is a sad thing" (<I>Making</I>, 453). It seems that perhaps "bottom"
nature is after all bottomless--just as repetition would seem to anchor
but in practice unhinges truth and narrative. The narrator's sentimental
dilemma reaches a climax as she approaches the last sections of her
book and broods over the complicated blending and mixtures and slippery
repetitions of each one. She confesses finally that:

Stein's narrator once more exposes herself as certain only of
uncertainty--a failed sentimental subject. And yet she weeps; she puts
herself at her reader's mercy; and so her reader is forced to make the
very move Stein has exposed as duplicitous and self-serving and, most
importantly, catalyzed by the questions of inclusion and ostracism,
a move prompted by a sentimental longing to reach across to the other
for recognition ("I tell you I cannot bear it this thing that I cannot be
realizing experiencing in each one being living") exactly in order to have
some sense of control in the world of others. Sensibility is an ambition,
in other words. It is omnivorous. And the reader is included in its feast.

<I>The Making of Americans, Being the History of a Family's Progress</I>
repeats the contradictory modern narrative of being and making, or
inheritance and innovation, that had shaped all such histories of a
family's <I>progress</I>. It meanwhile names the uncertainty principle
underlying progress's drive to <I>know</I>; and it links these to the
veiling of a non-reproductive yet compelling "sexual emotion." Through
repetition, Stein thus narrates the paradox Said had identified in the
modern novel in the West: of a progress that must reproduce itself,
that must repeat itself, that must obsessively begin again and again
to narrate itself in relation to the other, which in the end exposes
its precarious madeness, its will to a world-making self, which I am
arguing rests on a racial self-making and which, Stein reveals, entails a
smothering of gay feeling insofar as racial making requires heterosexual
reproduction. Stein repeats this exposure more searingly in <I>Three
Lives</I>, that triptych of failed assimilations and in particular of
the lesbian desire that disrupts the drive to progress, reproduction,
and assimilation. She strips narrative down to its racial-patriarchal
bones, with a vengeance.

If the narrator in <I>Making</I> simulates sentimentality and expands
it to the point of imploding it, the narrators of <I>Three Lives</I> are
aggressively anti-sentimental as they distill and parody the policing of
eroticism through codes of race and ethnicity. The narrators in <I>Three
Lives</I> insult their characters with racial and ethnic slurs. We learn
in "Gentle Lena" about one of the characters, who is explictly tagged
as German, that she was "an overgrown, slow, flabby, blonde, stupid,
fat girl" while the German family Lena (of the title) marries into is
"dirty and stingy" and "theirs was the german dirt of saving, of being
dowdy and loose and foul in your clothes so as to save them and yourself
in washing, having your hair greasy to save it in the soap and the drying,
having your clothes dirty, not in freedom, but because it was cheaper,
keeping the house close and smelly because so it cost less to get it
heated" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 248, 268).

"Melanctha" goes further. In this story, Rose Johnson is introduced as the
"real black, tall, well built, sullen, stupid, childlike, good looking
negress" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 85). We are told she does <I>not</I> have
"the wide abandoned laughter that makes the warm broad glow of negro
sunshine," and yet she does have the "simple promiscuous unmorality of
the black people" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 86). When her baby dies, perhaps
because she "just forgot it for awhile," Rose doesn't give her loss
much thought because "these things came so often in the negro world in
Bridgepoint"(<I>Three Lives</I>, 85).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These lines are calculated to offend. They are indistinguishable from
contemporary racist assumptions among many educated, established whites
about blacks and new immigrants but are pushed a step further than
"polite" white society (which Stein knew well enough) would like to
read in print or hear out loud. This polite society of established
whites is, I suggest, Stein's imagined audience. Indeed, one important
aspect of the insidious racism of the phrases in "Melanctha" is that
they are most likely written for white ears not black. It is a kind of
audience-response Africanism, wherein, as Toni Morrison clarifies in
<I>Playing in the Dark</I>, blacks serve a function rather than entering
as full human presences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Disconcertingly, though, as I will argue, their function is to echo
 the audience's racism in a way that makes readers squirm--all the while
 creating the author as author through the power of racism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's subjection of both Germans and blacks to this treatment further
suggests that her audience here is similar to that which she addresses
in <I>Making</I> in her apostrophe, "Middle class, middle class, I
know no one of my friends who will admit it." That is, these readers
admit neither, as said there, that they belong to a "sordid material"
economy nor, as implied in <I>Three Lives,</I> that they implicitly
espouse a dehumanizing racism.  She's calling her audience out of its
ideological closets. As we have seen, Stein had an ear for clich&eacute;,
for cultural trope, for what Roland Barthes called the <I>semes</I>
of social mythologies. She regularly picked up on such overdetermined
phrases and imitated the culture's repetition of them so as to pound
the meaning out of them and alert us to their inculcative power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 So Stein simultaneously echoes these phrases in order to expose her
 audience's investment in them and yet reveals her own attachment to
 them. She is empowered by her appropriations of them--she becomes an
 author exactly by this means. This is why, in at least one way, they
 deserve the name of racism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And yet, uncomfortably, to stop here is to turn away from a problem that
is ours as well as hers no matter who we are, and it is also to refuse
the insight Stein has to offer us in her grappling with this problem. For
in these stories Stein identifies a deep link between the economies
of racism and sexism, one that depends on the interlocking structures
of repetition and heterosexual reproduction; and she repeats these
connections in part to reveal them. She is in the business, as I will
later argue the novel is in the business, of recreating and reconring
the cultural fault lines that alienate her from her readers. Yet, more
than some other novelists, she disruptively troubles the link between
narrative repetition and racialized heterosexual reproduction, exactly by
working through and exposing the racial logic and the insistent rhythm
of reproduction that together drive the master plot of Anglo-American
virtue and sensibility, a fact

<B></B>

that becomes especially clear when we read <I>Lives</I> in the light
of <I>The Making of Americans</I>. That is, not only does Stein repeat
a phrase like "the broad sunshine of Negro laughter" enough times to
throw its clich&eacute; character and racist function into relief, to
defamiliarize it, but she does so within an enforced plot of heterosexual
repetition, into which she inserts a lesbian "deviance" that disrupts
it. It is here that I believe there is an incisive critique of racialism
implicit in her modernist narrative practice--even though at the same
time she can safely reiterate racist phrasing because her position as an
educated middle class "white" gives her the luxury to "play" with racism
while her Jewish-German heritage <I>compels</I> her to undertake this
"play."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The opening story of <I>Three Lives</I> begins simply: "Anna led an
arduous and troubled life." Most of the next several pages describe the
small mishaps and frustrations of her dogs, closing with the narrator's
reiteration, "You see that Anna led an arduous and troubled life"
(<I>Three Lives</I>, 13).  Given the triviality of the incidents with
Anna's dogs, we are immediately invited to read these repeated phrases
ironically, or in Bakhtinian terms dialogically, rather than in the
monological way that repetition seems at first to demand. This emerges
as especially so when we realize that the key to these incidents is
sexuality--and the policing of it: despite Anna's earnest and close
supervision, one of her dogs mischievously manages to get another dog
pregnant. The repetitive lament about Anna's "arduous" life mimics Anna's
tone of voice, yet also humorously undercuts her by highlighting the
failure of repetition to reproduce sexual regularity and to contain sexual
deviance. Stein thus forces the narrative mode of repetition to fail
in its function of regularizing reproduction and sexuality, even while
at the same time maintaining the appearance of regularization through
repetition. In effect she narrates what Foucault would later theorize:
the irony of the way in which policing discourses draw attention to and
embellish the acts they purport to prohibit. After all, Anna is fixated
on the sex life of her dogs.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the same time in this first story, repetition functions laboriously to
reproduce and contain ethnic identity as well as sexual regularity. Anna
is described as "a small spare german woman" who speaks a "queer piercing
german english" and who takes in young german girls as servants and acts
the part of "a good incessant german mother who watched and scolded"
(<I>Three Lives</I>, 19). Anna's German-ness is repeatedly stressed,
and with all this stress it begins to feel like an identity under
stress. Again repetition works not to fix but to create a sense of the
need to fix what might otherwise slip away or be misread or, from Anna's
point of view, lead to behavior that would break the rules of German
womanhood. For a key aspect of Anna's Germanness is her "firm old world
sense of what was the right way for a girl to do . . . A girl was a girl
and should act like a girl, both as to giving all respect and as to what
she had to eat" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 24). But many of her troubles are
with girls or women who, like her dogs, do not do "the right way for
a girl to do" (including as to what they eat!). In a way that becomes
even more marked in "Gentle Lena," it is not just that girls are girls
and boys boys but that German girls are <I>German</I> girls and German
boys <I>German</I> boys.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Proper gender identities must be properly ethnicized or racialized--and
it is these racialized gender features that get stressed in all of the
three stories. They are, in

<B></B>

significant part, the form repetition takes in the book. Narrative
repetition is yoked to ethnic or racialized repetition. The repetition
is usually taken far enough, and juxtaposed with enough dialogic effect,
not only to defamiliarize their racialized gender categories but also to
make narrative itself feel like willed repetition, determined recuperation
of a past self into a future self that will hold, an incessant naming
and naming again so as to <I>make</I> identities self-identical.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Meanwhile within this insistently narrated tale of German womanhood there
erupts a lesbian romance: "The widow Mrs. Lehntman was the romance in
Anna's life" . The point is repeated at intervals throughout, in
a way that acknowledges that this is a plot that might get overlooked
or repressed: "Remember, Mrs. Lehntman was the romance in Anna's life"
(<I>Three Lives</I>, 34, 54). Gradually, however, it becomes clear that
this story of the "good" Anna's life is the story of the failure of that
romance, which ends, crucially, over a disagreement about reproduction
and mothering: this reiterative and racially circumscribed cultural
plot reasserts itself over the pressure of that "sexual emotion" that
might have derailed it. As in <I>Making</I>, Stein narrates narrative's
"coverage" of sexuality, its will to contain, to have and to hold,
sexuality by the clenched hand of racialized community and its "progress."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For it is the demand for the reproductive, insistent, "scolding" work
of mothering that comes between Anna and Mrs Lehntman. In Anna's eyes
Mrs. Lehntman is a neglectful mother, who is failing to reproduce
the ideal German girl which, as Anna sees it, burdens her with the
task of showing Mrs. Lehntman's daughter "the right way for a girl
to do." Stein's narrator follows Anna's own maddening allegiance to
this ethnicized reproductive logic by maintaining repetition as her
narrative principle and, despite the insertion of an alternative plot of
homoeroticism, destroying the romance between the two women according to
that logic. Here as in both of the other stories in <I>Three Lives</I>,
the narrator follows this racialized and heterosexual narrative logic
until it kills off all of her deviant female protagonists. A careful
reading of "Melanctha" in this light establishes that it indeed repeats
this narrative logic by which Stein critiques the tradition of sentimental
fiction in English; and that, furthermore, the story of Melanctha's
"deviant" gay sexuality is of a piece with Stein's larger critical
project, perhaps her most overt expression of it, even as it also makes
use of whites' racialized sexual stereotypes of blacks and mulattas to
realize that project.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In an ironic echo of the good Anna's phrase, the female protagonist of
"Melanctha," wonders if suicide would "be really the best way for her to
do" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 89). Melanctha is acute about the logic that
Stein has just displayed for us in the preceding story. For Melanctha,
too, has a romance with another woman, Jane Harden, and for her, too, that
romance brings death. It's as if she looked sideways at the two stories
hers is sandwiched between and reads the writing on the textual wall.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Anna's, Melanctha's gay relationship is partially suppressed, written
elliptically, and finally cut short and defamed by codes that designate
"the right way for a girl to do." Although as a young woman Melanctha
is at first timid about sexuality, she wanders the streets in search
of <I>something</I>. Yet "with all her courage," the narrator tells us,
"Melanctha was here a coward, and so she could not learn to understand"--

<B></B>

until she meets Jane Harden who "had had much experience [and] was not
afraid to understand" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 100, 103). Jane was "very
much attracted by Melanctha" and they begin "more to be together than
to see men" during which time Melanctha "dimly . . . began to see what
it was that she should understand" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 105, 104). With
a smirk referring not only to the way Jane upsets Melanctha because she
"would be with other people and with men and with Melanctha," the narrator
tells us "in every way she got it from Jane Harden" (<I>Three Lives</I>,
106). Although Melanctha ends this affair and takes up with a man, the
sexual desires and the heterosocial <I>consequences</I> created by it
stay with her.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Anna, Melanctha befriends and is mothered by a heterosexual woman,
Rose Johnson, who very insistently knows what is "right for a decent
colored girl always to be doing" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 208). Some version
of this phrase is repeated by Rose ten or fifteen times. "Decent conduct,"
as Rose sometimes calls it, is repeatedly yoked not only to gender but
also to racial identity. This racially and sexually defined code of the
right way for a girl to do is once more the principle of repetition in
the story. The code is what the story reproduces--echoing the means
by which "colored" culture reproduces itself through its "decent"
reproducing women.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet unlike Anna or Lena, in Melanctha Stein creates a character
who understands the way the repetitions of speech serve not to
<I>represent</I> patterns in life but rather to <I>create</I>, to force,
and to reproduce those patterns in the face of "other" impulses. In
effect, Melanctha herself voices Stein's critique of Western traditions
of representation, especially its narratives of moral sensitivity and
sexual goodness. This becomes most clear in her conversations with the
doctor Jefferson Campbell, the man with whom she has a romance and who
also stands for the insistent principle of "the right way to do."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Jeff understands "just two kinds of ways of loving, one the way it is
to be good in families and the other kind of way, like animals are all
time . .  I didn't ever like that last kind of way much for any of the
colored people" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 158). He is a devoted doctor and
a sentimentalist who "wanted to work so that he could understand what
troubled people, and not just to have excitements, and he believed you
ought to love your father and your mother and to be regular in all your
life, and not to be always wanting new things and excitements" (<I>Three
Lives</I>, 116-17). He also advocates the apparently simple honesty
cherished by the characters in <I>Making</I>. He believes that you should
(and that it is possible to) "always tell everything just as you meant
it. That's the only kind of life he knew or believed in, Jeff Campbell
repeated." So again we have a racialized code of family reproduction
naturalized as "regular," a code which Jeff reproduces and repeats.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That Jeff <I>repeats</I> these notions is important and Melanctha
shrewdly exposes this mode of self-reproduction, and its covert
self-protection. Melanctha responds to Jeff not just by rejecting this
"regular living" code for colored people but also by pointing to its
status as rhetoric, as prescriptive ideology rather than ingenuous
description of feelings. She highlights the gap between his repetitive
speech and his desire: "about what you was just saying, Dr. Campbell
about living regular and all that, I certainly

<B></B>

don't understand what you meant by what you was just saying. You ain't
a bit like good people Dr. Campbell, like the good people you are always
saying are just like you . . . You don't care about going to church much
yourself, and yet you always are saying you believe so much in things like
that, for people" (<I>Three Lives</I>, 120, 118).  Finally she asks him
"what about Jane Harden?" whom he has cared for as a doctor and become
friends with:

repetitive "saying." She highlights the way it functions as a code which

impulses to avoid church and good girls and instead visit with queer
folks who like excitements. Jeff Campbell laughs out loud in recognition
of her insight; he listens too when she tells him he doesn't yet know
how to love--not regular-living love but "real, strong, hot love" for
"you certainly are just too scared Dr. Campbell to really feel things way
down in you." He responds that "perhaps I could learn a whole lot about
women the right way, if I had a real good teacher" (<I>Three Lives</I>,
125). And so their romance begins.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the code returns to haunt him and their sexual relationship. As their
relationship progresses, Jeff worries her with his feelings that she is
a bad hard girl and a good kind girl in one and he has trouble trusting
her. Their first crisis develops when he learns of her past affair with
Jane Harden which he at first feels is "ugly" (<I>Three Lives</I>,
144). They talk their way through this crisis and their relationship
eventually reaches a point where "with her pure, strong ways of reaching,
Melanctha would give him all the love she knew" and "Jeff took it straight
now . . . and he felt, strong, the joy of all this being, and it swelled
out full inside him, he poured it all back to her in freedom, in tender
kindness, and in joy, and in gentle brother fondling" (<I>Three Lives</I>,
154). But, apparently at the moment they start to move beyond "brother
fondling," Jeff's desire recoils. The passage is worth quoting at length:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
. . . they were lying there and resting, with a green, bright,
light-flecked world all around them What was it that now really happened
to them? What was it that Melanctha did, that made everything get all
ugly for them? What was it that Melanctha felt then, that made Jeff
remember all the feeling he had had in him when Jane Harden told him
how    Melanctha had learned to be so very understanding? .  . . It was
all green and warm and lovely, and now Melanctha had made it all so ugly
for him. What was it Melanctha was now doing with him? What was it he
used to be thinking was the right way for him and all the colored people
to be always trying to make it right, the way they should always be

<B></B>

living? . . . All the old thinking came up very strong in him. He sort
of turned away then, and threw Melanctha from him. He never, even now,
was ever sure, he really knew what
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Melanctha was, when she was real herself, and honest. . . . Then he
really knew he could know nothing. He knew then, he never could know
what it was she really wanted with him. He knew then, he never could
know really what it was he felt inside him. (<I>Three Lives</I>, 155)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At these most unstable, uncertain moments in the relationship the words
"really" and "certainly" make an insistent, repetitive appearance,
revealing their function as a response to the stress of potential
deviation and heterosexual disorder: Jeff Campbell thinks "I certainly
did think now I really was knowing alright, what I wanted. I certainly
did really think now I was know to be trusting . . . I certainly did
think it was like that with me sure . . . And now I certainly do know
I don't know anything that's very real about her" (<I>Three Lives</I>,
157). If it's certain that Jeff didn't really know Melanctha until now,
it is just as uncertain that he really knows her now. In this kind of
prose, in other words, the stability of words like really and certainly
certainly dissolves.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moreover, as in <I>Making</I>, that principle of certainty at the heart
of sentimental culture is linked to anxiety about racial identity and
sexuality. Jeff is most concerned with Melanctha's "honesty," but it is
his own honesty that he is trying so hard to secure by his repetitive
invocation of "decent" Anglo-Saxon sexual codes. Especially in this
light, the "really"s of this passage should condition the way we read the
racist phrases that are also laced with real's and really's--such as the
description of Rose as "a real black negress" or Rose's description of
Melanctha's father as "certainly a black brute." Certainly this must
be true. And yet it is just as uncertain as all the certainly's in
Stein's stories. Stein leaves us uncertainly with the certain violence
of her racist clich&eacute;s, just as certainly as she leaves those
clich&eacute;s deformed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's method is to constrain her characters' lives within an insistent
reproductive narrative even while she uses its repetitions to expose its
violence to her characters' desires. Her narrators tyrannically mimic
the master narratives that racialize sexual codes and doom those who
deviate to social or actual death. There is catharsis in her method,
and there is clearly more going on than using black characters to
signify transgressive sexuality, but both readers and characters become
instruments and victims of her parodic narrative method. She spares
no one--and this attitude, while impelled by a will to resistance,
also mirrors the master's violence. The racist resonance in these
repeated phrases cannot be controlled in the text. They fire off in
all kinds of directions, out of any author's or reader's hands and yet
accruing power to the white author/reader (e.g., "Why did the subtle
intelligent, attractive, half white girl Melanctha, with her sweetness
and her power and her wisdom, demean herself to do for and to flatter
and to be scolded, by this lazy, stupid, ordinary, selfish black girl"
[<I>Three Lives</I>, 200]). There is a kind of pleasure in their power
to shock and wound--when the character is German the pleasure is in part
masochistic, but the meaning necessarily shifts when she as a "white"
person uses racist phrases about "black" characters. Thus it becomes
clear that, like other modernists, Stein both critiques and colludes
in the racial order of things; she too is seduced by its epic sweep,
its narrative possibilities, and especially perhaps its lacunae into
which she, like Philip Redfern, can load her secrets.

Barbara Johnson once said that if there were not "men" and "women"
there would probably be no written literature--implying that such is
the co-formation of "text" and "sexuality" via the shared principle
of difference.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 I am increasingly convinced the same can be said of "text" and
 "race," or at least in the English and American tradition, of the
 novel and race. This joining operates, I have argued, via the tropes
 of sentimentality, which also unfolds through dynamics of sameness and
 difference, universality and hierarchy. Pointing in this direction,
 Hegel claims in <I>The History of Philosophy</I> that what most
 distinguishes the Germanic races as superior, what most suits Germans
 to the "Idea of Freedom" and the <I>"principle</I> of Subjectivity"
 (introduced, he says, by Protestantism and extending to England), is
 their dialectical consciousness of "History" (Hegel's emphasis).
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Hegel's formulation is paradigmatic of the ways that our fashioning
 of subjectivity takes its principle of narrativity from race. A
 freedom-seeking, modern race is, paradoxically, a race with a history,
 with a dialectical story to tell<B>:</B> a race with a <I>novel
 tradition</I>. Further, the novel finesses its paradoxical, dialectical
 claim on the new and the old, tradition and novelty, by way of women,
 whose fictionalized sensitivity and potentially transgressive sexuality
 motor the very narratives that enclose them and in the process reproduce
 epics of race (a feminist paradox that Myra Jehlen noted long ago and
 which I am now linking to the paradox of race).
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Thus is modernity's attachment to race transgressively reproduced,
 by women and by novels.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernism apprehends this telos and troubles it in such texts as
Loy's "The Anglo-Mongrel and the Rose," Woolf's <I>The Waves</I>,
Toomer's <I>Cane</I>, Joyce's <I>Ulysses</I>, and in Faulkner's
oeuvre as a whole. Yet modernism desires the subjectivity that the
West's modern racial narratology has yielded. It seeks epic scope and
ancient depth. In <I>Three Lives,</I> Stein's flattening repetitions
tamper with these desires, but in the process repeat the violence of the
history they expose. Meanwhile modernism as a whole seeks repeatedly,
and perhaps admirably, for a history <I>outside of</I> race that will
sustain a history-transforming, dialectical subjectivity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And generations later, we are still seeking, yet race still narrates
us. We repeat again and again the story of racial boundaries transgressed
yet recuperated. In cross-racial buddy shows and movies from <I>The
Lone Ranger</I> and <I>The Mod Squad</I> to <I>Fried Green Tomatoes</I>
and <I>Nothing to Lose</I>, in twentieth-century novels from <I>To
Kill a Mockingbird</I> to <I>Midnight's Children</I> to <I>The Color
Purple</I>, our narratives at once racialize history and promise to
elude that racialization, pivoting around plots of sexual identity. They
equivocate with great success. Only when they do otherwise, when race
and modernity uncouple, shall we be so transformed that Stein reflects
nothing about ourselves. Only then will race be history--someone else's
history and not ours.

This confluence of race and sensibility is increasingly supported by
recent scholarship on the American novel, such as that of Kenneth Warren

ideals operated in nineteenth-century American sentimental literature
both to transcend and reinforce racial identities. See Kenneth Warren,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the evidence of the number of entries in the Biblioth&egrave;que
nationale catalogue, Georges Belmont must rank among the most prolific
writers of the post-war period: 156 to date (September 1998) in Opale,
the online catalogue, to which one must add 13 in the 1960-1969
<I>Catalogue des imprim&eacute;s</I> and ten more in the old pre-1960
card catalogue. This impressive output includes five novels, a collection
of poems, and above all a large number of translations from English.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Belmont's work as translator over more than four decades ranges from
 Henry James (<I>The Ambassadors</I>), Malcolm Lowry (<I>Hear us, O
 Lord, from Heaven, Thy Dwelling-Place</I>), Evelyn Waugh (<I>Brideshead
 Revisited</I>), and James Hardley Chase, to autobiographies of political
 and artistic res such as Golda Meier and Arthur Rubinstein. Four
 authors with whom Belmont's name is more closely associated are Graham
 Greene (four titles: <I>A Sort of Life, Travels with My Aunt, The
 Honorary Consul, The Human Factor</I>), Peter Townsend (five titles),
 Erica Jong (<I>Fear of Flying</I> and eight other titles), and Anthony
 Burgess (13 titles, including <I>A Clockwork Orange</I>). But there is
 one author who is inseparable from Belmont in his role as translator:
 Henry Miller. In addition to the 13 titles Belmont translated
 (including <I>Tropic of Capricorn</I>, <I>Sexus</I>, <I>Max and the
 White Phagocytes</I>, <I>The Smile at the Foot of</I> 

<B></B>

<I>the Ladder</I>), he has published prefaces to Miller translations
by others and a volume of interviews he conducted with Miller in 1970
for the French national radio and television, known as the "Entretiens
de Paris," and has contributed an introduction and thirty-eight dense
pages of personal notes to the French translation of Mary Dearborn's
1991 biography of Miller.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 These notes document a friendship which went back to the late 1930s
 and they represent, together with the <I>Entretiens</I>, a valuable
 biographical source for Miller scholarship. If, however, one had to
 select one single book linked with Belmont's name, it would have
 to be not a translation but <I>Monsieur Proust</I>, the memoir of
 C&eacute;leste Albaret, Proust's housekeeper for the last nine years
 of his life, recorded and prefaced by Belmont. This famous literary
 "scoop" (seventy hours of conversations over five months according
 to the introduction) caused a sensation at its publication in 1973
 and its prodigious success can be measured by the simple fact that,
 twenty-five years later, it remains in print.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The critical reception of the book was mostly enthusiastic but the
 praise was not altogether unqualified. In spite of the ghostwriter's
 protestations of absolute objectivity in his introduction, doubts were
 raised about certain aspects of C&eacute;leste's monologue, which veers
 from a self-effacing to a vehemently assertive tone, denouncing what she
 views as the "lies" (<I>mensonges</I> is used frequently) that have been
 spread about her master, suggesting for instance that if Proust had been
 homosexual she would have been aware of it, and, while she repeatedly
 denies having any literary competence, often sounds as if she were
 paraphasing or parodying well-known passages from the <I>Recherche</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Is Belmont's C&eacute;leste quite the same person as the one interviewed
 for French television by Roger St&eacute;phane?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All the above should make us legitimately curious to know who was, or is,
the prolific Belmont. The Biblioth&egrave;que nationale catalogue does
not show anything published in book form under his name before 1950. The
first occurrence of his work I have been able to locate is the French
translation of John Hersey's <I>Hiroshima</I> which came out in 1947;
there is evidence, however, that it was first published with no mention
of a translator.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 There is a biographical note in Belmont's first novel, <I>La vache
 et la tour Eiffel</I>, published in 1953, but one would be tempted
 to say that it withdraws as much information as it yields: apart from
 the author's age, forty-three, he is introduced as an alumnus of "one"
 Grande &Eacute;cole, has not travelled much, "except in France," has
 "subjected himself to a variety of jobs and (reluctantly) put up with
 [<I>support&eacute;</I>] several positions--neither the ones nor the
 others highly interesting, ultimately, in his view." Then, we are told,
 he became a translator and lived in the suburbs before moving back
 to Paris with his wife and daughter. The note (presumably penned by
 Belmont himself) continues with a statement both bland and cryptic,
 and defies interpretation: "He believes that life is what it is, that
 is to say what you make of it. But if you make nothing of it, it will
 make itself and it will be even less fun."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 The short biographical note on the back cover of Belmont's last novel,
 <I>Ex</I>, published in 1969, tells us a little more. It specifies that
 "he was a journalist before and after the war" and later "abandoned the
 press to become an editor." Indeed, in the 1950s and early 1960s, Belmont
 worked as editor of popular glossy magazines such as <I>Paris-Match</I>,
 <I>Jours de France</I>, and <I>Marie-Claire</I> (for which he interviewed
 Marilyn Monroe in April 1960), and as an occasional

 In the late 1960s and 1970s, his name appears as director of collections
 for Robert Laffont, the publisher of two of his novels. If one turns
 to the bibliographies of two other novels, <I>Chris</I> and <I>Un homme
 au cr&eacute;puscule</I>, published by Julliard in 1965 and 1966, they
 list work in preparation which does not appear to have been published
 as well as a previously published poem, play, and essay--works which
 a curious reader would be at a loss to locate in any library catalogue
 under the name Belmont.

In the post-war era, Maria Jolas reportedly said that Georges Belmont did
not exist. She mentioned him infrequently and with evident distaste. It
was a painful subject, recalling a betrayal she no doubt viewed in both
personal and civic terms. Nonetheless in February 1982 she did so with
her usual firmness. When she saw under Belmont's signature an article
in <I>Le Monde</I> in connection with the James Joyce centenary, she
wrote to its editor Jacques Fauvet (she was then 89):

I must inform you that Joyce, who died in January 1941, knew no Georges
Belmont. This surname was adopted at the Liberation, perhaps to cast
oblivion on collaborationist activities, by Georges Pelorson; the French
had the recent opportunity to see this character on their television
screen, shouting slogans in favor of the "R&eacute;volution nationale"
. . . This ceremony . . . was part of the film <I>The Sorrow and the
Pity</I>. . . . I am offering these clarifications, Monsieur, because it

Georges Belmont."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I will now try in my turn to fill the lacunae by retelling the story of
the man I will henceforth call by his real name.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Georges Pelorson was born on July 19, 1909 in Belley, capital of the small
province of Bugey on the southeastern edge of Burgundy. After taking his
Baccalaur&eacute;at, he was enrolled in 1926 or 1927 at the Kh&acirc;gne
of the Lyc&eacute;e Louis-le-Grand which res so prominently
in Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Sirinelli's <I>G&eacute;n&eacute;ration
intellectuelle</I>. Indeed, even if he does not receive much attention
from Sirinelli, Pelorson is a perfect representative of that "generation
of 1905" which, too young to have fought in the First World War, found
itself so diversely involved during the second, especially under the
Nazi Occupation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 His contemporaries at Louis-le-Grand included Robert Brasillach, Maurice
 Bard&egrave;che, and Roger Vailland and his teachers the pro-Action
 fran&ccedil;aise French literature professor Andr&eacute; Bellessort,
 who was Louis-le-Grand's answer to the radical-socialiste Alain in the
 other leading Kh&acirc;gne at the lyc&eacute;e Henri IV.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 In 1928, Pelorson entered the &Eacute;cole normale
 sup&eacute;rieure. Among the 29 members of his class (besides the
 aforementioned Bard&egrave;che and Brasillach) were Jean Beaufret, the
 future philosophy teacher and Heidegger disciple who was also from the
 Kh&acirc;gne at Louis-le-Grand, as was Jacques Talagrand, a.k.a. Thierry
 Maulnier, future contributor to <I>L'Action fran&ccedil;aise</I> and
 <I>Je suis partout</I>. Last but not least, the 1928 class included a
 woman, Simone Weil. At rue d'Ulm, Pelorson's room was next to the one
 shared by Bard&egrave;che and Brasillach but he does not seem to have
 been particularly close to either.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Politically, he would appear to have leaned towards the left, if one
 can thus interpret his

<B></B>

presence among the 83 signers of the petition against the special
military preparation Normaliens were subjected to: it was published
in <I>Le populaire</I> of 26 November 1928 and provoked the ire of the
nationalist press.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If not much is known about Pelorson's political views during his
Kh&acirc;gne and &Eacute;cole normale years, much, on the other hand,
is known about his relations with the new English lecteur at the ENS,
fresh from Trinity College Dublin. His name was Samuel Beckett and he
was to become one of Pelorson's closest friends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 As the only English major in his class, the instruction Pelorson
 received from Beckett seems to have consisted mostly in two-voice
 readings of <I>The Tempest</I> and long conversations in the bars
 of Montparnasse. "The real lectures were in Montparnasse," reminisced
 Pelorson sixty years later, "the lectures of life. There were two things
 that changed my life, Montparnasse and then Ireland afterwards."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson went to Ireland in the fall of 1929 as the French lecteur
at Trinity College, Dublin, a position he held until the summer of
1931. Beckett himself returned to Ireland in 1930 and it was then
that he and Pelorson became particularly close. A well-known episode,
which took place in February 1931, was their staging of <I>Le Kid</I>,
a parody of Corneille's <I>Le Cid</I>, as the annual presentation of
the French group of the Modern Languages Society. Beckett played Don
Di&egrave;gue and Pelorson the Count. The event provoked the expected
scandal and has gone down in history as the first direct involvement of
Beckett with the theater and his first and only stage appearance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Pelorson is also linked with Beckett's debut as a novelist, since,
 according to James Knowlson, the episodic character named Liebert in
 <I>Dream of Fair to Middling Women</I>, his first novel (which remained
 unpublished until 1993), is at least in part based on Pelorson.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Pelorson also claims to have introduced Beckett to that remarkably
 pre-Beckettian text that is the diary of Jules Renard.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 During his second year in Ireland, Pelorson met a young woman named
 Marcelle Graham, whom he married shortly afterwards. On his return
 to France, he decided to abandon the traditional academic career
 usually expected of a Normalien to become a writer instead. He left the
 &Eacute;cole normale with only a licence (B.A.) in English instead of
 the <I>agr&eacute;gation</I> which would have made him a member of the
 French national school system. He and his wife together produced a French
 translation of Emily Bront&euml;'s poems, which was published in 1933.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Beckett's work had begun to appear in <I>transition</I> in June 1929, when
his first published story, "Assumption," as well as his essay on Joyce's
"Work in Progress," had appeared in <I>transition</I> 16/17. Thanks to
his connection with Beckett, Pelorson soon got to know Eugene and Maria
Jolas and it was in <I>transition</I> that he too made his literary
debut: his work, mostly in its original French, appeared in every issue
but one of the "new <I>transition</I>" from 1932 to 1938. Two poems,
"Isoc&egrave;le" and "Plans," re in the "Poetry is Vertical" section
of <I>transition</I> 21 (March 1932). Pelorson's name appears several
times in <I>transition</I> 22 (February 1933), with a letter-poem
"A Eugene Jolas" (dated October 1932), followed by three poems, a
multilingual short story, "Hysteriette of La Cosmosa," signed jointly by
Jolas and Pelorson. A Vertigralist fantasy, "Le moment de Parsifal" is
to be found in the "Paramyths" section of <I>transition</I> 23 (July 1935)

<B></B>

and the same issues contains two poems in the "Hypnologues" section,
a reply to the "Mutation in Language" questionnaire, and three short
poems in the section "Experiences in Language Mutation." There are
a lengthy poetic fragment ("Le nombre") in the "Vertigral" section
and a prose text ("Le Roi dans la Vall&eacute;e") in the "Paramyths"
section of <I>transition</I> 24 (June 1936). Finally, the prose poem
"Le vrai visage" appeared in two parts in the journal, part I in the
"Workshop" section of <I>transition</I> 26 (Winter 1937), part II in
<I>transition</I> 27 (April-May 1938), which also contains his
prose poem "Perp&eacute;tuel Mobile."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson's contributions to <I>transition</I> fall into two
distinct groups. One group is the work of a dutiful--if not highly
original--disciple of Eugene Jolas and the Revolution of the Word and
"Verticalist" or "Vertigralist" tenets. It is therefore not a surprise to
find Pelorson's name among the eight signers of the "Poetry is Vertical"
manifesto in <I>transition</I> 21.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Particularly characteristic of his production is "A Eugene Jolas,"
 a prose poem in celebration of American Spirituals: ostensibly in
 reaction to "Black Rhythms" in <I>transition</I> 21, it can be seen as
 an homage to Eugene Jolas the author of the anthology <I>Le n&egrave;gre
 qui chante</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 It combines neologisms (<I>all&eacute;goreuse</I>), spelling fantasies
 ("jeste" for geste), unorthodox punctuation, an emphatically stated
 preoccupation with the status of language and the possibilities of
 multilingualism, references to Joyce as well as to Benjamin P&eacute;ret,
 and a tone bordering on that of a manifesto: "Then instead of striving
 for the creation of new ideas with new words/We can create new words
 and ideas will follow if we truly cannot do without them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 The three poems that follow present the same characteristics; they are
 in fact not called poems but "ontogrammes," Pelorson's coinage, which
 res in <I>transition</I>'s "Revolution-of-the-Word Dictionary"
 in the same issue with the definition "neo-mythical composition with
 a-logical words."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Three short poems in <I>transition</I> 23 are called "rythm&egrave;ses"
 and can be described as nursery rhymes based purely on neologisms and
 nonsense words.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 "Perp&eacute;tuel Mobile," Pelorson's last contribution to
 <I>transition</I>, is very much along the same lines. All the
 aforementioned texts suggest--as seems to have been the case--a
 master-disciple relationship between Pelorson and Jolas. The short
 story they wrote in collaboration, "Hysteriette of La Cosmosa"
 (<I>transition</I> 22) is a Rabelaisian romp with passages in English
 and in French, often combined in the same sentence, peppered with
 Wakean coinages. It makes no greater impression than a curious and
 amusing experiment but its very effervescence is indicative of a happy
 congeniality between its two authors.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The other group of Pelorson's contributions to <I>transition</I>
belongs to a strikingly different vein. "Connaissance" and "Semence"
in <I>transition</I> 23 are called "ontogrammes" but it is difficult
to see what is "ontogrammatic" about them. Neologisms are absent. The
form, free verse in appearance, is in fact a series of hexasyllabic
lines which to the ear sound no different from conventional, if unrhymed
alexandrines ("L'homme alors s'avan&ccedil;a/dans la force de l'ombre/Et
l'on n'entendit plus/que le dur de la mer").
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 The poems deal with broad entities ("les Dieux," "la terre," "l'homme,"
 "la femme") in a mode of incantation and with a use of repetition
 strangely reminiscent of the poetry of Charles P&eacute;guy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 The first poem, "Connaissance," much revised, forms part of a much
 longer poem Pelorson published under that same title in 1937.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  "Le nombre--Prologue--

<B></B>

fragment" (<I>transition</I> 24) presents exactly the same
characteristics. "Le Roi dans la Vall&eacute;e" (<I>transition</I> 24),
a tale in the surrealist mode with a strong oneiric flavor, and "Le vrai
visage" (published in two parts in <I>transition</I> 26 and 27), also
in prose, retain some modernist traits: the latter, however, deals like
<I>Connaissance</I> with broad, abstract entities and displays the same
grandiloquence of tone and a similar reliance on effects of repetition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson's response to the "Inquiry on the Malady of Language"
in <I>transition</I> 23 appeared in English and was one of the two
longest. It unsurprisingly endorses Jolas's "vertical" and "vertigral"
aspirations. But it is also an intemperate anti-intellectual outburst
which has (with hindsight) a quasi-fascist ring to it: "Intelligence
be damned! . . . To the deuce with the fruits ripened in the brain! To
the deuce even with the brain! We shall create with the incantation of
our bodies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Transition</I> was the main, but not the only literary anchor of
Pelorson in the mid-1930s. His name crops up at least three times in
the <I>Nouvelle revue fran&ccedil;aise</I> between 1932 and 1935.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Another, longer fragment of the poem Connaissance, "Le soir," was
 published in Jean Paulhan's handsome review <I>Mesures</I> in 1935 and
 we know that in July 1936 Pelorson participated in a reading organized
 around <I>Mesures</I> at Adrienne Monnier's Maison des Amis des livres.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Was Pelorson the epic poet Paulhan eagerly wished for, as one of his
 editors has suggested?
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 In any event "Le soir" was Pelorson's only contribution to
 <I>Mesures</I>. According to Pelorson's own testimony recorded by
 Richard Ellmann, Paulhan asked him to undertake a translation of
 Joyce's <I>Pomes Penyeach</I> for <I>Mesures</I> and Pelorson worked
 on the project during the spring of 1937 in consultation with Joyce,
 who tried to convince him "to retain the identical rhythms in French
 as in English" (a common failing among poets who get involved in the
 translation of their own work). Ellmann does not indicate whether the
 undertaking was abandoned at Pelorson's or Joyce's initiative.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The question of Pelorson's relations with Joyce has been described in
diverse ways. Pelorson himself, both in his testimonies to Ellmann and
in the <I>Le Monde</I> article mentioned above, suggests that he and
Joyce enjoyed a sort of literary or at least intellectual friendship,
including discussions of Pelorson's own work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Maria Jolas, in her rebuttal of the <I>Le Monde</I> article, takes
 a firm exception to that view. "Around 1932, Joyce asked my husband,
 Eugene Jolas, to recommend to him a man who could help him in his work;
 Pelorson, who knew Ireland well, was approached because he was bilingual
 and competent in literary matters. He thus enjoyed the privilege of
 having professional relations with Joyce at that time. Joyce, to be
 sure, was affable and friendly towards the young man, but he kept
 his distance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 It must also be noted that Paul L&eacute;on, in a March 1933 letter to
 Harriet Shaw Weaver, lists Pelorson among the people who "constantly
 pester" Joyce, "asking for his help and aid which having not the strength
 to refuse he is trying to do in the best possible manner and which is
 not at all warranted either by his occupation or by his present state
 of health and nerves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 On the other hand, it was Pelorson who published in the <I>Revue de
 Paris</I> dated 1 September 1939 (the very day Hitler's troops invaded
 Poland) one of the first reviews--the first in French--of <I>Finnegans
 Wake</I>. According to his 1982 article in <I>Le Monde</I>, it was Joyce

<B></B>

who commissioned him to write the review and guided him through its
writing. Joyce was sufficiently pleased with it to recommend it to both
Valery Larbaud and Frank Bugden two weeks later.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson's activities in the 1930s were by no means limited to his
literary career. At least until the war he was a freelance reporter for
the daily <I>Paris-Midi</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 And in 1936, Maria Jolas recruited him as headmaster ("directeur des
 &eacute;tudes") of the &Eacute;cole bilingue de Neuilly which she
 had opened in 1932 and which grew from the original handful of pupils
 (which included her two daughters) to 150 in 1939. In addition to these
 administrative responsibilities, Pelorson taught literature courses
 at the school, where his wife Marcelle was a teacher as well. There is
 every indication from the surviving correspondence from that period that
 Maria Jolas had the greatest professional and personal confidence in
 both Pelorsons and the tone of the letters is, on both sides, that of
 mutual esteem and indeed affection--feelings that make her subsequent
 unforgiving resentment even more understandable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the end of 1937, as <I>transition</I> was about to stop
publication, Pelorson was ready to launch his own journal, the monthly
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I>. According to Maurice Girodias, whom he met at that
time and whose memoirs contain a perspicacious and generally sympathetic
portrait of Pelorson, <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> was financed by Pelorson's
journalistic work for <I>Paris-Midi</I>. Pelorson's own version is that
it was supported by a pool to which he and his co-founders had agreed
to contribute in equal parts, but that he found himself increasingly
responsible for its maintenance, all the others but two (Miller being
one of them) having stopped contributing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I> published 20 issues between December 1937 and
August 1939 and an additional one in the spring of 1940. Its official
editorial board, as it appears on the cover of the first issue,
comprised, besides Pelorson himself, Pierre Gu&eacute;guen, Eugene
Jolas, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Joliot, Henry Miller, Raymond Queneau, and
Camille Schuwer. Jolas's own presence is hardly a surprise: Jolas was,
as we have seen, Pelorson's literary godfather and it is only natural
that the disciple would have recruited his master. Gu&eacute;guen,
described by Girodias as a "little, round-bellied poet of gardens," was
one of the poets praised by Pelorson in his review of <I>L'ann&eacute;e
po&eacute;tique</I> for 1935; one poem by him had appeared in
<I>transition</I> 25.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The name of Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Joliot, known as Joliot-Curie
 following his marriage to Eve, daughter of Pierre and Marie
 Curie, is an unexpected re to encounter in the context of
 <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>. Pierre and Marie Curie had shared the 1935
 Nobel Prize for chemistry and their son-in-law may have simply lent his
 prestigious name out of friendship for Pelorson, since he does not appear
 to have made any substantive contribution to the review. A socialist and
 member of the Comit&eacute; de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes,
 he was then close to the Communist Party, which he officially joined only
 in 1942. As of No. 12 (December 1938), his name is no longer featured
 on the cover. Pelorson met Miller through Queneau in 1937 and they were
 to remain lifelong friends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Queneau himself had met Pelorson in 1935 through Paulhan and they became
 close friends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 In July 1939, he was recruited by Maria Jolas, presumably on Pelorson's
 recommendation, to teach at the &Eacute;cole bilingue de Neuilly: his
 mobilization in September 1939 prevented him from taking up the position.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

<B></B>

Schuwer taught philosophy and had been, like Pelorson, a regular
contributor to the "New <I>transition</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 A new name was added to the list as of the second issue, that of
 the modernist &eacute;migr&eacute; Hungarian sculptor Joseph Csaky
 (1888-1971), who became <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>'s chief art critic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson's later testimony on his intentions as founder of
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I> are not altogether consistent. On the one hand,
he claims that when he first approached Miller, what won the latter over
"was that there was no question of either a movement or group gathered on
a 'programme,' that there would be no common 'line' other than through the
natural conjunctions of opinions and ideas, each participant remaining
entirely free to express what he meant, no matter whether the review
offered in its pages the paradox of contradictions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
  On the other hand, he himself implies, in a rather self-serving
  statement that therefore needs to be somewhat qualified, that there was
  something of a political program behind the founding of the journal:
  "The journal <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> was born in my mind in order to
  awaken the energies to denounce and t the passivity of public
  opinion and the incompetence of rulers, on the side of democracies
  facing the hegemonic onslaught of a fanaticized Germany."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The contradictions and paradoxes announced above are indeed plentiful
in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>. To be sure, there is much in the journal
that can be described as non-political. This applies to Jolas's own
contributions: poems mostly, one Vertigralist essay ("Vertigral ou la
volont&eacute; cosmique") in No. 5, and one translation (a fragment of
"The Roan Stallion" by Robinson Jeffers, in No. 2). Jolas was, in fact,
one of the most frequent contributors to <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>, present
in every issue but one. Later, he evidently wished to distance himself
from it, since he mentions the journal only once in his autobiography
in connection with Miller, without referring to his own involvement.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 As for Miller, his work appeared 18 times in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>,
 usually in translations by Pelorson (except for an extract from <I>Tropic
 of Cancer</I> in the French version by Henri Fluch&egrave;re). Queneau
 res in 17 of the 20 issues of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> (as well as in
 the April 1940 number) and was its chief cultural critic, contributing
 articles on aesthetics, poetry, humor, Proust, and Joyce. Those include
 some of his wittiest and most esteemed early work as an essayist and he
 later collected nearly all of them in <I>Le Voyage en Gr&egrave;ce</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 He also published poems in No. 5 ("Paysan qui va-t-en ville") and No. 20
 (an extract from "Gueule de Pierre"). Besides Gu&eacute;guen and Schuwer,
 the poetry published in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> featured work by Jacques
 Audiberti, Armand Robin (poems later reprinted in <I>Ma vie sans
 moi</I>), and L&eacute;opold Sedar Senghor ("In Memoriam" in No. 17,
 "H&eacute;ritage" and "Aux tirailleurs s&eacute;n&eacute;galais morts
 pour la France" in No. 20).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson himself published little poetry in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>. One
poem, "Titan," in No. 15 (March 1939), was written very much in the mode
of <I>Connaissance</I>. <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 4 and 7 contained parts
III and IV of "Le vrai visage," the "prose po&eacute;tique" written
in the prophetic mode (the first two parts of which had appeared in
<I>transition</I>). His literary interests seem to have shifted towards
the theater, both as a playwright and as a critic. The first issue of
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I> contains a fragment ("Prologue") of a tragedy,
"Caligula"; two more fragments appeared in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 3
(from Act III) and 8 (Act IV, death of Caligula).
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Nos. 17 and 19 included two fragments from another Roman play, "Jules

<B></B>

C&eacute;sar."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 The fifth issue opens with an essay on "Le Th&eacute;&acirc;tre et les
 Moeurs," which denounces the decadence of the stage--from which only
 Giraudoux and Artaud (not the worst choices) are excepted. Four issues
 later, Pelorson published a "Lettre &agrave; M. Jean Dast&eacute; sur la
 trag&eacute;die," in which he gives his own conception: "The theatrical
 action seems to me to be the truest, most complete form of eloquence"
 (not a very avant-gardist statement).
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 As of No. 14 (February 1939), Pelorson kept a "chronique dramatique"
 of which three more installments appeared between March and August 1939.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Art criticism, we have seen, was mostly the province of Csaky, who
contributed a series of thought-provoking, at times frankly polemical
articles. The second, "Abstraction et Humanit&eacute; ou le Sens de la
Gr&egrave;ce Antique," published in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> No. 3, prompted
a response from L&eacute;once Rosenberg, the noted art dealer, who had
represented Csaky in the early 1920s. From No. 8 on, Rosenberg became
a second art critic for <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> and his contributions
included aphorisms on art, "Parlons Peinture," in Nos. 8, 9, 11, and 14
and a series on Italian art, "L'Italie sans Baedeker," in Nos. 15, 17,
and 19. Along with Queneau's articles, these contributions are some of the
more refreshing to read in this often relentlessly strident publication.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Why does a perusal of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> inevitably produce a
more than occasional feeling of malaise? It is due to part to some
individual contributions--and contributors--such as Lucien Combelle's
"Discours sur un Tombeau" in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 17 (May 1939),
a virulent attack on the Third Republic in which he advocates a "moral
revolution" in a particularly premonitory language: "When we face those
monsters, let us then be monstrous. . . . Threats if necessary. A black
list even. . . . <I>Physical</I> forces are at play. To resist them
victoriously, the fist must be ready to support the mind. Let us find
wits with firm fists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Combelle, who was only 27 in 1939, had been Andr&eacute; Gide's secretary
 and was then, among other things, managing editor of the magazine <I>Arts
 et Id&eacute;es</I> (published by Jos&eacute; Corti). During the war,
 Combelle became involved with, then responsible for the collaborationist
 weekly <I>R&eacute;volution Nationale</I>, to which Pelorson contributed
 as theater critic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 At the Liberation, he was sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor but
 was freed in 1951.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another cause for malaise is the recurrence throughout the issues of
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I> of a number of themes and vocabulary which,
admittedly, were found in many publications of various political
tendencies at the time, but are no less troubling for that. A good
example, taken from the opening number, is the first of Le Corbusier's two
contributions to the journal, in which he urges reforms in urban planning
policies in the context of "creating a solid, beautiful, healthy race."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Simply entitled "Volont&eacute;," and signed "Acte de volont&eacute;"
 like a proclamation at the end, the piece reads as if it had
 been ghostwritten by Pelorson: "Will to get out of it! Will of
 happiness. Definite happiness. Will of greatness. Greatness is to put
 one's heart before one and to respond to its simple, timeless demands."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 Along the same lines, an article by Pelorson entitled "Recherche d'un
 statut &eacute;conomique de la jeunesse" in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>
 3 advocates "policies of racial 'maintenance' (sports and leisure)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other passages, also much in the spirit of the times, sound themes soon to
be taken up in some of Marshal P&eacute;tain's best-known speeches. Under
the signature of Dr Henri

<B></B>

Arthus, in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 13: "The soil, our land, therein lies
the truth, therein lies what represents, among us, the center, the soul
of the nation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 In the next issue, Pelorson himself takes up the theme: "But the soil
 is stubborn. The soil has ideas of its own, which 'ideology' cannot
 comprehend. The soil has ideas on man, which man cannot control." This
 textbook example of the confusion denounced by Pascal when he warned
 against speaking of spiritual things in corporeal terms is followed
 by a not completely reassuring disclaimer: "And I see that I have to
 pause once again. For 'they' will misinterpret: 'they' will interpret
 this as racism, as 'they' put it these days."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Further on, Pelorson praises nationalism as the expression of the soil
 and finds reasons to exculpate Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin: "I also
 note that their mistake is in line with destinies, that they were able
 to correct their 'ideology' and that . . .they certainly <I>reawakened
 an idea</I>, gave rebirth to a soil, brought the minds back to their
 measure of soil. . ." Pelorson goes on to express qualified, but clear
 support for the Munich accords.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 The language is not much different in Pelorson's response to the enquiry
 on directors of conscience, the results of which occupy the entirety
 of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 18 (June 1939):

The person, in truth, matters so little, whereas the idea, sister of the

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Launched in its February 1939 issue, <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>'s
investigation on the nature and the role of "directors of conscience"
in the West was commissioned from the young sociologist Jules Monnerot
and it raises the question of the links between <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>
and the Coll&egrave;ge de Sociologie, since Monnerot was a participant in
its activities, as were a number of personalities who received Monnerot's
questionnaire and responded to it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 In its November 1938 issue, <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> had published the
 "D&eacute;claration du Coll&egrave;ge de Sociologie sur la crise
 internationale" which first appeared in the <I>Nouvelle revue
 fran&ccedil;aise</I> for November 1, with a note endorsing the
 declaration which may be interpreted as an indication that Pelorson
 had not yet come around to a pro-Munich attitude).
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 In their variety, the responses to Monnerot's questionnaire are the best
 illustration of the contradictions and ambiguities that characterize
 <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>--or indeed characterize that particular moment
 of French intellectual history. They range from Georges Duthuit's
 denunciation of "the sordid mysticism of race and the State" to
 Combelle's transparent apology for dictatorships and Pierre Libra's
 overt racism; from Eugene Jolas's hopes in "the new being," with "a
 new language, the inter-continental inter-language" to the astrological
 rantings of the charlatan Conrad Moricand, Henry Miller's friend.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 The most lucid is probably that of Jean Wahl, who begins by questioning
 the questionnaire ("What an odd questionnaire. How badly framed the
 question is")

<B></B>

and goes on to sum up in the clearest terms the crucial problem of
the hour: "Today the question is to know whether the collapse of the
national-socialist regimes will take place soon enough for democracies
not to be completely destroyed beforehand."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The presence of such statements in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>--and there are,
fortunately, more--corrects to some extent the impression of malaise
made by other statements like the ones quoted above.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 So does the publication, in the August 1939 issue, of Aim&eacute;
 C&eacute;saire's "Cahier d'un retour au pays natal"  and of poems by
 Pablo Neruda, Cesar Vallejo, and Octavio Paz.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 Above all, the review appears to mirror the ambiguities and ambitions of
 its creator, leader, and chief contributor. Though Pelorson is actually
 absent from No. 13, every issue of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> bears his
 mark. We have already noted in his poetry his penchant for blank verse
 combined with P&eacute;guy-like repetition. In <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>,
 these tendencies, especially the latter, are inflated to the point
 of caricature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 The word "volont&eacute;" is constantly hammered in like a mantra, either
 alone or in phrases like "volont&eacute; de grandeur" or "volont&eacute;
 de vivre" (a section heading in each issue), often printed in capitals
 for greater effect.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 "Actif France," the title of the two-part article quoted above, is
 particularly representative of Pelorson's growing tendency to think--or
 at least write--in slogans, a tendency that was to bear poisonous fruits
 in 1941-1943.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is indeed much in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> that could be interpreted
as evidence that Pelorson was harboring political ambitions. We have
quoted his article "Recherche d'un statut &eacute;conomique de la
jeunesse" in <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 3. The very first issue contains
a "Plan Directeur d'une r&eacute;forme de l'enseignement en France,"
identified in a footnote as an "excerpt from a book, <I>&Eacute;ducation
et enseignement</I>, to be published by &Eacute;ditions Deno&euml;l
next January." The publication of the book continued to be announced in
subsequent issues but the book came out, as we will see, only in late
1940, under a different title, and under a different imprint.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I> did not survive the Declaration of War, which
led to the mobilization of most of its editors. An attempt was made to
resurrect it in the spring of 1940, with Pierre Pr&eacute;vost as its
chief editor and as its new publisher the very young Maurice J. Kahane,
soon to become Girodias, whose father, Jack Kahane, founder of the
Obelisk Press, had just died. <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> 21 came out in
April 1940 and was distributed free. The cover page had a new design
and bore the address, though not the name, of the &Eacute;ditions
du Ch&ecirc;ne (16, place Vend&ocirc;me), which Girodias had just
created. It consists simply of four articles and a "letters from the
front" section. The contribution by Pelorson, "La guerre et la paix,"
and that by Pr&eacute;vost, "La guerre sans bataille," are relatively
sober assessments of the situation, whereas the piece by Combelle that
follows, by contrast, opens with a candid defense of eugenics as practiced
in Germany. The fourth article is a review by Queneau of M.B. Fondane's
<I>Faux trait&eacute; d'esth&eacute;tique</I>. <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>
22 was printed but the Nazi offensive on May 10 and the ensuing debacle
prevented its publication.
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson's editorship of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> brought him wide
recognition in pre-war intellectual circles. In the fall of 1939 and
the early months of 1940, he participated in the meetings that took
place in the apartment by Marcel Mor&eacute; to resume the activities
of the Coll&egrave;ge de Sociologie. Besides Mor&eacute; and Pelorson,
the meetings gathered, among

<B></B>

others, Georges Bataille, Julien Benda, Pierre Klossowski, Alexandre
Koyr&eacute;, Paul-Louis Landsberg, Ren&eacute; Leibovitz, Queneau, Wahl,
and, it seems, Gide. By May 1940, the group had disbanded, apparently
after bitter altercations ensued, and in which Pelorson was directly
involved.
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 According to both Paulhan's and Queneau's testimonies, Pelorson was
 also cultivating ties at the time ("a reprehensible flirt in my view,"
 in Paulhan's words) with Jean Coutrot, a Polytechnicien and the founder
 of AFNOR (Association fran&ccedil;aise de normalisation). Coutrot
 was the leader of Travail et Nation, a group which had ties with the
 fascist-leaning Parti populaire fran&ccedil;ais (P.P.F.) of Jacques
 Doriot. Members of this group included Henry de Jouvenel and Pierre
 Pucheu.
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 Pucheu's and Pelorson's paths were to cross again in Vichy three
 years later.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the meantime, Maria Jolas had moved her school to
Saint-G&eacute;rand-le-Puy, the tiny village near Vichy where she was
joined by the Joyce family. Pelorson remained officially the headmaster
and his wife a teacher: he was able to visit twice a month, at least in
the fall of 1939.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 In her 1950 article "Joyce en 1939-1940," published in the
 <I>Mercure de France</I>, she prompted Pelorson's last visit to
 Saint-G&eacute;rand in February 1940 and threw a dinner party with James
 and Nora Joyce, the Pelorsons and herself, but concluding tersely: "As we
 wished him 'godspeed,' far were we from suspecting the collaborationist
 career that awaited him following the armistice."
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marcelle Pelorson was Irish, and Maria Jolas's War Diary records her
virulent anti-English feelings as the hostilities erupted.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 As for Pelorson himself, he continued to be in touch with Maria
 Jolas. There is certainly nothing pro-Hitler in the feelings he conveyed
 to her from "somewhere in the Yonne [d&eacute;partement]" on May 29,
 1940: "Here we wept with rage before the radio yesterday. But we have
 never been so certain that Hitler will be swept away, or better: that
 Europe and the world will be swept clean of him."
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 At the armistice, Pelorson was briefly a prisoner of war but was, it
 seems, freed on parole, and was able to walk all the way back to Paris.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 Girodias mentions a meeting which then took place to discuss a
 possible resurrection of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>. These plans failed,
 however, owing to irreconcilable differences between the extreme right
 (Combelle) and the extreme left (Andr&eacute; Viollis, who was close
 to the Communist Party).
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 In the fall of 1940, as Maria Jolas and her daughters were leaving
 France for the United States, Pelorson and his wife reopened the school
 in Neuilly (reverting, according to a prospectus preserved in the
 Jolas Papers, to the school's original name, "&Eacute;cole nouvelle de
 Neuilly"). They had sixteen pupils and the teachers included Queneau
 and Paul Guth, the future popular writer, who had contributed to
 <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>
 However, by the end of the year, faced with high utility bills and unable
 to pay them (in that very cold winter of 1940), the school closed its
 doors for good.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By then, Pelorson's book <I>De l'enfant &agrave; la nation</I> had
appeared, one of the first if not the first book published by Girodias
under his new imprint, the &Eacute;ditions du Ch&ecirc;ne.
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>
 The first sentence of the introduction reminds the reader that the book
 was ready two years previously, which is another way of stating--and the
 author does state it--that its contents are unrelated to the context
 created by the defeat and subsequent Occupation. Indeed, it can be
 described as technical rather than a political work, going into such
 details as teachers' salaries and pupils' daily schedules. The two
 references to

<B></B>

educational practices in Third Reich Germany can be considered fairly
innocuous, even supposing that they were added as a topical afterthought:
there are others to England, the United States, and the Montessori
methods.
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 More significantly, in view of the functions the writer was soon to
 occupy, are the references to propaganda and even slogans as tools for
 a reform of education.
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
 Even more interesting and revealing are the introduction and the book's
 "packaging." The introduction refers to the child as the prime goal of a
 "r&eacute;volution nationale" (without capitals), and goes on to claim
 that the book "was rejected by a publisher not long ago on the grounds
 that it did not conform to the fantasies which the Abraham-Zay had made
 into law." The sentence targets the reforms introduced by the Popular
 Front under its minister of Education, Jean Zay, and generally known
 under his name (Abraham was his chief of staff). Pelorson's appellation
 ("la r&eacute;forme Abraham-Zay"), in the fall of 1940, was anything
 but innocent at a time when Zay had been imprisoned and had become the
 object of anti-Semitic attacks in the collaborationist press which did
 not cease until his assassination by the Milice in 1944.
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 There is a laudatory reference to Vichy's pro-family policies,
 immediately followed by a derogatory reference to the previous regime
 as serving the interests of "certain people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>
 As for the book's advertising matter, it is interesting in two
 respects. First, the biography on the flap of the front cover, which,
 after mentioning Pelorson's role as director of the "&Eacute;cole
 Nouvelle Bilingue de Neuilly," refers to his growing "interest in the
 political and moral problems caused by the disorder of our country"
 and goes on: "But Georges Pelorson, a born animator, could not be
 content with an activity limited to the intellectual 'elites'. He is
 aware that a racial and moral renaissance is called for. . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>
 The anonymous author of the biographical note, in all probability
 Pelorson himself, writes in conclusion that the book should be
 considered not as a technical study intended for pedagogues, but
 rather the work of a "moral and political reformer" and it quotes the
 "r&eacute;volution nationale" passage from the introduction. On the
 other flap, two more publications by Pelorson on related issues are
 announced, "Le testament de notre temps" and "La r&eacute;volution de la
 jeunesse," neither of which was published. Under the heading "Collection
 'Volont&eacute;s,'" forthcoming publications, presumably under the
 &Eacute;ditions du Ch&ecirc;ne imprint are announced: the authors listed
 include Jacques Copeau on the theater, Georges Bataille (<I>La mort et
 le sacrifice. Premier essai de sociologie sacr&eacute;e</I>), Pierre
 Pr&eacute;vost (<I>Le gouvernement des hommes</I>), Lucien Combelle
 (<I>Responsabilit&eacute; des &eacute;crivains</I>) and Jean Jardin
 (<I>Les transports</I>). Even though the "Collection 'Volont&eacute;s'"
 never materialized, this is an interesting assemblage which gathers
 briefly under the dual patronage of a half-Jewish publisher (Girodias)
 and soon-to-be Vichy official (Pelorson) two of the future founders of
 <I>Critique</I> (Bataille and Pr&eacute;vost), a P&eacute;tain-appointed
 theater administrator (Copeau), an ultra collaborationist (Combelle),
 and Pierre Laval's chief of staff (Jardin).
<SUP><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As we have seen, the paths of Bataille and Pelorson had crossed
previously in the context of attempts to revive the Coll&egrave;ge de
Sociologie. There is no evidence that they crossed again after the
abortive project of a "Collection  'Volont&eacute;s.'" Their names,
however, are linked in a most intriguing way in the context of one of
the many movements that sprouted in the first year of the Vichy period,
called "Jeune France." First

<B></B>

established in the free zone at the end of November 1940, then in the
occupied zone in January 1941, "Jeune France" was created with the purpose
of promoting the artistic and cultural education of young people and,
because of its educational aims, received the patronage of and financial
backing from Vichy's Secr&eacute;tariat g&eacute;n&eacute;ral &agrave;
la jeunesse. Its founder was a young Polytechnicien, Pierre Schaeffer,
later one of the heads of the national French radio and a pioneer of
<I>musique concr&egrave;te</I>. Other participants were former members
of the movement Ordre Nouveau, such as Paul Flamand, future head of the
&Eacute;ditions du Seuil, Xavier de Lignac, and Pierre Pr&eacute;vost,
and also a prestigious array of literary and artistic personalities:
the poet Patrice de la tour du Pin, the painter Alfred Manessier,
the philosopher Emmanuel Mounier, and men of the theater such as Jean
Vilar and Raymond Rouleau. Actors included Pierre Fresnay, and Pierre
Renoir, and contributing composers and musicians included Henri Baraud,
Daniel-Lesur, and Maurice Martenot. In spite of the fact that it received
official support from Vichy, "Jeune France" was a genuine educational
movement and historians of the period stress its high quality and
generally single it out as one of the most creative and high-minded of
the era.
<SUP><a NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">88</a></SUP>
 Pelorson was to be responsible for its literary section and preliminary
 discussions were held with Girodias about the publication of a journal.
<SUP><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></SUP>
 In February 1941, when Pelorson abandoned the project to take up his
 new position, he recommended to succeed him a young writer of his
 acquaintance whom he considered equal to the greatest. His name was
 Maurice Blanchot. Pelorson introduced him to Pr&eacute;vost who in
 turn introduced him to Bataille. Pelorson was thus responsible for the
 meeting, which soon developed into a close friendship, between two of
 the greatest res of the French literary avant-garde of the next
 three decades.
<SUP><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The new position Pelorson took up in February 1941 was that of "Chef de la
propagande des jeunes" for the occupied zone within the Secr&eacute;tariat
g&eacute;n&eacute;ral &agrave; la jeunesse (SGJ). The SGJ was one of
the creations of the Vichy r&eacute;gime that have survived, in various
incarnations, throughout the Fourth and Fifth Republics. It first
combined Family and Youth and was first entrusted to the right-wing
Basque sportsman Jean Ybarn&eacute;garay. As of September 25, 1940, the
new man in charge was Georges Lamirand, who was a director of the Renault
factories at the eve of the war. A catholic and an admirer of Marshal
Lyautey, who prefaced a book he published in 1925, <I>Le r&ocirc;le social
de l'ing&eacute;nieur</I> (a direct homage to Lyautey's own <I>R&ocirc;le
social de l'officier</I>), Lamirand had gained the personal confidence
of P&eacute;tain. He has been described by one historian as "a sort
of boyish itinerant national cheerleader for the National Revolution"
who seemingly loved nothing more than the sound of his own voice.
<SUP><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></SUP>
 He reported to the Minister of Education, except for a two-month period
 at the end of 1940 when the SGJ was controlled by Laval, who was then
 Vice-pr&eacute;sident du conseil. The role of the SGJ was to oversee
 training programs at all levels for young people after they had left
 school. The "Chantiers de jeunesse" and the 20 or so newly created
 leadership schools, of which the most famous was the &Eacute;cole des
 cadres d'Uriage founded by Captain Dunoyer de Segonzac, were under the
 SGJ's tutelage. It was also supposed to liaise with youth movements
 and develop a network of regional delegates. Finally, it was

<B></B>

able to subsidize youth movements once they had gone through a procedure
of official recognition or "agr&eacute;ment" (a system which, as Pierre
Giolitto points out, is more or less still in place today).
<SUP><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Youth Propaganda services which Pelorson headed for the occupied zone
had a program of publications, the collection "France nouvelle--&agrave;
nous, jeunes," which published edifying 32-page brochures on themes
such as <I>Forces de la France: le mar&eacute;chal, les jeunes</I>,
or <I>Qu'est-ce que la r&eacute;volution nationale</I>?
<SUP><a NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">93</a></SUP>
 Those brochures often reprint speeches given by Pelorson at meetings such
 as the Assises de la jeunesse de France organized at the Salle Wagram
 in Paris on June 15, 1941 for regional youth delegates from the occupied
 zone: in the presence of the notoriously pro-Nazi Abel Bonnard, Pelorson
 addressed the audience on "Destin de la jeunesse fran&ccedil;aise,"
 "L'Union et l'unit&eacute;,"  "Discipline," "Hi&eacute;rarchie," among
 others. Under "N&eacute;cessit&eacute; de choisir," Pelorson opposes
 "the France of the Mar&eacute;chal, which is France itself" and "that
 image of our country which has been appropriated by a mendacious foreign
 propaganda and which they are trying to promote from beyond our borders,"
 between "the hero of Verdun" (P&eacute;tain) and "l'homme de Dakar et
 de Syrie" (De Gaulle). He urges the delegates to have "absolute faith
 . . . in the Leader the Mar&eacute;chal gave us: Georges Lamirand."
<SUP><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></SUP>
 At another such meeting ("Journ&eacute;es de solidarit&eacute;
 nationale"), held at the V&eacute;l d'Hiv at the end of November 1941,
 the former editor of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> addressed the youth delegates
 in words and in a style that sound like a parody of his younger self; a
 less charitable interpretation would be to suggest that the "geographic"
 rhetoric of <I>Volont&eacute;s</I> had finally found its real home:
 "We have a will,--it is to achieve, together with the Mar&eacute;chal,
 for the greatness of our country, the National Revolution. This will
 is made of our blood, and our blood is made of our soil. This will is
 that of France. We are here by the will of France. And no force in the
 world could possibly distract us from this will."
<SUP><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the evidence of their speeches, it would seem as if Lamirand and
Pelorson were speaking as one voice. They were, in fact, bitterly opposed
in their views, which represented two conflicting and contradictory sides
of Vichy France. Lamirand, for all his fondness for public appearances and
his addiction to applause, was a pragmatist rather than a doctrinaire. His
Catholicism and social conservatism were in contrast with Pelorson's
anti-clericalism and socialist views. Both Anglo-American and French
historians of the Vichy regime, for once in agreement, have taken a
severe view of Pelorson, whom one of them introduces as "one of the more
curious characters that the regime threw up."
<SUP><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></SUP>
 He was described as an ideologue bent on imposing a "jeunesse unique"
 on the model of the Hitlerj&uuml;gend, a "brilliant representative
 of the collaborationist extreme-right within the SGJ," a partisan of
 "a kind of moral and spiritualist fascism," a "crypto-fascist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></SUP>
 He was held in suspicion in Vichy because of his extremist views,
 both by P&eacute;tain's staff and by the prudent J&eacute;r&ocirc;me
 Carcopino, Minister of Education from February 1941 until the return
 of Laval to power in April 1942. In his post-war memoirs, Carcopino

In early 1942, the relations between Lamirand and Pelorson had
deteriorated to such a point that the former, according to Pelorson's
own testimony, tried to force him to resign.
<SUP><a NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">99</a></SUP>
 Pelorson, however, had the opportunity of furthering his political
 ambitions in mid-March 1942 at a meeting of the Conseil national,
 the advisory body created by P&eacute;tain to advise him on
 constitutional matters, which was convened behind Carcopino's back
 to review questions relating to youth. In his testimony before the
 Commission, Pelorson attacked the "clerico-reactionary" philosophy of
 the SGJ and denounced its tepid paternalism. His views were supported
 by the ultra-collaborationist wing on the Council: Pucheu, Minister of
 the Interior, Paul Marion, Minister of Information, and Bonnard. The
 Commission's final report recommended him among possible replacements
 for Lamirand.
<SUP><a NAME="REF100" HREF="#FOOT100">100</a></SUP>
 In April 1942, Laval returned to power and named Bonnard Minister of
 Education. On June 6, Pelorson was appointed Deputy Secretary General
 for Youth with the specific mission of keeping Lamirand in line and
 with the determination to push for a more authoritarian control over
 youth movements. Pelorson's "reign" (since Lamirand was no more than a
 rehead at this point) began, to the alarm of P&eacute;tain's cabinet,
 with an administrative purge of the moderate elements in the SGJ staff.
<SUP><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></SUP>
 It was marked by the granting of official recognition (and therefore
 subsidies) to overtly pro-fascist movements previously kept at bay by
 Lamirand, such as the Jeunesse de France et d'outremer, the Jeunesses
 paysannes of Dorg&egrave;res, and the Jeunesses francistes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF102" HREF="#FOOT102">102</a></SUP>
 Another opportunity Pelorson had to display his New Order zeal was
 the support he gave to the Jeunes de l'Europe nouvelle of Marc Augier,
 which he lobbied in vain to represent France at meetings of the Union of
 European Youth organized in Vienna by Baldur von Schirach, the notorious
 Jugendf&uuml;hrer of the Third Reich.
<SUP><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></SUP>
 He was, in fact, soon known among youth leaders wary of SGJ hegemony as
 "Baldur von Pelorson."
<SUP><a NAME="REF104" HREF="#FOOT104">104</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson's grand idea (in the context of his dreams of a "Jeunesse
unique") was the "&Eacute;quipes nationales," which he created in early
August 1942 to "gather the young from 12 to 15 that do not belong to
any movement, to make them participate in civic and social activities
and give them a 'virile and strong' training."
<SUP><a NAME="REF105" HREF="#FOOT105">105</a></SUP>
 The context of the speech is worth recalling: since May 29, Jews in
 the occupied zone had been forced to wear the yellow star and the
 V&eacute;l d'Hiv roundup had just happened on July 16. It goes without
 saying that those &Eacute;quipes, in Pelorson's own words, echoed in
 the oath required of the "&Eacute;quipiers," were reserved to the "sole
 Frenchmen worthy by the soil, the blood and the race to be admitted
 into the French community."
<SUP><a NAME="REF106" HREF="#FOOT106">106</a></SUP>
 And if any doubts subsist on how Pelorson then stood on such issues,
 here is how he addressed the youth leaders on August 3, 1942: "We wish
 to launch in France the reign of a new, just, and strong State. . . . We
 want this force not to be used anymore for the benefit of velleities
 [<I>volont&eacute;s</I>], parties and more or less anonymous and
 French private ventures: for the benefit of the Jews, the Freemasons,
 corporations, the financial world and international capitalism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF107" HREF="#FOOT107">107</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As we have suggested above, Pelorson's policies did not endear him to
any but the most pro-Nazi activists among youth leaders. For example,
at the Congress of the Jeunesses nationales populaires in 1943, he was
singled out for praise by Marcel D&eacute;at's

<B></B>

right-hand man, Georges Albertini.
<SUP><a NAME="REF108" HREF="#FOOT108">108</a></SUP>
 He was particularly resented by the Catholic movements.
<SUP><a NAME="REF109" HREF="#FOOT109">109</a></SUP>
 Relations were no better with the leadership schools, which Pelorson
 viewed (not incorrectly) as devoted to Uriage. In late August 1942,
 at a "R&eacute;union des Chefs" held at the &Eacute;cole des cadres du
 Mayet-de-Montagne, Pelorson blamed the Uriage representative for the
 school's failure to apply Vichy's anti-Semitic policies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF110" HREF="#FOOT110">110</a></SUP>
 At a similar meeting with Pelorson at &Eacute;cully, near Lyon, in
 October 1942, an uproar occurred as a result of the racism of some of
 the statements.
<SUP><a NAME="REF111" HREF="#FOOT111">111</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In spite of Pelorson's collaborationist zeal which earned him praise
from the Nazi authorities, he did not succeed Lamirand, to the surprise
of many, when the latter was finally dismissed on March 24, 1943. As we
have seen, Pelorson was not popular with the entourage of P&eacute;tain
(with whom he had a meeting the day before, on March 23). The pragmatist
Laval (who also saw Pelorson in Vichy on March 18) may have grown wary of
his extremism. Bonnard himself, even though Pelorson was perceived as one
of his henchmen, may have come to the conclusion that his nomination would
have incensed the youth movements. Instead of him, he chose as Lamirand's
successor the conservative law professor F&eacute;lix Olivier-Martin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF112" HREF="#FOOT112">112</a></SUP>
 The position of deputy Secretary General was abolished and Pelorson's
 political career came to an end. He did, however, keep his office on
 the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor&eacute; and was retained by Bonnard
 to head an obscure collaborationist organization called "Les amis
 du Mar&eacute;chal," a position he retained until his arrest at the
 Liberation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF113" HREF="#FOOT113">113</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Vichy historians generally agree--not, of course, to deplore it--on the
overall lack of success of the regime's propaganda machine. Indeed,
Pelorson's tenure at the SGJ is symptomatic of the glaring contrast
between Vichy's inflated rhetoric and the realities faced by the country,
particularly the increasing weight put on its youth by the Service du
travail obligatoire, which by the summer of 1943 claimed an ever-growing
number of them. Pelorson himself almost seems to have sensed the ultimate
futility of his efforts even as he was addressing the topic dearest to
him, his "thing," the creation of the &Eacute;quipes nationales: "Never
mind even what those young people should build: roads leading nowhere,
roads that would not make any sense . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF114" HREF="#FOOT114">114</a></SUP>
 The irony is that despite this "Bridge on the River Kwai" insanity,
 the &Eacute;quipes nationales actually accomplished some useful work,
 especially after Pelorson's departure, as the bombing of French cities
 intensified. They were not dissolved at the Liberation and, even more
 paradoxically, were subsequently incorporated into the Communist-led
 Union de la jeunesse r&eacute;publicaine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF115" HREF="#FOOT115">115</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One Frenchman who hardly met Pelorson's official criteria of blood,
soil, and race had nonetheless kept in touch with him throughout the
war. Girodias was indeed able to continue his activities as a publisher
throughout the Occupation and regularly visited Pelorson at his office,
conveniently located within walking distance of the Place Vend&ocirc;me.
<SUP><a NAME="REF116" HREF="#FOOT116">116</a></SUP>
 Pelorson was by then separated from his first wife and eventually
 married his secretary at the SGJ, named Josephine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF117" HREF="#FOOT117">117</a></SUP>
 Girodias's &Eacute;ditions du Ch&ecirc;ne published two works by Pelorson
 during the war: the play <I>Jules C&eacute;sar</I> in 1943, and the
 poem <I>Carmen Seculare</I> the following year. <I>Carmen Seculare</I>
 is a love poem and definitely not a modernist one, even if we allow
 that it was written at a time when even former

<B></B>

Surrealists turned back to traditional forms ("je pourrai dans tes
yeux/et dans l'ombre lev&eacute;e,/voir enfin devant Dieu/la beaut&eacute;
communier/avec l'&eacute;ternit&eacute;").
<SUP><a NAME="REF118" HREF="#FOOT118">118</a></SUP>
 <I>Jules C&eacute;sar</I> is a more interesting work, not so much in
 its form which is the familiar split alexandrines of Pelorson's earlier
 poetry, but for the deliberately anachronistic treatment of the theme
 as a fascist tragedy--the dictator versus Roman senators who are made
 to sound like Third Republic senators.
<SUP><a NAME="REF119" HREF="#FOOT119">119</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is no surprise to find Pelorson's name on the black list published at
the Liberation by the Comit&eacute; national des &eacute;crivains, whose
members included Queneau. Pelorson appears both on the first list of 88
names, published in the <I>Lettres fran&ccedil;aises</I> for September
16, 1944, and on the much enlarged list of 158 names published in the
same journal on October 21.  The presence of one's name on those lists
was tantamount to a ban on publication, at least for the immediate future.
<SUP><a NAME="REF120" HREF="#FOOT120">120</a></SUP>
 Pelorson, who had been arrested in his office at the Liberation, was then
 in one of the makeshift prisons established in the Montparnasse area
 to cope with the overcrowding of the official ones. Girodias tried in
 vain to plead with Queneau the cause of his old friend "Pelo" and claims
 to have even plotted an escape attempt, but Pelorson was unexpectedly
 released after five months. Having risen only to the level of Deputy
 Secretary of State, he was spared a trial by the High Court of Justice
 and was sentenced to a relatively lenient deprivation of civil rights
 for ten years.
<SUP><a NAME="REF121" HREF="#FOOT121">121</a></SUP>
 He was also advised to spend a few years away from Paris. As he needed
 financial support, Girodias put him in charge of the translation of
 <I>Tropic of Capricorn</I> and other works by Miller: the career of
 Georges Belmont had begun.
<SUP><a NAME="REF122" HREF="#FOOT122">122</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Few of Pelorson's pre-war friends appear to have even attempted to resume
relations with him. He does not come up in name in Jolas's autobiography,
though one passage clearly alludes to him: "I met old friends who had
spent the war in resistance to the enemy. I also heard of others who
had been P&eacute;tainists or had even betrayed France and its Allies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF123" HREF="#FOOT123">123</a></SUP>
 Henry Miller himself, who was being translated by Pelorson while the
 latter was in hiding, writes to Jolas in October 1950 that he has "never
 had a line from Pelorson since [he] left Paris" (though relations were
 resumed shortly afterwards).
<SUP><a NAME="REF124" HREF="#FOOT124">124</a></SUP>
 The main exception was Samuel Beckett, which may be surprising in
 view of his involvement in the Resistance, but which can be explained
 both by the closeness of their early ties and by Beckett's profoundly
 forgiving nature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF125" HREF="#FOOT125">125</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are few links between the literary output of Belmont and that of
Pelorson. The 1953 novel, <I>La vache et la tour Eiffel</I>, is a mildly
amusing satire reminiscent of the popular works of Pierre Daninos. His
next work, <I>Le grand pressoir</I> was published four years later also
by Robert Laffont. And though it is also rather conventional in form,
it is, by contrast, a serious and even stark novel. Set in the future
(the 1970s), it is the story of a civil war in France and an obvious
allegory of the Occupation and its sequels. France has been caught in a
war between the two superpowers. The hero, Jacques Legrand, was on the
American side and served the government they backed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF126" HREF="#FOOT126">126</a></SUP>
 The other side having won, he is taken prisoner and eventually murdered
 by one of his jailers after having seen his best friend savagely
 tortured. Flashback chapters describe the fallen regime, at the head
 of which were an old general ("L'Image") and his head of

<B></B>

government, the "Vizir." These transparent portraits of P&eacute;tain
and Laval contain cruel barbs towards the first, whereas the interview
with the second in chapter 8 is a lively vignette, clearly based on
personal reminiscences. Legrand himself is a leader of Brigades civiques
de volontaires in which it is not too difficult to recognize Pelorson's
&Eacute;quipes nationales. <I>Le Grand Pressoir</I> is a striking novel,
but, as an attempt on Pelorson's part to come to terms with his past,
it is also a deeply dishonest one. By transposing the action into
the future, Belmont can be conveniently selective in his allegorical
treatment of Vichy. Racial persecutions are not even hinted at. Based
on this account, it would seem that the gravest crime Pelorson would
let himself be accountable for was political naivete.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The other three novels can be dealt with more briefly. <I>Chris</I>,
published in 1965, is also allegorical, and is also set against a
political background. Its theme is reminiscent of Sartre's <I>Les
mains sales</I>, opposing a cynical hero and "Chris," his "pure"
Doppelg&auml;nger. An epilogue suggests, a little heavy-handedly,
that Chris never existed and they were the same person. <I>Un homme au
cr&eacute;puscule</I>, published the following year, is set in Ireland
and on the Riviera and explores the sentimental interaction between the
French narrator, his Irish friend John (a painter), and John's girlfriend
Vicky. Vicky turns out to have had a previous affair with another woman,
who committed suicide. The treatment of the sexual theme seems excessively
melodramatic. We are certainly as far from <I>transition</I> as from
the R&eacute;volution nationale. <I>Ex</I>, published by Deno&euml;l
in 1969, has little in common with Belmont's preceding four novels. It
is a "nouveau roman" of sorts, with some typographical and syntactic
liberties such as interrupted sentences, unconventional punctuation,
or the words "aimer" and "amour" replaced by dashes. The work has a
certain confessional tone--a confession made at times to a doctor,
at other times to a judge--and there are references to a plague-ridden
city and an unspecified "thing" which haunts the narrator and follows
him everywhere: it could be seen as his past, but the very opacity of
the text defies interpretation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pelorson published one more book of poetry in 1973, <I>L'honneur
de vivre</I>, with a vanity press known as &Eacute;ditions
Saint-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s. One poem is dedicated to Maurice Nadeau
and his wife, another to Beckett. The form is freer than Pelorson's
earlier poetry, the inspiration elegiac or melancholy. But the most
notable feature of the book is its colophon, where we catch the author
fiddling with his past: it mentions a limited edition of 26 and a few
Hors Commerce copies with a lithograph by Jean H&eacute;lion: "This
illustration was made in 1937 by the painter for the poem 'Connaissance'
by Georges Belmont."
<SUP><a NAME="REF127" HREF="#FOOT127">127</a></SUP>
 As Maria Jolas might have said, Georges Belmont the author of
 'Connaissance' does not exist.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There has been a growing tendency among historians of ideas in the past
two decades to cast suspicion on the intellectual and artistic avant-garde
as the pre-war or wartime political views of some of its representatives
became better known.
<SUP><a NAME="REF128" HREF="#FOOT128">128</a></SUP>
 The case of Georges Pelorson is of no such scope insofar as his
 literary significance is negligible and, his early contributions to
 <I>transition</I> notwithstanding, he was never more than a surface
 modernist. On the other hand, it is an extreme case in the sense that
 it would be hard to find anyone else in the pre-war avant-garde circles
 and connected

<B></B>

with so many of their members, who compromised himself to such an extent
as a government official--only just short of occupying a cabinet position
in the Vichy regime during the period when it sided most clearly with
the Nazis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF129" HREF="#FOOT129">129</a></SUP>
 The post-war disappearance of Pelorson and his reappearance as Belmont
 make it also an interesting case as one of the most successful (and
 therefore little-known) illustrations of what Daniel Lindenberg amusingly
 calls "l'effet Monte Cristo." What Maria Jolas and many others who knew
 him as Edmond Dant&egrave;s could not forgive him for was his attempts to
 have it both ways: he posed as Georges Belmont--the friend of Beckett,
 Miller, and Joyce--as if he and "Baldur von Pelorson" had not been one
 and the same person.

Jean Piel, a one-time contributor to <I>Volont&eacute;s</I>, may well have
had the journal (if not Pelorson himself) in mind when he wrote in his
diary for September 26, 1943: "This is the result of that frenzy of naked
will, devoid of the true convicton that would give it a purpose: thus
erred so many pre-war pseudo-intellectuals, reacting against surrealist
fatalism, and among whom fake Nietzschean stirrings were awakaned by noisy
echoes from beyond the Rhine. Will for will's sake without any reason
for willing. Pure dilettantism, lyrical gymnastics." ("Voil&agrave;
o&ugrave; m&egrave;ne cette fr&eacute;n&eacute;sie de volont&eacute;
nue, sans conviction vraie qui lui asigne un but: d&eacute;formation de
tant de pseudo-intellectuels d'avant-guerre, en r&eacute;action contre
le fatalisme surr&eacute;aliste, et chez lesquels de faux relents de
nietzsch&eacute;isme &eacute;taient r&eacute;veill&eacute;s par les

The other Vichy official to have been in relations with Joyce, Jacques
Benoist-M&eacute;chin (sentenced to death by the High Court of Justice in
1947, a sentence later commuted), does not come close in the range of his
other contacts. None of the other possible contenders, such as Bernard

or Drieu la Rochelle, occupied a government position.

I had completed the revision of this article when I became aware
of a short biography of "Georges Belmont" in English available
on the World Wide Web through the Gale Literary Databases. Under
"Politics," the "personal information" section states simply: "Never
belonged to any party." No wartime activities are listed except for
service in the infantry in 1939-1940 and "taken prisoner by
the Germans" (a very short imprisonment, as we have seen). Religion
is given as "Pantheism." The "career" section makes no reference to
<I>Volont&eacute;s</I> (or <I>transition</I>); on the other hand, Joyce,
Beckett, and Miller are mentioned in the "sidelights" section. Two novels
are listed as being in preparation. Most tantalizing is the indication:
"accumulating material for memoirs." The biography seems to have been
compiled in the late 1970s and we can only speculate as to why the
promised memoirs have failed to appear in the 20 years since.

The French tradition beginning with Baudelaire's writings on art and
the work of Manet has seemed to generations of scholars to be the most
compelling modernist work there is. In the earliest historiography of
modern painting this art was conceived as possessing an inherent drive
towards abstraction, the full realization of which was understood to occur
only with the passing of the modernist baton to New York in 1945. The
dominant concern of modernist art was said to be the pursuit of a pure
painting, a preoccupation with pigment and the surface of the canvas, and
a consequent denigration of the importance of subject matter. Associated
above all with Clement Greenberg and Alfred Barr, this style of thinking
has been widely criticized from the 1970s onwards and largely replaced by
an alternative reading which privileges engagement with social modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Stemming from the thought of Walter Benjamin, a very specific reading of
 Baudelaire, and, most immediately, from the popularity of T. J. Clark's
 powerful analysis of Impressionism in <I>The Painting of Modern Life</I>,
 this approach defines a modernism in painting that is engaged with the
 society of the spectacle and the social consequences of modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However different these accounts may be, they share a fascination with
the art and thought of France as central to the project of understanding
modernism, and hence provide a norm upon which any definitions must
explicitly or implicitly be built.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 One consequence of such a situation is historiographical hesitancy

<B></B>

about the status of modern visual art made in other places and under other
circumstances. In the case of English art, the evident differences from
French norms have obscured the possibility of evaluating the modernity
of work produced from the mid-nineteenth century onwards.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 With very few exceptions, such as that of Vorticism around 1914 or the
 revivified continental abstractionism of Ben Nicholson in the 1930s,
 English art has seemed continually at odds with ideas of modernism
 derived from France, whether it is conceived as abstraction or as
 socially responsive. An artist like Walter Sickert (1860-1942)
 is problematic in this way. Evidently occupied with the subjects of
 modern life, he is also committed to exploring the idea of a purely
 formal painting. But in neither aspect is he readily imaginable within
 French norms except through interpretative violence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The question of the modernity of late nineteenth century English art
has only recently begun to receive attention. Debate has focused around
two issues: the possibility of understanding the ways in which the art
produced in England in these years responded to cultural modernity in
Britain; and how far it can be related to modernist art made elsewhere.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 These questions open up the possibility of reading the modernism of an
 artist like Sickert within the historical circumstances and concerns
 which formed his art. But Sickert's modernity continues to be judged by
 the degree to which he can be brought within the definitions of French
 modernism. In 1970 Wendy Baron concentrated on Sickert's interest
 in formal matters and argued that his work can be understood as the
 accommodation of a succession of French styles via Manet, Whistler,
 and Impressionism to an earlier, "pre-Impressionist" French tradition
 which she characterized as "the climax of Sickert's history."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 More recently art historians have begun to explicate Sickert's art by
 adapting the concerns which the social history of art finds in French
 modernism. Anna Gruetzner Robins, the foremost commentator in this
 vein, has suggested that we must understand Sickert as a fl&acirc;neur,
 integrating him into an interpretation of "modernist strategies and
 modern life" which derives from the preoccupations of current readings
 of French experience.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These commentators seem to share a certainty that the developments
to be found in France are ineluctably prior to any which could have
taken place in England. If Sickert's modernism is taken to lie in his
technical practice, and yet he seems to have rejected the procedures of
Impressionism, then it is inevitable that he found the "method . . . which
he considered to be ideal" in another version of French painting, even if
this time "of pre-Impressionist origin." If the interest is in the social
modernity of his subject matter, then it seems equally inevitable that we
should turn to powerful concepts such as the spectacle, the fl&acirc;neur,
and ideas of urban leisure evolved in scholarship on the social history of
French modernism, to better understand Sickert's work. Yet it is no more
clear that we can use definitions of cultural modernity predicated upon
French history to improve our grasp of English art than that we should
refer any technical innovations to French models. The circumstances of
French and English modernity are distinct and modes of representation
in the two countries are culturally specific. To translate terms and
concepts evolved to account for one type of art to describe work produced
elsewhere is to court misreading.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this essay I pursue a rather different argument. Taking the example of
the important music hall scenes he produced from the late 1880s onwards,
I suggest that we can discern in Sickert's work a critique of the capacity
of painting to comprehend modern experience, even as he deploys it himself
in an effort to do so. Sickert inherits from this two mentors, Whistler
and Degas, contrasting approaches to the representation of modernity,
broadly equivalent to the formalist and the social definitions I have
discussed. Both are present in his work. But their passage through English
culture in the form of Symbolist and Realist modes of painting, makes
them available to Sickert in ways that proved conducive to critique. By
looking closely at the music hall paintings we can observe both his
attempts to enact the modernist imperative to define and understand
modern life and his articulation of the difficulty of attempting to do
so through what he called the "grossly material" substance of paint.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 In the process he both asserts and questions the fascination of modernist
 painting with pure visuality and with the subject matter of modernity. I
 will argue that this dialectic is formed within the specificity of
 English modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sickert's music hall paintings fall into several distinct chronological
periods.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 They first appear in his oeuvre around 1887, and Sickert produced
 some of his most important paintings and graphic works of the London
 halls in the years up to 1889. This first period includes the sequence
 of paintings which I shall discuss below, in which mirrors play an
 important compositional role. Returning to this theme between 1894 and
 1898, Sickert produced a number of studies concentrating mostly on the
 Bedford Music Hall in Camden Town. The majority of these paintings take
 as their subject various descriptions of the audience. This phase of
 his work seems to have been brought to a close when Sickert departed
 for Dieppe at the end of 1898. He was based abroad for seven years and
 returned to London to live and work during 1905, a move which may have
 inspired his next sequence of music hall subjects. In 1906-1907,
 starting with <I>Noctes Ambrosianae</I> (1906, Nottingham Museum and
 Art Gallery), Sickert produced studies of the audiences seen in halls
 in London and Paris. After this, and with very few exceptions, Sickert
 abandoned themes related to the halls.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The early music hall scenes have been identified with Sickert's transfer
of loyalties from Whistler to Degas during the 1880s. Their importance
in this way is indicated by Wendy Baron, who ascribes to them Sickert's
main influence from the French tradition concerned with content rather
than technique. According to Baron:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In spite of Sickert's denial of any French influence behind his early
music-hall paintings their compositional arrangements were certainly
derived from Degas's theater and ballet pictures; moreover, Degas's
<I>caf&eacute;s-concerts</I>, with their harsh lighting and robustly
characterized <I>chanteuses</I> must have contributed towards Sickert's
initial inspiration to tackle their nearest English equivalent, the
cockney music-hall.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<B></B>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
She goes on to account for this influence in formal terms of
composition and technical procedure. More recently, T. J. Clark in
<I>The Painting of Modern Life</I> devotes some close examination
to the caf&eacute;s-concerts and the attention Degas paid them in
the 1870s. Clark sees the commodified leisure of the urban Parisians
as a fertile soil for the complexities of definition and enactment
of the new class identities modernity brought in its wake. Clark's
caf&eacute;-concert "<I>produced</I> the popular" as a sounding board
against which the uncertainties of class could be made to resonate and
which it "mitigated . . . by making a spectacle of them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 For at least some of its audience, Clark argues, "it seems . . . that
 the masquerade [of the performance] confirmed their sense of the
 class as pure contingency, a matter of endless shifting and exchange,
 for society was pictured in the caf&eacute;-concert as a series of
 petty transformation scenes, in which everyone suffered the popular
 sea-change'.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In responding to these strange circumstances, Degas's paintings give
 an image to this sense that the audience "<I>were</I> the illusion
 (<I>Painting of Modern Life</I>, 224)."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Intriguingly, in making this argument Clark feels the need, virtually for
the only time in his writings, to draw a standard of comparison from the
circumstances of English modernity. He cites T. S. Eliot's 1923 obituary
essay on the music hall artist Marie Lloyd. Clark quotes at length and
it will be worth following what holds his attention so strongly. Eliot
observes in his text that Lloyd had in her time "far the strongest hold
on popular affection" and attributes this to "her understanding of the
people and sympathy with them, and the people's recognition of the fact
that she embodied the virtues which they genuinely most respected in
private life." Eliot concludes:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I have called her the expressive re of the lower classes. There is
no such expressive re for any other class. The middle classes have
no such idol: the middle classes are morally corrupt. That is to say,
their own life fails to find a Marie Lloyd to express it; nor have they
any independent virtues which might give them as a conscious class any
dignity. (<I>Painting of Modern Life</I>, 216-17)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is, in other words, an argument about the representation of bourgeois
modernity in English culture. In some way which neither Eliot nor Clark
explore, the difficulties of evolving a set of languages through which
modernity of experience could be represented is rooted, or perhaps
especially telling, in the English experience. Clark returns to Eliot's
claim to clinch his own argument.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
To put Eliot's verdict in a more limited form: the middle class in the
later nineteenth century, and even the early years of the twentieth,
had not yet invented an <I>imaginary</I> of its own fate . . . for the
time being it was obliged to feed on the values and idioms of those
classes it wished to dominate; and doing so involved it in making the
idioms part of a further system, in which the popular was expropriated
from those who produced it--made over into a separate realm of images
which were given back, duly refurbished, to the "people" thus safely
defined. (<I>Painting of Modern Life</I>, 229-230)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a result, Cark says, "the material called popular" was hotly contested,
needing to be "continually renewed and recast, lest its working-class
users find ways of giving it back

<B></B>

its original consistency--making it assume, for example, the form called
proletarian" (<I>Painting of Modern Life</I>, 230).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One might well argue that Sickert's music hall scenes are
indices of the same modern processes that Clark discerns in the
caf&eacute;s-concerts. Sickert's colonization of the popular forms of the
music hall, his forceful use of the bodies of working-class models and the
gestures of working-class entertainment as markers of modern experience,
might seem to amount to the same thing as Clark's caf&eacute;s-concerts,
the capture of powerful representations of modernity as a means of
cloaking the nakedness of the bourgeois imaginary. It's a good argument,
and I can readily imagine someone giving it an outing on Sickert's music
hall pictures. But I want instead to suggest that the meanings Sickert
took from Degas would not be adequately described by this reading. Degas,
for Sickert, is part of a complex of possible relations to modernity
which are best described as deriving from the patterns of reception of
continental influences in England. They are bound up with the ways in
which Symbolism and Realism as alternative and competing descriptions
of modernity were alive for Sickert--not least within the process of
the compositions of his paintings; and not least when they were named
respectively Whistler and Degas--and the ways in which they were worked
through as part of the interest in making painting a practice suited to
the representation and investigation of modern life within specifically
British conditions and circumstances. To clarify this I need to say
something about how these relations were defined by the time that Sickert
began his music hall sequences in the 1880s, and particularly about the
role of Symbolism in that unfolding process.

In 1889 Sickert wrote an introduction to the  catalogue of the "London
Impressionists" show at the Goupil Gallery in which he showed several
music hall pictures.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 What Sickert said there has had a bad press from art historians, who
 have seen it as an instance of bad faith or a deliberate attempt to
 throw the readers off the scent of his relationship with continental
 Impressionism. The problem is that Sickert writes about a collection of
 paintings which have a shared aim to depict the contemporary scene as
 if they were perpetuating the protocols and concerns of Symbolism. In
 the catalogue he defined Impressionism like this:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Essentially and firstly it is not realism. It has no wish to record
anything merely because it exists . . . It accepts, as the aim of the
picture, what Edgar Allen Poe asserts to be the sole legitimate province
of the poem, beauty. It is . . . strong in the belief that for those who
live in the most wonderful city in the world, the most fruitful course
of study lies in the persistent effort to render the magic and poetry
which they daily see around them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This has often seemed disconcerting to later readers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Sickert's justification for the subject matter of the show is not social
 realism or "the painting of modern life." Instead, he couches his work
 in the language of symbolism by using the terms "beauty,"

<B></B>

"magic" and "poetry." And by evoking Poe he calls upon one of the
arch-symbolists of the English-language tradition. How are we then to
reconcile this artist's own account of his work with the ambitions which
seem to be embodied in works shown at the Goupil, such as Sidney Starr's
<I>The City Atlas</I> (1889, National Gallery of Canada) or Sickert's own
<I>The Butcher's Shop</I> (1884, York City Art Gallery), let alone with
his music hall paintings? The catalogue introduction seems to suggest a
different and inappropriate principle of meaning for images which strike
us as plainly about social realism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It would be a mistake to place too much interpretative weight on Sickert's
introduction. Nevertheless, I think that we can largely accept what
he says here. The fact is that it is possible to read this strand of
British Impressionism as profoundly aware of the ambitions of Symbolism
and influenced by them in its project to represent the modern city.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 These paintings have a central concern with describing the realities
 of experience as they obtained within the modernized environment of
 London's new boundaries.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 The modern city is presented as a legitimate slice of reality on which
 to expend the analytical and registering powers of painting.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The perception of the London Impressionists show as centrally concerned
 with the requirements of this recording is accurate enough. But it is
 also the "magic and poetry" and the "beauty" of this material which is
 to be evoked and these are Symbolist ambitions, that Wendy Baron quite
 rightly refers directly to Whistler's <I>Ten O'Clock Lecture</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The last decades of the nineteenth century, those in which Symbolism
was emerging within the fluid relationships of the British art world,
saw the beginning of an unprecedented modernization of the conditions of
artistic production which continued into the twentieth century. Rapidly
changing, requiring ever-greater professionalization from practitioners,
this modernizing process enforced the commodification of the work and
the transformation of art practice into capitalist production which
is so marked a feature of British experience--as of French--from the
Pre-Raphaelites to Vorticism and beyond.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Under these circumstances the most urgent impulses of British art
were those which derived from the experience of modernity. The common
preoccupations were not only about the evolution of new modes and idioms
of visual enquiry, but also about what needed to be enquired into, whether
modern life or some promise of alternative value. What emerged was in part
a new definition of practice which emphasized the function of the work of
art as revelation. Capital's professionalized publicity machines and the
strutting artist-entrepreneurs, of whom Whistler, "his pockets bulging
with newspaper articles" is only the most obvious example, often made
art out of a belief in its capacity to transcend this lived modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The values of art were understood to be those which the materialism of
 contemporary life had put aside. It was to be prized for its access to
 concealed, but fundamental, truths, to a reality which the frenetic,
 mobile, surface of modernity merely disguised. Modern life was something
 which it was the task of the artist to endure, overcome and discard in
 order to reveal the truths beneath.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the formation of this set of concepts, the induction of French
<I>Symbolisme</I> into Britain, through channels such as Charles
Ricketts's periodical of the 1880s and 1890s, <I>The Dial</I>, and
Whistler's close relationship to Mallarm&eacute; and his circle, plays
an important role.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Coming out of the pressures of modernity in the late nineteenth century
 on the art world, British Symbolism's central concern was the search
 for a representation which would access those aspects of experience
 and reality which the dominant materialism of industrial capitalism was
 felt to elide or cover over. Its most urgent desires were those which
 aim to strip away the veil of matter and to suggest or evoke something
 of greater truth beneath.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This did not mean that such art abandoned an interest in modern
experience. Far from it. Whistler's nocturnes have been cited as "central
statements of the Symbolist position" because of their artificiality
and frank distance from reality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 A painting like <I>Nocturne: Blue and Silver--Chelsea</I> (1871, Tate
 Gallery) elides the contemporary elements of the scene in favor of a
 painterly self-sufficiency and the evocation of what Whistler called
 "poetry" and "palaces in the night."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Nonetheless <I>Blue and Silver</I> remains a contemporary scene,
 recognizable as a view across the Thames towards Chelsea. The motif it
 depicts is an industrial, quintessentially modern one.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 In a parallel way, the work of G. F. Watts exemplifies modes of Victorian
 painting that repudiate the claims of Realism, yet he conceived it as
 offering a direct relation to contemporary experience. In <I>Mammon:
 Dedicated to his Worshippers</I> (1884-1885, Tate Gallery),
 Watts depicts modern society's self-destructive embrace of idea that
 "prosperity has become our real god."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 His re of Death pressing remorselessly across the threshold of
 a Victorian household in <I>Love and Death</I> (c. 1874-1877,
 Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester) likewise aims to bring questions about
 the meaning of existence forcefully into Watts's contemporary world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These paintings derive from a concern with the character of modern
experience, but deal with it by attempting to find principles through
which a more authentic meaning, a deeper truth, can be brought to
bear. Symbolism seeks a representation which will access those aspects of
existence and reality which it believes the dominant materialism of its
culture covers over. Modernity's surface, an account of its appearance
and optical character, is repudiated in favor of the 'beauty' which
may be found within it. But this act of revelation remains a way of
responding to the contemporary: Watts's symbols of terror and sterility
and Whistler's transformation of the London scene are equally ways of
attributing significance to the contemporary themes and sites from which
they begin. Symbolist representation in this sense is committed to an
analysis and understanding of modern experience, but distrusts a surface
account of the visual world as a means of achieving it. Symbolism proposes
a deeper investigation and revelation of the conditions of experience
than the surface can provide.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The advent of an art explicitly concerned with contemporary life and
subjects in Britain is in part the result of a shift from this Symbolist
ambition to make sense of the

<B></B>

contemporary world by uncovering abstract or generalized truths which
can substitute for it to an ambition to comprehend the modern on its
own terms. In the history of that ambition artists like Sickert were
also the heirs to a mode of painting opposed to Symbolism, one which
attempted to transcribe and understand the character of modern life
precisely by cultivating an art of the surface. For, by the end of
the century, not only was there a wing of British painting composed
of Aesthetes, Decadents, Pre-Raphaelites and others--artists concerned
with the inherent or essential meaning of experience and hence loosely
'Symbolist'--but there was also a broad spectrum of 'Realist' painters
whose aim it was to describe the appearance of the world in their art,
whether as plein-air painters, Impressionists or naturalists. Whereas
Symbolist practice understands the character of modern life by searching
for its essential 'beauty' beneath the surface, Realist practice in
all its variety pins down experience by replaying its visual, often its
optical, appearance rather than by attempting to conjure its essence. In
other words, Realist attention is directed towards an account of the
forms and surfaces of the world, painting modern life through the kind
of description the analysis of appearance could offer.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both Realists and Symbolists are divisible into a multitude of sub-groups,
and many artists have characteristics that belong to apparently opposing
camps, so that these options are in fact best understood as points on
a continuous range of possibilities. Individual artists frequently had
connections to both ends of the spectrum, and many produced work which
is best understood as bringing together apparently opposed ambitions
and strategies. Both were of crucial importance for the development of
Sickert's account of modern experience in his art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Leading 'London Impressionists' exhibitors in 1889 like Philip Wilson
 Steer accordingly show a pattern of movement between the recording
 of surface and this delving for universal truth. <I>Girls Running,
 Walberswick Pier</I> (c. 1889-1894, Tate Gallery) or <I>A Summer's
 Evening</I> (c. 1887-1888, private collection) combine in their
 fabric the dual inheritance of Symbolism and Realism. <I>A Summer's
 Evening</I> yokes an overt reference to the universalized Symbolism of
 Puvis de Chavannes to experimental paint marks which push forward the
 plein-air and recording ambitions of much English Impressionism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Steer's most interesting works are hybrid, combining the ambitions
 of Impressionism to transcribe and register the surface realities of
 the world with the Symbolists' aspirations to universalized truths
 to produce an art which aims to uncover and reveal the realities of
 modern experience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Steer, Sickert's explicit interest in revealing modernity's character
by uncovering the surface to lay bare the essential realities, was deeply
indebted to the ambitions of Symbolism to uncover the hidden truths of
experience. But, also like Steer, his attention to the surface character
of that life as a sign of its authenticity and nature were indebted to
Realism. The apparent ambiguity in Sickert's artistic loyalties was the
occasion of a great deal of comment in the art press.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Sickert's critics see in his work an example of modernity in English
 painting because they recognize a very modern kind of puzzle, a great
 technical ability and sophistication put at the service of what seems
 to them to be unequivocally sordid and ugly subject matter. On the one
 hand, Sickert is for his critics the proponent of an "extremist Realism,"
 a recorder of the

<B></B>

surface of reality, whose "eye is a purely mechanical contrivance for
conveying images" which "seems to strip his subjects of all the[ir]
<I>aura</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 On the other hand, he is a painter who "like Mallarm&eacute; . . . gives
 you a fragment here and a fragment there, enough to prove the reality
 of his vision, but not enough to render it visible to the world,"
 or who shows "how . . . a subject may be beautified by the touch of
 mystery that results from a dextrous suggestion of the unseen."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 These critics understand that Sickert has a visual project, sustained
 over a number of years and a great many works, but they can only
 understand the content of his paintings as evidence of a perplexing
 desire to be 'modern' at all costs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 These uncertainties are, I think, about the ways in which continental
 influences coming into Britain are to be understood as affecting art
 practice via their intersection with domestic traditions rather than as
 if they were straightforwardly transferrable as defining concepts from
 Paris to London. Symbolism and Realism were for Sickert vital players
 and signs in the ambition to paint the modern world he encountered. But
 their roles within that arena were ones defined by the complexities of
 the indigenous histories which absorbed French and other continental
 influences and remade them into forms which reflected domestic concerns.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Sickert's case, this dual investment in the aims of Symbolism and
Realism gives rise to a further possibility. Sickert understood the
Symbolist painter and the Realist painter as sharing a similar goal:
both attempt to understand the world through the agency of the visual,
though they each interpret the character of this world in different
ways. Ideas of the visual seemed to underlie both the optical realism
of Impressionist practices and the investigation of hidden meaning which
would support the project of Symbolist artists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The visual is imagined as describing both the world as surface, as
 appearance, as what optically registers as its characteristics and
 organization; and the visionary, the province of the seers and prophets
 so beloved of Symbolism: that which lies beneath the surface and in
 which reality inheres. The visual bounces back from the surface, and
 it penetrates into the depths. Contemporaries understood the visual as
 recording the reality of experience because it registers what is really
 there; and as recording the reality of experience because seeing beyond
 what appears on the surface into the depths of meaning.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The surface thus became a site of contestation between the Symbolist
and Realist modes of representation. The visual seemed to treat the
surface as the only authentic account of the world, but also contends
that perceptions <I>beneath</I> the surface were what counted in the
representation of reality. The possibility accordingly arose for these
artists that paint, the substance of the visual itself, could accurately
register surface reality or uncover the depths of meaning in a revelatory
transcription of essence onto the surface of the canvas. At a moment
when the authority of language to register the world was increasingly
in doubt, the promise of an unmediated access to reality through the
visual media of paint and its graphic analogues became truly attractive.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 But to say this is already to raise the principal difficulty, for paint
 is unquestionably material, a densely physical medium which inserts
 its own creation of the world into the ideal space of an unmediated
 presentation of reality.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This nature of paint allows it to match the opposition of Symbolism
and Realism, depth and surface, with a third set of terms and to act,
for Sickert, as a critical tool in opening up the implications of the
modes of representation promulgated in Symbolism and Realism. Sickert
does this by problematizing the signs which paint offers as a route to
comprehension of the world. On the one hand, there is a neat sequence of
connections to be posited which runs from the real via the visible forms
and surfaces of the world to the surface of the painting which embodies
the visual transcription of those forms and surfaces. On the other,
there is the surface of the painting itself, a surface which intrudes
into the fantasy of an unmediated transcription of reality, a blatantly
fictional skin of paint or cluster of marks which constantly threatens
to reduce itself to its own materiality and consequently to yield up
its presumptive rights to <I>be</I> the world which it describes. The
interplay between fictionality and reality which the painted surface
enacts allows the contest between a form of understanding which wishes
to see truth in the visible forms and surfaces of the world and one
which wishes to see truth only in what is <I>in</I>visible, beneath or
behind those forms and surfaces, to be articulated and explored within
the physical and material constitution of paintings themselves.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Themes of the visual--looking, transcription, the exigencies of the medium
of paint or some other graphic process--are all important in Sickert's
art because they strive to articulate these issues within the works.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 The visual seems to Sickert to be both the necessary medium of
 understanding and one which, by the very fact of its materiality,
 is compromised because it carries inherent difficulties of analysis
 within it. This gives rise to a critical project within Sickert's
 oeuvre, one which deploys the diagnostic possibilities of the visual
 to understand and determine the realities of contemporary experience
 while self-reflexively attempting to understand the limitations and
 range of those possibilities. These preoccupations are discernable in
 the thematization of the visual and the act of looking which occurs in
 Sickert's music hall works. It is not just "poetry and magic" which
 are derived in these works, the deep meaning of the modern, but also
 the adequacy of the visual as a tool for uncovering that meaning. In
 effect Sickert's use of the "grossly material" medium of paint tests the
 adequacy of painting as an investigative instrument for the apprehension
 of the realities of modern experience.

The music hall paintings use the scenes of contemporary entertainment in
the halls to stand for the character and meaning of the modern. Sickert
seems to have felt that the authenticity and reality of modern experience
that he wished to reveal to his audience could best be suggested in
the rough and tumble music halls that were mainly located in outlying
London districts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Sickert sets the dialectic between essence and surface in motion
 by drawing attention to the theatricality and the falsity of the
 stage as a surface in his depiction of his music hall scenes. The
 ramifying visual complexities and nested images of paintings
 like <I>Little Dot Hetherington at the Bedford Music Hall</I> (<A
 HREF="7.2peters_corbett_1.html"> 1</A>) or <I>Vesta Victoria at
 the Old Bedford</I> (<A HREF="7.2peters_corbett_2.html"> 2</A>),
 are Sickert's meditations on this

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 296]</B>

dialectic between the representation of the material surface of experience
and what lies beneath them. In <I>Vesta Victoria</I> and <I>Little Dot
Hetherington</I>, space is misleading: what we initially take to be the
stage is revealed to be a reflection, and the direction of the singer's
gestures have to be painfully reconstructed from reversed information.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 The first experience of encountering an image like <I>Vesta Victoria</I>
 is often puzzling. What is being depicted here? And what can we make of
 the relationships between its parts? The eye persistently attempts to
 read the left-hand side of the picture as a hollow space that allows us
 to see into the hemisphere of the box. But the presence of the audience
 in the gallery above therefore becomes inexplicable, a problem compounded
 by Sickert's abstraction and flattening of the vertical divider between
 the audience and the stage which here seems flush with the picture
 plane and parallel to it. Lower down, Sickert offsets the increasing
 clarity of this vertical element by juxtaposing it with an incoherent
 passage composed of fields of near-formless color. It is only when we
 reach the very bottom of the canvas that the vertical element fully
 crystallizes into the beaded frame of the mirror, at which point the
 spatial complexities of the painting at last become clear. In short,
 Sickert contrasts represented space with the flatness of the picture
 surface in order to confuse our perceptions of the events he depicts.

Recession, too, challenges our understanding.  In <I>The Sisters Lloyd</I>
(c. 1888-89, Government Art Collection), or <I>Little Dot</I>, our
perception of the backdrop has to be laboriously wrestled clear of the
perspective space. We are reminded that we cannot trust the surfaces of
appearance because of the inherent theatricality, and hence unreality,
of the performance depicted. Sickert also uses mirrors, backdrops and
other theatrical devices to draw our attention to the instability of
representation and appearance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 <I>The P. S. Wings in the O. P. Mirror</I> shows the performer in
 the off-prompt mirror reflected behind the watching audience, whose
 fascinated attention to the stage therefore appears to us at first
 misdirected (<A HREF="7.2peters_corbett_3.html"> 3</A>). We see
 the act of vision, of looking, of surrendered self-consciousness, as well
 as the performance which attracts it, but now the two are disjunctive
 and ill-matched. Appearance, analysis and display, the movements of
 the surface and of its meaning, come to us through Sickert's painting,
 confused and in an alienated relationship to each other. It is as if
 the lines of relationship which connect appearance with the meaning of
 events are disrupted and difficult to access. Surface is revealed as
 inadequate and deceptive. "Poetry and magic" arise from the gap between
 the surface appearance, the act of looking, and the reality of what is
 seen, as they are imaged in the commercial halls where the essence of
 modern experience is performed through the surface of entertainment.

This might be regarded as stage one of Sickert's argument in paint. In
paintings such as <I>Gatti's Hungerford Palace of Varieties: Second Turn
of Katie Lawrence</I>, Sickert advances his argument further through the
extended use of facture and depicted space to problematize visual meaning
(<A HREF="7.2peters_corbett_4.html"> 4</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 In <I>Gatti's</I>, Katie Lawrence is standing full square in front of
 a backdrop curtain which has an elaborate architectural space painted
 on it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 There is none of the overt spatial obscurity which dominates <I>Vesta
 Victoria</I>. Having set himself the challenge that this poses, Sickert
 manipulates perception and

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 298]</B>

space, surface and depth by exploiting the ambiguities that the backdrop
curtain suggests.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 As in <I>Little Dot</I> and <I>The Sisters Lloyd</I>, the <I>tromp
 l'oeil</I> effect of the backdrop confuses us.  It is difficult to
 decide whether what we are looking at is intended to represent real or
 painted depth. The backdrop is depicted in such a way that the areas
 between the columns at the 'sides' are to be imagined as mirrors.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 On the right, the distinction between the backdrop and the 'real'
 space is defined by the curtain (although this is only a darker maroon
 compared to the lighter maroon, plum and dark pink dominant in much
 of the backdrop, a similarity which itself suggests more confusion or
 blending of real and fictional spaces, perhaps even a confusion of
 identity). Although the pelmet of the curtain is visible across the
 whole of the top of the picture, it is much harder to make out what
 is happening on the left hand side. The backdrop appears to extend
 beyond the edge of the canvas, but this does not make visual sense as
 it becomes vertiginously difficult to disentangle real from fictional
 space. The thin strip of light color at the bottom of the backdrop
 marking the gap between it and the floor does not extend beyond the
 hats of the audience at the far left, so the final section lacks this
 key marker of difference. Immediately above the space on the left where
 this gap would be is a strictly illegible patch of paint in light and
 dark tan colors which has been simply scrubbed onto the surface of
 the canvas. This patch is strategically placed to allow the design of
 the backdrop to appear to be real space and to emphasize the effect of
 the perspective recession painted onto it. With this arrangement, it
 is almost impossible to read this left hand section of the backdrop as
 flat. Only the hint of the swag of the curtain at top left allows us, if
 we notice it, to key in the proper relationships of depth and reality. At
 the far right, above the round plate-shaped hat of the watching woman,
 there is another similar area of illegibility.  Although it doesn't
 have the same deliberately disturbing effect as that on the left,
 this area also disrupts expectations of clearly differentiated space.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sickert also used specialized painting techniques to extend this
confusion of reality and fictionality into other areas of the canvas. A
thin and watery application of yellow paint describing the low railings
across the front of the stage functions representatively rather than
mimetically. This application of yellow paint changes with the pressure
of the hand and the fullness of the brush. Such is the mark of this
medium: it cannot claim a direct transcription of the world but rather
asserts its physicality in constructing its account of the world. In a
similar spirit, some of the heads at bottom right of the painting are
outlined in a heavy black line. Sporadically across the surface (for
instance in the woman's hat and hair in the foreground) there are lines
of bright red paint which seem at first to be the remnants of lines
at right-angles to each other and resemble the painter's squaring up,
the network of gridlines used to accurately transfer the information
from preparatory drawings to the canvas. Some of the lines are tight
and appear to be ruled, others are blotted. This gives a random accent
to the surface which provides visual interest, but it is certain that
these grid lines were applied after the main stages of painting.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 They are visible even where the main body of the paint is wet on wet,
 and it's clear that in some areas the red paint has been brushed dry
 over dried wet on wet paint.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Again, the woman's hat was described using liquid

<B></B>

paint, and the thinly drawn red lines could only have been added
afterwards. Like the patches of illegibility which paint as a material
is allowed to describe at the two sides of the canvas, these dialectical
relationships of paint surface and descriptive technique function to
draw attention to the character of paint as a medium.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Paint in Sickert's music hall scenes is avowedly fictional, a
 medium of apprehension and understanding rather than a transparent
 transcription. It is precisely this fictionality, the metaphorical
 opacity of the medium, which is acknowledged through the literally
 opaque and declaratively material character of the paint itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These strategies draw attention to the paradoxes of the visual surfaces of
these scenes. A mere description of contemporary life will not do. Sickert
embarks upon an Impressionistic investigation that transcribes the
surface appearances of modern life, but he doesn't stop there. The
music hall becomes what W. J. T. Mitchell has called a "hypericon," or
an image that seeks to investigate "the act of picturing" or "imagine
the activity of imagination, re the practice of ration."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 The music hall serves as a workshop for Sickert's investigation of how
 painting renders meaning in relation to the desire for knowledge about
 the world. This investigation questions the access to reality which
 paint affords. By exploiting the paradoxes and ambiguities clustered
 within representations of the 'sordid' music halls of London, Sickert
 questions the feasibility of communicating a deep understanding of
 modernity in paint. The visual surface of the painted canvas is the
 tool he uses for this enquiry.

This relationship to the visual also accounts for the interest
so many of Sickert's music hall paintings and drawings take in the
audience. The various versions of <I>The Gallery of the Old Bedford</I>
(<A HREF="7.2peters_corbett_5.html"> 5</A>) or the 1906-1909
series--which includes <I>Noctes Ambrosianae</I>, <I>The Old Middlesex</I>
(c. 1906-1907, The Beaverbrook Art Gallery,

<B></B>

Fredericton, New Brunswick), with its bird's-eye view down onto the
spectators in the stalls, and the <I>Gai&eacute;t&eacute; Montparnasse</I>
(c. 1907, private collection), which takes the opposite viewpoint,
sharply upwards from the stalls into the gallery--all dwell on the
watching audience. In these works the loss of the self in the act of
spectatorship signals a direct involvement with the world, the absence of
mediation which Realism claimed for itself. The rapture of the audience
as they watch, craning, leaning and gawping down, suggests a complete
self-identification and involvement of the spectator with the spectacle
via the transparent medium of transcription. But the observation of the
audience in these works also allows Sickert to question and explore the
adequacy of that account of visuality.

In one of the climatic paintings of the Camden Town period, <I>The
Studio: Painting of a Nude</I>, Sickert foregrounds visuality as a
thematic concern (<A HREF="7.2peters_corbett_6.html"> 6</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 <I>The Studio</I> places the nude re which serves as the center of
 attention in the Camden Town series into a more complex spatial setting
 and introduces the explicit re of the painter observing his model
 in a mirror.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 The real and implied multiplication of images

<B></B>

of a passive nude re suggest that she functions solely as an object of
observation. The important action is the painter's translation of the nude
body into the medium of paint. Likewise, the rapture of spectatorship,
the loss and dissolution of the self in the parade of tawdry action on
the Music Hall stage can be brought back into the realm of comprehension
by the pressure of the analysis the painter brings to bear upon it. It
is the painter's vision which renders the nude and the audience, the
music hall and its performers, meaningful and exemplary of modernity and
reality. The music hall audience, like the nude, is itself the object of
observation in the painter's vision. The meaning of these events seems to
be that they <I>are</I> observed and therefore brought into the context
of knowledge. In both types of subject matter Sickert's painter's eye can
assess, discriminate, classify and analyze the shifting social practices
of modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The audience of rapt watchers stands for a complete identification of
the spectator with the thing observed the imagined abolition of the
medium of representation. But it is also the opportunity for Sickert to
create a conceptual laboratory which will allowed him to investigate that
situation and hence to assess the position of the painter as well as of
paint. The painter sees not only the world but also those who look at it;
he sees not only reality but its watchers, too. This serves to assert
Sickert's claims for the authority of the painter as the finest example
of the visual and its power, the purest vision, and the purest instance
of visuality at work. But the fictionality of the music hall performance
reminds us that the revelations offered to us by the visual (and hence
the painter) are in fact inadequate.  Sickert's play with mirrors and
his insistence on the contested nature of visual knowledge in painting
increase this effect and draw our attention to it. Thus the audience is
the image of the direct engagement with the world that visuality claims
it can deliver, but the location of this example is within circumstances
which are clearly fictional. The audience's rapture is provoked not by
immediate reality but by theatrical performance, a fiction which deceives
them and their fascinated observation. Depth frustrates surface here. The
artist's observation of the self-deception of the audience gives Sickert
the space he needs to consider the limitations of the claims of the
visual. The artist as observer still retains some authority, but the
presence of the audience implies a critique of visuality that suggests
that the artist, too, is compromised.

The drawing Sickert made of the drop curtain at the Gai&eacute;t&eacute;,
Montparnasse sometime between 1906-1907 displays this compromise in
a summary form (<A HREF="7.2peters_corbett_7.html"> 7</A>). The
curtain is, first of all, a surface; its smooth fall obscures the
arrangement or rearrangement of objects and events behind it. The
curtain here represents the flat surface of the canvas or paper. Like
those surfaces, it is marked and scored with a multiplicity of visual
and verbal signs. These signs are both representational in the sense
that they function as drawings and icons of the advertisements and
conventional in the sense that they are linear elements which divide
the screen into boxes and hence into discrete commercial spaces. But
the marks that describe the curtain and the signs for which it is the
material vehicle are identical to those that describe the surrounding
spaces in the drawing. This suggests that the semiotics of modernity
implied in this re of the curtain cannot be separated from the social
space where these meanings

<B></B>

are realized. Despite this paradox, Sickert's attention is firmly focused
on the curtain itself and the messages it flashes out at the audience
beneath it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here, Sickert thematizes the surface as a subject in its own right. In
Camden Town period paintings such as <I>The Studio: Painting of a
Nude</I>, the surface represents the imposition of meaning on the world by
the controlling mark of the painter's hand. Even the nugatory or trivial
can be become meaningful once a particular quality of attention is paid
to it by the central self of the painter who wields the brush or pencil
as an instrument of knowledge about and definition of the world. Sickert
used painting techniques to draw our attention to the overt presence of
the materiality of the paintwork such that the surface itself functions
as a sign of his authorial knowledge. The surface is the site where
that process of definition takes place. And here we have a surface on
which particular sorts of modern meaning are frankly declared. What is
thematized is therefore the process or fact of surface as meaning. The
sort of meaning it offers is, of course, another matter. The modernity
of the advertisements makes them also the <I>subject</I> of Sickert's
attention. They are what he understands and renders comprehensible
through the practice of his art. By the process of drawing them, the
advertisements become known, are brought into the orbit of comprehension,
but they also <I>become</I> that process. Their superficiality (in the
literal sense), flatness, reduction of the signs of meaning to a few
gestural formulations, suggests the problems attendant

<B></B>

on knowing the world through representation. What is happening here is
that Sickert's own practice, his own use of surface and materiality
to render modern life in a form of knowledge, is seen as inadequate,
as a reduction of the fullness of the world into a flattened surface,
into <I>representation</I>. What presents itself as informational, as
knowledge or as reportage about the world is revealed as discourse, as
invested or interested. The view of reality which the surface encapsulates
and promotes is a partial rather than a full account. It is compromised
and bound into the systems it seeks to explicate.

I have taken a rather different view of Sickert's music hall scenes than
that one might derive from a reading dependent on either the formalist or
the social-historical readings of modernism. In particular, I have argued
that Sickert's work at this period resists the charge one might muster
from a reading of Clark via Eliot. This work, in fact, is precisely
about the representation of English bourgeois modernity which Eliot
notes as the central issue in his discussion of Marie Lloyd. Clark sees
French depictions of the caf&eacute;s-concerts as involved in the lack
of 'an <I>imagery</I>' adequate to the representation of middle-class
experience. Sickert's work depends on a similar problematic absence of
representation and the concomitant need to bring it into existence to
clarify and describe the experience of modernity. But if Sickert attempts
to make use of the forms of working-class entertainment to image and
assuage a middle-class homelessness in modernity, then he also subjects
that project to critical attention. In undertaking this critical project,
Sickert makes use of paint, the visual itself as the principal means of
inquiry and criticism. I am not suggesting that this is better or worse
than the monuments of French modernism, simply different. In other words,
if we want to progress in the ambition to revise our understanding of
modernities outside the French experience then we need to tackle them
from within.

Two of the most sophisticated and developed attempts to do so, work
by defining Sickert as a wholly realist painter, unresponsive to the
mediating function of the painter; see Robert Ross, "The Stafford
Gallery: Paintings by Mr Walter Sickert," <I>Morning Post</I> (19 July
1911), and Roger Fry, "Mr Walter Sickert's Pictures at the Stafford
Gallery," <I>Nation</I> (8 July 1911), both of which were provoked by
a successful one-man show. For Fry, Sickert's "vision is curiously
detached . . . . Things for him have only their visual values, they
are not symbols, they contain no key to unlock the secrets of the heart
and spirit." For Ross, Sickert's subjects "must . . . satisfy a severe
aesthetic formula which admits nothing so artificial as poetry, nothing
so obvious as physical beauty, to disturb the functions of paint." The
point for both critics, is that Sickert is a creature of the visual only
and that his subject matter is accordingly inconsequential for him.

In a short essay on "Sickert's late work" in <I>Late Sickert</I>,
exhib. cat. (London: Arts Council, 1981), Helen Lessore described the
ways in which "one of the most striking characteristics of Sickert's
late pictures is the consistent treatment of the canvas as a surface,
with an all-over equality of tension between the flat shapes into which
it is divided, irrespective of what they represent" . She adduces
<I>Temple Bar</I> (c. 1941, private collection), which has some claim
to be the last picture Sickert ever painted, as evidence that "he did
also eventually notice that the grid of squares on the canvas itself in
some mysterious way contributed something to the painting" so that "he
actually re-painted the squaring-up lines after their original purpose
has been served." She comments, "part of the magic lay in seeming to
bring everything up to the surface" . This technique clearly has a
longer history in Sickert's oeuvre than Lessore remembered.

Perhaps, since the description and technique here is a mixture of wet on
wet and heavy black outline (that is, mixes Degas and Whistler), then
this, too, inscribing a broken grid pattern over wet on wet painting,
declares Sickert is using Degas as well as Whistler. See Wendy Baron's
comments on the impact of Degas on Sickert's technique in "Sickert's Links
with French Painting," 186-197. Baron argues that Sickert derived the
use of squaring up procedures, utterly alien to the technique of Whistler,
from Degas, 188-9; on Sickert's technical practice and squaring up
see the memoir by Clifford Hall, who was Sickert's pupil in the 1920s,

Fellini described in strikingly contrary terms his attempt in <I>La dolce
vita</I> to reconre plot or narrative construction as a work both of
deconstruction and recomposition: "We have to make a statue, break it,
and recompose the pieces. Or better yet, try a decomposition in the
manner of Picasso. The cinema is narrative in the nineteenth-century
sense: now let's try to do something different."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Indulging a taste for caricature and grotesquerie not unfamiliar to
 his Spanish precursor, Fellini makes <I>La dolce vita</I> a "Cubist"
 film by cultivating a disjointed narrative style at odds with the linear
 plots favored in classic Hollywood movies. We can reopen the question
 of the modernist status of this masterpiece by examining its paratactic
 narrative structure.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
T. J. Clark has recently proposed that one of the most important
manifestations of modernism has been the Italian cinema from the period
of Neorealism through the 1960s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Moreover, critics such as John Orr and Fredric Jameson have generally
 identified the period from the late 1950s through the 1960s as the
 heyday of the modernist or "neo-modernist" sensibility in sound film.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 In their view, Fellini's classic works <I>La dolce vita</I> and
 <I>8&amp;1/2</I> should qualify as exemplars of this sensibility,
 if only by virtue of the films' production and release dates. Yet
 Fellini's appropriation of the art-historical qualifier "Cubist" ought
 to alert us to the paradoxical nature of his aspiration. For if the
 critical periodization is correct, the development of a viable modernist
 vocabulary in sound film coincides historically with the abandonment
 of modernist aesthetics in other fields. Because modernism emerges
 belatedly in sound films, the director-auteur must struggle with the
 contradiction inherent in the attempt to

<B></B>

renew the modernist language game at a moment when its basic res and
tropes have been eviscerated by literature and the visual arts. Fellini's
awareness of this dilemma helps to explain the melancholic pathos of
<I>La dolce vita</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this essay, I will approach the film as both an exposition and an
instance of the exhausted modernist aesthetic prevalent in Italy at
the moment of the "economic boom." In this film Fellini revisits the
canonical topoi of modernism in order to stage allegorical scenes that
bid farewell to such topics. Accordingly, my discussion will focus on
unrealized episodes from the screenplay which I believe reflect Fellini's
fixation with the re of the modernist intellectual. In addition,
I hope to suggest how the modernism exemplified in <I>La dolce vita</I>
compares to the modernisms of other artistic media from painting to music
to architecture. We might want to observe, for example, that Nino Rota's
celebrated theme music for the movie is a near-plagiarism of Kurt Weill's
"Mack the Knife."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 An auteur such as Antonioni might seem more committed to the exploration
 of modernism, given his celebrated cinematic appropriation of the
 visual techniques of abstract painting and the narrative techniques
 of the nouveau roman. However, in the 1960s Fellini's oeuvre became
 more self-reflexive, ironic, and fragmentary in style in comparison
 to the luminous phenomenological explorations of <I>La strada</I>,
 <I>Il bidone,</I> and <I>Le notti di Cabiria</I> in the 1950s. By
 turning away from a realist cinematic vocabulary, Fellini's films of
 the 1960s sponsored a powerful mythologization of modern urban life,
 a mythologization that does not rule out a dramatic awareness of the
 obsolescence of the modern Zeitgeist.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In <I>La dolce vita</I> we encounter an array of slippery concepts such
as modernism, neo-modernism, and postmodernism, concepts that become
even more ambiguous when applied to cinema.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Studies of the relationship between cinema and modernism customarily
 begin with an examination of the masterpieces of the silent cinema
 directed by Murnau, Lang, and Eisenstein. The silent era is regarded as
 an "age d'or" insofar as the early cinema emerges as a modernist idiom
 in synchronicity with the other arts, an idiom that would influence the
 development of new literary techniques during the 1920s and 1930s in the
 work of writers such as Joyce, Eliot, and Dos Passos. According to John
 Orr, the relationship between cinema and modernity is paradoxical: "In
 the cinema the modern is already history. But it has never been replaced"
 (<I>Cinema</I>, 1). Orr argues that "one can really speak of two 'modern'
 cinemas," meaning the silent films of the first decades of the twentieth
 century and the sound films of the 1960s and early 1970s, both of which
 in his opinion exemplify "a cinema of the reflexive will-to-power" as
 they "constantly speculate upon the power of the camera itself" (2, 6).

Film then occupies a paradoxical position within cultural modernity,
dealing it a deathblow in the very instant that it brings its most
intimate aesthetic potentialities to birth. For though as a medium it
is founded upon Modernist "shock" experience within the metropolis,
it leaps almost at once both behind and beyond Modernism, allowing only
the briefest moment for the classic silent directors to actualize its
"inherent" experimental

<B></B>

potentialities. . . . But in another sense, as it moves into its own
new technological phases of sound and colour, film takes a backward
somersault behind Modernism, reinventing the latter's own realist past
so thoroughly in the Hollywood domination of the medium that after the
Second World War a new brand of auteur Modernism has to seek all over
again to return film "to itself," to drag it back into that twentieth
century whose very epitome it once was.

Offering itself as the ultimate modernist signifier, cinema revives
modernism at the very moment of its exhaustion. <I>La dolce vita</I>
represents a magisterial attempt on Fellini's part to reinvent the
modernist cultural sensibility in the terms of 1960s European cinema. And
yet Fellini's phenomenology of spectacularization and media hysteria also
provides one of the first holistic readings of the symptoms of modernism's
demise in contemporary culture. Frank Burke aptly characterizes the film's
spirit when he remarks that <I>La dolce vita</I> presaged postmodernity
"not because of any authorial intent but because the film was exploring
a contemporary world verging on postmodernity."

The phrase <I>la dolce vita</I> would seem to allude to the spell of
relative prosperity achieved in Italy during the 1960s when economic
growth and a relative political stability seemed to inaugurate a new
historical phase after the ravages of World War II. We might ask if
<I>La dolce vita</I> is meant merely to connote an innocuous stereotype
about an Italian lifestyle during the economic boom. Or does the phrase
also carry an ironic, critical significance, slyly propounding a logical
equivalence between "sweetness" and decadence? We should not forget that
the working title first proposed by Fellini for the film was <I>Babylon,
Two Thousand Years After Christ</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 <I>Babylon</I> suggests the hedonism of an international social
 order where globalization is strictly a function of the expansion
 of capital markets. The final draft of the film's title, however,
 is no less evocative or suggestive than the rather overdetermined
 symbolism of the first. We might construe the adjective <I>dolce</I>
 as connoting a sort of Kunderian unbearable lightness of being or a
 Calvinian postmodern comic lightness. The term might even be felt to
 anticipate the later ascendancy of "weak thought," Gianni Vattimo's
 sweet mode of post-metaphysical philosophy which affirms the principle
 that, as Nietzsche would have said approvingly, there are neither
 facts nor truths, only interpretations. More pointedly, however,
 the adjective controverts <I>a posteriori</I> the sublime character
 ascribed by critics such as Lyotard and Jameson to most modernist and
 avant-garde art. In this sense the title phrase thus signals a waning
 of the modernist outlook, including but not limited to its consumerist
 domestication and its populist familiarization.

Written in a collaboration between Fellini, Tullio Pinelli, and Ennio
Flaiano, <I>La dolce vita</I> remains one of the most incisive analyses
of the vulgarity and corruption of the Italian political economy of the
1960s. The film's organization in the form of a prologue, eight extended
episodes, and two interludes allows Fellini to stage a drama of digression
and eventual withdrawal from an increasingly distant modernist world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 If, as Zavattini asserts, neorealism developed as the art of the
 encounter, an art that places emphasis on the element of chance inherent
 in any random <I>rencontre</I>, Fellini by way of contrast, perfects
 in <I>La dolce vita</I> a cinematic art of love at last sight. And he
 maintains this mode of perception throughout the film.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the first episodes revolves around Marcello and Maddalena's
impromptu "pick-up" of a Roman prostitute and the use of her apartment
bedroom for farcical and perfunctory lovemaking. Before Fellini's
camera follows Marcello and Maddalena on their nocturnal escapade,
the sequence starts in a Roman nightclub where a Javanese dance
troupe entertains a wealthy and star-studded crowd. The iconography
of the sequence rehabilitates familiar themes of French Impressionist
painting, combining the visual motifs of primitivist art, haute couture,
the decadence of the aristocracy, and prostitution. When the couple
leave the prostitute behind at dawn like an abandoned clich&eacute;,
the film performs the first of many allegorical adieux that punctuate
the narrative. This valedictory gaze will also be bestowed upon Steiner,
the movie's modernist intellectual rehead; upon Marcello's father;
and, in the end, upon Paola, the pseudo-epiphanic girl on the beach.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The paratactic narrative structure of <I>La dolce vita</I> thus transforms
every segment into a memorial tableau, the representative value of
which is enhanced by the looseness of the plot connections, as if the
disjunction between episodes threw each one into higher symbolic relief.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 This shoring of fragments recalls the archetypal plot structure of
 modernist fictions from Eliot's <I>The Waste Land</I> to Joyce's
 <I>Ulysses</I>. Arguing for a connection between this sense of
 "decomposition" and the repertory of Christian images in the movie,
 Robert Richardson finds a resemblance between <I>La dolce vita</I> and
 <I>The Waste Land</I> based not only on their common episodic structure,
 but also on a common ethical attitude: "Both the film and the poem are
 twentieth-century versions of Ecclesiastes, visions of the hollowness
 of contemporary life. . . . Both <I>The Waste Land</I> and <I>La dolce
 vita</I> tell a modern story, or better, they reveal modern conditions
 against an older and supposedly richer background."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though Eliot and Fellini both seem to "tell a modern story," I would
argue that Baudelaire provides a more pertinent model for Fellini than
does Eliot's poetry. Just as Baudelaire's work is positioned on the
border between romanticism and modernity, Fellini's magnum opus defines
the imaginary limit between modernity and postmodernity. Both artists
shared an inclination towards "decadence" as the grounds or root of their
work. Of course, as Pier Paolo Pasolini rightly observes, Fellini's case
is rather one of a "neodecadent" acheivement, a cinematic revival of
an earlier, fin de si&egrave;cle mentality: "For my part, I declare to
the four winds that Fellini's work signals and formalizes the vigorous
return of a taste and of a stylistic ideology which have characterized
the European literature of decadence." Pasolini is quick to recognize,
however, that Fellini's neodecadent stylistic signature develops, like
that of the great Italian modernist author, Carlo Emilio Gadda, in the
direction of sheer pastiche, of an altogether "subjective, grotesque,
violent, visceral, and distorting" experimentalism.

<I>La dolce vita</I> might well be retitled <I>The Spleen of Rome</I>,
and Marcello, the film's brooding protagonist, would represent the last
of the urban fl&acirc;neurs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 As if to achieve the photovisual equivalent of Baudelaire's description
 of Parisian streetlife during the Haussmann era, Fellini portrays
 Marcello as a kind of voyeuristic fl&acirc;neur who takes "an immense
 joy to set up house in the heart of the multitude, amid the ebb and
 flow of movement, in the midst of the fugitive and the infinite."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 The Italian director shares

<B></B>

with the French poet a strong urge to mythologize and allegorize the
social conditions of the modern city. In both cases, the result is a
transformation of the immediate moment into a "m&eacute;moire du present,"
to use Paul de Man's formulation. (As an example of this effect, we
might think of the scene where Marcello and Sylvia wade in the Fontana
di Trevi). Such a memory ought "to extract from fashion whatever element
it may contain of poetry within history, to distil the eternal from
the transitory."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Of course, Baudelaire's aspiration towards the melodramatic sublime is
 replaced in Fellini's films of the 1960s with a more satirical vision of
 the sweetness of fulfilled capitalism. However, the two artists have in
 common important affinities, such as their sensitivity to boredom and
 a delight in fashion. The latter enthusiasm is given greater urgency
 because they are alert to the transience of certain cultural paradigms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Accordingly, I would like to pay particular attention to the film's "air
de famille" with the modern and the modernist imagination, downplaying
the relevance of certain traditional references to writers such as
Dante. Critics as diverse as Adams Sitney, Barbara Lewalski, and Anne
Paolucci have advanced readings of the film as an allegorical pastiche
of Dante's <I>Commedia</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 According to this perspective, the movie's inaugural image of a statue
 of Christ being flown across Rome by helicopter encodes a dire Catholic
 warning. No less ominously, the enigmatic fish that appears on the beach
 at the conclusion of the movie symbolizes Dante's Satan. Steiner is
 interpreted as a kind of parodic analogue of Virgil, and the mysterious
 girl at the beach symbolizes either Beatrice (Lewalski) or Matelda,
 the iconic re of sexual innocence encountered by the pilgrim at
 the summit of Purgatory (Sitney, Paolucci).
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Reading <I>La dolce vita</I> as a kind of Dantesque roman &agrave;
 clef runs counter to the testimony of Fellini himself, however. After
 the movie opened he often asserted that it was not his intention to
 provide a moralistic depiction of Italian society. As the director
 put it during a talk at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia,
 his aim was to film a trial as seen not by a judge but by an accomplice.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Indeed, the morally fluid and anti-metaphysical attitude of <I>La dolce
 vita</I> is inconsistent with the theological and teleological structure
 of the <I>Commedia</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Remarkably few critics have recognized the greater relevance of modernist
sources to Fellini's undertaking in the film. The movie's celebrated
prologue, in which Marcello and his journalistic sidekick Paparazzo
ride in a helicopter convoy that is air-lifting a statue of Christ to
the Vatican, is exemplary on this score.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 The exuberant aerial tracking shots of the lead helicopter hauling its
 freight through the sky over Rome suggest, if anything, the ascendancy of
 human technology over the religious, rather than any portentous return
 of spirituality. And in its most absurd, celebratory interpretation of
 science as a new religion, the film seems to position itself as the
 latest addition to a cultural genealogy that includes poems such as
 Marinetti's "The Pope's Monoplane" and Apollinaire's "Zone"--the latter
 of which refers to "le Christ qui monte au ciel mieux que les aviateurs
 [Christ who ascends to heaven better than aviators]."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 We might say that Fellini uses the avant-garde gesture of contaminating
 religion with science, thereby laying claim to the title of a
 late-modernist auteur, the Picasso of cinema. This gesture also
 establishes the movie's historically irreverent tone with the proper

<B></B>

sprezzatura or "appearance of bravery."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the same time, the prologue establishes the complicity of modern
technology with the consumerist mass-media. The early modernist enthusiasm
for technology is tempered by a more critical view of the symbiosis
between telecommunications and journalism, a link symptomatic of a
culture already on on the verge of postmodernity. The film's insistence
on the interdependence of photography and the cult of celebrity and its
final revelation of Marcello's professional fate as the public-relations
agent of a second-rate actor also contribute to the impression that we are
watching the modernist ideal nearing a dead-end. Notwithstanding the loose
formal structure of the film, its renunciation of a synthetic point of
view and indulgence in an apparently aimless visual r&ecirc;verie, <I>La
dolce vita</I> does provide a logical center. In order to dramatize the
plight of the high modernist sensibility, Fellini needs the stern modern
intellectual to play the foil to the film's population of metaphysically
"weak" journalists and photographers. He assigns this function to Steiner,
who is Marcello's friend, mentor, and modernist role model. The Steiner
segment represents a blind spot in the film's oblique narrative or, as
Lacan would put it, the "point de capiton" of the imaginary and symbolic
threads of <I>La dolce vita</I>.

The Still Life of the Modernist Intellectual: Steiner
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fellini's ideas for <I>La dolce vita</I> evolved from an abandoned
earlier project, <I>Moraldo in citt&agrave;</I>. The latter was to be a
continuation of <I>I Vitelloni</I>, the director's portrait of a group
of idle, provincial men of the 1950s. <I>Moraldo in citt&agrave;</I>
would have recounted the story of one of these men as he moved to Rome to
establish himself in the capital. Fellini eventually decided, however,
that it would be more interesting to encounter Moraldo-Marcello years
after his original resettlement and to dramatize his confrontation with an
altogether different series of existential events. Given this important
reconceptualization of the project, it is interesting to note that one
crucial element of the screenplay of <I>Moraldo in citt&agrave;</I>
which Fellini retains in <I>La dolce vita</I> is the re of Steiner.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The film's producer, De Laurentis, begged the director unsuccessfully
to eliminate the grim episodes depicting Steiner murdering his children
and his suicide. Another producer, Angelo Rizzoli, was also unhappy with
this segment, a mean "divertissement" that he believed to be authored by
Flaiano, the caustic Italian writer who was co-author of the screenplay
for <I>La dolce vita</I> (Kezich, <I>Fellini</I>, 274-276). However,
as Kezich argues, and as Fellini's insistence on retaining the character
affirms, Steiner, the re of high-mindedness, is the logical pole
of the film . If Steiner epitomizes the fate of the modernist
intellectual in a society increasingly suspicious of notions such as
difficulty and purity, it is hardly surprising that his first appearance
in the film occurs in a church where he has gone to pursue his research.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While shadowing a beautiful woman, Marcello enters a church that,
incongruously for Rome, is designed in a high-modernist architectural
style. Once inside, he happens to meet Steiner, who engages him in
amiably didactic small talk. In search of a Sanskrit grammar, Steiner
indicates his happiness at encountering Marcello, who appears in

<B></B>

turn eager to be instructed by his older and more serious friend. Marcello
sheepishly pretends to be gathering some material for an upcoming book,
while Steiner unconvincingly feigns enthusiasm for the banal columns
that Marcello has been publishing in the tabloids. Yet Steiner himself
exhibits from the outset all the daring of a sterile imagination. Asked
to play the organ or, as he pompously puts it, to elicit the "mysterious
voices coming from the earth," he settles for the most well-known,
not to say hackneyed, of Bach's fugues (the D minor), after a joking,
momentary flirtation with jazz. Marcello's devotion to his friend
seems misplaced in its blindness to Steiner's disturbingly alienated
state. Indeed, the older man's dramatic function seems far closer to
that of a Pirandellian author sought after by his lost characters than
as a Virgil guiding Marcello's Dante, as some critics have suggested. The
Pirandellian strains of Fellini's <I>8&amp;1/2</I> have been acknowledged
most often, but as Manuela Gieri further contends their presence can be
felt throughout his entire oeuvre.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Remarkably, throughout the development of the Steiner subplot, we
never learn Steiner's occupation or profession. Is he a writer,
a critic, perhaps an editor? His generically cerebral character
supplies nothing more than a token of the high modernist intellectual
as such. Paradoxically, as the movie advances, this token accumulates
a more allegorical valence on account of, rather than in spite of, its
generality. It must be noted that Fellini wanted to cast the great Italian
writer, Elio Vittorini, in the role of Steiner, but Vittorini declined.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 As a representative of a stereotypically cryptic, "high" modernist, a
 kind of secular priest of the intellect (who is perhaps most at home in
 high-modernist churches), Steiner is hopelessly out of step with society.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This point is made in a subsequent scene during a soir&eacute;e set in
Steiner's apartment. Steiner hosts a gathering of his cosmopolitan,
artistically-inclined friends, a party to which he has invited
Marcello and his unhappy girlfriend, Emma. Different speakers by
turns deliver epigrammatic pronouncements on various subjects, but the
overall impression is one of tiresome clich&eacute;. (Interestingly,
Fellini took pains to cast real intellectuals and artists as members
of Steiner's coterie, among others the writer Leonida Rapaci, the
painter Anna Salvatore, Letizia Spadini, and the poets Iris Tree and
Desmond O'Grady). A few moments later, Marcello notices a painting on
the wall by that exemplary Italian modernist painter, Giorgio Morandi,
and expresses his admiration to Steiner, who replies that Morandi is the
artist he loves most on account of the painter's clarity and precision:
". . . Such power, precision and rigor. You could say art has left
nothing to chance." Immersed in a metaphysical luminosity, Morandi's
bottles come to stand for the ultimate modernist objects--difficult and
yet clean and auratic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fellini's choice of subject for his commentary on the decline of
modernist culture was not arbitrary. Morandi's career might be said to
recapitulate that of high modernism in painting. From an initial devotion
to C&eacute;zanne and Cubism, the Italian painter developed his own,
original variant of De Chirico's <I>pittura metafisica</I> by insisting
on an abstract ativeness that was akin in spirit to minimalism and
conceptual art. Gaining recognition after World War II, he was praised for
demythologizing De Chirico's metaphysical vocabulary in favor of objects
that reveal a metaphorical value through the conditions of light, time,
and space.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 We could say that in this sense Morandi is

<B></B>

the painter par excellence of aura. The picture in Steiner's apartment
represents the type of art that even Marcello can embrace without
qualms. In his words, it is an art that is clear, neat, without rhetoric
or lies, that does not flatter (<I>non adulatrice</I>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We should note that Pasolini, another important Italian filmmaker
contemporary to Fellini, inserted an homage to Morandi in his first major
work. In <I>Accatone</I>, the title character pays a visit to Stella,
who is washing a series of bottles in a scene overtly reminiscent of
the glassware in a Morandi painting. Rather than photographing an actual
painting and interpreting it through a character's sententious commentary,
Pasolini achieves a much more subtle and poetic evocation of Morandi's
art. Bringing the bottles to cinematic life, Pasolini asserts their deeply
felt emotional presence and the poetic significance of Morandi's still
life. As if to resuscitate the bottles like so many miniature Lazaruses,
the camera defeats the stillness of the still life. The deathliness of
what the French and Italians would call <I>nature morte</I> is defeated
in a feat of almost evangelical transumption. The more conventional,
prosaic, affectless quotation of Morandi in Fellini's film indicates
the director's deep skepticism toward the possibility of renewing the
authority of a drained modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We might conclude that this cultural and intellectual society ought to
fall subject to a hermeneutic of suspicion even before the turning point
in the film of Steiner's suicide. Marcello, after all, is a spiritual
fl&acirc;neur, floating with ease and charm through his encounters with
different people and ideas. Despite the levity that he and some of the
other guests contribute to the occasion, however, the soir&eacute;e is
disred by the recurring appearance of an ominous sign. A distracting
beam of light repeatedly flashes through the living-room window, an
insistent, mechanical signal from the outside world that the sheltered
world within is soon going to come to an end.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The discomfort is increased by Steiner's idle entertainment of his
friends with a tape recorder. When an American poet describes Steiner
as being as tall as a Gothic steeple, another amused guest records
her words and repeatedly replays the sentence on tape. The repetition
quickly drains the conceit of any charm, revealing it as clumsy bombast,
despite Steiner's humble and polite protests against what he apparently
regards as undeserved praise.

The simile likening Steiner to a Gothic steeple is powerfully resonant
of one of the chief res of modernism, namely, Proust. For Proust,
a Gothic cathedral was the most apt metaphor for the construction of an
inspiring novel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Here, the Gothic no longer stands for the ambitious, spiritual
 arrogance of the heroic modernist enterprise; instead, it has become
 a banality. The tape continues and reveals Steiner's recording of a
 series of natural noises, from thunder to the whistling of wind to
 birdsong. The artificial amplification and isolation of the sounds
 suggests an experience of nature not as a benign or harmonious
 referential system, but as a simulacrum divorced from any

<B></B>

context. Following Marcello and Steiner's discussion of Morandi's
painting, the inclusion of the tape recorder in the scene appears to
enact a kind of Benjaminian pessimism regarding the hieratic value of
the artwork in an age of mechanical reproduction.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Steiner later enters his children's bedroom to examine the youngsters
in their sleep, his paternal scrutiny seems cold and <I>unheimlich</I>--as
clinical as his mechanical recording of the natural world. Another
modernist "fauve" painting in the form of a portrait of Christ by Roualt
hangs on the wall in the background. Given this ominous tableau, it
becomes difficult to take at face value Marcello's claim that he wishes
to visit the Steiner household more often, as it provides refuge. Rather
than living "in the harmony of the successful work of art" as Steiner
had encouraged him to do, Marcello will succumb to his usual ambivalence
before ever setting out on a new path. After Steiner kills his children
and commits suicide, Marcello's existential indecision will become an
insurmountable psychological impasse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If, as Walter Benjamin declared, modernism must be viewed under the sign
of suicide, then <I>La dolce vita</I> provides an image of the ultimate,
allegorical suicide in Steiner.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 When Marcello arrives at the grisly scene and discovers what has
 happened, he seems for once genuinely stricken and distraught. Reaching
 his friend's apartment in the EUR section of Rome, he looks at Steiner's
 corpse seated in an armchair and at the children who lie dead in their
 beds. "I do not know anything, I really do not know anything," Marcello
 numbly repeats to the investigators. On the wrenching evidence of
 this moment, we might conclude that Marcello is formulating a negative
 "phenomenology of the spirit" insofar as his rational self-awareness
 seems to diminish as he nears the unconscious mentality of the movie's
 climactic orgy, a virtual mise en sc&egrave;ne of the death of the
 subject (Benjamin, "Paris," 99-103). Fredric Jameson in fact has
 even proposed that, in contrast to the films of Antonioni and Bergman,
 <I>La dolce vita</I> might be regarded as "postmodern" by virtue of
 its deconstructed subject.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 When Steiner's wife arrives at the apartment building, a mob of
 photojournalists awaits her on the street to snap her picture at
 the moment she learns of her husband's act. "Do you think I am an
 actress?" she asks in puzzled amusement before the reason for her
 sudden celebrity has been explained to her. The private nature of her
 trauma will be exploited for public consumption as the flashbulbs of
 the photographers pursue her without pity or remorse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The reiteration of key visual elements from the party sequence in the
discovery of the dead bodies--the image of Steiner seated in the living
room, the children lying in their beds--casts a withering light on the
existential course imagined for Marcello by Emma, when she remarks in
the earlier party scene that they, too, will one day live in a house
like Steiner's. Underscoring the point through Emma's suggestion, the
film raises the possibility that Steiner in some sense commits suicide
in Marcello's place. The modernist temptation to cast as heroic the act
of self-annihilation is dismissed by eliminating a secondary character,
as it will be through sheer parody in <I>8&amp;1/2</I>. When Guido Anselmi
crawls under a table to shoot himself during a press conference gone awry,
Fellini performs a mock gesture that constitutes a necessary prelude to
the achievement of the ecumenical, happy ending of <I>8&amp;1/2</I>.

After much struggle, Fellini chose not to shoot two episodes included

particularly telling. A few days after the accidental death of another
friend, Marcello visits a writer, Dolores, who lives in a tower by the sea
(and in whose role Fellini wanted to cast the actress Louise Rainer). He
discovers with Delores what he feels is a new capacity for sympathy and
understanding in an unusual relationship for him, to which he repeatedly
returns despite various interruptions. However, when Dolores at last
fully enunciates her opinion of Marcello, both as a writer and a man,

<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 The omission of this episode from the finished film might be explained
 in various ways, but the chief suggestion I wish to make is that it is
 omitted because it is redundant. We already have observed Steiner's
 function in the narrative as a kind of substitute for Marcello's
 potential suicide. A more analytic or nuanced representation of the
 defeat of his residual intellectual ambition would have been superfluous,
 particularly given the film's interest in mapping the new cultural and
 intellectual territory that lies beyond modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The ivory tower, that most clich&eacute;d icon of high modernism, already
had crumbled. Fellini leaves the viewer of the finished movie instead
with the tower of Babel. In the final cut of <I>La dolce vita</I>, the
episode involving Dolores is replaced by a briefer, more playful interlude
that almost casually prepares the viewer for the film's stunningly bleak
conclusion. Alone at the beach, in search of inspiration for his book,
Marcello is distracted by the appearance of a young girl, whose graceful
persona reminds him of a painted fresco of an "Umbrian angel." She
is listening to "Patricia," a popular hit song, at high volume. After
momentary irritation at the intrusion, Marcello gives up and lets her
turn the music up full blast. The loud, mindless pop tune and his rapid
acquiescence to its assault dramatizes his lack of commitment to the
demanding vocation of art.

Modernist Architecture and its Discontents

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to John Orr, one of the chief legacies that high modernism
leaves to the late or "neo"-modern is its architecture (<I>Cinema</I>,
14). In one sense, the star of <I>La</I> 

<B></B>

<I>dolce vita</I> is Rome itself in all its "stupendous fragmentariness,"
to borrow George Eliot's apt characterization of the city.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Of the Eternal City's multitudinous strata of construction, it is the
 modernist layer that is assigned the most threatening role in the film. A
 useful contrast may be drawn between Fellini's use of architecture
 and painting in the film. The camera approaches Morandi's bottles,
 as it were, with an implicitly competitive attitude and a sure faith
 that cinema will have the last word. In contrast, architecture exposes
 more fully than painting does the terminally formulaic condition of
 modernism in the 1960s and presents itself as the symbolic tombstone of
 this ideology. This is because, in the Italian socio-historical context,
 modernist architecture not only reveals a strong link to fascism, but
 during the period of the economic boom embodies a pathological, manic
 drive to financial speculation. No less starkly than in an Antonioni
 film, modernist architecture in <I>La dolce vita</I> furnishes
 the setting of every threatened or actual death scene--from Emma's
 attempted suicide, to the heart attack suffered by Marcello's father,
 to Steiner's murder-suicide.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fellini first establishes a strong visual association between modernism
and death when Marcello drives Emma to the hospital after her attempt
to kill herself. The director shoots the interior of the hospital
with an emphasis on the abstract, ascetic, modernist qualities of the
building, an edifice that, like Steiner's residence, is located in the
EUR. Languid tracking shots frame Marcello and direct our attention to
the cold, empty spaces of the hallways and rooms. The cinematography
is awash in white light, lending itself to an effect that is strikingly
distinct from the visual style of the rest of the film. The hallucinatory
sequence in the hospital seems to belong to movies such as Antonioni's
<I>The Eclipse</I> or Welles's <I>The Trial</I> or Bertolucci's <I>The
Conformist</I>. Marcello and Emma's barren-looking apartment is a
nightmarish version of a Corbusian "machine" for habitation and also
belongs to the EUR.  Fellini presents it as colorless, sterile, and
almost empty of furniture save for a bed. It is in this district which
was to have been the centerpiece of Mussolini's planned urban renewal
of Rome that we also find the severe modernist church in which Marcello
first meets Steiner, as well as Steiner's elegant flat where the film's
most brutal acts of violence take place.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>La dolce vita</I> implies a degree of political awareness insofar as
it observes both Rome's problematic status as a model for the modern city
and the connection of this problem to Fascism. At a congress on urban
development in 1937, the Fascists anointed Rome the modern capital not
only of the Italian nation and Catholic Christianity but of the entire
world. The "Esposizione Universale" of the Rome of 1942 which gave the
precinct its acronym was supposed to establish Rome as the exemplar
of the ideal modern city. Numerous Italian architects took part in an
architectural contest during the years 1937-1938 to develop the
district that came to be referred to as the EUR and was then known as
"E42." The contest was held under the supervision of the architect
Piacentini, who proposed to uphold the crucially nebulous values of the
rational, the modern, the Mediterranean, and the classic. Unsurprisingly,
the different projects were gradually modified in the direction of the
classical through insistence on certain materials such as marble and
granite, on elements such as the column and the arch, and on Pythagorean
proportions and mirrored symmetries. On this score, we

<B></B>

might view the "Palazzo della Civilt&agrave; Italiana"--otherwise known
as the "squared coliseum"--by Giovanni Guerrini, Ernesto La Padula,
and Mario Romano as representative.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The building is distinguished by its forbidding, decorative arches
 and, perhaps on account of this eerie mixture of luxury and menace,
 appears in a number of Fellini's films from <I>Nights of Cabiria</I>
 to <I>Ginger and Fred</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fellini was fascinated with what Brunello Rondi has labeled the
"science-fiction" style of architecture that prevails in the EUR.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 This fascination coexists with an anxious sense of alienation, a deeply
 Baudelairean melancholy that arises from witnessing the rapidly changing
 physiognomy of the modern city:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Baudelaire, Fellini reads allegorical significance into the
historical transformation of his surroundings in order to counteract
the <I>horror vacui</I> of modernist urban planning. The very existence
of the EUR elicits a feeling of cultural and spatial dislocation from
which Marcello may prove incapable of recovering. Without a Hausmann-like
visionary to reorganize the city plan, Rome bears only sporadic traces
of modernity's influence. If sites such as the Via Veneto, the Caracalla
baths, the Fontana di Trevi, and the sixteenth-century Odelscalchi castle
at Bassano di Sutri provide the film with a complement of opulent,
one-of-a-kind, theatrical settings for sustained visual reveries, the
modern suburbs of Rome represent the "wake-up call" of a mass-produced
reality where life cannot be sweet. The episode involving Marcello's
night on the town with his father dramatically encapsulates the film's
sobering historical outlook. After a boisterous evening of dancing and
drinking at the Kit-Kat club, Marcello's father accompanies the dancer
Fanny to her apartment in the city's industrialized outskirts. Once he
arrives at the city's modern, dehumanized periphery, he suffers a heart
attack that cuts short the festivities and forces him to exchange hasty
and fumbling good-byes with Marcello.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The architectural settings of the film's scenes appear to
alternate between two different styles: that of a benign, dream-like
<I>anciennet&eacute;</I> associated with the pleasure principle and
that of a grim, functionalist modernity associated with the reality
principle. Fellini's oscillation between these modes brackets the older
type like a quotation, a suspended fragment of the past that achieves by
virtue of its rootedness in human history and memory a mythic, archetypal
resonance. Assuming what appears at first glance to be a contrary stance
in his essay "The Return of the Fl&acirc;neur," Walter Benjamin expresses
perplexity that the modernist imagination has seized upon Paris rather
than Rome as the city par excellence of fl&acirc;nerie:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The fl&acirc;neur is the creation of Paris. The wonder is that it was
not Rome. But perhaps in Rome even dreaming is forced to move along
streets that are too well paved. And isn't the city too full of temples,
enclosed squares, and national shrines to be able to enter undivided

<B></B>

 into the dreams of the passer-by along with every paving stone, every
 shop sign, every flight of steps, and every gateway. . . .
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet it is precisely Rome's historical overdeterminacy, so eloquently
captured by Benjamin, that in Fellini's mind gives the city its undeniable
allegorical value. By looking at the symbolically saturated, "unconscious"
strata of Roman antiquity from the conscious, realist standpoint of
modernism, the director finds a consoling alternative to the brutal,
industrialized hypercapitalism of the latter twentieth century. In certain
respects, Fellini may be said to recapitulate Freud's view of Rome in
<I>Civilization and its Discontents</I>, where he treats the Eternal City
and its buried ruins as a psychical entity with a long and copious past,
a material representation of the various layers of mental life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Like Freud, Fellini appears to privilege the past in <I>La dolce
 vita</I>. He contrasts the archaic, baroque regions of Rome, where the
 circulation of the streets replicates the exhilarating freedom of a
 primary process of the unconscious, to the palpable discontent of modern
 civilization, where the secondary mechanisms of conscious thought are
 denied the relief of condensation and displacement. If modernism finds
 in Paris its paradigmatic city, it perhaps encounters in Fellini's
 Rome its nemesis and corrective, a prelude to the double-coding of
 postmodern aesthetics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After the extreme shock delivered by Steiner's suicide, Marcello seems
on the verge of a momentous decision, perhaps even of a conversion to
the <I>dolce vita</I> of the title and a renunciation of his previous
ambitions. We see him in the movie's final episode presiding over an
increasingly debauched party in Fregene as a sort of impromptu master
of ceremonies. The orgy sequence achieves with satiric brio what Jean
Baudrillard would call the transformation of the "scene" into the
obscene. Bauman helpfully elucidates this dichotomy: "The world is no
longer a 'scene' (a plane where the play is staged which, as we have
the right to suspect, will be directed towards some concrete ending,
even if we do not know in advance what it is); instead it is obscene: a
lot of noise and bustle without plot, scenario, director, and direction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 The party appears to celebrate simultaneously the annulment of a
 friend's marriage and Marcello's new job as a publicity agent for
 movie actors. Accordingly, he reminds the guests with revealing lack
 of specificity that the party marks the annulment of "everything."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The ensuing revelry represents a transvaluation of all values initiated
by a couple of transvestites dancing to "Jingle Bells." The party grows
progressively duller following a striptease that only momentarily
assuages the participants' restlessness. Marcello, the nominal
"intellectual" of the group, promises to produce thousands of ideas for
further performance, but is too pathetically drunk to articulate any of
them. As he formulates his <I>raccour&ccedil;i</I> of late capitalist
logic with respect to publicity, excess, and celebrity, the meaningless
chatter and sexual titillation escalate toward a tired finale, during
which Marcello sadistically humiliates a young girl from the provinces
by riding and whipping her like a mule. This final sequence is crucial
to understanding the

<B></B>

movie as allegorized cultural analysis. Jean Baudrillard imagines the
historical arrival of modernity as an "orgy," a moment of explosive
liberation after which the "current state" of postmodernity looks like
an experience of enervation or disappointment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Taking our cue from this French theorist, we might view Marcello's
 participation in the antics at Fregene as the final discharge of
 modernist energy within the movie.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Notably, it is the transvestite, Mariuccio, whom Fellini assigns the
one line in the original screenplay that in any way elucidates the
title. Observing the quickly degenerating atmosphere, he tells Marcello,
"I love life . . . the very sweetest life. And you?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Mariuccio evidently possesses the kind of innocence and melancholy
 reserved for an individual who has embraced without denial the chaotic
 but poetic nature of his own desires. But it is notable that Fellini does
 not keep Mariuccio's line in his final work. Seen through the eyes of
 the more embittered and fatalistic Marcello, the notion of  "la dolce
 vita" might achieve congruence with the kind of <I>douceur</I> that,
 according to Baudrillard, is characteristic finally of the postmodern
 condition: "On se demandait jadis ce qui pouvait advenir apr&egrave;s
 l'orgie--travail de deuil ou melancolie? Ni l'un ni l'autre sans
 doute. . . . &Agrave; la fuite en avant nous pr&eacute;f&eacute;rons
 l'apocalypse r&eacute;trospective, et le revisionnisme en toutes
 choses--toutes nos societ&eacute;s sont devenus revisionnistes, elles
 repensent tout en douceur. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the morning, the last of the numerous dawnings that punctuate the
film, the guests file out of the villa like actors exiting the stage
with theatrical flourishes and farewells. Walking through a wood of
pine trees at the border of the seaside, the group seems melancholic
and anxious. The only possible source of the <I>Lichtung</I> they hope
to find is the vast and empty sea itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Yet the only event of interest results from the discovery of an enormous
 fish on the beach that, one bystander observes, has been dead for three
 days. Some critics have proposed to interpret this event as a Christian
 metaphor, relying on the traditional association between fish and
 Jesus and the reference to the three days between his crucifixion and
 resurrection. It seems to me instead that Fellini's camera performs a
 powerful subversion of a potentially auratic spectacle here, discovering
 in the fish the sign of a grotesque and hostile cosmos. Through a
 remarkable medium shot of the fish's dead eye returning the gaze of a
 disquieted Marcello, Fellini suggests a confrontation that is primarily
 aesthetic and epistemological in its contours. If Benjamin is correct
 that the model of the auratic experience is the investment of an object
 with the ability to return a gaze, then the fish in <I>La dolce vita</I>
 represents the ultimate travesty of such experience.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 What is certain is that here, at the finale, Fellini avoids any
 suggestion of resurrection or deliverance for his characters and hence
 any hint of a redemptive religious message.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marcello begins to walk along the shore of the beach when Paola, the
girl whose personal pop-music soundtrack diverted him from his book,
appears in the distance, waving to catch his attention and gesticulating
to remind him of their previous encounter. His reunion with the young
siren indeed promises to enlarge on the charged significance of their
first meeting. As Frank Burke writes, "When Marcello encounters her
earlier . . . he is able to relate to her only as an icon . . . purely as
simulation. . . . One could also argue that the film itself does precisely
to Paola in the final scene what Marcello did earlier . . . 'reproducing'
her as an icon of spirituality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fellini toys with our expectation of a fleeting "moment of being"
or epiphany that will enlighten the anxious hero, an expectation in
keeping with the classic narratives of modernism. Marcello, however,
appears to miss his opportunity for inspiration, unable as he is to
hear Paola's shouted attempts at communication over the noise of the
ocean. Resigned to his condition, he walks away to join a woman from
the previous night's group of partygoers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The piercing last shot of the film lingers on the sweet, benevolent smile
 of the young girl. Marcello is absent from the picture, the epiphany
 has not happened, and the riddle of modernity has not been solved. The
 hermeneutic elusiveness of the moment might best be captured by Foucault,
 when a few years later he envisions the very concept of man inviting
 his own annihilation "like a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 It is of crucial significance that Fellini chooses for the final drama
 of failed consciousness one of the favorite loci of high modernism:
 the seaside encounter with a young girl.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not only can we think of the narrator's crucial encounter in <I>La
recherche</I> with Albertine, <I>la jeune fille en fleur</I>, but also of
Stephen Dedalus's sublime moment of self-discovery in <I>A Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Man</I>. In Joyce's <I>Bildungsroman</I>, Stephen
walks along the seashore as he ruminates on his new-found ambition to
"create proudly out of the freedom and power of his soul, as the great
artificer whose name he bore, a living thing, new and soaring and
beautiful, impalpable, imperishable. . . . "
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 A few moments later he spies a girl by the water and undergoes an
 overwhelming epiphanic realization:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A girl stood before him in midstream, alone and still, gazing out to
sea. She seemed like one whom magic had changed into the likeness of a
strange and beautiful seabird. . . . She was alone and still gazing out
to sea; and when she felt his presence and the worship of
his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet sufferance of his gaze and then
quietly withdrew her eyes from his and bent them towards the stream,
gently stirring the water with her foot hither and thither. . . . Heavenly
God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of profane joy. . . . A wild
angel had appeared to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy
from the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of
ecstasy the gates of all the ways of horror and glory (433-434).
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Clearly, Stephen's vision of the young girl represents a conversion
experience of sorts in the <I>Portrait</I>, a conversion away from
organized religion and toward artistic self-determination that in
some sense represents the antithesis of Marcello's capitulation to
the pressures of a spectacularized capitalism in the wake of Steiner's
suicide. In considering Fellini's opinion of the "classic" modernist
conversion myth, we ought to keep in mind that, as originally scripted,
<I>La dolce vita</I> was to have ended on a different and somewhat more
hopeful note with respect to a possible epiphany.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In its iconography and overall outlines, the final scene has a more
Proustian than Joycean quality. Marcello in fact meets not with a single
"angel," but with a group of young girls, "sweet feminine res,
. . . calm, safe, and joyful as girls are when in company," arriving
at the beach (<I>Qf</I>; 279). He recognizes Paola, and their brief
conversation leaves them both with a feeling of happiness. When he tries
to interest her in

<B></B>

the dead fish, however, her attention wanders, and after a few minutes
she runs away. Fellini describes Marcello as he watches her withdraw in
the company of her friends: "He is gripped by a profound, inexplicable
emotion; he does not really know if it is sorrow or joy, desperation or
hope. . . . Marcello's turmoil is agonizing. He looks far off; in the
luminous and still sea, the little girls run wild with joy, mysterious
messengers of a new life" (<I>Qf</I>, 281-282).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet in the finished film, it is Marcello who walks away from Paola, as he
perhaps bows to an advancing sense of reality. We cannot fail to notice
the emotional implications of his decision--we may expect Marcello's
abandonment of the girl to occasion no artistic inspiration, merely an
elegiac pang of regret. If the myth of epiphanic self-realization is both
deconstructed and lamented by <I>La dolce vita</I>, quoted as the residue
of a past from which we have to distance ourselves, it will be translated
into a kind of absurdist afterlife in <I>8&amp;1/2</I>. Whereas Fellini
in <I>La dolce vita</I> aims to survive the apocalypse of modernity
by presenting his images as the last, viable modernist signifiers, he
no longer cultivates any illusions about the efficacy of his own art
in <I>8&amp;1/2</I>, a film whose title evokes the cryptic labeling
of abstract expressionist paintings of the 1940s and 1950s. After an
archetypally modernist convalescence at a pseudo-Thomas-Mann-style
sanitarium, the protagonist Guido Anselmi embarks on a search for
enlightenment via an encounter with a beautiful girl in white whom he
has glimpsed at the spa.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Unlike <I>La dolce vita</I>, though, <I>8&amp;1/2</I> uses its familiar
 quest narrative in an evidently parodic mode and concedes without
 reservation the untimeliness of Guido's dream of purity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The latter film concludes with the justly famous image of the cast
of characters holding hands and dancing in a circle. Guido directs
everyone to their position and then finally joins the circle to the
strains of Nino Rota's haunting theme music. At the time of the movie's
release, most critics and viewers found this denouement puzzling in
its transmogrification of life and art into sheer spectacle. The
birth of postmodernity in Italy may be said to coincide with this
illusory triumph. It is strangely fitting that the closing scene of
<I>8&amp;1/2</I> was originally shot as the promotional trailer for the
film's theatrical release. Not satisfied with the narrative crescendo of
the "real" ending and appreciative of the surreal energy that the scene
exuded, Fellini revised his plan to incorporate the trailer's visually
metonymic, allusive summation of the larger movie. The redemption of film
from all that is not spectacular and cinematographic is now accomplished;
no longer is film, as in Kracauer's theory, supposed to redeem physical
reality. As Umberto Eco adroitly puts it, Fellini "has lived to redeem
the cinema from what is external to itself."

The territory is highly controversial, since for certain critics cinema
represents the quintessential modernist art, whereas for others such as
Michael Fried film is essentially unable to fulfill canonical modernism
categories: "cinema is not, even at its most experimental, a modernist

cinema does not possess inherent dimensions and functions. See Fried's

Gilles Deleuze has written the most thoroughly considered commentary on
the disjunctive, experimental narrative techniques of European cinema from
the 1950s through the 1960s. Deleuze identifies the Italian films of the
period as the chief instances of such techniques and reads these works in
continuity with the preceding generation of neorealist films as belonging
to a cinema of the "time image." As opposed to the European cinema
prior to neorealism, in which meaning is achieved through a synthetic
action-movement, the new cinema of the "time image" is characterized by
dispersive situations, weak plot links, the voyage or "stroll" form, and
an absence of plot. The visual fl&acirc;nerie of <I>La dolce vita</I> thus
provides a textbook case for the application of Deleuze's theory. Deleuze
makes the point that the movies of Visconti, Antonioni, and Fellini all
might be considered neorealist, as they all share what he considers the
two main achievements of neorealism: that of a "direct image of time"
and that of a purely optical space. The spectator is provoked by this
kind of cinema, which will come to encompass the French New Wave, to
decipher an image rather than to follow an action. Gilles Deleuze,

It is useful in this connection to note that Stanley Cavell argues for
the relevance of Baudelaire's essay, "The Painter of Modern Life,"
both to film and to film criticism, particularly with regard to the
poet's identification of certain mesmerizing, iconic archetypes of
modernity such as the military man, the dandy (or fl&acirc;neur), and
the woman. According to Cavell, these character types play a central and
recurrent role in the development of cinema. I think the essay ought
to be pondered carefully by anyone wishing to assess the essential
qualities of Fellini's cinema. See Cavell, <I>The World Viewed</I>

Indeed, the inspiration for Fellini's chef d'oeuvre may have been a
contemporary fashion style: "<I>La dolce vita</I> was inspired for

Flaiano has likened the scriptwriters' effort to find the appropriate
name for the character of Paparazzo to the two years of labor spent
by Flaubert to settle on "Emma" as the first name of the heroine of

by George Gessing entitled <I>Sulle rive dello Jonio</I>. At any rate,
the success of Fellini, Flaiano, and Pinelli at their endeavor may be

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This exploration of a broadly revealing strand of Martin Heidegger's
thinking is intended, at least tangentially, to rehistoricize the debate
about the shift from the modern to the postmodern. If ongoing discussions
of the postmodern have a central issue at stake--a discernible core rather
than a perpetually evasive "uncentering" or diffuse "unfounding" in the
cause of ineffable Otherness or unnamable <I>diff&eacute;rance</I>--then
Heidegger will continue to be invoked there. As Karsten Harries has
observed, "postmodern theory is unthinkable without his questioning."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  French critics Luc Ferry and Alain Renaut are even more adamantly
  encompassing: "The Heidegger controversy merely stands in the foreground
  of a controversy that has a quite different impact, involving nothing
  less than the significance attributed to the logic of modernity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "logic of modernity" is a large subject and Heidegger, who did not
shrink from the largest and most indefinite of all subjects (Being as
such), endowed the otherwise intangible logic

<B></B>

of modernity with a palpable shape, historical telos, and easy
comprehensibility by associating it with the most venerable, renewable,
and clich&eacute;d concept in German (and European) thinking about
modernity. I am referring to the tandem notions of <I>Americanism</I>
and <I>Americanization,</I> which served in Heidegger's thinking to convey
the recent phase of mankind's fateful course of <I>Ruinanz</I>--that is,
the total but unrecognized ruination of the world through the occlusion
of Being by way of putative progress. As both ordinary way of life and
blockage of the sense for Being, Americanism came to incarnate modern
humanism run lethally amok. In its blind, pragmatic-technological frenzy,
it was utterly inhuman and at the same time all-too-human. In a compound
logical and eschatological sense that combined fulfillment, perfection,
and extinction, Americanism came to stand for the end of human history,
as it did for other "classical" thinkers of the twentieth-century
<I>posthistoire,</I> including Heidegger's contemporaries Alexandre
Koj&egrave;ve, Ernst J&uuml;nger, and Arnold Gehlen.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Heidegger's account of the logic of modernity served his unique
ontological aims, but his choice of these particular terms of reference
was anything but idiosyncratic; rather the choice was foreordained by
received ideas. For over a century before Heidegger's main writings,
German thought had characterized the "most modern" by the catchphrases
Americanism and Americanization. Over the long term, these prepotent
epithets have exerted a deeply formative influence on the German
understanding of modernity as a demonic-dynamic trajectory of mass
civilization, running automatically amok beyond all proper bounds
and measures toward the consummately inhuman. More than all others,
these two terms have served to encapsulate the dreaded "common way"
of the liberal-democratic, capitalist-industrialist West against which
the German "special way" (<I>Sonderweg</I>) was, until 1945, held up as
the heroic exception and exalted alternative.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Even today, after the great transformations following upon 1945 and
 1989, these twin shibboleths continue to impart the sharpest critical
 edge to lingering German doubts about most modern (and postmodern)
 civilization as a potentially inhuman, inverted world of man's
 own making. These two habitual terms continue to serve as the most
 compelling master tropes (or commonplace conceits) for distilling
 the otherwise elusive, self-surpassing dynamic of modernity. They are
 the ambivalent residue when more innocent conceptions of Promethean
 progress have been demythified, deconstructed, or even ironically
 inverted by the searing calamities of the twentieth century. Moreover,
 as spectral self-clich&eacute;s of modernity, these twin terms continue
 to re at the forefront of almost all attempts to think "beyond the
 modern," whether to overtake and steer it along different lines or to
 transcend and supersede it altogether with some radical otherness, be
 it countermodern, postmodern, or transmodern. For multiple reasons, a
 careful historical exploration of Heidegger's unique and yet commonplace
 employment of these fateful terms promises to be timely and illuminating.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 My chief argument is that the notion of Americanism assumed an axial
 position in Heidegger's writings that was sustained from the mid-1930s to
 the late-1960s. Indeed it loomed larger and more luridly in the period
 <I>after</I> his avowedly Nazi period and after his resignation from
 the rectorship of the University of Freiburg in April 1934.

<B></B>

His usage continued unabated but not unmodified through the surrender
of Nazi Germany in May 1945 and persisted thereafter throughout
his later thinking on global technology. To phrase it succinctly,
Heidegger increasingly essentialized the entire destiny of modern Western
civilization into the reductive catchword Americanism, which served as a
holistic, homeopathic mass clich&eacute; for the totalizing trajectory
of mass civilization itself. As such, this commonplace term became
indispensable to his evolving perspective upon the entire destiny of human
history and the human project itself. More graphically and handily than
all other terms, Americanism served to embody the ever-more convenient
but ultimately catastrophic way of being human in the modern world. As the
most concrete and convenient term for human-centered convenience as such,
it was interpreted as fulfilling eons of unwitting anthropomorphism and
centuries of modern self-conscious humanism--while allegedly obliterating
all residual appreciation for Being itself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Heidegger's reductive and essentialist use of the term was not static;
 after World War II and the American occupation of Western Germany, this
 ingrained but now politically touchy appellation was diffused into less
 sensitive terms, including generic humanism and even vaguer notions of
 "planetary technicism" and the primordial "will to will."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  But the barbed original term Americanism explicitly continued to
  play a crucial diagnostic and prognostic role in Heidegger's writings
  and addresses. Among all his notoriously arcane archaisms and vatic
  neologisms, the term Americanism remained an intellectual Archimedean
  point in the unfathomable flux of time, history, and Being; it was
  as close as Heidegger comes to a conceptual constant or ide&eacute;
  fixe, perhaps appearing circumstantially under other names but
  "ontically" and essentially still the same. As the most familiar
  antithesis and most readily understood dialectical foil to his core
  notion of Being, Americanism remained central to his thinking through
  all its confounding turns and reversals. As with many other European
  thinkers of his generation, Americanism served Heidegger as a "pop"
  historical apriori, a ready-made <I>id&eacute;e re&ccedil;u</I> for
  easily eliciting and projecting the ultimate meaning of modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Heidegger is often said to have radically de-essentialized both
 Being (<I>Sein</I>) and man's own concrete way of being in the world
 (<I>Dasein</I>); but by the same token, he just as certainly and
 radically essentialized modernity into the correspondingly formulaic
 and hackneyed stereotype of Americanism. These two tendencies of
 his thinking remained reciprocally and, in his sense, "essentially"
 related: the radically deconstructive or essence-naughting tendency
 in his thinking necessitated the patently schematic and reductive
 tendency embodied in his caricature of Americanism as Western and then
 planetary destiny. Heidegger's sustained effort to dethingify the Being
 of all beings entailed the correspondingly relentless reification of the
 thingified mindset dubbed Americanism. The present exposition constitutes
 a sustained response to Hugo Ott's question: "When are we finally going
 to see a study of stereotypes in the writings of Martin Heidegger?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  The approach adopted here may seem thoroughgoing to the point of being
  overbearing, but it is only in keeping with the relentless tenacity
  with which Heidegger himself framed the issue; Americanism remained
  the most "absolute" and encompassing of his stereotypes, reverberating
  loudly and sometimes tediously

<B></B>

through his writings as the conventional, plebian mass mantra for
modernity. His defamiliarization of practical-functional things in
the higher cause of Being required a corresponding instrumental use of
Americanism as the most familiar and functional of modern clich&eacute;s
for modernity itself. There is a great irony here, to say the least,
but only the reader can say whether it ultimately works for or against
Heidegger's standing as one of the great thinkers of modern times.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Heidegger's use of Americanism necessarily cuts across the
 prophylactic <I>cordon sanitaire</I> erected by some interpreters
 between his philosophy, which is deemed profoundly original and
 immensely suggestive, and his quirky politics, which are just as often
 considered a repugnant but brief lapse that he quickly moved beyond
 but never clearly renounced. Wherever and whenever Heidegger turned,
 he continued to carry with him his dark vision of Americanism as the
 culmination of <I>Ruinanz</I>--a constant and final end to what has
 aptly been called his "politics of Being."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  His relentless instrumentalization of Americanism demonstrates more
  clearly than any other facet of his thinking that his dialectical
  metaphysics (at odds with all previous metaphysics) cannot by its
  own lights be quarantined from the mundane realm of the political,
  the ideological, and the worldly.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 A special interpretive economy or intellectual trade-off obtains in
 the effort to understand Heidegger on Americanism that derives from
 the reciprocal relation between the critical (or deconstructive) and
 reductive (or stereotypical) vectors of his thinking. As a radical
 metaphysician-against-metaphysics, Heidegger is notoriously difficult
 to understand in his own terms, but Americanism is easy to understand
 since almost everyone <I>already</I> understands what it means by an
 implicit, unreflective preunderstanding. This habitual familiarity
 and tacit taken-for-grantedness of America and Americanism as nearly
 everybody's latent stereotype of modern life was slyly spoofed in
 Bertolt Brecht's 1929 work "From a Reader for City Dwellers," which
 also carried a self-parodying, self-ironizing effect characteristic of
 Brecht but hardly of Heidegger:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Heidegger, by contrast, the absolute worst (yet best) thing about
Americanism was precisely that nearly everyone in the West was coming to
understand it not merely as the dominant modern way of life but simply as
life itself--at the incalculable and unrecognizable cost of the loss of
Being itself. Americanism perfected mankind's anthropomorphic urges to
doing, making, having, and knowing, while at the same time obliterating
the true thinking of Being.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Heidegger pressed the odd quasi-familiarity of Americanism as the
 quintessence

<B></B>

of modernity to the limit. He emphasized repeatedly its superficial,
thoughtless matter-of-courseness (<I>Selbstverst&auml;ndlichkeit</I>)
and its deeper, hidden power to convey the staggering paradox of the fully
humanized yet somehow also dehumanized world. In his earliest writings, he
expostulated on the woeful aura of an inverted human/inhuman world before
finding the upper-case "proper name" for such an abject condition. In
1910, while still a theology student in Freiburg before World War I and
on the verge of his tortuous rift with Catholicism, Heidegger railed
against modern decadence and the "destructive influences of modernism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  In an address at the dedication of a monument to the seventeeth-century
  Augustinian monk-preacher, Abraham a Sancta Clara, the young Heidegger

The ground-destroying rage for the new, the crazed distraction from

which contemporary art of every sort moves--these are elements which
point toward a decadence [<I>Dekadenz</I>], toward a sorry falling away
[<I>Abfall</I>] from the healthiness and the transcendent value of life.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 By the logic of his own developing ideas, Heidegger's term for
 modernity's grievous "falling away" would soon undergo a hypostatization
 into first <I>Ruinanz</I> and then eventually Americanism. In the wake of
 World War I and his reading of Oswald Spengler, Ludwig Klages, and Georg
 Simmel, Heidegger coined his own solecistic yet infinitely synthetic term
 <I>Ruinanz</I> to encapsulate the deeper metaphysical/ontological dynamic
 concurrently at work in the widely discussed "decline of the West."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  As both essence and process, this gerundive term was supposed to
  connote much more than merely an end (<I>Untergang</I>) of the
  spiritual-idealist high culture of the once-Christian, Eurocentric
  West. Rather <I>Ruinanz</I> was meant to convey the intrinsic movement
  of debasement or preternatural "falling away from Being" through man's
  peremptory formulation of things, concepts, and entities. Foremost among
  his many terms for this ontic falling from Being toward thingness,
  <I>Ruinanz</I> remained more inexorable and more imponderable than
  mere civilizational <I>Untergang</I>--in the same way that Being
  itself must remain more primordial than all things at man's behest
  or disposal. Transitive, self-surpassing <I>Ruinanz</I> became for
  Heidegger the darkening shadow of the human will to <I>Transzendenz.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  In Heidegger's evolving thought, these two equally primordial
  tendencies of human striving--toward transcendent Being and toward
  cognizable, manipulable things-other-than-Being--became so mutually
  implicated and intertwined that they threatened to become tragically
  indistinguishable, like the two "sides" of a M&ouml;bius strip. In
  this confounding circularity, the commonplace catchphrase Americanism
  came to serve as his all-purpose, familiar trump-term for rendering
  the ontological difference both more commonly recognizable and more
  radically diagnostic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Apart from unique, ulterior ontological allegiances, Heidegger's
 conception of Americanism as wholesale <I>Ruinanz</I> masquerading
 as ersatz <I>Transzendenz</I> was similar to that of many contemporary
 culture critics, including Spengler, Klages, Werner Sombart, Hans Freyer,
 Hans Zehrer, the J&uuml;nger brothers, and others often grouped

<B></B>

under the rubrics of "radical conservatism" or "conservative
revolution." They too viewed Americanism as a vulgar hyperhumanism
or instinctive animalism of the uncultured masses, at once cravenly
conformist and wildly amok, potentially inducing by its very excesses a
dialectical backlash or leap forward toward some redemptive kingdom come
of super- or transmodernism. Declaring "total cultural war" and a decisive
"struggle to the last" to redeem the German spirit and culture from the
coils of "anomic" Western liberal civilization, these radicals urged the
"manly," hard voluntaristic course of direct action and revolutionary
deed (literally, "<I>die Tat</I>") in response to the pervasive aura of
cultural pessimism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Calls for hard action stemmed from an underlying mood of darkening
 despair; Heidegger proved susceptible to both summons. The manichean
 and masculinist posture of Weimar culture warriors was given softer,
 more poetic expression by Rainer Maria Rilke in a letter of 13 November
 1925, lamenting the transformation of real things into commodities
 and counterfeit substitutes. In a passage often cited by Heidegger,
 Rilke cast the genuinely human sense of substantial Being against
 the encroaching American sense of fungible, disposable, commodifiable
 things. The ontological difference was rendered palpable in Rilke's
 phrasing:

For our grandparents a "house," a "spring," a familiar tower,

there surge empty, indifferent things, fake things, dummy-life
[<I>Lebensattrappe</I>]. . . . A house, an apple, a grape vine, in the
American sense, has nothing in common with the house, the fruit, the grape
into which our forefathers poured their hope and solicitude. . . . Things
living, experienced, and communing are going under and cannot be
replaced. We are perhaps the last ones who will have known such things.

 After World War I, even soberly rational minds not surrendering
 to poetic melancholy were nevertheless given to sweeping prophetic
 pronouncements regarding the spread of such Americanism. In his famous
 address "Science as Vocation" in 1918, Max Weber equated modernization
 and Americanization, insisting broadly that "[I]n very important
 respects German university life is being Americanized, as is German
 life in general."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Writing in 1925 amid the pandemic craze of Weimar "Americanitis," the
  liberal journalist Rudolf Kayser urged semantic caution, "Americanism
  is the new European catchword. Like all catchwords it is subject to
  the same fate: the more one uses it, the less one knows what it means."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 For Heidegger and other cultural critics of left, right, and center,
 however, the best thing about Americanism was precisely its ubiquitous
 popular meaning as the perpetually self-stoking dynamic of modern mass
 civilization, accompanied by the paradoxical, uncanny tendency to
 "mean" the loss of meaning altogether. As in Heidegger's subsequent
 writings, Americanism in Weimar Germany was used more and more loosely
 as a wild-card catchword; but rather than the term undermining its
 own meaning through flagrant and exaggerated overuse, it continued its
 boundless hypertrophy even through the Great Depression, owing to its
 singular capacity to mean the end of meaning--and

<B></B>

for many commentators, the end of history, nature, culture, and even the
world itself. Moreover, Americanism carried this paradoxical premonitory
meaning not merely for an elite of intellectuals and cultural critics
but for many anxious "little people," who in the turbulent interwar
years cared more about a loss of practical livelihood, savings, and jobs
than about any loss of ontological Being. Like the German Reichsmark,
Americanism in the Weimar period lent itself to stupendous hyperinflation
without an accompanying semantic deflation so that subsequent Nazi usage
of the term might best be called a caricature of a caricature. For his
part, Heidegger prepared to impel this modern slogan toward "absolute"
ontological dimensions by his path-breaking exegesis of human existence
and its concrete historicity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Heidegger's great unfinished work of 1927, <I>Being and Time,</I> sent
 shock waves through German and continental philosophy. The work was
 hailed widely as another epochal Copernican turn in thinking, on a par
 with Kant's earlier transcendental turn. Ironically, Heidegger's rich
 but elliptical work soon established his stature in the wider realm of
 public fame that he scorned in the work itself as "inauthentic." Neither
 <I>Ruinanz</I> nor Americanism appeared explicitly in the work itself,
 but both notions were implicit in much of Heidegger's interpretation
 of everyday human existence. As a phenomenology of "everydayness"
 and ordinary, quotidian life, this dense work laid down lines of
 interpretation that would clearly converge a few years later in his
 formulaic use of Americanism as the prevailing worldview of modern man.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 <I>Being and Time</I> set out to provide a philosophy of radical
 reflection upon human existence as a unique form of Being as such. More
 technically, the work undertook a hermeneutic phenomenology of concrete
 human <I>Dasein</I> in its immanent experiential horizon of temporality
 and finitude. Under the universal categories of existence, temporality,
 and historicity in general, it presented a certain <I>mode</I> of human
 life in a certain <I>period</I> of human history--what could be called
 modern <I>Dasein</I> or modern Western life under urban-industrial
 conditions. Apart from this underlying tension between its universal
 phenomenological claims and its restricted historical range of evidence
 and specific areas of concrete lived experience, the work adumbrated
 an even more ambitious general ontology or hermeneutic of Being as such.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Abjuring the transcendental departure of much modern thought from
 the abstract human subject or pure consciousness, Heidegger began
 within concrete existence and the experiential human situation. But
 his exposition of purported universal structures of human existence in
 terms of familiarly and recognizably modern usages presumed what needed
 to be demonstrated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  As some mildly skeptical commentators noted at the time, Heidegger
  prejudicially conflated the exegesis of human existence as such with
  a slanted interpretation of modern life under current conditions as
  refracted through the biased categories of Kierkegaard, Burckhardt,
  Nietzsche, Graf Paul Yorck von Wartenburg, Spengler, and other thinkers
  hostile to modern civilization. One might go a step further to argue
  that the metaphysical "opening to Being" adumbrated in <I>Being</I>
  and Time (and reserved for future elaboration) constituted the opening
  for his subsequent deployment of Americanism as the stereotypical
  "essence" of Western <I>Ruinanz</I>. Human <I>Dasein</I> came to its
  ruination-cum-perfection through its own immanent logic of "being
  modern."

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "normal" everyday world of "inauthentic" human existence presented in
<I>Being and</I> <I>Time</I> consisted of humdrum routine, daily praxis,
and "publicness"--superficial sociability, collective conformity, and
thoughtless compliance with the anonymous rule of the other as "them"
(<I>das Man</I>), whom Heidegger called "everybody and nobody." Existence
tends to slide toward an inauthentic life of averageness, homogeneity,
conformity, publicity, busyness, and business-as-usual; it also tends
to become ridden with boredom, empty talk, distractions, newspapers,
comfort, security, sensationalism, and a host of other forms of life that
were habitually associated with Weimar Americanitis. Heidegger insisted
that this unthinking "normalcy" of daily existence entailed not only the
loss of a sense of Being but also of the active and manly qualities of
heroism, risk, autonomy, decision, vitality, tradition, and hierarchy,
as well as the passive, nurturing capacities to reflect, to keep silent,
to listen, to revere, to thank, and to be capable of awe or wonder.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Entwining human-historical and ontological modes of comprehension,
Heidegger discerned a double trajectory consisting of the deepening loss
of Being concurrent with growing self-alienation among human beings; the
authentic "I" tends to become lost in the "they," just as Being becomes
obscured in practical "things" regarded as entities, commodities, and
instruments at the disposal of human beings. Surrounded by the ever-ready
tools of technology, <I>Dasein</I> tends toward the average, anonymous
"mass being" of public conformity rather than toward authentic selfhood:
"By publicness [<I>&Ouml;ffentlichkeit</I>] everything gets obscured and
what has thus been covered up gets passed off as something familiar and
accessible to everyone."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  Significantly, it seems to require an average "templated" idea like
  Americanism to convey the full dimensions of man's own intrinsic
  tendency to a "templated" average consciousness. The esoteric notion of
  ontological <I>Ruinanz,</I> so to speak, averages out most intelligibly
  for nearly everybody as vernacular Americanism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Heidegger indicated that the specifically modern mode of existence
 annuls metaphysical awe and questioning in favor of scientific
 knowledge and technological mastery; these dispositions of mind in
 turn flatter man's wishful self-image of sovereign control even as
 they shatter cherished illusions of human specialness. A modern form
 of self-conscious anthropomorphism trumps the traditional form of
 na&iuml;ve anthropomorphism; but in any case, man remains fixated
 upon himself and his own designs. The ultimate driving force in the
 obliteration of Being through man's abiding self-fixation turns out to
 be the Moloch of modern technology.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Immediately after <I>Being and Time,</I> Heidegger began in 1928 to
 realign his exposition of human existence by emphasizing the growing
 powerlessness of <I>Dasein</I> in the face of the boundless domination
 of technology "which rages about in the world like an unchained beast"
 (<I>G,</I> 26:215, 279). Man was being irrevocably overpowered by
 his own instrumental power; what man has brought into being reacts
 reflexively upon him to obliterate all bonds with primordial Being,
 leaving man estranged and homesick, sprung out of all original bounds and
 bonds into a "groundless" and "homeless" world of his own devising. The
 world (of true <I>Sein</I> and <I>Dasein</I>) was becoming the "world"
 (in lethal quotation marks) and "worldview." In 1929-30 Heidegger
 repeated Novalis's pronouncement that genuine philosophy was always in
 essence "homesickness," while

<B></B>

adding a sharp jab at the unrecognized "normal" sickness of contemporary
existence: "Homesickness--is there something like this in general
today? Has it not become an incomprehensible word, even in everyday
life? For have not contemporary urban man and the ape of civilization
(<I>Zivilisationsaffe</I>) long since abolished homesickness?" (<I>G,</I>
29/30:71) The specter of modern man, stylized as the anonymous "<I>das
Man</I>" or the subhuman "<I>Zivilisationsaffe,</I>" was "progressing"
toward its end point in <I>Ruinanz</I>--the robotic homunculus of <I>homo
americanus.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In <I>On the Essence of Truth</I>  Heidegger escalated his critique
 of the "blind" subjectivism and anthropocentrism of modern thinking,
 "He [man] is all the more mistaken the more exclusively he takes himself,
 as subject, to be the standard for all beings."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  Subjectivism bred its logical reciprocal in doctrines of
  objectivism--and vice versa. The seemingly (but superficially)
  antithetical worldviews of marxism and modern Catholicism revealed
  themselves on deeper inspection as bankrupt kindred forms derived from
  the same modern anthropocentrism, differing only in degree rather
  than in kind. In a letter of 22 June 1932 to Elisabeth Blochmann,
  a liberal-democratic Jewish friend who had recently converted to
  Protestantism, Heidegger was at pains to differentiate among modern
  intellectual horrors: "Communism, among other things, may well be
  horrible, but it is a clear affair, whereas Jesuitism is--pardon me
  for saying this--diabolical."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  On 30 March 1933, two months following Hitler's assumption of the
  chancellorship, Heidegger wrote in the same manner of a new German
  two-front war against the insidious twin specters of materialist
  "antispirit" and "expiring ex-spirit," "The confrontation with 'Marxism'
  and with the 'Center Party' would slacken away from its true sense,
  if it did not ripen into a confrontation with the antispirit of the
  Communist world and no less with the moribund spirit of Christianity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  The crises of present day politics assumed real meaning only in
  reference to the even more urgent metapolitics of Being; the acute
  emergency of human values self-evident in the death throes of the Weimar
  Republic counted for nothing in relation to the perpetual emergency
  of human blindness to Being. Modern civilization had to be overcome
  to clear the way for something other than mere things.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During his notorious tenure as Nazi rector of the University of Freiburg
for nine months during 1933 and 1934, Heidegger's previous dire warnings
about man's narcissistic hubris and maniacal self-apotheosis did nothing
to inhibit his own apotheosis of Hitler as the exalted, superhuman
"heroic" standard-bearer of all things German and authentic, as the
sole remaining earthly agent to combat modern degeneration. With his own
special hopes of "leading the leader" toward Being, Heidegger bestowed
upon Hitler the unique historical-ontological status of total incarnation
of German (and European) destiny, who might "invert the inversion"
and re-turn <I>Ruinanz</I> toward authentic <I>Transzendenz.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  Not just historically, for the passing moment, but ontically and
  eternally, Hitler <I>was</I> Germany--as the stock phrase went--and
  Hitler was thereby the incarnate, existential vessel of Being
  itself: "Let not propositions and 'ideas' be the rules of your Being
  [<I>Sein</I>]. The F&uuml;hrer alone <I>is</I> the German reality,
  present and future, and its law."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  A reopening of human access to Being thus remained the purpose of
  political engagement, but only as a self-sublating politics to end
  all politics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In Heidegger's unabashedly National Socialist phase, it was not politics
 in any usual sense but rather Being itself that constituted the supreme
 stake in Germany's revolution: "This revolution brings with it the
 total transformation of our German being."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  Heidegger thought that the Nazi revolution would accomplish
  the "practical" activist equivalent of the philosophical
  <I>epoch&eacute;,</I> the deliberate, reflective rupture of thoughtless,
  daily routine for the sake of authentic existence and Being. In a
  private letter of December 1933 to his confidant Erik Wolf, Heidegger
  transmuted authentic individual <I>Dasein</I> into invincible collective
  <I>Deutschsein,</I> with both personhood and nation-state conscripted
  in the supreme service of Being itself: "The individual, whatever his
  place, counts for nothing. The destiny of our nation within the state
  counts for everything."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
  The authentic personal selfhood of <I>Being and Time</I> was
  "transcended" in the tide of destiny.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In view of Heidegger's abbreviated but total public engagement for
 Nazism, the bitterest irony would come in the form of censure from
 several Party superzealots who complained that <I>Being and Time</I>
 remained "a fundamental ontology which looked at man in his passive
 role rather than in his active one."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
  What these critics left out of their cavil was that Heidegger had
  embraced Nazism precisely to force the turn from "normal" conformist
  passivity to voluntarist "decision" on behalf of Being. This critique
  notwithstanding (which in hindsight may seem somewhat prescient but
  was unfounded in view of his publicly stated position), Heidegger
  remained vehement that a concerted radicalism of thought <I>and</I>
  deed was necessary to overcome the pervasive meaninglessness of modern
  existence. His subsequent use of Americanism at so many turns offered
  a singularly effective rhetorical and philosophical way to reclaim
  an ideological orthodoxy and ready-made intelligibility while also
  retaining his reputation for unabashedly radical thinking. He could
  use familiar old wine in familiar old bottles with old labels and old
  stoppers to refer to the newest installment of <I>Ruinanz.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 It is noteworthy that Heidegger wrote the first recorded passages
 concerned expressly with Americanism in the period following his
 resignation from the Freiburg rectorship on 23 April 1934. (He remained
 a member of the Nazi Party until the end of the war.) If his own
 affiliation with Nazism was turning more heterodox and even idiosyncratic
 in its ontic orientation, he couched his opprobrium against Americanism
 in far more conventional, worldly terms. In a report urging university
 reform dated 28 August 1934, he saw the American menace already lurking
 inside the temple of German learning and <I>Wissenschaft.</I> Echoing
 Weber on the Americanization of German learning and life, Heidegger urged
 a counterstrategy leading to a final cultural showdown, "If the American
 influence in contemporary academic and scientific life, already far too
 powerful, is to be effectively countered and eradicated in the future,
 it is essential to allow the restructured academic disciplines to grow
 in accordance with their own inner exigencies."

 In another university document--a confidential report filed with the
 National Socialist Professors' Organization at G&ouml;ttingen opposing
 the candidacy of his former student Eduard Baumgarten, who had studied
 the pragmatism of John Dewey in the United States--Heidegger judged
 Baumgarten (who happened to be a nephew of

<B></B>

Max Weber) to be dangerously unreliable in view of the urgent national
imperative to meld philosophy, culture, and politics into a total
unity. Heidegger's report was alternately pointed and elliptical regarding
Baumgarten's shortcomings: "His stay in the United States, during which
he was Americanized, no doubt allowed him to learn much about the country
and its inhabitants. But I have solid reasons to doubt the sureness of
his political instincts and his judgment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  Even if privately Heidegger was rethinking the necessary congruity of
  politics and metaphysics, he began publicly to deploy the inveterate
  catchphrase Americanism as a cultural tocsin--a call to arms in the
  service of authentic Being and becoming "truly" German.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In a well-known passage from his <I>Introduction to Metaphysics</I>
 of 1935, Heidegger posed the question "Is 'Being' a mere word and its
 meaning a vapor, or is it the spiritual destiny of the Western world?" He
 went on to insist:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
This Europe, in its ruinous blindness forever on the point of cutting
its own throat, lies today in a great pincers, squeezed between Russia
on one side and America on the other. From a metaphysical point of view,
Russia and America are the same; the same dreary technological frenzy,
the same unrestricted organization of the average man.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He proceeded to lament the fact that under the global impact of
technology, time has "ceased to be anything other than velocity,
instantaneousness, and simultaneity and time as history has vanished from
the lives of all peoples. All this frenzied haste raises the question
what for? Whither? And what then?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
  Heidegger was capable of seeing all the difference in the world
  between Being and beings but no difference worth considering between
  Bolshevism and Americanism. The supreme ontological difference between
  Being and beings gave rise to a sovereign indifference regarding
  "worldly" distinctions and values. Just as he had recently excoriated
  "Jesuitism" as more diabolical than Communism, however, Heidegger would
  similarly denounce Americanism as far more sinister than Communism--
  precisely owing to the former's thoughtless convenience, ready
  familiarity, distraction, and sly dodge away from firm ideological
  explicitness. Henceforth Americanism loomed larger and larger as the
  unrecognized telos of matter-of-courseness in modern human existence,
  which takes itself and all Being for granted. In this sense, Heidegger's
  pathway of ever more radical and encompassing <I>Destruktion</I>
  represented a homeopathic disclosure (and, faintly but potentially,
  a rearguard reversal) of the fateful <I>Ruinanz</I> exemplified in
  commonplace Americanism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In a gesture of supreme radicality, Heidegger insisted that all
 human-centered categories and values remained utterly fatuous. The
 "childish" anthropomorphic categories of hope and despair, like the
 everyday human categories, practical forms of life, and ordinary
 practices generated out of man's mundane concerns--all these remained
 distorting mirrors and blinders, diverting man from the sense of
 Being. Americanism remained unmatchable in endowing the ontological
 difference with an intrinsically powerful anthropomorphic and ever catchy
 popular meaning. The German spirit, as embodied in the German language,
 became the redemptive response to Americanizing

<B></B>

<I>Ruinanz.</I> Germany's double vocation of politics and metaphysics
required it to confront its identical-twin antagonists by ting
fire with fire: the concerted total mobilization of National Socialism
(and allied European fascist movements) were required to counter the
enveloping technological mania of Americanism and Bolshevism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Heidegger continued to portray contemporary developments in the
 later 1930s entirely in terms of his primordial "ground-category" of
 <I>Ruinanz,</I> which was now protracted not only beyond "childish"
 optimism and pessimism but beyond any residual element of human
 recognition or recollection whatsoever. The "falling away" from true
 spirit culminating in the modern age degenerated into the uniform,
 standardized mass mind and mass existence of the twentieth century
 as institutionalized in the interchangeable Molochs of Americanism
 and Bolshevism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In his summer 1936 course on Schelling given several months before
 formation of the Rome-Berlin Axis, Heidegger held out both Mussolini
 <I>and</I> Hitler as having "learned from Nietzsche" and as having begun
 a "countermovement to nihilism." Democracy represented not "freedom" but
 a kind of cultural death: "Europe tries to cling to 'democracy' and will
 not admit that this 'democracy' will be Europe's historical death. For
 democracy is, as Nietzsche clearly saw, only a kind of nihilism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  In terms again redolent of Max Weber's famous Munich address,
  Heidegger went on to pinpoint the problem of the universities and
  their conception of science, "We have long since slipped into the
  most sterile Americanism, according to whose principles the truth is
  merely the successful and everything else is 'speculation,' that is,
  'irrelevant dreaming'" (<I>G,</I> 45:54-5).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Perhaps heeding his own call to "courage for the absolute," Heidegger
 also ventured some cautiously veiled reproofs of the dogmatic rigidity
 and racialist delusions of National Socialism. (He was under Gestapo
 surveillance at the time.) But at the same time he continued to
 denounce Americanism in terms far more damning than those of Nazi
 officialdom, which was at this critical juncture still hoping to
 preserve American neutrality by dampening precisely such propagandistic
 diatribes. Heidegger began to hint gingerly that all mundane "isms" and
 discrete worldviews were fated to resolve into the same fundamental,
 twisted transformative will-to-power intrinsic to modernity. Whatever
 signs of doubt about Nazism one can find in Heidegger in this period,
 they remain entirely of a piece with his much more adamantly forthright
 opposition, indeed "total" resistance, to the <I>Ruinanz</I> that was
 most fully evident (but not necessarily intellectually "reflected")
 in what he never stopped calling Americanism. Heidegger's critique
 of Nazism consisted of reassigning it from the role of sole practical
 redeemer to one of partaking vaguely in the same <I>Ruinanz</I> as the
 totalizing destiny of Americanism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In the recently much-studied <I>Contributions to Philosophy,</I>
 Heidegger's censure of Nazi science and its racialist mania centered not
 on its overtly inhuman values but on its deeper, unrecognized Americanism
 of technological power over things and persons: "The 'folk-based'
 'organization' of science moves on the same path as the 'American,'
 and the question is simply which side will most quickly and fully have
 at its disposal the greatest force and means" (<I>G,</I> 65:149).
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  Heidegger's erstwhile effort to "lead

<B></B>

the leader" resolved itself into understanding Nazism "better than
it understood itself," resolving it into a latter-day variant of
power-besotted anthropomorphism. He thereby assigned "functioning"
or "operational" Nazism to the sprawling camp of modern civilization
and its core dynamic of "unlimited" Americanism. What had formerly
recommended itself as National Socialist "rescue" was being co-opted
(from the standpoint of Being) into the pan-<I>Ruinanz</I> of Americanism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In "The Age of the World Picture" of 1938, Heidegger again singled out
 Americanism by way of a discussion of the disproportion between "man's
 measure" (which must always remain anthropocentric) and "the gigantic"
 (which manifests both the hypertrophy of the man-made but also in some
 oblique, awestruck way the vestiges of Being itself). He underscored
 the inevitable failure of purely quantitative means to comprehend the
 staggering quality of the gigantic. A new note of ironic metareflection
 resounded in several key passages. Heidegger seemed to press the
 issue of Americanism beyond the childish and churlish level of popular
 understanding by using the customary term with the caveat of distancing
 quotation marks, "We do not think at all, if we believe we have explained
 this phenomenon of the gigantic with the catchword 'Americanism.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  The new note of irony did not, however, invalidate the notion of
  Americanism as the uniquely proper name for the dynamic propelling the
  world to total <I>Ruinanz</I>; rather this new typographical gesture
  of deeper self-consciousness served to underscore the claim that Being
  remained the real issue at stake. An appendix to the lecture elaborated
  on this passage in an even more thought-provoking way:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
"Americanism" is itself something European. It is an as-yet uncomprehended
variety of the gigantic, and the gigantic itself is still inchoate,
still not yet capable of being understood as the product of the full and
complete metaphysical essence of modernity. The American interpretation of
Americanism by means of pragmatism still remains outside the metaphysical
realm.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Just as the immanent self-understanding of Nazism and Communism missed
the mark, so the immanent or "inside" understanding of Americanism in
its own practical terms was destined to remain a misunderstanding that
necessarily missed Being.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 As elsewhere, Heidegger plays here upon a seeming paradox in order
 to provoke deeper thinking. The passage leaves unclear whether the
 European character of Americanism concerns the actual practical dynamic
 of <I>Ruinanz</I> itself, which he is presumably trying to avert (or
 deflect), or its proper metaphyscial understanding by Europeans, which
 he is presumably trying to promote. The new note of deeper reflection
 suggests that Americanization could no longer be regarded as something
 alien, encroaching from afar, but rather should be seen as a process,
 now relocated by reflection, at the very core of Europe's essence. So
 relocated by deeper reflection, Americanism would serve to lead Europeans
 back to Being and out of their Babylonian captivity in civilizational
 "progress" and the commodious thing-world of instrumental functionality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 After the outbreak of war in 1939 and amid the escalating maelstrom of
 human and inhuman events, Heidegger continued to present all history
 as the ontological

<B></B>

encounter of Being versus (but also Being <I>as</I>) <I>Ruinanz</I>; the
destiny of human beings seemed rather beside the point. At the same time,
however, he continued in public lectures to couch the ontic stakes of
the struggle in terms of actual specific events and clearly designated
adversaries. Human beings and their collective groupings served as
unknowing and unwilling vessels of ontological disclosure; nations became
emanations of Being. Thus, the defeat of France in June 1940 fulfilled a
"mysterious law of history" whereby the culture that nourished Descartes
was crushed by a people, the Germans, who have pressed the "machine
economy" to its utmost but who at the same time miraculously remain
"most spiritual." As both the fulfillment and dialectical overcoming of
Western tradition, Heidegger invoked the notion of total mobilization
borrowed from the maniacal pan-productionism of Ernst J&uuml;nger's
<I>The Worker</I>: "only the superman is capable of an unconditional
'machine economy' and vice versa: the one needs the other in order to
establish an unconditional domination over the earth" (<I>G,</I> 48:205).

 As the war against Britain shifted to the "gigantic" war upon Russia,
 Heidegger identified the redemption of Being with Europe as a whole
 becoming fully German in spirit. For its own authentic well-being
 and the sake of Being, Europe must cast its collective existential
 "decision" for German spiritual culture. This conjoined Euro-German
 destiny entailed doing battle not only against the Bolshevik East but
 against the most advanced civilization of the West. With American entry
 into the war in December 1941, Heidegger removed the hedging quotation
 marks around Americanism; active battle was called for by world destiny,
 not reflective or ironical problematization. At this critical juncture,
 Germany, as the homeland of spirit, must purify itself and stand fast
 against its own "inner America." Heidegger warned expressly against a
 peculiar German susceptibility to inner, self-inflicted Americanization
 as the worst form of craven cultural capitulation, "Unfortunately for
 itself, the surrender of German being to Americanism goes so far at
 times that Germans are ashamed that their people was once called 'the
 people of poets and thinkers'" (<I>G,</I> 52:134).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the H&ouml;lderlin lectures of summer semester 1942--several months
after America's entry into World War II but prior to the decisive battle
of Stalingrad--Heidegger restated the ontological difference between Being
and beings by insisting that such a "question of questions" remained
entirely at odds with mankind's worldly concerns, measures, values,
categories, events, and self-centered "plans." Now even metaphysics itself
ceased for Heidegger to be a meaningful response, or even a revealing
clue, to the loss of Being. Western metaphysics no longer red as
<I>Gegenruinanz</I> but rather as a veiled auxiliary of pan-technology;
Western metaphysics resolved itself into "proto-Americanism" raised to
a higher power. What had been "total mobilization" was now given over to
Heidegger's radical program of total deconstruction (<I>Destruktion</I>
or <I>Abbau</I>). The whole edifice of Western thought had to be
entirely "undone" to make way for the first and last things: now only
poetic language was deemed to offer a fragile "clearing" or "hospice"

of <I>Gegenruinanz.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The war in Heidegger's rendering proceeded in a hybrid manner--partly
 as the Clausewitzian "extension of politics by other means" but also
 as a paradoxical kind of total mobilization of poetic language by its
 own means, redirecting language against its own inertial <I>Ruinanz</I>
 into all-too-worldly, reified uses. Heidegger's position echoed that
 of Rilke and the followers of Stefan George, whose motto was "Language
 is the innermost bastion of the spirit in a world of things."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  At this same time, efficacious "means" in the sense of worldly
  aims were becoming gravely compromised for Heidegger, as they all
  conspired to occlude Being. The spiritless tide of Americanism, as the
  hypertrophied essence of the West, was bent upon the destruction of
  any vestigial hospice of Being. Americanism remained bent upon besting
  all its variants before completing the obliteration of the homeland of
  Being itself. H&ouml;lderlin's "homesickness" was taken to portend the
  obliteration of the German homeland and of all homelands of "rooted"
  cultures and peoples. Heidegger's new ontology of poetic refuge--however
  radical its turn from power-politics or will-to-power toward poetry--was
  still ideologically consonant with Nazi New Order Europe. Heidegger
  warned with a tone of dire emergency and of hope against all odds:

Today we know that the Anglo-Saxon world of Americanism has decided to
destroy Europe, and that means the homeland, and that means the incipient
origin of the West. What is origin is indestructible. The entry of
America into this planetary war is not the entrance into history, but
is always already the final American act of American history-lessness
and self-destruction [<I>G,</I> 53:68].

In perhaps the most surprising of his many convoluted turns, Heidegger
asserted in 1942 that Bolshevism was merely a derivative offshoot of
Americanism; the more advanced and "boundless" Western pincer had already
subsumed its Eastern counterpart in preparation for engulfing Germany
and all Europe:

This primacy of quantity is itself a quality, an essential mode, that

of Americanism. This is the truly dangerous form of the measureless,
because it appears in the form of democratic citizenship, mixed
with Christianity--and all of this in an atmosphere of pronounced
history-lessness [<I>G</I>, 53:86].

Language, like human <I>Dasein</I> itself, harbored the latent potential
for both the greatest promise of homecoming and the greatest danger
of ruination. This deep duplicity of language was evidenced in the
fact that modern Germans could "say" German words but really "speak"
American meanings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Shifting away from the Western front, Heidegger instanced Japan as
 Germany's equally hard-pressed far-Eastern ally that was also waging
 battle against ruination through American-style civilization. There,
 too, language could be more dangerous and devastating than man-made
 bombs falling on ancestral homelands. These bombs showed the sudden,
 visible horror of the <I>Ruinanz</I> of all Being when Being is deployed
 instrumentally in man-made systems and categories. There remained,
 however, an

<B></B>

even more essential danger: the final <I>Ruinanz</I> of language itself
as venerable hospice of Being: "We [Germans], like the Japanese, learn
the English-American language. This has its own technical-practical
necessity that no one in their right mind would question. The question
remains whether beyond the utility of such language capacities, we also
recognize their essential danger" (<I>G,</I> 53:80).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 As the house of Being, language showed a double tendency and double
 meaning, akin to the German homeland in its precarious middle position
 [<I>Mittellage</I>]. Deprived of its "useless" poetic use, language
 can be deployed to serve the world of pragmatic-practical "business"
 and "distraction," especially when language becomes shackled to
 the alien forms of quantity, number, and commensuration. Echoing
 Hegel, Goethe, and other German thinkers <I>contra numeros,</I>
 Heidegger insisted that sheer quantity had assumed a unique quality
 all its own--a fundamental condition of modern life that obtruded
 everything genuinely qualitative. In the <I>Contributions,</I>
 Heidegger dilated on the superhuman scale of this quintessentially
 modern <I>Ruinanz,</I> "What transformations are taking place [within
 the industrial economy]? Manipulation and business. The big number,
 the gigantic [<I>das Riesige</I>], sheer spatial extension, and growing
 superficiality and hollowness. The inevitable fall into kitsch and the
 inauthentic" (<I>G,</I> 65:392). In its anthropomorphic ambition to
 "make" history entirely in the human image as "things for disposal,"
 Americanism forfeited any trace of the "being" of authentic history,
 culture, and nature: "Nature is history-less. [But] Americanism is
 history-less and therefore catastrophic in a way that nature itself
 could never possibly be" (<I>G,</I> 53:179).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In the Heraclitus lectures of 1943, delivered during and after Stalingrad
 and after Goebbels's call for total war, Heidegger juxtaposed the
 climactic catastrophe of current events with the consoling serenity of
 a continuing German destiny in Being projected far beyond the fray of
 current history. Trumping the Americanism he despised, Heidegger could
 find consolation in an alternative or counterhistory-lessness of a
 time-being of postmodernity and even a kingdom come of posthumanity. If
 Germany's self-appointed National Socialist mission in the world
 was ending in utter destruction, her surpassing destiny beyond this
 "all-too-worldly" world of worldviews was not thereby finished. In the
 dire winter of 1944, Heidegger wrote of opportunity vested in calamity,
 of reversal implicit in <I>Ruinanz,</I>: "Decline is not the same as
 death. Every decline remains secure within the ascent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
  Heidegger's famed ontological difference provided the primordial
  engine for an oddly paradoxical kind of "progress" after all, not in
  the banal, anthropocentric American sense but rather in a superhuman
  "progress beyond progress."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 While expressing these rarified superhuman hopes, Heidegger was
 already looking beyond the physical destruction of Germany to an even
 greater danger: the impending planetary <I>Ruinanz</I> that refused to
 recognize itself as such. For Heidegger, the darkest night was arriving
 en masse as "enlightenment," reeducation, and the prospect of further
 Americanization. The world had fallen so far into <I>Ruinanz</I>
 as "the absolute humanization of all Being" that any alternative to
 mankind's narcissism was precluded. Indeed, the grand tradition of
 Western metaphysics was henceforth the deepest problem rather than
 any kind of possible solution: "metaphysics is anthropomorphism--the
 formation and apprehension of the world according to man's image."

 With French occupation of southwestern Germany, Heidegger fell under
 a partial denazification ban from 1945 to 1951. He was forbidden
 to teach at the university level but not forbidden to publish or to
 lecture. During the ban from 1945 to 1951, Heidegger continued his
 turnings and re-turnings--backward again to Greco-Germanic origins
 but also outward toward French and Eastern thought while deepening
 his reflection upon the Western tradition. His turn toward the East
 included reading and attempting to translate Lao Tsu. As West German
 society of the <I>Wirtschaftswunder</I> was said by many critics to
 be lapsing more and more into Americanization (indeed, becoming "more
 American than America"), Heidegger took up his "homely dwelling" in
 steadfastly regional, Alemmanic folk culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
  He took solace from and pride in the fact that he was becoming as deeply
  interesting to the French and the Japanese as he was embarrassing
  to the Germans--and anathema to the Anglo-Americans. His reputation,
  at low ebb at home, soared abroad.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Heidegger's exegesis of mankind and its anthropomorphic "systems"
 and "centrisms" always resolved itself simultaneously into a gnosis
 of Being and a diagnosis of Americanism; the two were inextricably
 entangled and mutually dependent. His notion of Being remained so
 altogether "different," so ex-centric and ec-static, yet so relentlessly
 all-encompassing and beyond human concerns as to permit staggering
 conceptual equivalences pitched far beyond the categories and values
 of any mere "worldview," whether Americanism, Communism, positivism,
 or other variants of humanism. Heidegger insisted that Americanism
 belonged alongside Bolshevism, Communism, and National Socialism as
 variants of collectivist "massification," "You can also say Americanism
 in this regard. It is exactly the same thing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
  The <I>Ruinanz</I> of Being remained the implacable outcome of mankind's
  modern way of thinking even more than of its ways of doing, having,
  and existing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Heidegger's final testament came in the famous <I>Spiegel</I>
 interview of 1966, which was not published until ten years later,
 on 31 May 1976 (four days after his death) under the telling title
 "Only a God Can Save Us." The title was especially revealing in light
 of his apothegm that modern man remains "too late for the gods and too
 early for Being." For this "final Heidegger," mankind has become quite
 beside the point while still fancying itself to be the only point. It
 may at first seem incongruous that Heidegger chose the allegedly most
 Americanized magazine of German popular opinion in which to leave his
 final message, but in a sense his entire homeopathic counterlogic
 of <I>Gegenruinanz</I> required such a "mass" forum. Heidegger's
 interviewers, publisher Rudolf Augstein and his associate Georg Wolff,
 assumed the role of common citizens, who, as quasi-devil's advocates,
 tried to wrest some satisfaction from the "miracles" of German recovery
 and the fact that in the present Federal Republic "everything is
 functioning." But for Heidegger, of course (i.e. the "of course" of the
 logic of <I>Ruinanz</I>), that condition was the very essence of the most
 profound problem. In modernity, sheer functioning has displaced wondering
 and reflective thinking. <I>Ruinanz</I> has run its disastrous course,
 with the expected losses: practicality precludes profundity, efficacy
 eliminates epiphany, and mastery dispels mystery. The ever-salient,
 self-reconstituting term Americanism cropped up obliquely but crucially
 as the two interviewers 

<B></B>

pressed Heidegger further on his notorious reaffirmation of "the inner truth and
greatness" of National Socialism as residing in "the encounter between
technicity on the planetary level and modern man" (<I>G,</I> 40:208). The
<I>Spiegel</I> interviewers asked Heidegger if he included the Communist
movement among those who misunderstood the meaning of technology. He
answered, "Yes, definitely--as determined by global technology." The
interviewers then added: "Americanism also?" Heidegger answered, "Yes,
I would say that too. Meanwhile, the last thirty years it should have
become clearer that the global movement of modern technology is a force
whose scope in determining history can scarcely be overestimated" ("OG,"
104). The "all-encompassing breadth of meaning" that his interviewers
gently challenged in Heidegger's promiscuous use of the habitual
term nihilism actually applied far more aptly to his reflexive use of
Americanism--especially as nihilism and Americanism stood for the same
implacable thing-ification of Being. In the <I>Spiegel</I> interview, the
ever-salient term no longer carried the ironically questioning quotation
marks that Heidegger had seen fit to apply thirty years before, when,
paradoxically, he still believed there was some possibility of altering
the course of <I>Ruinanz.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Later in this final interview, Heidegger returned to the theme of
 American ways of thinking and alluded briefly to an exceptional element
 within the otherwise desolate American scene:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I see the task of thought precisely in this, that within its own limits,
it helps man as such achieve a satisfactory relationship to the essence
of technicity. National Socialism did indeed go in this direction. Those
people, however, were far too poorly equipped for thought to arrive at
a really explicit relationship to what is happening today and has been
underway for the past 300 years.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The interviewers asked, "Do the Americans today have this explicit
relationship?" Heidegger replied,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
They do not have it either. They are still caught up in a thought that,
under the guise of pragmatism, facilitates the technical operation
and manipulation of things, but at the same time blocks the way to
reflection upon the genuine nature of modern technicity. At the same
time, here and there in the USA attempts are being made to become free
from pragmatic-positivistic thinking. ["OG," 111]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 One can only wonder what Heidegger meant in this coyly tantalizing
 reference; most likely it referred to the growing interest in
 phenomenological, existential, and hermeneutical thinking, most notably
 including his own body of writings. Given his ontological catch-22
 that mankind's every effort at transcendence has worked ultimately to
 reinforce its servitude to technology, it seems implausible to find
 any redeeming element in American efforts at "becoming free" by way of
 self-criticism. Would not the American self-critique of Americanism
 remain wholly within the terms of Americanism, just as Heidegger
 had shown ad infinitum that the Western critique of Western thinking
 remained, ultimately, within that thinking and fell short of Being? In

<B></B>

the final analysis, Heidegger's unremitting use of Americanism as
"know-how" and "instrumental <I>ratio</I>" remained the necessary polar
antithesis to his vision of Being. Increasingly, Heidegger turned far
"back" in time but also "beyond" the Western tradition for the rescuing
power from the East. In the <I>Spiegel</I> interview, he looked eastward
after glimpsing only the faintest trace of hope from America: "And who
of us would be in a position to decide whether or not one day in Russia
or China very old traditions of 'thought' may awaken that will help make
possible for man a free relationship to the technical world?" ("OG," 111)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The same deep thinker who aspired to dehabitualize and to
 de-clich&eacute; Being with successive radical turnings--first of
 thinking, then of acting and willing, and then of un-willing--wound
 up harping on one of the most hackneyed stereotypes and shopworn
 rhetorical tropes of modern times. Excepting one or two elliptical
 passages, Heidegger did not question or deconstruct <I>this</I>
 rampant master-clich&eacute;; rather, he hypostatized and totalized
 it into a veritable planetary mode of un-Being--the most palpable,
 empirical-historical form of man's fateful <I>Ruinanz</I>. Heidegger's
 polemic against Americanism was an integral and unwavering element of
 his critique of modernity, humanism, and the whole Western intellectual
 tradition. Throughout his thinking and rethinking, Americanism
 represented the "totalization" or absolutization of anthropocentric
 "will to will" that, in the cause of mastery over all beings and things,
 produced only <I>Ruinanz.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In his deposition in 1945 to French military authorities, who were
 vetting him for the right to teach, Heidegger declared with disarming
 candor, "Nietzsche did me in" ("Nietzsche hat mich kaputt gemacht").
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  Nowhere did Nietzsche, whom Heidegger designated as "the first of
  the last metaphysicians," strike closer to Heidegger's radical way
  of "thinking through Being" than in the mordant observation: "What
  philosophers are in the habit of doing is adopting a popular prejudice
  and exaggerating it." Heidegger adopted and exaggerated Americanism
  as the arch-avatar of all modern deformations of Being and of being
  human; it remained his habitual incantatory mantra for modernity. He
  used it so massively and so promiscuously, however, that he came close
  to using it up altogether--ironically, somewhat akin to the historical
  fate of Being itself, "done in" by its own implacable <I>Ruinanz.</I>

Heidegger insisted that "the whither of <I>Ruinanz</I> is nothingness"
(<I>Das Wohin der Ruinanz: das Nichts</I>) but that authentic
philosophical thinking also posed the possibility of a potential
"counterruination" (<I>Gegenruinanz</I>) (<I>G,</I> 61:143, 153). On
the term and its vastly encompassing valences, see Theodore Kisiel,

Heidegger's <I>Ruinanz</I> continued to carry the peculiarly dual
sense of an unnoticed, meaning-constituting intentionality (as the
phenomenological "sense of being" (<I>Seinssinn</I>) of Aristotle,
Brentano, and Husserl) as well as the "dynamic" sense of ever more
progressive decadence in Nietzsche's "degenerence" (<I>Degenereszenz</I>);
see Nietzsche, <I>S&auml;mtliche Werke</I>, ed. A. Baumler (Stuttgart:
Kr&ouml;ner, 1964), 78:229. Thus, <I>Ruinanz</I> entails the stupefying
paradox that the mind's intentionality is directed toward a thingness
that is also nothingness. But the main meaning of the onto-historical
process remains that Being becomes lost in the mind's own operations:
man's being occludes Being itself.

If the title of this essay were "<I>Love</I> rhymes with <I>shove.,</I>"
it would probably make us smile. One reason would be that the second rhyme
word is unexpected: we would be likely to predict a more conventional,
decorous choice of echo for <I>love</I> in <I>dove</I> or <I>above.</I>
At the same time, <I>love</I>:<I>shove</I> is a familiar type of bathetic
rhyme designed to raise a smile in all sorts of humorous poetry, where
absurd pairings of like-sounding words are the traditional vehicle for
expressing what W. H. Auden called "comic contradiction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  By contrast, <I>love</I>:<I>of</I> does not belong to a category
  of rhyme we would find in poetry we are typically used to. Such
  combinations virtually never appear in English poetry except in rare
  humorous verses until the nineteenth century, and even then they
  were seldom used and only for comic effect or for a formal reason
  such as to encourage enjambment. Rhymes like <I>love</I>:<I>of</I>
  have signifying possibilities that were first taken seriously in the
  early twentieth century because they satisfied the intentions of the
  modernist aesthetic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The premise of this discussion is that "<I>Love</I> rhymes with
<I>of.</I>" works in unique ways. Everyone who hears that title laughs,
not only because they had not thought of the rhyme before but because the
paired words are mismatched in a different, unfamiliar, and unsettling
way from either <I>love</I>:<I>dove</I> or <I>love</I>:<I>shove.</I>
Although the statement "<I>Love</I> rhymes with <I>of.</I>" is instantly
recognizable as true, it is true in a way hard to know how to think about;
it is outside our everyday patterns of thought and language. How it comes
to have these incongruent effects is both a conceptual and a historical
question that this essay will explore.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One clear signal the title gives is that what follows will be about
poetry and not prose, even though "<I>Love</I> rhymes with <I>of.</I>"

<B></B>

is a prose sentence that uses a rhyme to prove its statement. We tend
to associate rhyme with poetry as distinct from prose because we do not,
except in extraordinary instances, hear or think of like-sounding words
in prose speech or writing as rhymes: for instance in familiar phrases
like <I>the love of God</I> or <I>the god of love.</I> The reason for
this difference in response is that prose is not systematically arranged
to emphasize similarity of final sounds by their accent and syntactical
position, the way almost all rhymed poetry in English was structured
roughly from Chaucer to Tennyson.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Simply, rhyme in English poetry--described by T. V. F. Brogan as
"historically its single most consistent characteristic"--is the bringing
together into related positions in the verse of words that are partially
like in sound but differ in meaning.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  It is a specialized form of repetition since the linked words are not
  identical. Linguists describe the relationship between words that rhyme
  by various terms, among them: <I>consequence,</I> <I>consonance,</I>
  <I>convergence,</I> <I>equivalence,</I> <I>parallelism,</I>
  <I>symmetry.</I> Rhyme works rhetorically like a simile because both
  kinds of verbal patterning make a comparison in which perceived likeness
  at the same time calls attention to difference. In the paradigmatic
  instance of simile, Shakespeare's Sonnet 18, the beloved is like a
  summer's day and also is not. Structurally, a rhyme word placed at the
  end of the line works to mark off the line as a unit while binding
  together different lines by their like end sound. The prominence
  granted by their final position strengthens the double power of such
  rhymes to liken and distinguish, as does the traditional practice,
  recommended in theory until the nineteenth century, of having the
  metrical accent fall on the final syllable. End rhymes, empowered by
  their position to engage the reader most actively in recognizing both
  likeness and difference, are the subject of this discussion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"It is in the nature of rhyme to bring differences together and to reveal
the differences in likeness," according to Jurij Lotman's definition,
but the balance of the comparing and distinguishing effects of rhyme can
tilt in either direction between pairs of words, between whole poems,
or phases of an author's work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  The greater emphasis of poets on the closeness or distance between rhyme
  pairs has varied within the same period--particularly with respect
  to different genres--and from one period to another. Even so, there
  are signs that there has been a growing interest among poets writing
  in English over more than five centuries in widening the phonetic,
  structural, semantic, and grammatical gaps between words linked by
  resemblance of sound.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The discussion here proposes that the most radical phase of this
history, the practice revealing the most fundamental transformation
of attitudes toward the ordering of thought in the language of rhymed
poetry, is the acceptance by poets in the twentieth century of rhymes
like <I>love</I>:<I>of.</I> Their common appearance is witness to wide
recognition of truth in the paradoxical proposition that there are
legitimate conceptual grounds for such agrammatical rhymes in spite of
their inherent conceptual incompatibility.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Every reformation in English poetry has involved shifts in attitudes
toward rhyming, in the practices of it, and in the rules for its proper
conduct. A starting point for looking at this slow and unsteady movement
is in the sixteenth century. Then English writers--some of them theorists
as well as practitioners of rhyme--first explored the

<B></B>

state of their language as it was emerging from what Sir Philip Sidney
called "that mistie time" of the greatest poet England had yet boasted,
Chaucer.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  The challenge these writers faced was to find support for their argument
  that poetry in English could achieve its own excellence without the
  inflectional grammar that had supported the unrhymed system of ancient
  verse and had left traces in the rhymed poetry of Chaucer and his
  followers. Chaucer himself had long ago complained of a "skarsete"
  of rhymes in the English he had to work with.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Inevitably, the sixteenth-century defenders of rhyme turned to the
new mode of endings that George Puttenham called "the cheife grace of
our vulgar Poesie," which "consisteth in the Symphonie," a synonym for
<I>rhyme</I> that meant at once likeness of sound and metrical accent
in particular, agreement or harmony in general.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  The "most auncient" vocabulary from "our naturall Saxon English" with
  its wealth of monosyllables supplied a high proportion of words with
  like sounds that could substitute for inflectional endings. They were
  preferred for end rhymes over words of more than one syllable because,
  as Puttenham said, the "<I>monosillables</I> of our English Saxons
  . . . do naturally and indifferently receive any accent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  This meant that at the end of the line they accommodated themselves
  inevitably to the pattern of masculine rhyme, the norm accepted in
  English poetry for most of its history.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rhyme, scorned by classicists as new-fangled ornamentation--Thomas
Campion called it "childish titillation"--was defended on the grounds
of its fidelity to the structure of the English language and to its
"most auncient English" vocabulary.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  George Gascoigne, in the earliest treatise on the making of English
  verse in rhyme, instructed poets that "the more monasyllables that
  you vse the truer Englishman you shall seeme."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  Even though the argument for the naturalness of rhyme was made for
  its expedience, it was predicated on ways of thinking so widely and
  unquestioningly taken for granted, it seems, that there was no need
  to bring them to the surface in these earliest defenses of rhyme.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Elizabethan writers recommended specifically monosyllables handed
down from "naturall Saxon English," they were essentially referring,
without having to say so, to nouns. Nouns made up a vast proportion of
the prized monosyllabic end rhymes, verbs a lesser share, adjectives
(still considered, as in Latin, to be a species of noun) and adverbs
together making up a very much smaller number than verbs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  Since the position of end rhymes gives them a special prominence,
  their place would belong naturally to nouns and verbs, which are the
  parts of speech that chiefly determine the structure and carry the
  burden of meaning in a sentence, where for those reasons they are
  normally stressed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nouns that name what we can see and touch are the first words we are
taught as infants. They are the grammatical guides that help us most to
get along in the world, as anyone knows who has traveled in a foreign
country with only the most rudimentary knowledge of its language. Nouns
are the first category to be explained in any treatise on English grammar,
reflecting a hierarchical ordering of parts of speech that goes back to
antiquity. In the earliest English rhyming dictionary of 1570 the only
classes included are, in this order, nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nouns and verbs of Saxon origin in particular tend to be the names
for common things and events that make up ordinary life. (Many foreign
nouns were imported in the sixteenth century to supply English with a
vocabulary of terms for abstract concepts it had no words for.) Because
these things and events are part of everyday experience, the nouns and
verbs for expressing them were themselves recognizable realities. Their
solid familiarity gave them precedence over less essential words belonging
to other parts of speech, so that the hierarchical structure of English
grammar supported the use in poetry of rhymes that contribute most to the
making of "order and forme," which Samuel Daniel in "A Defense of Ryme"
claimed to be "pleasing to Nature."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The monosyllables paired in rhymes usually belonged to the same part of
speech, so they had the same grammatical meaning. That agreement meant
they filled the same function in structuring the mind's understanding of
order in the world. In sixteenth-century terms, pairing like grammatical
parts in rhyme induced the "certaintie" and "clozes" that Daniel believed
"the diuine power of the spirit" imposed on the poet's imagination to
bring about harmony.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  Grammatical agreement was an important instrument in the preferred
  aesthetic of rhyming, in concert with other agreements in sound, in
  syllabic structure, in metrical accent, and in closeness of lexical
  meaning or what Roman Jakobson called "semantic propinquity" (using
  <I>dove</I>:<I>love</I> as an example).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sequences that bind their member rhymes together by their likeness in
multiple features have threaded their recognizable way through English
poetry at least since the sixteenth century: <I>God</I>:<I>rod,</I>
<I>breath</I>:<I>death,</I> <I>womb</I>:<I>tomb,</I>
<I>lust</I>:<I>dust,</I> <I>tears</I>:<I>fears,</I>
<I>sleep</I>:<I>keep,</I> <I>name</I>:<I>fame,</I>
<I>prime</I>:<I>time,</I> <I>rhyme</I>:<I>chime,</I>
<I>trees</I>:<I>breeze,</I> <I>heart</I> (in the sixteenth century often
spelled <I>hart</I>): <I>part</I>:<I>smart</I>:<I>dart.</I> The series
<I>love</I>:<I>prove</I>:<I>move,</I> pronounced alike at least into the
eighteenth century (in poems by Pope, Gay, and Prior among others) has
gone on being a useful formula, perhaps because historically <I>love</I>
has been pointed out as a famously difficult word to find rhymes for.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  As recently as 1970, G. S. Fraser used it as his example in a discussion
  of the poverty of rhymes in English by comparison with languages
  rich in words with like endings: "<I>Amore</I> in Italian rhymes
  with <I>cuore</I>, but <I>love</I> in English perfectly only with
  the undignified word <I>shove</I> or the trivial word <I>glove</I>"
  (a conservative statement, we shall see, in the light of practice in
  twentieth-century poetry).
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first stanza of "Gascoignes good morrow" shows the focused interest
and expertise of sixteenth- and earlier seventeenth-century poets in
bonding like-sounding words by harmony among their various features,
to create verses that might be perceived as reflecting the divinely
given orders of nature and language. This was the prevailing ideal of
poetry that the laws for rhymed verse first explained by Gascoigne were
dedicated to fostering:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You that have spent the silent night,
<BR>
In sleepe and quiet rest,
<BR>
And ioye to see the cheerefull lyght

<B></B>
<BR>
That ryseth in the East:
<BR>
Now cleare your voyce, now chere your hart,
<BR>
Come helpe me nowe to sing:
<BR>
Each willing wight come beare a part,
<BR>
To prayse the heavenly King.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The stanza is composed of forty-four monosyllables, five words of
two syllables, and one of either two or three; the pattern of regular
iambic trimeter expected of the last line makes it most likely that
"heavenly" is contracted to two syllables, though since it is the most
significantly charged word and is positioned in the last line, it might
be allowed three.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The metrical arrangement of syllables is reinforced by the end rhymes,
themselves all monosyllabic nouns except "sing," which as an infinitive
works more like a noun than a verb. Beyond those syllabic and grammatical
symmetries, the paired words are close to one another in lexical meaning,
and not only those end words that agree in sound but also those that are
acoustically unlike. That is: "night" has the same semantic orientation as
"lyght" but also "rest"; "lyght" in turn is located by familiar Biblical
imagery in the same semantic field as "East." The pairing of "hart" and
"part" is so common in sixteenth-century poetry that their likeness
in sound could persuade, as Hugh Kenner said of proverbial rhymes,
"that they inhere in the workings of the normal mind";
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  "part" also has a semantic association with "sing" in the language of
  religious and other ceremonies because in choral music, which the poet
  in this stanza invites readers "to sing," each voice is assigned its
  "part."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Likeness of syllabic structure, and of lexical and grammatical meanings,
together with like sound, create a symphony that draws into its concert
even the rhyme words that are unlike in their vowel sounds: "night,"
"rest," "lyght," "hart," "part" all close on the sound of <I>t.</I> Only
the "heavenly King" demands a rhyme of His own, but one that agrees with
the uninterrupted accentual pattern of masculine rhyme.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These likenesses between words linked as end rhymes were conceived as
given not only in the senses that the same pairs were always at hand,
expected, and the more valued for having been so often repeated as to
have become proverbial truths. George Herbert, in the last two stanzas
of "A true Hymne," stated or--to use his own preferred verb--<I>copied
out</I> another understanding of rhyme as given:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
He who craves all the minde,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the soul, and strength, and time,
<BR>
If the words onely rhyme,
<BR>
Justly complains, that somewhat is behinde
<BR>
To make his verse, or write a hymne in kinde.
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
Whereas if th' heart be moved,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the verse be somewhat scant,
<BR>
God doth supplie the want.
<BR>
As when th' heart sayes (sighing to be approved)
<BR>
O, <I>could I love!</I> and stops: God writeth, <I>Loved.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<B></B>
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">


Because agreements in many features of the rhymes together make the
harmony in these stanzas, as they do in Gascoigne's, the form of the
verses agrees closely with their sense so that form and sense themselves
can be said to rhyme. Herbert's title, which could serve equally for
Gascoigne's morning hymn, implies as much: to call a hymn <I>true</I> was
to describe it as being faithful to eternal verities and exact in form.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sixteenth- and earlier seventeenth-century prescriptions for end rhymes
were based on the hierarchy of grammatical parts in English, and reflected
the hierarchy of poetic kinds that the makers of the new vernacular
verse promoted (probably encouraged by the examples of modern Italian
and French poetry). Theorists like Puttenham condescendingly allowed
scattered departures from the accepted norm of monosyllabic masculine
rhyming in poems of lesser stature in the hierarchy of kinds:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And the accented sillable with all the rest vnder him make the cadence
. . . but alwayes the cadence which falleth vpon the last sillable of a
verse is sweetest and most commendable: that vpon the <I>penultima</I>
more light, and not so pleasant: but falling vpon the <I>antepenultima</I>
is most vnpleasant of all, because they make your meeter too light and
triuiall, and are fitter for the Epigrammatist or Comicall Poet then
for the Lyrick and Elegiack, which are accompted the sweeter Musickes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This view gave poets license to vary details of their rhyming style
to suit verses of different kinds. The more elevated in rank demanded
rhyme pairs closest in sound and in other features that would mirror
concord in the creation. The humorous kinds that treat of disorderly
conduct and upset values, accidents and tricks might be served by words
mismatched in form and in lexical and grammatical meanings, which would
represent conflict in the human world and untrustworthiness in its
language: Sidney's "love":"shove"; Spenser's "handsomly":"I"; Donne's
"kinde":"blind-"/["nesse"], "away":"India," "or":"abhorre"; Jonson's
"love":"Glove," "embrace":"Pythagoras," "at a":"taffeta"; Herrick's
"Go on":"<I>Predestination,</I>" "Tiffanie":"the":"Sea."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The revolution in English poetry in rapid progress by 1700 was a
reordering of the hierarchy of kinds, again measured by new standards for
the proper practices of rhyming. These were laid out in 1702 by Edward
Bysshe in his respected treatise, <I>The Art of English Poetry.</I>
The kind of verse Bysshe took for granted as norm and ideal was rhymed
"Heroick Poetry," defined to be lines coupled by end rhymes, each line
made of exactly ten syllables arranged in iambs so that the final syllable
would be strongly accented. In his treatise Bysshe explained the more
minute formal regulations of the new verse, and included a dictionary
of "such Words only, as both for their Sence and Sound are judg'd most
proper for the Rhymes of Heroick Poetry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By definition the strict criteria for heroic rhyme excluded schemes of
alternating end rhymes and divisions into stanzas, structures preferred by
earlier poets writing in the highly ranked "Lyrick and Elegiack" kinds;
in Bysshe's ranking "the Lyrick" was demoted to the same inconsiderable
status as "Burlesque" (<I>AEP,</I> 22). The stricter rules for insuring
the accent on the final syllable of the line and the closure at the end
of the couplet promoted close agreement rather than difference in accent
between the paired

<B></B>

words, and since the rhymes were adjacent, their accents were sharply
audible. At the same time, Bysshe's catalogue of exclusions listed
rhymes that are phonetically "too perfect," which, though "allowable
in the Days of <I>Spencer</I> and the other old Poets," are "not
so now; nor can there be any Musick in one single Note" (<I>AEP,</I>
23). His example-- "<I>Light</I>":"<I>Delight</I>"--makes clear that the
objection was specifically to pairs where not only the vowel sound but
the consonant before it are acoustically alike. Still, there is a more
general suggestion implicit here that though there were more and stricter
criteria for proper rhyming, agreement overshadowing all differences
between rhyme pairs was deliberately to be avoided in heroic couplets.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The same suggestion is implied by the silence in Bysshe's treatise and in
other discussions of heroic verse about the desirability of monosyllabic
rhymes, which typically come close to perfect agreement and were in large
part for that reason treasured and preserved by repeated use. In "An
Essay on Criticism" Pope used "<I>Breeze</I>":"<I>Trees</I>" (an instance
of the "too perfect" type of "<I>Light</I>":"<I>Delight</I>") to make
fun of the stock of "<I>unvary'd Chimes.</I> / With sure <I>Returns</I>
of still <I>expected Rhymes.</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  Simple boredom must account to some degree for the lack of enthusiasm
  for familiar, monosyllabic nouns as end rhymes; a sense of historical
  distance from earlier and more impoverished stages of English must
  also have played a part. Beyond those causes, there seems to have been
  at issue conceptions of the origins and nature of rhyme that differ
  from the sense of it as given that informed the earlier enthusiastic
  practice of monosyllabic end rhyming.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Four couplets into Pope's "Windsor-Forest" is a set passage that, like
Gascoigne's and Herbert's stanzas, calls attention to its matching of
form to sense. These lines present themselves as a deliberate model
for poetry, and specifically for heroic rhyme ordered "harmoniously,"
"as the World" in its divinely intended form:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like the earlier sort of poetry that Gascoigne's morning hymn represents,
Pope's "Song" celebrates a natural order where parts "all agree." Here
that emphasis is conveyed by adjacent masculine rhymes, closely matched
in sound, anchoring the ends of lines identical in number of syllables
and in positioning of accent. Agreement in these features always creates
the most immediate impression of harmony. Even so, the balance toward
closeness over distance in rhymes does not have the same effects in
Pope's lines as in Gascoigne's. Only four of Pope's ten end words here
are monosyllabic nouns,

<B></B>

and of them only "Flame" and "Fame" are paired together. "Song" is
linked in imperfect grammatical agreement with "long," while "Plain" is
mismatched both grammatically and in syllabic structure with "again." The
distance is not disturbing, as it deliberately is in the examples quoted
earlier of unruly comic rhymes, but it does allow space for "Variety"
within the measured "Order" of rhymes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pope's end words do not belong to the metalanguage of conventional rhyme
that Gascoigne used when he joined "night" with "lyght" or "hart" with
"part." These were commonplaces passed on from poem to poem so that
readers could participate easily by predicting the completion of the
chime, singing their part in the song. Pope selected his words from a much
larger and more various vocabulary. The echo of the first paired word by
the second could not be predicted in these couplets (except perhaps the
perfect match of "Flame" and "Fame," used more than once in Sir John
Denham's "Cooper's Hill," the model of descriptive verse imitated in
"Windsor-Forest").

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The introduction of variety and unexpectedness within the strict
order of structure and sound in the rhymes makes readers aware of the
poet's acts of choosing and bringing the end words together in these
couplets. Authorial presence is more strongly felt than in Gascoigne's
hymn, where the poet is a voice summoning us to join him in a choir of
other voices all singing their given parts.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course this awareness of the poet fetching rhymes is stronger in
Pope's satires, where the "uncommon," "Low," and "Miscompounded Words"
allowed by Bysshe only in humorous verse widened the distances between
rhymed words in lexical and grammatical meanings, as well as in syllabic
structure. Still, Pope even in satires took care to avoid the most extreme
form of disagreement between rhyme pairs that would result from drawing
on those parts of speech Bysshe altogether outlawed as words that "ought
not to end a Verse; as the Particles <I>An,</I> <I>And,</I> <I>As,</I>
<I>Of,</I> <I>The,</I> &amp;c" (<I>AEP,</I> n.p.).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the heroic couplets of Pope's pastoral poem, the role of the poet in
shaping the "Description" is called to attention by that word itself;
by "seem," which shows him engaged in interpretation; and most strongly
by the line "Where Order in Variety we see" (its internal rhyme adding
to its variety and unexpectedness). We readers see the multitudinous
classes of things in the phenomenal world unified in a single design
because the poet's rhymes are models of the way "tho' all things
differ, all agree." In the closing pair of lines, the first proposes a
definition of order in "the World"; the answering line defines the heroic
couplet. Together they characterize the ideal of heroic poetry in rhyme,
where, Pope wrote in "An Essay on Criticism," "The <I>Sound</I> must seem
an <I>Eccho,</I>" that is, a rhyme, "to the <I>Sense</I>" ("EC," 281).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The aesthetic of heroic rhyme agreed with the earlier ideal of symphonic
rhyming in the sense that both assumed the existence of a grandly
inclusive order in the phenomenal world and in language. Throughout this
extended period, in spite of shifts in the hierarchy of kinds, English
poetry accepted rhyme as the expressive instrument of some overarching,
unifying authority. Even so, historical differences distinguished
between the conceptions of rhyme so authorized. In the earlier period,
proverbial rhymes were conceived as divinely given repositories of truth
preserved and handed down in poems. In eighteenth-century heroic rhyme,
the poet was accepted as an

<B></B>

intermediary authority gifted in the art of finding adequate form in
rhymes to express universal truths, a process Pope summed up in his famous
maxim: "What oft was <I>Thought,</I> but ne'er so well <I>Exprest</I>"
("EC," 273).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In revolutions of English poetry rhyme has always been a charged issue,
its defenders and attackers debating on one or the other side as to
whether it fosters truth to nature in poetry or thwarts it. By the late
1700s dissatisfaction with heroic rhyme became a force in the revolution
against what the makers of new poetry considered the all-inclusive
artificiality of eighteenth- century verse. This revolt surfaced, and has
done so intermittently ever since, in two forms. Edward Young, looking
back to <I>Paradise Lost</I> as the ideal model of what Milton called its
"<I>English</I> Heroic Verse without Rime," set an example along with
Thomson's and Cowper's by eschewing rhyme altogether in long poems.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  While Wordsworth followed this course, other poets of his time and later
  tried out rebellious experiments with variously new ways of rhyming.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To this point in the discussion it has been possible, with considerable
simplification, to recognize and describe preferred forms of English
rhymed poetry roughly from Gascoigne's generation to Pope's, and to
extrapolate from them a common sense of language and its place in
the world. To borrow from Clive Scott's description of French verse of
comparable periods, poetry in English before the later 1700s was generally
predicated on the assumptions that there is accessible to poetry "some
underlying unity in the world," that "the relationship between signifier
and signified is direct, unmediated, and unproblematic," that "semantic
closure is perfectly achievable and truth utterable."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As these assumptions began to unravel--for the many complex reasons
too often discussed to need summarizing here--the possibility of a new
aesthetic with a dominant ideal of form in rhymed verse dwindled as well,
and for the same reasons. Various poets experimented with new ways of
rhyming that were informed by an assortment of literary and metaphysical
attitudes and impulses, but showed a common interest in freeing poetry
from the unnaturally strict regularity and the too predictable closure
of the heroic couplet. That impulse encouraged, among several poets
writing in the early 1800s who were influential throughout the century,
the preference for paired end words that differ more than they agree in
formal features and in lexical and grammatical meanings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Loosening the likeness in sound between rhymed words was the most
widespread form of revolt, a practice that rhymed poetry in English
has not turned away from since. Blake set an early example in such
pairs as "tomb":"come" and "lawn":"morn" that later poets expanded
by enlarging the gap. Some examples are: Keats's "patiently":"sigh";
Elizabeth Barrett Browning's "fewer":"poor"; Emerson's "fell":"oracle";
Longfellow's "woods":"solitudes"; Dickinson's "indeed":"instead";
Swinburne's "love":"enough." Coleridge launched a different attack
on heroic rhyme in his experiments with classical meters. By their
admission of trisyllabic feet, they invited end rhymes mismatched in
syllabic structure and placing of accent like "hospitality":"jealousy,"
and especially paired feminine with masculine rhymes:

<B></B>

"unless":"loveliness"; "suddenly":"be." Keats tried out the curious
effects of making the rhymed couplet straddle separate sentences:
"Will trace the story of Endymion. / The very music of the name has gone."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Poets writing in traditional rhymes at least since the time of Shakespeare
have occasionally allowed themselves prepositions as end words when they
act as part of a verb in what linguists now call <I>phrasal verbs</I>
or <I>prepositional verbs.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  Instances are: Shakespeare's "drinkes it vp":"cup"; Herbert's "creeps
  in":"sinne"; Milton's "bout":"drawn out"; Wordsworth's "passing
  by":"jeopardy"; Tennyson's "floated by": "high." For a considerable
  number of nineteenth-century poets this kind of grammatical formula
  offered an effective escape from the artificiality of diction they
  objected to in eighteenth-century poetry.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Browning heard in such phrases the authentic note of colloquial speech,
particularly when the preposition stands out at the end of the line at
some distance from the verb: "look backward for," "Telling ought but
honest truth to." Hardy, above all, showed interest in such phrasal
rhymes, using them to create a sense of a speaking voice coming through
strictly ordered meters and rhyme schemes. He often ended lines with
colloquial expressions like "worth living for," "found herself in," "know
nothing of," "thought nothing of," <I>of</I> being specially useful for
many of his poems by offering a rhyme with <I>love</I> that was neither
trite nor trivial. Probably in large part because of Hardy's effective
use of these phrases, Marianne Moore praised him as the master of the
"unaccented terminal rhyme."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Shelley violated traditional rhyming practices by different and more
radically subversive use of end rhymes made from prepositions and other
parts of speech on Bysshe's list of words altogether excluded from
serious rhymed verse: "the Particles <I>An,</I> <I>And,</I> <I>As,</I>
<I>Of,</I> <I>The,</I> &amp;c." As late as 1845, when the revolt against
the heroic couplet could declare itself victorious, an encyclopedia
article on grammar cited in the <I>OED</I> called particles "inferior
Parts of speech." What made particles attractive to Shelley, it seems,
was their potential--when not built into a phrasal or prepositional
verb--for enjambing lines of verse. A word like <I>of</I> when part of
a phrase acts as a modifier or intensifier of the verb preceding it, as
in <I>to make of</I> (where <I>of</I> gives the verb phrase a different
meaning from <I>to make</I>). When not part of a such a phrase, <I>of</I>
has the function of connecting or relating, for instance in <I>the
love of God</I>; it points forward to the word that must complete its
significance. Hence these lines from Shelley:

My reading turned up fewer than a handful of such rhymes in
Shelley's work. Other rare instances of lines enjambed by means of
articles, conjunctions, and prepositions are sprinkled about in later
nineteenth-century verse, particularly in poems by Christina Rossetti,
Swinburne, and Hardy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gerard Manley Hopkins made a sort of quasi-mystical system that allowed
inclusion of those parts of speech in rhymes. His idiosyncratic sprung
rhythm encouraged various departures from traditional practices of
syllabic structure and placing of accent. His equally personal ways of
thinking about rhyme--that "any two things however unlike are in something
like," that "all beauty may by a metaphor be called rhyme"--justified
pairing words to any degree like in sound, however unlike in grammatical
and lexical meaning:
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  "England":"and"; "the":"thee"; "or":"snowstorm"; "busy to":"unvisited";
  "on":"Communion"; "of":"Love." Before the nineteenth century, these
  end rhymes would have been allowed only in humorous poems (though not
  in Pope's heroic satire).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Once the nineteenth-century experiments with wider distances between
rhymed words in sound, syllabic structure, and accent grew familiar
in the work of greater numbers of poets not otherwise much alike,
those new rhymes could be taken seriously. More or less extravagant
disagreements in these three features slowly began to be tolerated;
they were expansions of traditional rhyme that did not destroy its
conformity with our everyday patterns of thought and language. In the
same period, rhymes like <I>love</I>:<I>of</I> were not so absorbed, as
the reception of Hopkins, who died in 1889, to some degree reflects. His
poems first appeared as a collected volume in 1918, but it was not until
the mid-1930s that they were acclaimed, revealingly, as the work of a
<I>modern</I> poet. This valuation was due in considerable part to his
radical innovations in rhyme. On the basis of Hopkins's contributions
to the movement toward allowing more extreme innovations in rhyming,
T. S. Eliot in the mid-1930s in his introduction to a volume of poems
by Marianne Moore, included Hopkins's work among what he considered at
that time to be "the best contemporary poetry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is not altogether an exaggeration to say that the possibilities of
rhyme were reconceived in 1916 when Marianne Moore in a poem with the
arresting title "The Just Man And" used an end rhyme of "the" with "be."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  Her first readers had good cause to respond with amused bafflement
  not only to the grammatically odd title, but to what they would have
  taken to be a radically unbalanced end rhyme that paired the most
  significantly charged verb in the English language with an article. We
  have evidence that even sophisticated readers of contemporary poetry,
  Moore's fellow poets, had much the same sort of initial response
  that on a lesser scale we have to the sentence "<I>Love</I> rhymes
  with <I>of.</I>"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
William Carlos Williams allied himself with Moore in sharing the
overarching aims of "all the moderns" to "separate the poetry from
the subject," to insist that "pure craftsmanship joins hard surfaces
skilfully," and to do without "<I>ex machina</I> props of all sorts,
without rhyme, assonance, the feudal master beat, the excuse of 'nature,'
of the spirit, mysticism, religiosity, 'love,' 'humor,' 'death.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  Still, even Williams, who believed that

<B></B>

"Marianne Moore is of all American writers most constantly a poet,"
acknowledged the "incomprehensibility of her poems."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  He complained that the "only help I ever got from Miss Moore toward
  the understanding of her verse was that she despised connectives,"
  another feature of the modernist aesthetic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Williams gave these accounts of his responses to Moore's poems in the
early 1920s. In 1935, Auden made what he later called his "silliest
critical blunder" when he "could not make head or tail" of the work
newly gathered in Moore's <I>Selected Poems.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
  Wallace Stevens, commenting on that volume, described its aesthetic as
  "new," its style as "unique," and Moore as a "complete disintegrator"
  and an "equally complete reintegrator."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  Eliot, who edited the selection, introduced her as a poet of "original
  sensibility"--"Miss Moore has no immediate poetic derivations"--who
  "found her rhythm, her poetry, her appreciation of the individual word,
  for herself" ("I," xiv, ix, x). He praised her for "startling us into
  an unusual awareness" likely to cause "bewilderment" to the point where
  it would sometimes be "difficult to say what is the 'subject-matter'"
  of a poem ("I," x, xi). Stevens registered the same response when he
  said of Moore's poems, "Subject, with her, is often incidental."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
  Without admitting to the incomprehension that Williams and Auden openly
  confessed, Eliot's introduction implies that readers of Moore's poems
  must retrain their ways of thinking to understand the workings of
  her mind and language, as different from ours as the operations of
  "a high-powered microscope" ("I," x).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The formal feature of Moore's poems that Eliot thought readers would
find most baffling, since he gave it most attention in his introduction,
was her use of rhyme, "in itself an innovation in metric" ("I," xii). He
began his lesson with a description of rhyme as it was practiced by
poets writing in English before his generation:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In the conventional forms of rhyme the stress given by the rhyme tends
to fall in the same place as the stress given by the sense. The extreme
case, at its best, is the pentameter couplet of Pope. Poets before and
after Pope have given variety, sometimes at the expense of smoothness,
by deliberately separating the stresses, from time to time; but this
separation--often effected simply by longer periods or more involved
syntax--can hardly be considered as more than a deviation from the norm
for the purpose of avoiding monotony. ["I," xii]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
More recently, some poets contemporary with Moore and Eliot had made the
modernist choice with Williams to dismiss rhyming altogether. Others had
asserted their modernity with regard to rhyme by using it "here and there
to make a pattern directly in contrast with the sense and rhythm pattern,
to give a greater intricacy" ("I," xii). Although Moore publicly claimed
to despise rhyme on principle, she was one of these (she owned a rhyming
dictionary that she said was "indispensable").
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This rhyming against the pattern of sense and stress Eliot separated
into two kinds, "heavy or light," saying that of "the <I>light</I>
rhyme Miss Moore is the greatest living master; and indeed she is the
first, so far as I know, who has investigated its possibilities" ("I,"
xiii). What he meant he illustrated partly by quoting the opening end
rhymes of two stanzas from "The Fish" (a poem with a conventional-seeming
title that turns out to be the grammatical subject of a sentence ending
part way through the second stanza).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The innovative effects of Moore's kind of light rhyme, Eliot explained,
were "sometimes obtained by the use of articles as rhyme words," as in

Both the words that initiate the rhymes in these two opening couplets
would be called light because as articles they are regularly unstressed
in a sentence and unaccented in verse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Words of this category (articles, conjunctions, and prepositions to which
modern grammarians have added demonstratives) are fundamentally different
from the parts of speech traditionally allowed in rhyming. They have a
function in relation to other words but no inherent signifying capacity:
by themselves they refer to nothing. The problem they present to rhyming
is not the proverbial difficulty of pairing apples and oranges, nor even
apples and umbrellas, but something more like the challenge of comparing
apples with D, which, like <I>an</I> or <I>the,</I> is a sign without
what linguists call <I>descriptive content.</I> It is for these reasons
as well as for their light stress that such words, described by Charles
Tomlinson as "the humbler components of language," were for centuries
denied the prominent position of end rhymes in serious verse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moore's way of undermining the ranking of grammatical parts that dictated
traditional rhyming practice was to seem innocently unaware of it. In "The
Fish" she slyly tucked her two stanzas beginning with the most subversive
form of rhyme--"an":"fan" and "the":"sea"--among three other stanzas
that are built in the same unconventional lineation and rhyme scheme but
that play by traditional rules in being made out of acceptable parts of
speech: "wade":"jade," "sun":"spun," "pink":"ink." Yet that grammatical
distinction, which is the predication of our ordinary ways of thinking
about the nature of language and how it works, is blandly ignored. Or it
is swept out of sight by insistence on the agreement among these two forms
of rhyme by exact repetition of their other than grammatical features.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The opening rhyme words in all five stanzas are notably similar in
size. They are all constructed out of two, three, or four letters packaged
in one syllable (letters and syllables are what Moore in "Poetry" partly
meant by "the raw material of poetry") and arranged in the identical,
distinctive pattern of lines. This makes a strong impression of a single,
clearly shaped design repeated all down one page as spaced in <I>Selected
Poems.</I> The emphasis on exact structural repetition works against
the hierarchical differentiation

<B></B>

and demotion of "an" and "the": these articles are among their
equals. In some way that matters, this declaration defines the rhymes
with satisfactory precision, clearing away the distortions imposed by
convention, sifting the "genuine" from the "derivative" (to quote again
from "Poetry").

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The last three stanzas of "The Fish," all down the facing page in this
edition, bring this suggestion of conceptual equality a little closer to
the surface, it may be as a way of testing our progress toward recognizing
what has not been said in words but red in their shape, structure,
and arrangement (perhaps what Moore hinted by saying of her poems,
or all poems, that "Form is synonymous with content--must be"):

The words that make up the opening rhymes in these stanzas (all departures
from traditional rhyme following the directions of nineteenth-century
experiments) do not closely mirror the look of those on the opposite
page. They are made with anywhere from two-plus-hyphen to seven
letters. Two are capitalized because they begin a sentence (not because
lines of poetry used always to begin with capitals). One is followed
by a period (marking the end of the sentence not coterminous with the
stanza). Two are trisyllabic with the rhyme falling on the unaccented
last syllable. One, "ac-/ cident," is broken off as if by accident but
of course by design to make the components of the word fit the syllabic
pattern of the lines.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These stanzas offer a potpourri of irregular rhymes in various forms
all different both from the radical combinations of "an":"fan" or
"the":"sea" and from the traditional pairs like "wade":"jade." Even so,
their identical arrangement of syllables --without regard to where the
accent falls--is the measure and proof of their common nature and their
equality: any word or even any syllable (Moore once pointed out that
"Everyone writes in syllables!") is raw material for rhyming.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The opening end rhymes in the last three stanzas of "The Fish" also have
in common that they use a different kind of word from those in the first
five stanzas. Besides

<B></B>

being more complexly built out of more than one syllable, these longer
words contrast with the semantic simplicity of the earlier rhymes, almost
like ones in a children's book. We might be likely to describe "external,"
"ac-/ cident," and "Repeated" as words more conceptual, more explanatory,
more weighted with meaning. These are all ways of describing them that
make them seem more serious or dignified, deeper: certainly more so than
"an" or "the," but also than "wade" or "fan" or "pink." And "dead."--its
finality visibly red by the "." that constitutes one of its parts--is
tempting to single out as the most important word in the poem.

But to give in to that temptation would be to disregard what Moore's
repetition of her stanza form based on exact syllabic count does to her
craftily chosen end rhymes. It equalizes them as if they were digits,
and "mathematics" is one of the preferred terms Moore used to describe
her syllabic verse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  Ranking words in a hierarchy of lexical meanings that makes "dead." more
  important than -"ed" (or "an" or "pink") is as distorting to an
  understanding of the nature and workings of rhyme as traditional
  grammatical snobbery. So is generic ranking. The trick of breaking
  off a syllable from the front of a word is pulled out of the bag of
  conventions associated with comic verse, but here the play with "ac-
  / cident" occurs in a context that is not comic, where it makes a
  serious point: the synonymity of form and content.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It seems that Moore's rhymes in "The Fish," matching words that belong
to wholly unreconcilable parts of speech, are prized for their power
to shock us. They can jolt us into new ways of thinking about rhyme and
what it tells us about the nature of language and of poetry, making those
concerns part of Moore's characteristically opaque subject-matter (along
with such others as the unknowable mystery of the natural world, and its
ways of overturning our sense of relations among time and space, outward
and inward, surface and depth). "The Fish" seems to be leading us to see
beyond, beneath, through the "external" conventions--their analogues may
be worn-off "cornices"--that dictated centuries of rhyming practice. The
particular lens "The Fish" implicitly offers as an instrument to focus
our looking is the "Repeated / evidence" of its rhymes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another poem of Moore's brings end rhymes of the most iconoclastic kind
into sharper focus by using them to open four of its five stanzas:
"those":"echoes," "and":"hand," "a":"Persia," ["pear":"square,"]
"to":"su-." Like "The Fish," the poem itself begins with what is called
a run-on title: a phrase in the title space that starts a grammatical
sequence in the text. In this instance it starts a series of phrases and
clauses with no predicate but stopped by a period thirty lines later in
the second to last line of the second to last stanza:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The close, multiple likenesses between the three words of the title and
the first three words of the opening line--grammatical units in identical
order made of identical

<B></B>

demonstratives and adjectives modifying monosyllabic plural nouns--are
signals that the phrases are to be read in <I>apposition</I>. As
grammarians define the term, it means that these parallel phrases have
the identical reference; what they refer to the first rhymed couplet
points at. "Scalpels" and "sounds," themselves naming two classes of
phenomena seeming as nearly resistant to comparison as the grammatical
classes of "those" and "echoes," nevertheless both refer to, or are
analogues for, rhyme. The rest of the long, incomplete sentence catalogues
other entities: some "repeating . . . in reverse order," "all alike,"
"of uniform / and at the same time diverse, appearances." These phrases
tell us the items listed have in common that they, along with "Scalpels"
and "sounds," are references to, or are analogues for, rhymes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the last stanza, "these things" (the shift from "those" to "these"
locating the listed items nearby where the reader can see them on the
page) are collectively described as "rich / instruments with which to
experiment; naturally." Uncharacteristically, Moore's poem comes close to
explicitness here about what its subject-matter might be: experimental
rhyming. What its experiments discover about words, language, poetry,
and their relation to "things" in the phenomenal world, the poem expresses
only implicitly, very often obscurely.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Collective terms given in the last stanza and in the catalogue preparing
for it are unreliable in that they are not uniformly applicable to the
items listed. For instance, "things" names a category that scalpels
would usually be said to belong to (a more specific category would be
"instruments"), but not sounds. We would ordinarily be more likely to
call them by a term for intangible phenomena like <I>effects.</I> The
inclusive description given in stanza three--"a collection of little
objects"--would more emphatically exclude "sounds" because in our
habits of speech <I>object</I> more strictly than <I>thing</I> refers
to something we can see and touch, except in the grammatical sense of
<I>object.</I> (That meaning, we shall see, comes close to the surface
here.) The use of these ill fitting collective terms seems pointed when
contrasted with the way similar classifications in "The Jerboa"--"small
things," "little paired playthings"--are used to describe objects that
all belong equally to those categories.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even when exclusively visible and tangible things are listed together
as analogues for rhyme, they do not all have littleness in common. In
the sequence of "pear / and three bunches of grapes, tied with silver:
your dress, a magnificent square / cathedral tower," the "square /
. . . tower" is way out of scale in size with (though linked by sound to)
"pear." Beyond that, none of the items except "pear" and "grapes" seems
to have anything in common with the others as we ordinarily experience
them, so we find no grounds for comparing them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other res for rhyme in the catalogue present a different kind
of obstacle to comparison, compounded by the problems that Moore's
characteristically idiosyncratic punctuation puts in the way of
grammatical clarity. Some closely parallel phrases point to likenesses
in form and meaning among various analogues for rhyme while they also
intersect with other parallel phrases belonging to an altogether unrelated
field and sometimes a different ontological sphere. Here is a set of
examples from stanza two that shows this layering of parallels as if
"successively at random":

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your raised hand,

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the retoucher on the contemporary stone: your other hand, . . . .
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The phrases "your raised hand," "your cheeks," "your other hand"
(following "your hair," "your ears," "your eyes" in the first stanza)
are closely drawn parallels between parts of the body "re- / peating
. . . in reverse order" and rhyme. Then "your cheeks, those rosettes"
seems to set up a different kind of parallel, not drawing on repetition
of words, syntax, and semantic orientation, but on "intermingled echoes"
of famous poems in the tradition epitomized by Robert Burns's "My love is
like a red, red rose." The continuation in the next line of the clause
begun by "those rosettes" pushes aside the conventional simile--<I>your
cheeks are like roses</I>--and replaces it with an unexpected comparison
joining things so remotely similar that the parallel is almost buried
(as are the "lances all alike" that are "partly hid" by jeweled ornaments
in stanza three).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the final phase of layering, "those rosettes" is joined, by the rhyme
it initiates, with "those regrets." The lexical incompatibility of these
rhymed words is as difficult to resolve in its way as the grammatical
disagreement between end words in the kind of rhyme represented
by <I>love</I>:<I>of</I> (a pairing Moore used once, in "The Paper
Nautilus"). The untraversable lexical distance between "rosettes" and
"regrets" (which also bear no discoverable resemblance to other end
words), points to the conclusion that the parallel depends solely on
likeness of sound, absolutely independent of intelligibility.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here the rhyme is used as a lens to bring into focus a modern and
modernist view of language and its relation to the phenomenal world
that Malcolm Bowie described as fundamental to work by French poets of
Val&eacute;ry's generation, who were Moore's older contemporaries:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Sound-system and sense-system are heterogeneous, and the mystical echoes
which many nineteenth-century writers had heard traveling between them,
and suggesting the existence between them of some unfathomable kinship,
are heard no more. The relations between them are now a source of
intellectual tension and excitement.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Moore's poems, with special concentration in "Those Various Scalpels,"
they are also an encouragement to obliqueness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The rhyme "those rosettes":"those regrets" diagrams in little the great
divide between sound and sense, while the parallel between "Those Various
Scalpels," and "those various sounds" does something else that the poem
wants us to find primary. Or so it seems to suggest in the question
straddling its last lines: "But / why dissect destiny with instruments
which / are more highly specialized than the tissues of destiny itself?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By describing the rhymes in the poem (including the one completed
in the question itself where "which" echoes "rich / experiments") as
"more highly specialized" than need be for discovering a new way of
understanding rhyme, the closing question raises playful doubts about
the necessity for the extravagant obliqueness of the poem's

<B></B>

procedures. Its collective categories that seem not wholly applicable
to what they describe, and its layering of parallels, analogues,
comparisons to rhyme based on distant or obscure or undiscoverable
likenesses, are "too highly specialized." The question hints at a
simpler, primary understanding of the issues in the poem that the poem
has not directly led us to, has "disguised," "hid," made "indistinct" or
"ambiguous": all words sprinkled inconspicuously among the items in the
catalogue. This obscured but basic understanding is discoverable in the
opening rhyme words that end adjacent lines in each stanza, even though
here the exaggeratedly uneven lengths of the coupled lines puts a wide
distance between the rhymes so that their "echoes" are "indistinct."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As in "The Fish," the first member of each pair is a single word by
itself constituting the line, so that it is isolated for scrutiny as if
in the visual field of a microscope. When we look at the one seemingly
ill-fitting instance of "pear," we can picture--cannot prevent ourselves
from picturing--an object, much as it would be drawn on the page of a
children's book with PEAR written below. When we stare through the lens at
"those," "and," "a," or "to" we see only letters making a word. We may
hardly be aware of its sound because the echo that calls attention to it
takes so long to be heard. Still, because "pear" is placed in a sequence
of other words of similar size and identical position doing the same
work of rhyming, they are all understood to belong to a common category.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although "those," "and," "a," "to" cannot be included among "a collection
of little objects" in the phenomenal sense, they can be objects in the
grammatical sense--as Moore used the word in the title of her essay
"Subject, Predicate, Object"--because they all belong, equally with
"pear," to the category of word, and any word appreciated for itself,
which Eliot praised Moore for doing, is a noun. In their own simple terms,
"those," "and," "a," "to" lead us to read the title-sentence of this
essay as stating the obvious: that "<I>Love</I> rhymes with <I>of.</I>"
must be understood to mean "the word <I>love</I> rhymes with the word
<I>of.</I>" What binds <I>love</I> and <I>of</I> together beyond their
likeness of sound has nothing to do with their lexical and grammatical
meanings, but everything to do with their common nature and status as
words. Purely as words, stripped of all conventional misconceptions
about them, they become nouns. Stevens was perhaps the first besides
Moore among their contemporaries to recognize and use the ontological
truth of this grammatical event in poems: he condensed it in his famous,
playful, only seemingly obscure phrase "The the."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The primary understanding of language that Moore's radical rhymes lead
to is more widely based even than the recognition that sound and sense
are heterogeneous. In "Those Various Scalpels," her iconoclastic rhymes
bring into sharp focus the unbridgeable ontological gap between words
and the phenomena they point to "at random." What Williams said in his
discussion of all true poems can equally describe the words that Moore's
poems are made with: that they have "a separate existence uncompelled
by nature or the supernatural."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
  Necessarily the rhymes they make do not echo some universal harmony
  but only their own phonetic effects, and the poet does not act in the
  poem as an intermediary authority who discovers the conjunction of
  language with phenomena of this world or beyond it.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The poet of "The Fish" is as rigorously excluded as grammar will allow,
although the extravagantly strict arrangement and minute word play in
the poem call attention to the suppressed poet's verbal feats. "Those
Various Scalpels," implies the presence of an agent shaping the raw
material of the poem by another of Moore"s inconspicuous scatterings
of words with like associations: "struck," "sculptured," "sown," "set,"
"made," "tied," "Whetted." Beginning with "struck" in the opening lines,
they hint at the work of an artisan skilled in using the tools of various
trades. Simultaneously, the first stanza res the poet as a performer
at a street fair, striking sounds "from thin glasses successively at
random," publicly making private and precarious music.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moore's small, simple opening rhyme words are ordinary, unspecialized
verbal objects like "glasses": everyday things put to use as musical
instruments. The tune they play fulfills the antipoetic ideals of
modernism. Though "indistinct," creating what Sylvia Adamson described
as the "illusion of a natural speech which falls into rhyme almost
accidentally,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
  the "sounds" made by the artisan-street-performer-poet can be
  heard among the "highly specialized" experiments that are also a
  characteristic of modernist poems. Yet another of their defining
  features is their capacity to make fun of their own obscurity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Elizabeth Bishop remembered that Marianne Moore "made contemporary
poets self-conscious about their crudities, afraid to rhyme 'bone' with
'stone,'" and that once Moore congratulated her for the (Moore-ish)
rhyme "antennae" with "many."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
  Auden admitted to having "stolen a great deal" from Moore, and by 1936
  was himself rhyming <I>love</I> with <I>of</I>; Moore took amused
  notice that he was not "too fettered to use 'who,' 'he,' 'the,' or
  'which,' as an end rhyme."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
  Richard Wilbur acknowledged having been "very charmed" by Moore's poetry
  and "undoubtedly influenced" by it, and the repeated evidence of James
  Merrill's rhymes makes it entirely likely that he learned from hers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
  The examples of these and other strong poets following Moore have made
  her most vehemently anticonventional rhymes accessible for poets to
  use for their own, quite different, effects.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Something like this assimilation or accommodation has followed every
revolution in rhyming. According to Henry Lanz, when the "classical rules
are violated . . . so frequently that the poets' disregard for them can
no longer be considered a mere license," then for "many poets licenses
become rules. Out of the chaos of individual experiments new principles
begin to arise."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
  A further dimension of this process is that when subversive rhymes
  become accepted practice among the poets whose influence defines the
  norms for their generation, then those rhymes have a different role
  in the production of meaning.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A sequence of couplets in Thom Gunn's "Memoirs of the World" can show this
transformation of anticlassical rhyming, even of Moore's most radical,
agrammatical type: <I>of</I>:<I>love.</I> The contrast in rhyming effects
is sharpened because the passage from Gunn's poem bears some resemblance
to "The Fish" in that it leads the reader to look into the depths at
aquatic creatures seen like "cells" through the lens of a microscope:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The distances here between words paired in end rhymes, their mismatchings
in sound, structure, accent, lexical and grammatical meanings are
as exaggerated as in many of Moore's experiments, but no particular
attention is directed to the fact of their incompatibility. By contrast
with Moore's extravagantly imbalanced line lengths, the largely even
lineation of Gunn's couplets prevents the rhyme words from standing out
to be specially noticed. They are meant to be taken for granted.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Adding to this leveling effect, the rhyme pairs in this passage
are all without exception mismatched in their various ways as they
are, for instance, in poems of Wilfred Owen, whereas Moore included
instances of classical rhyming to call attention to the eccentricity
of her experiments. Here even before the "cells swimming in concert"
are disturbed in the second couplet-- "But look at / the intruder"--the
word "concert" is inharmoniously joined with "effort." Irregular rhymes
here are not "mutations"; they are the norm. Even "of":"love" is not
distinguished in its oddity from a near rhyme like "concert":"effort,"
the kind Eliot described as merely a deviation from the classical model
and not an overthrow of it. These differences in verbal treatment offer
concrete explanations of our differences in response to the same types
of anticlassical rhyming.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A more conceptual way of thinking about why we are not taken aback or
baffled by Gunn's rhyming, as we can be by Moore's, is suggested in Clive
Scott's statement that the rhyming practices of a culture or period can
be seen as "continually endorsing the intellectual and emotional stance
of an ideology."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
  What Moore's antitraditional rhymes express--that language and the
  phenomenal world coexist without intersecting, as 
  
<B></B>


parallels that
  never meet--has by now become so deeply embedded in the ideology of
  our culture and time that it is not held up to be questioned; Gunn's
  rhymes no longer need to proselytize about these issues.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Why, then, can we still be surprised and uneasily amused by Moore's rhymes
built on the model of <I>love</I>:<I>of</I>? Besides the fact that they
use every imaginable verbal means to startle, bemuse, and amuse their
readers by their eccentric behavior, they are aided by circumstances of
history and habit. Most readers of poetry even now are more familiar with,
and therefore more at ease with, poems written over some four hundred and
fifty years of traditional rhyming than with modernist and more recent
poetry. According to Wilbur, "most poets who choose to rhyme, nowadays,
are troubled about using easy rhymes and are embarrassed about using
their own rhymes more than once."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
  Readers are more likely to be troubled by unfamiliar, anticlassical
  rhymes when they call attention to their departures from tradition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Or to describe differently the roles of habit and history in shaping
our responses to Moore's iconoclastic rhymes: our ideology is not
easily compatible with what Marie Borroff described as our "naive or
commonsensical account of the conceptual implications of our inherited
parts-of-speech system."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
  The grammatical distinction between words in the separate and
  traditionally unequal classes that <I>love</I> and <I>of</I> belong to
  still has shaping power over our workaday understanding of language
  in relation to the things of this world. We still have an immediate,
  unexamined sense that the descriptive content of <I>pear</I> connects
  it with a piece of fruit, making it possible for us to conceive of them
  in relation to one another, which is what traditional rhyme teaches
  us to do. Whereas <I>a</I> is inherently empty of reference; in our
  hierarchical system of grammatical classes it could not legitimately
  be used in a rhyme with <I>pear,</I> which Marianne Moore vehemently
  insisted on doing, and Gunn might be quite likely to do without our
  noticing. It is tempting, but probably irresponsible, to think that
  this gap between our responses still shaped by inherited common sense
  notions and our contemporary ideology is implicitly acknowledged in
  Gunn's line, "There is coupling where no such should be."

much earlier phase of English not yet fully emerged from inflectional
grammar. Wimsatt's example of Chaucerian rhyming is a sequence from
the Knight's portrait: "he," "worthynesse," "ded," "wildernesse,"
"kyndenesse," where the <I>esse</I> endings are close to what Aristotle
called <I>homoeoteleuton</I> (identical or similar inflectional case
endings). In contrast, Wimsatt characterized Pope's rhyme pairs as more
widely differing in parts of speech or in function of the same parts
of speech, in lexical meaning, and in syllabic structure, differences
heightened by the reliance of Pope's couplets on parallel structure and
epigrammatic point.

The bohemian as a social stereotype first found definition on the pages
of Parisian popular magazines sometime around the mid-1840s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  Associated with the carefree and impoverished existence of artists
  on the fringes of middle-class life, the bohemian gained a surprising
  degree of symbolic importance among his contemporaries. Indeed, he came
  to be seen as the first embodiment of the artist of modernity and the
  privileged interpreter of aesthetic truths in contemporary society.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Although the social and personal aspects of the bohemian way of life
  have become clich&eacute;s, the cultural meanings and implications of
  the phenomenon remain full of contradiction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These contradictions were already apparent in Henri Murger's
<I>Sc&egrave;nes de la vie de boh&egrave;me,</I> a series of amusing
vignettes about artistic life in the Latin Quarter that was published
serially in <I>Le Corsaire-Satan</I> between 1845 and 1849 and was to
serve as a model for all later depictions of the bohemian type. Bohemians,
Murger wrote in the 1851 preface to his book, "are not a race of
today, they have existed in all climes and ages, and can claim an
illustrious descent," from Homer, through Michelangelo, Moli&egrave;re
and Shakespeare, all the way to Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  As legitimate heirs to all great artistic traditions of the past,
  bohemians were, Murger implied, ahistorical res, embodying
  transcendental artistic values. Murger, however, did not stop at this
  point but proceeded to make a further, seemingly contradictory, claim.

<B></B>

The bohemian was not only the timeless artist but also a quintessentially
modern social type whose activities were defined by the new commercial
realities of the cultural marketplace. Unlike his romantic predecessors,
whom Murger dismissed as "obstinate dreamers," the true bohemian was
a successful professional and artistic entrepreneur who had learned
to create publicity for his products and to negotiate the cultural
marketplace for his own advantage (<I>Sb,</I> 34). Bohemia was,
Murger insisted, not a permanent way of life but rather a period of
apprenticeship, a transitional phase in the young artist's life that,
like any business venture, could lead to financial success and social
recognition but also to ruin and bankruptcy. In Murger's words, bohemia
was merely a preface before "the Academy, the Hotel de Dieu, or the
Morgue" (<I>Sb,</I> 34).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Historians and theorists of bohemianism have tended to perpetuate
these seemingly incompatible interpretive frames through which Murger
originally explained the meaning of bohemia to his contemporaries. Like
Murger, contemporary commentators have oscillated between visions of
the bohemian as a creator of transcendental art and as a characteristic
product of capitalist modernity. The first position has been argued
by literary historians like Matei Calinescu and Gene Bell-Vilada, who
have identified bohemians with the invention of l'art pour l'art and a
protomodernist aesthetic that would eventually lead to modern abstraction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  On the other side, Walter Benjamin has claimed that the true
  significance of the bohemian lay within the tensions of capitalism,
  which radicalized the modern artist but also transformed him into a
  cultural commodity bought and sold in the marketplace.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  The historian Jerrold Seigel also has seen the bohemian as a product
  of bourgeois modernity, though he placed the emphasis on the social
  rather than the economic aspects of his function. For Seigel, the
  bohemian should be regarded as a liminal re who acted out the inner
  contradictions of bourgeois individualism and helped reconcile modern
  society's opposing needs for social order and self-expression. Pierre
  Bourdieu, too, has stressed the role of the capitalist marketplace in
  the emergence of bohemia, but he also has argued that the bohemian
  found a modus vivendi with capitalism by creating an independent
  intellectual field and becoming a pioneer of aesthetic autonomy or
  l'art pour l'art in the modern world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As valuable and suggestive as these visions of the bohemian are in
themselves, they fail to provide a fully contextualized, historically
specific image of the bohemian. They lack convincing empirical or
theoretical connections between the social spaces that the bohemian
inhabited and the aesthetic function that he fulfilled in modern
society. The bohemian as social type appears detached from, if not in
direct conflict with, the bohemian as aesthetic creator. In other words,
what seems absent in contemporary theories of bohemia is the cultural
middle ground that could connect the social and the aesthetic dimensions
of the bohemian and thus reestablish the historical specificity and
concreteness of the re.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I will argue that the missing cultural image of the bohemian preceded
the social and aesthetic types by almost a generation and needs
to be sought in a radical artistic subculture that emerged in the
late-1820s and early-1830s and defined itself in opposition to bourgeois
modernity. Curiously, historians and theorists of bohemia have tended
to underplay the importance of this early bohemian moment, regarding it
as simply an

<B></B>

immature version of a later phenomenon depicted in Murger's imaginative
work. There are a number of reasons for this critical neglect of the
cultural origins of bohemian identity. Perhaps most obvious is the
uncertainty surrounding its name. It was not until the late-1840s,
thanks in large part to Murger's popular stories, that the word
"bohemian" came to be associated exclusively with artistic life in modern
societies. Before Murger, "bohemia" had a number of nonaesthetic meanings,
long-forgotten by later ages. The word "bohemian" could refer to gypsies,
who were thought to have originated in Bohemia, to socially marginal
urban types with uncertain sources of livelihood, as well as to colorful
members of the criminal underground depicted in melodramas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  However, once the concept of bohemia found its permanent definition
  as an artistic identity in the late-1840s, it was frequently applied
  retrospectively to the 1830s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A more important reason for the relative oblivion surrounding the re
of the cultural bohemian of the 1830s is its subversive implications for
later interpretations of aesthetic modernism. Ultimately, the cultural
bohemian is incompatible with ideas about the modernist artist that gained
increasing importance from the latter half of the nineteenth century
on. Indeed, he problematizes the very notion of social and aesthetic
autonomy, long considered central to the identity of the modernist
artist. As I hope to show in the following pages, the bohemian of the
1830s emerged from a complex reworking of themes and images common in
early-nineteenth-century popular culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  Bohemian identity was symbiotically linked to popular romanticism
  and the melodrama, which were losing ground to more respectable,
  bourgeois artistic forms by the early 1830s. The image of the bohemian
  as a theatrical performer who reenacted and eventually reaestheticized
  the subversive forms of popular culture is obviously incompatible with
  the traditional vision of the bohemian as the producer of high culture
  and canonical art that began with Murger.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What were the historical preconditions that explain the emergence of the
cultural bohemian? What were his characteristic features? What were the
sources of his vision of modernity and how did he implement them within
the historical world? My attempt to answer these questions is based on
a historically informed phenomenology that returns to the early sources
of bohemianism with the intention of contextualizing them and retrieving
their original meanings. This is, in many ways, a traditional historical
undertaking that is deeply concerned with the meaning of texts and their
relationships to contexts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  It is also unconventional, however, in the sense that I define the
  nature of both contexts and texts in fundamentally different terms from
  traditional intellectual history. Instead of assuming the context to be
  an objectively given social or political space within which the texts
  find a stable set of meanings, I see context as a mediated cultural
  realm that is itself in need of interpretation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  The texts of my investigation also take on a different aspect once
  they are defined as cultural, rather than social, phenomena. I see the
  bohemian self as a collective rather than an individual identity that
  acquired its meanings from performative gestures enacted within the
  generic conventions of specific cultural forms. Thus, my exploration
  of the historical trajectory of the cultural bohemian will carry
  me from the world of the romantic drama, the melodrama, and the
  com&eacute;die-Vaudeville all the way to the allegorical romance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is no accident that the earliest appearance of the bohemian as
a cultural re was in the context of a theatrical scandal that
transgressed social and cultural norms and shocked all of Paris. The
"Battle of <I>Hernani,</I>" as the event came to be called, is worth
recounting in some detail since it represents the first time the bohemian
appeared as a public re in French cultural life and illustrates the
ways this re was interconnected with the problematic of the romantic
drama. The battle took place on the opening night of Victor Hugo's
<I>Hernani,</I> scheduled to be performed at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Fran&ccedil;aise on 28 February 1830.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  The controversial play was eagerly awaited by Parisian audiences, who
  saw the event as a showdown between romanticism and classicism and as
  an apotheosis of the battle between the moderns and the ancients that
  had been raging for at least two decades.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  Seats were sold out for opening night weeks ahead, and Hugo was
  bombarded by requests for complimentary tickets by such luminaries as
  Benjamin Constant, Adolphe Thiers, and Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e,
  who had been unable to obtain tickets at the box office. Fearing that
  <I>Hernani</I> might become the occasion for political turbulence,
  the progovernment paper <I>La Quotidienne</I> warned, "However great
  importance the performance of 'Hernani' may have for the republic of
  letters, the French monarchy cannot be concerned about it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What, in fact, occurred during the opening night of <I>Hernani</I> was a
different kind of scandal from what the audience had anticipated. The real
outrage of the evening hinged not on the innovations of Hugo's play but
on his youthful followers, who gathered to support the romantic dramatist
against his classicist foes. According to Hugo's account of the event,
his own actions helped transform the performance of <I>Hernani</I> from an
aesthetic controversy of predictable outcome into a cultural scandal of
major proportions. This innovation had to do with the author's decision
to forgo the well-established custom of hiring professional clappers to
ensure the success of his play and to rely on his own unpaid supporters
among the students and artists of the Latin Quarter. When reproached
for the foolhardiness of this venture, Hugo responded that a new art
form needed a new audience that would resemble the play and that this
new audience was to be found among "the young people, poets, painters,
sculptors, musicians, print makers etc." who would come to support the
play of their own free will ("VH," 456).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hugo's calculation that he could rely on the loyal support of the hundreds
of students, artists, and intellectuals who idolized romanticism was
not mistaken. The defense of <I>Hernani</I> was organized by his young
adherents with all the skill and precision of a military campaign. Key
followers like G&eacute;rard de Nerval, Th&eacute;ophile Gautier,
and Petrus Borel acted as organizers who generated lists of recruits
among their acquaintances in the Latin Quarter and made sure that they
showed up on opening night. Inside the theater, they scattered in small
groups in the pit and the galleries and acted as coordinated cheering
squadrons for the play. They countered every hiss from the audience with
louder applause, and the commotion in the audience rivaled in interest
the actual drama being performed on stage. As one of the reviewers of
the play commented the following day, "The spectators were on the same
plane as the actors on the stage and they performed as epileptics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  The success of <I>Hernani</I> was ensured by the

<B></B>

fourth act, and between the fourth and fifth acts, Hugo was approached
by the representative of a publishing house, offering to publish the play
for the sum of 6,000 francs. The deal was concluded and signed at a nearby
tobacco vendor's, and Hugo received the 6,000 francs in cash on the spot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the next four months following the scandalous first night (there
was to be a run of forty-five performances), the young romanticists
continued their organized defense of <I>Hernani,</I> which had become
a sacred cause. Writing eight years after the performance, Gautier
remembered <I>Hernani</I> as a mock-heroic battlefield on which

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the champions of romanticism and the athletes of classicism clashed
and fought with all the unparalleled fury and passionate ardor that
only literary antagonism can provoke; each verse was taken and retaken
in assault. One evening, it was the romanticists who lost a speech,
the next, they recaptured it and the classicists, beaten, brought to
another line a formidable artillery of hisses, bird calls, screeches,
and the combat was re-engaged with even more spirit.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From the perspective of forty years later, Gautier was to provide an
even more revealing evaluation of the significance of the Battle of
<I>Hernani.</I> The opening night<I>,</I> Gautier recalled, was "the
greatest event of the century, since it represented the inauguration of
free, youthful, and new thought on the debris of old routine." It was
the battle "of youth against decrepitude, of long hair against baldness,
of enthusiasm against routine, of the future against the past." The
visual contrast between the youthful defenders of romanticism and its
balding opponents was, for Gautier, a living panorama of the state of
contemporary culture. "It was sufficient to cast one's gaze on this
public," he illustrated, "to be convinced that this was no ordinary
occurrence; what was at stake here were two systems, two parties, two
armies, it is no exaggeration to say, two civilizations, who hated each
other cordially."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gautier's hyperbolic account accurately conveys the hidden agenda of
the Battle of <I>Hernani.</I> The real significance of the mock-heroic
battle was, it turns out, not the triumph of romanticism over classicism,
which was a foregone conclusion by 1830, but the transformation of the
long-standing aesthetic conflict into a more modern cultural antagonism,
that of artist versus bourgeois, bohemian versus philistine. The
Battle of <I>Hernani</I> witnessed the emergence of radical artists
as a recognizable, collective presence in public life. It represented
the first enactment of the bohemian identity in modern culture. The
theatrical scandal also saw the crystallization of the concept of the
philistine, a term that referred to a newly self-assertive middle class
that assumed the mantle of classicism and came to serve as the defender
of transcendental values, Christian morals, and social stability in
contemporary literary life.

We have become so habituated to the seeming inevitability of the
antagonism between bohemian and bourgeois that we fail to ask why it
emerged at the particular

<B></B>

moment it did and why it took the forms that it did. To say that the
bohemian artist was the natural antagonist of the bourgeois, its radical
"Other," is, in a sense, a tautology that does not explain the historical
particularity of the re. If the bohemian is to be understood as a
cultural phenomenon in his own right, he has to be seen in terms of his
own agendas, his own version of self and modernity that was calculated
not only to shock the modern bourgeois but also to provide a radical
alternative to his vision.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This alternative vision cannot be found in any literary text or
ideological tract produced by members of bohemia. It was, rather,
performed through gestures, clothes, lifestyle, and interior decoration.

  The bohemian acted out his opposition to philistine modernity, above
  all, by dressing up in outrageous costumes. Extravagant clothing
  and appearance played, in fact, a central symbolic and ideological
  role in the confrontation between the young romanticists and their
  opponents at the Battle of <I>Hernani.</I> Their striking costumes
  distinguished Hugo's followers not only from the classicists but also,
  significantly, from the older generation of romanticists who dressed
  according to formal bourgeois conventions. Victor Hugo's bemused
  description of the appearance of his young supporters on the opening
  night of <I>Hernani</I> provides telling proof of how clothing redrew
  cultural boundaries, not only between romanticists and classicists
  but also, implicitly, between romanticists and bohemians. "From one

the numerous pedestrians of the rue Richelieu saw a growing band of wild

and backs articles of clothing from every century and clime, and this
in the midst of Paris and in broad daylight. The bourgeois were stopped
short in their path, stupefied and indignant. M. Th&eacute;ophile Gautier
was a particular insult to their eyes, in a scarlet satin waistcoat and
thick long hair cascading down his back. ["VH," 460]

Gautier, too, makes special mention of the important role that costume
played in the activities of the young romanticists. They were convinced,
he writes, that the evening that was to inaugurate "free, youthful,
and new thought on the debris of old routines" needed to be celebrated
"with an appropriate toilette, some costume, splendid and bizarre, that
would honor the master, the school and the play" (<I>Hr,</I> 79). The
champions of the future took pride, Gautier assures us, in not looking
like notaries and modeled themselves on characters from Renaissance
paintings, romantic dramas, and Gothic novels. Even those who could not
afford the expense of satin, velvet, and military braid necessary to
duplicate their visions of Rubens or Velasquez still managed to look
colorful and romantic in makeshift costumes. Of all the imaginative
outfits of the evening, Gautier's red satin waistcoat, meticulously
tailored for the occasion, seemed most successful in capturing the spirit
of provocation and eccentricity that was the essence of the event. It
became not only the symbol of the Battle of <I>Hernani</I> but of
Gautier's entire career. As he remarked ironically in his reminiscences,

In order to understand the serious symbolic and ideological implications
of these seemingly frivolous gestures, it is necessary to extend our
analysis beyond the Battle of <I>Hernani</I> to the broader landscape
of Parisian artistic and intellectual culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  The fashion for beards, long hair, and historical costumes did not
  begin with the Battle of <I>Hernani</I> but went back to around 1827,
  when artists and intellectuals began for the first time to dress up in
  clothes that affronted the conventional dress code of the bourgeoisie.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  Young men were to be seen everywhere sporting Venetian outfits from
  the sixteenth century, Polish military uniforms from Brandenburg,
  Hungarian hussars' mantles, oriental robes of all kinds, which were
  worn as markers of artistic identity and personal distinction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  The young artists in historical costumes carefully distinguished
  themselves from the fashionable dandies or "lions" of the time, who
  dressed according to the latest fashion imported from England.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  After 1830, the taste for exotic costumes among young people became
  so pervasive that visitors to Paris invariably commented on it as a
  central feature of the city's cultural landscape. Frances Trollope,
  writing of Paris in 1835, repeatedly returns to the spectacle of
  the "jeune gens de Paris" (young people of Paris) who were visible
  everywhere and whose gestures were seen by everyone as "something great,
  terrible, volcanic, and sublime."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  The theatricality of these costumes prompted another visitor in 1835
  to comment, "One would have thought that certain of the newer plays
  had sent out their characters into the street."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So deep-seated was the association between eccentric historical
costumes and the modern artistic life that it was still echoed in
popular definitions of social types that became prevalent in the
1840s. In obvious reference to the fashion of the previous decade, we
find the following definition of the "Man of Letters" in the multivolume
encyclopedia of urban social types, published in 1842 under the title
of <I>Les Fran&ccedil;ais peints par eux-m&ecirc;mes</I>: "The man of
letters wants to transform himself and to appear like the resuscitated
inhabitant of another century. . . . One can thus encounter the hairstyle
of Saint-Louis in the omnibus, the beard of Henri III on the railway,
and the hat of the Duke de Guise in the restaurant."

Why did the young romanticists choose to enact their opposition to
bourgeois modernity through the literal embodiment of medieval, and
more generally, exotic images? What were the cultural and ideological
implications of their carnivalesque performances? The dominant approach
to this question has generally taken a political and ideological turn. It
has been argued convincingly that young artists who idolized the medieval
world were motivated by historical nostalgia, by a regressive desire to
return to an originary golden age that had been lost to modernity but
still haunted it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This view was already put forward by the journalist Delecluze, who, as
early as 1832, raised the question of why young artists grew beards and
sported long hair as gestures of identification with the Middle Ages. He
suggested that the young generation found it necessary to return to the
Middle Ages in order to "retrieve the correct path that was abandoned
by the writers and artists of the so-called Renaissance under Francis
I and of classicism under Louis XIV." Contemporary medievalism, in
Delecluze's view, was thus a philosophic and ideological repudiation of
the Enlightenment and a reactionary search for a spiritual home in the
distant past. As he concluded, "long beards sported by isolated men in
a population without beards are sure proof of a desire on their part to
restore, to regenerate, some old custom or ancient tastes that had been
worn out by time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Plausible as this explanation is on the surface, it becomes problematic on
closer examination. In the first place, the young bohemians were neither
authoritarian, nor religious, nor hierarchical in orientation; they were,
on the contrary, irreverent, antimoralistic, and transgressive. In the
second place, no literal relationship existed between their medievalism
and an empirically or politically defined past. They appropriated their
vision of the middle ages not from history books and archives but from
Gothic novels, fashionable romances, romantic dramas, and melodramas,
whose colorful images saturated the world of popular culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  In the context of the time, one has to conclude that their stylized
  medievalism represented not so much a conservative repudiation of the
  modern world as a polemical gesture of support for the popular forms
  of modern urban culture. Through these gestures, bohemians signaled
  that they were opposed not so much to modernity in general but to a
  particular bourgeois manifestation of modern culture that was in the
  process of emerging in the 1830s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The testimonials of the bohemians themselves unmistakably reinforce this
interpretation. Ars&egrave;ne Houssay, for instance, a member of Gautier's
early circle, explained that their outlandish costumes signaled their
"common revolt against all prejudice, I might say against all laws."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
  Characteristic of their group, wrote Maxime du Camp some years later,
  was "a general repudiation of acceptable habits and common customs,"
  especially those of the "abhorrent bourgeois."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  His scarlet waistcoat, claimed Gautier, represented a "symbolic protest
  against the grayness of modern life" (<I>Hr,</I> 79).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to understand the full implications of these subversive gestures,
we need to regard them as manifestations not of reactionary politics but
of an essentially modern cultural phenomenon that anticipated the radical
youth movements of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The
sociologist Dick Hebdige has entitled these movements "spectacular
subcultures" since they create collective and personal identity

<B></B>

through public spectacle and performance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  Their defining feature is the ability to invest objects, gestures,
  everyday practices with subversive meanings and thus to invent
  "style." It is through "style" that subcultures disrupt the "authorized
  codes through which the social world is organized and experienced"
  and thus bring into doubt the implicit values and moral norms of the
  majority. In this sense, all subcultures pose "symbolic challenges to
  a symbolic order" (<I>S,</I> 91, 92). Subcultures represent more than
  mere gestures of defiance or rebellion against the established order,
  however. The broader significance of these movements, according to
  Hebdige and others, derives from their links to the often hidden
  or unacknowledged contradictions of mainstream society. Spectacular
  subcultures act out the latent ideological, economic, and cultural
  tensions that exist in the larger culture as a whole. Theirs is, in
  Hebdige's words, "a coded response to changes affecting the entire
  community" (<I>S,</I> 80).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The bohemian subculture of the 1830s was also an integral part of a
broader social and ideological conflict that found its most concrete
and visible incarnation in the realm of the theater. Gautier was
ultimately referring to this phenomenon in his reminiscences of the
Battle of <I>Hernani</I> when he claimed that the antagonism between
artist and bourgeois represented not merely aesthetic disagreements but
ideological and cultural incompatibilities that implied nothing less
than the clash of two civilizations. On the one side was romantic drama
and its ancestor, the melodrama, which embodied a distinctly populist
and dynamic conception of modernity still deeply anchored within the
ethos of the French Revolution; on the other side was, not classicism,
but the com&eacute;die-Vaudeville, which represented a more respectable,
bourgeois cultural ethic triumphantly claiming ground by the 1830s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The meanings of bohemianism were coded in terms of these theatrical
conflicts, but its historical fate was also intricately tied to their
eventual outcome. At this point, therefore, it is necessary to broaden
our analysis from the actual phenomenon of bohemianism to the cultural
context within which it took shape. The changing world of French popular
drama, and in particular the melodrama, provides the keys to the eventual
fate of the cultural bohemian.

The melodrama has moved to the forefront of literary and critical debates
during the past two decades since the publication of Peter Brooks's
groundbreaking <I>The Melodramatic Imagination.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  This recent body of research has essentially transformed the image of
  the melodrama from a vulgarized and unsophisticated popular genre into
  the essential prototype of all later forms of modern popular culture,
  including the novel. In light of these recent interpretations of
  the melodrama, the bohemians' symbolic identification with the genre
  becomes understandable.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There seems to be a consensus in the literature that
early-nineteenth-century melodrama was the cultural heir of revolutionary
politics and the tangible embodiment of modern experience. This is fully
supported by such contemporary texts as the <I>Trait&eacute; du</I>
m&eacute;lodrame, an anonymous tract of 1817 that spelled out most of
the salient meanings

<B></B>

and characteristics of the melodrama for the age. "It is sufficient
to note in the interest of the chronology of art," wrote the author,
"that the first plays that were an emanation of this divine substance
[the melodrama] attained their success during the revolution. Great
political convulsions have this characteristic that they inject into
the spirit a kind of inner anguish which devours it and even when the
storm passes, the anguish remains."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The melodrama was, however, more than a simple reflection of the political
turbulence of the revolution. It was also a therapeutic response to it,
providing, according to our theorist, comfort and intensity of experience
to the suffering individuals who lived through the terrible convulsions
of the age. "Where would we be," he queried, "if the emotional needs
for plenitude that the revolution had awakened within us had not found
a means of satisfaction in the Melodrama?" (<I>Tm,</I> 41) The new art,
he continued, was a luminous presence for contemporary humanity that
"enlightens those with the least discerning eyes; warms the most luke-warm
temperaments; regenerates the most arid imagination . . . [and] satisfies
all tastes, enchants both sexes, and captivates all ages" (<I>Tm,</I> 7).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Behind the excessive rhetoric lies a suggestive historical assessment
of the function of the melodrama in postrevolutionary culture that
only recently has been taken seriously by literary scholars. The
melodrama satisfied the newly awakened taste for public excitement and
passionate spectacle that originally had been nourished by revolutionary
events. But it also provided a language and ideology that could explain
the meaning of these events and make transparent to ordinary citizens
the hidden workings of the modern world. Ultimately, the melodrama was
an object lesson in revolutionary justice, transposing onto the plane of
private life the abstract moral and ideological values of revolutionary
politics. It demonstrated the cosmic struggle between the forces of good
and evil as it played out within the realm of individual consciousness. It
affirmed the inevitable triumph of individual innocence, perseverance, and
steadfastness against the evil machinations of tyrants and villains. In
Peter Brooks's words, the melodrama articulated "simple truths and
relationships" and "the cosmic moral sense of everyday gestures."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Equally significant was the unambiguously democratic and universal nature
of the new art form. It spoke in a populist style that appealed to both
the poorest and most uneducated classes as well as the to the middle
orders, providing them with a common vocabulary and common images for
conceptualizing the nature of modern cultural experience. This experience
was given shape through formulaic characters and plot structures that
required little or no knowledge of the sophisticated conventions of
the classic theater. The stock characters of the melodrama, writes the
treatise, consisted of "a buffoon, a tyrant, an innocent and persecuted
woman, a knight, and . . . some domesticated animals" (<I>Tm,</I>
9). The tyrant, who embodied absolute corruption and pure evil, was
"placed in the melodrama to try the patience and virtue of his victims"
(<I>Tm,</I> 14). After much suspense and the extremes of vicissitude,
the outcome of the melodrama was a foregone conclusion: "the tyrant will
be killed at the end of the play, virtue will triumph, and the knight
will marry the innocent and unhappy woman, etc." (<I>Tm,</I> 10).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

The melodrama was the characteristic expression of modernity since it
gave voice to the emotions of ordinary people who faced the tribulations
of a destabilized historical world. At its core, it contained a radical
ethic of individual emancipation that was subversive of traditional
social order and political authority. The melodramatic hero and heroine
were invariably of uncertain birth and ambiguous social status, and
they ultimately triumphed over illegitimate power, personified by the
villain or the tyrant. It is true that at the end they often regained
an exalted social position from which they had been unjustly deprived,
but the significance of their actions, nevertheless, resided in their
personal fortitude and inner reserves of strength rather than their
external resources. The central truth of the melodrama revolved around the
sanctity of individual consciousness and interiority--defined in terms of
virtue, patience, perseverance, sensibility, and honesty--which prevailed
over external misfortune and evil. The virtuous knight was ultimately the
incarnation of the new individual born of the French Revolution. He was
the self-conscious citizen and the sentimental hero in one, who "carries
the civil code in his pocket and a sword in his hand, so that he may
learn on the one count what he must defend on the other" (<I>Tm,</I> 72).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For young bohemians concerned with the emancipation of passion,
imagination, and artistic liberty, the appeal of the melodramatic
tradition is not surprising. Gautier devoted a significant part of his
critical oeuvre to the actors, actresses and, impresarios of the melodrama
and admitted at one point to a deep inner identification with the great
pioneers of the tradition. "O Guilbert de Pix&eacute;ricourt! O Victor
Ducange!" he exclaimed, "Misunderstood Shakespeares, Goethes of the
Boulevard du Temple, with what pious care, with what filial respect
. . . we have studied your gigantic conceptions, forgotten by the
previous generation!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  In a tribute to his friend, the melodramatist J. Bouchardy, Gautier
  made a similar point, "What gave strength to Bouchardy was his
  profound seriousness, his unshakable conviction. He believed that he
  had succeeded in discovering the modern formula in art; and those who
  have this conviction are truly happy because they communicate with
  others and dominate their public" (<I>Hr,</I> 161).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gautier and his fellow bohemians saw in the melodrama the heroic epic of
modernity. It represented the quintessentially modern form of imagination
that had been the first to repudiate the tyranny of classical tragedy
and comedy and had opened the path to a truly modern form of cultural
expression. In this sense, the melodrama embodied the hidden, populist
roots of romanticism and helps explain the deepest reasons for the
bohemians' defense of romanticist art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
  Their aesthetic affinities were permeated with philosophic and
  ideological implications having to do with the meaning of modernity
  itself. For these aesthetic affinities to crystallize into a distinct
  cultural stance, however, something more was needed than inner
  sympathy. Social and aesthetic pressures that brought into question,
  and eventually made irrelevant and outdated, the cultural values of
  the melodrama had to develop within the larger culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The changes became apparent from the late-1820s in the form of public
calls for a more sober theatrical tradition based on an ethic of prudence
and moral responsibility. "The time is not far off," intoned a reviewer
in the <I>ro</I> in 1831, "for a reaction to set in against the
overflow of the marvelous and the fantastic in favor of common

<B></B>

sense."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
  During the 1830s, it became increasingly fashionable to decry the
  violence and vulgarity of the melodrama. As Frances Trollope put it in
  1835, no doubt echoing her French hosts, the melodramas performed at the
  Porte St. Martin contradicted "that universal diffusion of knowledge"
  that was the characteristic trait not only of the French but also of
  the civilized world in general.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
  By the 1840s, the melodrama had acquired the reputation of being
  an exclusively lower form of entertainment that lacked artistic
  merit. In the words of the journalist Jules Janin, the melodrama was
  characteristically loaded "with events, accidents, sudden changes
  of fortune, revolutions, deaths, births, terrors, and convulsions of
  every kind, to please the taste of their habitual spectators."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
  Not only was the melodrama aesthetically discredited but it also became
  morally suspect as well, being seen as the chief source of violence
  among working-class youths. Janin established a direct link between the
  melodrama and the criminal population of Parisian jails, who had "at an
  early age frequented those immoral shops, where comedy and melodrama,
  sell, for the lowest possible sum, their lessons of infamy and vice"
  (<I>AP,</I> 211).

The discredited world of the melodrama was symbolically opposed by a new
kind of theatrical spectacle, the com&eacute;die-Vaudeville, that had been
growing in popularity since the 1820s. The com&eacute;die-Vaudeville
was unambiguously identified with the newly rich and increasingly
respectable commercial middle classes. It appealed, wrote Jules Janin,
to the "intermediate world" between the masses and the aristocracy and
found its most enthusiastic support on the "neutral ground" of "the
Chauss&eacute; d'Antin and finance" (<I>AP,</I> 203). A caricature
of Henry Monnier's, published in 1831 in the humor magazine <I>La
Caricature,</I> presents the supporters of the new theater in less
circumspect terms, as the very incarnation of philistinism (<A HREF="7.3gluck_1.html"> 1</A>). Under
the title "Th&eacute;&acirc;tre du Vaudeville" are depicted four
substantial and unfashionably dressed res chatting in the foyer of
the theater. The two men on the left seem to be engrossed in business
negotiations, a distinctly stout and unattractive woman looks on with
interest, and a hatted male re in a garish striped vest stares out
at the spectacle around him with apparent suspicion and disapproval. A
more unlikely audience for aesthetic appreciation or refined judgment
could not be imagined.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The plots of the com&eacute;die-Vaudeville were constructed to appeal to
such audiences. They were characterized by close fidelity to contemporary
life, by an ethic of prudence and pragmatism, and above all by a kind
of moral Puritanism that was becoming a dominant feature of bourgeois
life. The Vaudeville succeeded in being relevant, entertaining, and
morally uplifting at the same time. Unlike classical tragedy, pointed
out Lady Sydney Morgan, a shrewd observer of the contemporary Parisian
scene, the new theater did not demand the kind of "profound and reflective
attention" that an aristocratic audience "who had passed the morning in
idleness" could provide. The Vaudeville was amusing and practical and,
thus, perfectly suited to the needs of "a merchant who has spent the day
in the counting-house, or to the lawyer who is jaded with attendance in
the courts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The acknowledged master of the new genre was the playwright Eug&egrave;ne
Scribe, variously characterized as the Christopher Columbus of
middle-class culture, the dramatist

<B></B>

of the everyday and the conventional, or simply, the arch-Philistine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  The epithet that all would have agreed on, however, was "the greatest
  amuser of the age" (<I>AP,</I> 206). According to Lady Morgan,
  Scribe's comedies "drew crowded audiences, assembled to laugh equally
  at the classicists and romanticists, whose opinions and disputes were
  exhibited with much humor and truth" (<I>F,</I> 2:68). After attending
  one of Scribe's plays about the unhappy consequences of a young girl
  marrying against the wishes of her father, she commented approvingly:

inclination is gratified at the expense of reason and propriety. We

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The popular enthusiasm surrounding Scribe's plays strongly recalls
the reception of the melodrama earlier in the century. Indeed, the
com&eacute;die-Vaudeville could lay claim to being a quintessentially
modern genre for much the same reasons as the melodrama. Like the
melodrama, it was a "realistic" and therefore a "modern" form of

<B></B>

theater since it, too, focused on contemporary events and experiences
and appealed to individual sentiments and emotions. Moreover, the
com&eacute;die-Vaudeville, too, had broken from the formal rules of
classical comedy, established by Moli&egrave;re and others, and had
invented a truly contemporary form of entertainment in tune with the
needs of the age.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet the Vaudeville's vision of modernity, its social and ideological
truths, were of a fundamentally different nature from those of the
melodrama or the romantic drama. The melodrama identified the modern
with dynamic change and an eschatological politics; the Vaudeville,
with stability and middle-class values. The melodrama defined the
innermost truths of individuality in terms of passion, emotional and
physical excess, and the struggle against injustice; the Vaudeville
saw the exemplary modern self in terms of moderation, common sense,
and conformity to social norms. The heroes of the melodrama were placed
in an allegorical universe of historical adversity and were engaged in a
cosmic battle between the forces of good and evil; the characters of the
com&eacute;die-Vaudeville functioned in realistically conceived drawing
rooms and country estates and were concerned with the daily conflicts of
social life. Even the marriage ceremony with which both the melodrama and
the com&eacute;die-Vaudeville formulaically concluded had different moral
implications. In both cases, it is true, social harmony was reestablished
through the affirmation of the role of the domestic family. In the case
of the melodrama, however, this social harmony rested on the valorization
of the autonomous, moral self, while in the Vaudeville, it rested on the
collective values of the social hierarchy. As Janin perceptively put it,
a Scribe play did not end with the girl of obscure birth who marries
the great lord, but, on the contrary, "takes in hand the defense of the
opposite opinion, and writes the <I>Mariage de Raison,</I> to prove that
the son of a general would be very foolish to marry the daughter of a
soldier" (<I>AP,</I> 208).

The ultimate significance of the com&eacute;die-Vaudeville lay in its
ability imaginatively to define a collective vision of the modern that
was relevant for the age, to reinvent a pattern of social and personal
ideals that resonated with the experiences of a middle-class, commercial
civilization. This phenomenon, however, went hand in hand with the
inevitable devalorization of the melodrama and the romantic drama, whose
vision of the modern came to be associated with either social degradation
or irrelevance. Honor&eacute; Daumier, the great chronicler of the age,
depicted this development in his caricatures of the 1840s. One drawing,
from 1846, "&Agrave; la Porte Saint-Martin," identifies the melodrama
with an unsavory audience of hulking shapes out of whose midst rises an
emaciated, ape-like re, transfixed in a hypnotic trance, whose gaze
is directed to the stage (<A HREF="7.3gluck_2.html"> 2</A>). A second lithograph from 1833 entitled
"Le Vaudeville et le Drame" depicts a parallel process of devaluation,
associated this time with the romantic drama (<A HREF="7.3gluck_3.html"> 3</A>).

  The top panel of the drawing, obviously referring to the Vaudeville,
  shows an enraptured audience with vivid gestures, mouths half-open in
  admiration or amusement, and handkerchiefs in hand to wipe away tears
  of empathy. The bottom panel, dedicated to the Drame, paints a sea
  of nodding heads, bored faces, and occasionally horrified expressions
  that convey a collective mood of alienation and indifference.

The Vaudeville's growing popularity among the respectable middle
classes cannot be separated from the fate of bohemianism as a cultural
phenomenon. The triumph of the Vaudeville and the decline of the
melodrama and the romantic drama signaled the erosion of the social
spaces that had defined and given legitimacy to the bohemian's heroic
vision of modernity. The new theatrical tradition could lay claim to
being more up-to-date, more truly expressive of contemporary life, than
the romantic drama and the melodrama. In the eyes of the mainstream, it
had become the legitimate embodiment of the culture of modernity. This
undeniable fact undermined, if not the emotional appeal of the colorful
and heroic world of the melodrama, certainly its viability as a direct
model for bohemian performance and parodic echoing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to Dick Hebdige, subcultural styles become reincorporated into
mainstream culture in two different ways: they are either transformed
into fashion or are redefined as deviant or exotic behavior. In the
case of bohemianism, both processes came into play. By the middle of
the 1830s, bohemian medievalism was becoming fashionable among the
well-to-do and the stylish. To be au courant meant wearing clothes that
suggested some medieval or fanciful motif, often taken from current
theatrical productions, and to furnish one's home with heavy, ornate
pieces suggestive of medieval images.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
  At the same time, however, bohemians became objects of satire in
  mainstream journals, which both exaggerated their eccentricity and
  deflated their seriousness. Probably the best-known of these humorous
  parodies of bohemianism was a series of articles published in the
  <I>ro</I> in late 1831 under the title of "Jeune-Frances." Bohemians
  were singled out in these articles for their artistic pretentions,
  their bizarre clothes, and their exotic tastes in food and interior
  decoration. The typical Jeune France, wrote the anonymous journalist,
  had a tendency to "weep at romantic verses, go into convulsions before
  primitive colors, faint at the sound of free verse, and fall dead
  before the sight of pure vermilion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
  Moreover, he deliberately rejected the costumes of ordinary people:
  "On the contrary, he would blush to be like others. But he stands up
  for the common man because the common man is spontaneous, unpolished,
  dramatic, straightforward, colorful, and bearded."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
  The dwelling of the Jeune France was also presented as a mixture of
  fantasy and morbid exoticism, with stuffed crocodiles hanging from
  the ceiling, preserved fetuses adorning the mantle piece, and hammocks
  used in place of beds.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
  Even in his culinary tastes, the Jeune France was bizarre, showing a
  preference for "boar's head, wild roe steak, peacocks with large wings,
  cologne, confiture dishes and drinking bowls." In this, as in everything
  else, the Jeune France was driven by the dictates of fantasy over
  taste or good sense, which allowed "metaphor to triumph over appetite."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1833, Gautier wrote a rebuttal to these articles in a series of parodic
short stories entitled <I>Les Jeunes-France.</I> As parodies of parodies,
Gautier's stories were a brilliant counter- offensive that used conscious
exaggeration to deflate the original attack and to deflect its ridicule
from the young artists back on the philistine critic. But Gautier's
humorous saga about the eccentricities of his protagonists had more
far-reaching implications as

<B></B>

well. It provided an unusually acute analysis of the erosion of the
bohemian project within the context of bourgeois modernity. <I>Les
Jeunes-France</I> was ultimately an exploration of the fate of imagination
when placed under the harsh glare of common sense. It represented a
tragi-comic revelation of the incompatibility of the bohemian gesture
with the dominant bourgeois version of modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The problem found one of its most ironic expositions in the short story
"Onuphrius," which focused on the tribulations of a typical bohemian as
seen through the eyes of a philistine. Onuphrius, we are told, was "Jeune
France and a passionate romantic" who had shoulder length hair, dressed
in a dark mantle worn in a Dantesque manner, and was fatally addicted
to novels, chivalric tales, mystic poetry, and other fantastic literature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
  Given such unwholesome nourishment, Onuphrius eventually lost his
  mental stability, developing a tendency to morbid imaginings. By the
  end of the story, the young artist had succumbed to madness and the
  incapacity to distinguish fact from fantasy, reality from dream. The
  moral lesson to be derived from Onuphrius' sad fate was spelled out
  with mock-serious didacticism, "By becoming a spectator of his own
  existence, Onuphrius forgot those of others, and the ties that attached
  him to the world broke one by one."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This cautionary tale about the pseudo-dangers of romantic imagination
obviously mocked the fashionable moralism and pragmatism of the
com&eacute;die-Vaudeville that routinely cautioned against anything
that was extreme, unconventional, and impractical. Just as importantly,
however, it exposed the fragility of the romantic gesture itself, which
inexplicably lost its inner pathos and vitality when viewed through the
alien lenses of practical life. The conclusion of Onuphrius was that
the search for fantasy and enchantment, if undertaken in the na&iuml;ve
spirit of the Jeunes France, withered into eccentricity, narcissism,
and even pathology in the context of the world of the Vaudeville.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An even more serious peril, however, lay in the ability of the world of
the Vaudeville to appropriate the forms of the romantic gesture and to
transform them in its own image. Gautier explored this possibility in his
short story, "Celle-ci et celle-l&agrave;" (The latter and the former), a
parodic account of the romantic hero's futile, and eventually ludicrous,
search for passion and heroism in the modern world. The protagonist,
Rodolph, decided to realize his aspiration for emotional intensity through
the acquisition of a mistress, whose characteristics were meticulously
modeled on the pattern of the melodrama or the romance. Rodolph's choice
fell on a fashionable married woman, only referred to as Madame de M.,
whose Spanish beauty recalled <I>Hernani</I>'s heroine and immediately
captivated the young bohemian. Sexual conquest of Madame de M. served only
to dissipate the illusion of romance and ended up provoking in Rodolph
an even more acute sense of boredom and a deeper dissatisfaction with
everyday life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This tale about the impossibility of recuperating the conventions of
the romance in contemporary life was ultimately an allegory about
conflicting visions of modernity embodied in the melodrama and the
com&eacute;die-Vaudeville. The protagonist failed in his search for
fulfillment not because of some unique personal flaw within himself or in
his mistress but because of the historic impossibility of the enterprise
in which he was involved. Under modern conditions, Gautier implied,
the heroic gestures of the romance

<B></B>

and the melodrama were inevitably transformed into drawing-room
farce. Thus, Rodolph not only failed to become a romantic
hero but found himself metamorphosed into a character from the
com&eacute;die-Vaudeville. "There was," he mused after his all-too-easy
seduction of Madame de M., "absolutely nothing artistic in the scene
that has just been played, and far from making a fifth act of a play,
it is worthy of being represented in a vaudeville; he was angry with
himself for having so badly dealt with such a beautiful subject, and
for having failed to bring passion into such a promising situation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rodolph's story concluded with the decision to turn away from the
dazzling but illusory attractions of Madame de M. toward the real charms
of Mariette, his pretty servant girl who had long loved him. The shift
in Rodolph's erotic investment indicated a major cultural reorientation
as well, involving the repudiation of exotic fantasy in the interest
of everyday experience. The heroic ethic of the melodramatic tradition
finally was admitted to be an unattainable dream, which first turned
into the sham of bourgeois comedy and then into the pretensions of
middle-class high culture. Rodolph's exemplary story, Gautier informed
his readers, needed to be read as a modern morality tale in which the
futile aspirations for romantic transcendence were finally abandoned
for the tangible joys of sober reality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gautier's parodic short stories in <I>Les Jeunes-France</I> marked the
exhaustion of the bohemian project as a performative subculture. The
bohemian attempt to assume the exotic costumes and social roles of
the melodramatic hero and thus to transform everyday life into heroic
adventure had proven ineffectual in the face of social reality. As
Gautier ruefully admitted in an unusually self-revelatory aside, he and
his generation had been mistaken in placing such confidence in symbolic
actions. They had to accept the fact that "an individual equipped with a
beard, a moustache, hair &agrave; la Raphael, several daggers, a man's
heart, and a slightly olive complexion, was not necessarily superior
in attractiveness to a fat grocer, greasy, freshly shaven, and daily
guillotined by his cravat."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The ultimate implication of Gautier's observation was the acceptance of
the nonidentity between life and art. It meant the final rupture with the
totalizing impulses of romanticism and the melodrama, which had tried to
heal the fragmentation of modernity through aesthetics. If the melodrama
and romanticism had tried to create identity between life and art through
"interiority and sentimentality," bohemianism attempted the same task
through the aestheticization of life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
  The failure of this project, however, did not mean the end of
  bohemianism as a cultural force. It simply marked the beginning of
  its transformation and reincarnation in forms more appropriate to the
  changed circumstances of the modern world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The separation between life and art found concrete realization in
Gautier's personal life in 1836, when he abruptly ended his bohemian
existence and accepted a post as permanent collaborator at the first mass
circulation newspaper in France, Emile de Girardin's <I>La Presse.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
  For the rest of his life, Gautier would have a double identity: as

<B></B>

a poet of exquisite, but little-read verses, and as a journalist of
influence, known for his theater reviews, salons, literary essays,
and travel accounts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
  Gautier was not the only bohemian of the 1830s to assume an important
  position within the cultural establishment of the July Monarchy and
  the Second Empire. Many other members of the early bohemian circle
  became successful theatrical directors, newspaper editors, literary
  reviewers, or industrial entrepreneurs. Others, however, failed to
  translate their early artistic enthusiasms into successful careers
  and either died early or dropped out of sight.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the social existence of the former bohemians became either marginalized
or integrated within the cultural or financial establishments, the
identity of the modern artist also came to be redefined as an autonomous
aesthetic self removed from the compromising pressures of ordinary
life. Perhaps no one did more to articulate this new ideal than Gautier
himself, whose <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I>  has become a classic
text of nineteenth-century aestheticism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
  The origin of Gautier's aesthetic parable was almost certainly based
  on an actual historical personage, a certain Madelaine d'Aubigny,
  who dressed as a man, fought duels, and had all kinds of adventures
  before dying in a convent in 1707. The cross-dressing heroine of
  popular legend found incarnation in a successful novel of 1829, Henri
  de Latouche's <I>Fragoletta,</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
  and it is probable that Gautier's <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I> was
  a reworking and a parody of this popular work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
  What is certain, however, is that Gautier's version of the story had
  more complex and far-reaching implications than the original. Indeed,
  it succeeded in systematically transforming the bohemian themes of
  the early 1830s into a new aesthetic formula that spoke to the deepest
  cultural and ideological needs of a postromantic generation. For this
  reason <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I> became a key cultural document
  of the age that was celebrated by contemporaries as different as
  Baudelaire and Balzac and was cited by the critic Sainte-Beuve as a
  "bible of romanticism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What did Gautier and his generation mean by aesthetic autonomy or l'art
pour l'art?
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
  What were the cultural and historical implications of this theory,
  frequently identified with Gautier's remark in the preface to
  <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I> that "nothing is really beautiful unless
  it is useless"?
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
  A close reading of <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I> makes it apparent that
  Gautier's theory of l'art pour l'art had little to do with classical
  philosophic discourses on aesthetic autonomy, first articulated in
  Germany in the late eighteenth century and subsequently popularized
  in France through Victor Cousin's lectures on aesthetics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
  Gautier's novel was concerned not so much with the philosophical
  problems of aesthetics as with the cultural dilemma of the contemporary
  artist who had lost the ability to differentiate himself from a
  commercialized, philistine modernity. The ultimate achievement of
  Gautier's creative vision was to give voice to a new definition of the
  modern artist, which represented a more up-to-date, more autonomous
  version of the cultural bohemian.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is far from fortuitous that this project found expression in
<I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I> through the conventions of the allegorical
romance rather than through theatrical performance. The stylistic shift
marked a new mode of perception, a new kind of relationship to the world,
indicative of the former bohemians' disenchantment with direct

<B></B>

cultural activism. Modern allegory frequently has been associated with
a fragmented and alienated universe where the identity of self and the
world had been irreparably severed and where only traces of sacred values
and collective meanings remained.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
  As Walter Benjamin put it, "allegories are, in the realm of thought,
  what ruins are in the realm of time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
  The allegorical mode of thought is, thus, concerned with the
  articulation of elevated or esoteric truths that no longer form an
  integral part of mainstream life. This broader cultural definition
  of allegory is implicit in the name itself. According to Ralph
  Flores, "allegory" unites the meaning of <I>allos,</I> other; with
  <I>agorevein,</I> to speak in the market place. It, thus, means,
  "to speak of 'other'--sacred, secret, special--things in a profane,
  political place."
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
How did <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I> function as aesthetic allegory? How
did it transform the increasingly esoteric truths of the bohemian
artist into a modern form of sacred speech promulgated in the secular
marketplace? In order to answer these questions, the novel needs to be
subjected to a more serious and systematic analysis than its fanciful
contents would seem to warrant.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
  Literary critics have remarked on the generically heterogeneous
  nature of <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin,</I> which mixed the conventions
  of the sentimental novel, the picaresque, and the romantic theater in
  a seemingly indiscriminate manner.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
  These diverse styles, however, were organized around a more ancient
  literary genre, that of the religious quest or allegorical journey,
  and this form defined the underlying cultural meanings of the
  narrative. The hero of this quest, the chevalier d'Albert, was the
  bohemian artist, identified by his love for unconventional costumes,
  his addiction to novels and travel stories, and his longing for
  passionate adventure. Like his fictional predecessors in <I>Les
  Jeunes-France</I>, d'Albert, too, began his journey in the frivolous
  setting of Paris drawing-room comedy where he first met and courted
  his mistress, Rosette. He ended, however, in the fantastic world of
  a Gothic chateau, whose balustrades and artificial moats designated
  not so much the concrete theatrical world of the melodrama as the
  disembodied realm of imagination that d'Albert attained only after
  the failure of external sight and the awakening of internal vision.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As with most religious quests, d'Albert's story, too, was organized around
a narrative of obstacles and emotional difficulties that the hero needed
to surmount in order to reach his true identity as aesthetic hero. The
catalyst and the symbolic center of these obstacles was the mysterious
re of Mademoiselle de Maupin, who made her appearance only after
the romance between d'Albert and Rosette had settled into a stalemate
and the couple had moved to the idyllic setting of Rosette's Gothic
chateau. Appearing in the guise of a youthful and athletic knight who,
nevertheless, radiated female beauty, Madelaine/Theodore was a true
androgyne, who united "the body and soul of a woman [and] the spirit and
strength of a man" (<I>MM,</I> 330). For d'Albert, she immediately assumed
the aspect of ideal beauty that he had always sought but did not find in
modern life. Yet, she did not function in the narrative as the traditional
symbol of transcendental beauty. As the focus of accelerating sexual
rivalry between d'Albert, who loved her as a woman, and Rosette, who
saw her as a man, Mademoiselle de Maupin was a force of destabilization
who brought into question all existing social conventions, moral norms,
and sexual identities. The principle of beauty that she represented

<B></B>

was based on the unstructured energies of life rather than the idealized
vision of traditional art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For d'Albert, the love of absolute beauty, which was experienced as
sexual attraction to a man, created a shattering moral and psychological
crisis. It was the beginning of a journey beyond good and evil whose
stages were associated with social isolation, moral degradation, and
psychological self-loss. As his crisis deepened, d'Albert's re
became explicitly allied with the villain of melodrama, who had also
been driven by obsessive lust and illicit sexual passion. Unlike the
melodramatic villain, however, d'Albert's experience of evil had a
positive outcome. It resulted in his eventual rebirth as aesthetic
hero who merged the identities of knight and villain into a new kind
of self that was defined not by stable social and moral truths but by
the self-generating energies of creativity. The moment of integration
was symbolized by a night of passion with Mademoiselle de Maupin, who
revealed herself to be a woman only to disappear from d'Albert's life
forever. The physical possession and loss of Mademoiselle de Maupin
brought to an end d'Albert's aesthetic quest. Having gained initiation
into the secrets of absolute beauty, he could become the spokesman of
the esoteric truths of art in a secular and utilitarian world where they
had become alien realities.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The aesthetic self, which constituted the final goal of d'Albert's
allegorical journey, was clearly a reincarnation of the melodramatic
hero, whose passion and energy had been internalized as imaginative
truth. It signaled the transformation of the melodramatic self into an
aestheticized form of avant-garde identity that, for the first time,
effectively differentiated the true artist of modernity from the
mere bourgeois entertainer. This gesture was ideologically laden even
though it explicitly repudiated direct politics. For in resurrecting
the theatrical genre of the melodrama, the aesthete was doing more
than simply creating distinctions between himself and bourgeois forms
of art. He was also reaffirming the Promethian promise of an earlier
moment of cultural modernity that was increasingly being pushed to the
periphery of modern life. Paradoxically, even while looking backward
to the outdated tradition of the melodrama, the aesthetic self became
the pioneer of a more thoroughly modern form of subjectivity than was
available to the bourgeois self. Liberated from the external pressures of
moral conventions and social conformity, the aesthete was in a position
to valorize the hedonistic pleasures of beauty and passion, as well as
the critical potential of irony and self-reflexivity. He was, above all,
empowered to affirm and protect the autonomy of the creative self in
the face of the encroaching conformism of modern life in ways that the
cultural bohemian had been unable to do.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The autonomy of the aesthete was far from being absolute, however. It
had, in fact, little to do with the popular myths of aesthetic autonomy
perpetuated in the late nineteenth century and already visible in Murger's
preface to <I>Sc&egrave;nes de la vie de boh&egrave;me.</I> The modern
artist, as Gautier and the cultural avant-garde of the 1830s conceived of
him, was neither a re of transcendental aesthetic authority possessing
the mantle of canonical high art nor the quintessential professional
inhabiting an autonomous intellectual field. He was, rather, a speaker of
parables and allegories whose task was to translate the esoteric truths
of aesthetic experience within a secular and desacralized

<B></B>

world. His role as allegorist made the modern artist both distinct from
and yet an integral part of the modern marketplace. He had the ability
to proclaim the absolute superiority of art over other commodities but
not the power to prevent its ultimate transformation into the image of
the commodity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gautier explored the paradoxical implications of this situation through
an ironic parable with which he concluded his preface to <I>Mademoiselle
de Maupin.</I> The parable contextualized his aesthetic project and
marked out the complex role that the modern artist was to assume within
the increasingly commodified cultural marketplace of the nineteenth
century. Assuming for the last time the role of the cultural bohemian,
Gautier launched an impassioned diatribe against the commercial medium of
the mass-circulation newspaper that had interposed itself between "the
artists and the public" and had destroyed the possibility of genuine
aesthetic experience and expression (<I>MM,</I> 51). Rejecting this
inauthentic world, Gautier conjured up an alternate environment for the
public presentation of <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin.</I> The publication
of his novel would be proclaimed, he wrote, by "twenty-four mounted
heralds, in the livery of the publisher, with his address on their
backs and breasts" (<I>MM,</I> 53). Bearing banners with the title
of the novel embroidered on them, each herald would be preceded by a
drummer and a kettle-drummer who would cry out the publication date
of the novel and the excellent qualities of its author. This colorful
spectacle, recalling an idealized medieval marketplace, and, indirectly,
the world of the melodrama, was obviously meant to suggest the inherent
superiority of Gautier's novel over other commodities being advertised
on the pages of the mass-circulation newspaper. Indeed, he humorously
predicted, his unique form of publicity would awaken so much interest
in his novel that it would "sell five hundred copies a minute," "new
editions would appear every half-hour," and "a picket of municipal guards
would have to be posted at the door of the shop, controlling the crowd
and preventing any disturbance" (<I>MM,</I> 53). With this projection,
Gautier deflated and deheroicized his own narrative, acknowledging the
ultimate futility of his attempt to elevate his aesthetic truths above the
world of the newspaper. The creations of the modern artist could not be
differentiated absolutely from other commodities. In the final analysis,
their aesthetic beauty was only a form of exoticism whose function was
to increase their desirability in the marketplace not to separate it
from other commodities. His advertising strategies for <I>Mademoiselle
de Maupin</I> turned out to be, he confessed, only slightly superior
to "a three-line announcement in the <I>Debats</I> and the <I>Courier
Fran&ccedil;ais,</I> between the elastic belts, the crinoline collars,
the feeding-bottles with incorruptible teats, Regnault paste and cures
for the toothache" (<I>MM,</I> 53).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet Gautier's final message about the imminent fate of his novel in the
modern marketplace was not one of defeat. <I>Mademoiselle de Maupin</I>'s
formal, if not substantive, superiority over other commodities was
preserved by its ability to draw on the aura of medieval romance and
glamour. Its status as a work of art was guaranteed by its association
with a more colorful, aesthetically superior world, unavailable to
ordinary commodities. In a sense, Gautier's parable pointed to a dual
context for the modern work of art. Its social and economic context was
unalterably determined by the laws

<B></B>

and conditions of the cultural marketplace, but its cultural context
was still anchored within the world of the melodrama, recreated and
reaestheticized by the imagination of the modern artist.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The history of nineteenth-century aesthetic modernity would be determined
by the dialectical interaction between these two different contexts
that represented different aspects of modernity. The social and economic
contexts were to be sources of homogenization and commodification, where
the lines of demarcation between the work of art and the commodity
were inevitably erased, while the cultural context was to be the
source of differentiation and aesthetic distinction, where these lines
were incessantly redrawn and recreated. Significantly, historians of
aesthetic modernism have found it difficult to acknowledge this dynamic
and essentially paradoxical aspect of artistic creation in the modern
world. Striving for clarity and stability in their depictions of the
modern aesthetic project, they have tended to present it as either
an integral part of the commercial market place; or as an autonomous
creative act disengaged from modern life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
  What has consistently remained invisible in their analysis of modernism
  is the unstable cultural middle ground that both linked the avant-garde
  artist to certain forms of radical popular culture and also helped to
  differentiate him from ordinary commercial activities.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet the act of integrating the re of the modern artist within a
specifically cultural, as well as a social and aesthetic, context opens
up interesting possibilities for modernist studies. Methodologically,
it allows us to see modern aesthetic identities as essentially historical
creations whose contents change over time along with other manifestations
of modern life. Politically, it helps clarify the long-standing
uncertainty about the relationship of the avant-garde artist to modernity
by highlighting his strategic alliances with forms of urban popular
culture that opposed bourgeois modernity from the Left rather than the
Right. Finally, conceptually, it helps us deheroicize and concretize the
re of the modern artist who was a master of disguises and masquerades
that both mirrored and purified aspects of ordinary culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The bohemian self had been the first and possibly the most colorful of
these masquerades that would define the modernist artist in the course
of the nineteenth century. It is, perhaps, for this reason that his image
has remained so firmly fixed in the popular imagination as the stereotype
of the modern artist. As popular stereotype, the bohemian was to have a
long and continuous history, from Murger's popular <I>Sc&egrave;nes de
la Vie de boh&egrave;me,</I> which became the hit of the Parisian theater
season in 1849; through Puccini's <I>La Boh&egrave;me,</I> first performed
in Milan in 1896; all the way to <I>Rent,</I> the contemporary version
of the bohemian legend transposed to the New York of the 1980s. Behind
all these images, there continue to hover the charismatic res of
the first bohemians who used costume and lifestyle to define a cultural
alternative to bourgeois modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For practicing artists, however, the bohemian gesture, in both its
direct and aestheticized forms, was a passing historical phenomenon that
was becoming anachronistic by the end of the July Monarchy. "In 1848,"
wrote Albert Cassagne, "bohemia no longer constituted the avant-garde
of artists; it was rather an arri&egrave;re-garde, outmoded

<B></B>

and in disarray, painfully following the lead of others."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
  The invention of the cultural forms of the new avant-garde of the
  1850s was the task of a younger generation of artists who would use
  the image of the popular <I>fl&acirc;neur</I> as the alter ego of the
  modern artist. This, however, is a different story with a distinct
  cast of characters and a new version of a performative public space.

with uncertain sources of livelihood. A reviewer of Daumier's album of

One finds in this album the debris of all social positions, classes

former lawyer next to the political refugee, the imperial prefect
with the clothes merchant. It is a resum&eacute; of all hazardous
occupations, the history of those who await in Paris the manna of
chance, it is the dregs of society, drawn by a hand both vigorous and

In 1866, for example, the critic Sainte-Beuve referred to the contrast
between the "Boh&egrave;me Galante" of the 1830s and Murger's more
plebian bohemia of the 1850s. The latter, he argued, were characterized
by a hand-to-mouth existence while the former by "the exalted enthusiasm
for the old Gothic masters . . . the contempt for mediocrity, the horror
of the commonplace and the vulgar, and the feverish ardor for renewal"

Gautier's two identities were apparently so well insulated from each

"What! Th&eacute;ophile Gautier a poet!" she supposedly exclaimed. "This
prince of mockers, this master of irony, this great iconoclast, is also
a dreamer of cascades, a melancholy inhabitant of the floating kingdom of
clouds" (Mme de Giradin, quoted in Joanna Richardson, <I>Th&eacute;ophile

The phrase "l'art pour l'art" was first used by Benjamin Constant,
who presumably had learned of the concept through conversations with
Friedrich Schelling and other German philosophers. The idea, however,
was popularized in France through Victor Cousin's influential lecture
series, <I>Du Vrai, du Beau et du Bien,</I> which he first gave in 1818
after his 1817 trip to Germany. As a direct result of Cousin's efforts,
l'art pour l'art became an integral part of academic eclecticism and
the official aesthetic philosophy of the bourgeoisie. See Cassagne,

When Zora Neale Hurston published her now-celebrated novel, <I>Their Eyes
Were Watching God,</I> in 1937, a handful of critics objected to its
feathery characterization of rural southern African Americans. Richard
Wright was among those who urged Hurston to attempt a more "serious"
and politically responsible portrayal of black life in America; and Alain
Locke advised her to tone up her "surface[y]" "folklore" narratives with
hard-hitting "social document" techniques.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  It would be a stretch to suggest that Hurston turned to the Federal
  Writers' Project in 1938 in an effort to answer Wright's and Locke's
  appeals to social realism and the gritty substance of the modern
  document; the production of a federally subsidized tour guide can
  hardly have been the sort of social project that her critics had in
  mind. Still, it was in her position as an editor of the American Guide
  Series book, <I>Florida</I> , that Hurston first came to try her
  hand at documentary writing. Her contributions to the Florida guide are
  scant, but they are characteristically complex. The "Negro spirituals
  and secular tunes" that she recorded and transcribed for <I>Florida</I>
  may not be as "authentic" as they seem; and their uncertain status as
  documented "folk" materials suggests that, despite the progressive
  efforts of many who participated in the Federal Writer's Project,
  Hurston's conceptions of "culture" clashed with the varieties of culture
  fostered by the governmental documentary projects of the late 1930s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The state and regional guides produced by the Federal Writers' Project
did more than feed and clothe writers during the Depression. They also
promoted new varieties of national pride during a decade rife with
radical political sentiment. As the art historian and theorist John Tagg
has noted, the liberal Roosevelt

<B></B>

administration compiled its massive factual and photographic archives
in an effort "to retrieve the status of Truth in [liberal governmental]
discourse." This "Truth" status had been "threatened by crisis," and its
"renegotiation was essential if . . . national and social identities
[were to be] resecured" in a manner that served both corporatist and
state interests.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  As part of a widely praised effort to provide a documentary "roadmap
  for the cultural rediscovery of America from within," the 378 books and
  pamphlets of the American Guide Series provided more than a compilation
  of the "raw cultural material" of myth and fact.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  They also functioned as the popular literary vanguard of a project
  that shaped radical dissent toward the imperatives of liberal reform.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The publications of the American Guide Series served both informational
and commercial purposes. Richard Wright's "sociological" contributions
to the Illinois project, for example, laid a groundwork for the stories
that he later published in <I>Uncle Tom's Children.</I> The gap between
the informational and commercial directives of the Federal Writers'
Project can be measured in the interval between the Guide Series'
Florida and Alabama projects. Hurston had traveled extensively through
these contiguous states when she gathered data for her studies of rural
southern African American culture in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and
the divergent Alabama and Florida guides therefore offer an apt index
of the imperatives that bore down upon the native Floridian who later
undertook government-sponsored documentary work. Although Hurston did not
participate directly in the making of the 1941 Alabama guide, this book
does list Hurston's <I>Mules and Men</I>  among its bibliographical
sources, and it contains a short but notable account of Cudjo Lewis,
the recently deceased African slave from the Mobile area whom Hurston
had interviewed for her as yet unpublished book-length study, "Barracoon."

Of the two southern state guides, the Alabama guide is renowned for its
unsentimentalized portrayal of the Deep South's violent settlement. The
Roosevelt scholar William Leuchtenburg, for example, singles out the
Massachusetts and Alabama state guides for their exemplary historical
analysis and writing. "Though the [Guide Series] writers labored
under some constraints," Leuchtenburg claims, "their comments could be
unsparing." Offering an example of such sharp commentary, he praises the
Alabama guide's account of the disappearance of the state's "indigenous"
peoples:

In remarking on a site where the Colonial Dames of America had placed a
marker on the triumph of Civilization over Savagery, the authors of the
Alabama guide observed: "Here, in 1802, was negotiated one of the series
of treaties by which the United States absorbed the Choctaw lands at a
price of one broken promise per square mile."

Not surprisingly, the guide's authors are more muted on the subject of
the ongoing strife between whites and blacks in Alabama. To their credit,
however, they do acknowledge that mutual racial "antagonism" had been a
feature of Alabama's history; and they discuss the rise of racist groups
including the Ku Klux Klan during the state's "Reconstruction" years.

The Florida guide, by contrast, is little remembered for its documentation
of southern history. In this guide, Florida's history and culture are
introduced and discussed as a kind of currency for the contemporary
tourist trade. The southernmost state is a place not of anguished
monuments but of simulacra: its "palm-thatched" "Indian villages" and
"tribal flags" have been "hoisted" quickly in an effort to lure passing
motorists. In Florida, history is written first on profligate "highway
signboards." According to the guide, the doubtful "Seminole names" that
adorn these signboards "are more numerous and widespread . . . than are
the living members of the race. . . . The Indians themselves have made
the most of one profitable name. Since they discovered that the story
of Osceola is popular among tourists, that fiery war chief has acquired
many descendants, and most of the present-day Osceolas display their
names along the Tamiami Trail."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  With its frank discussion of the state's self-fashioning as a tourist
  haven, and with a large proportion of its pages outlining tours for
  the modern sightseer, the <I>Florida</I> guide plainly functions as
  a subsidized lure to visitors.

The difference between the informational Alabama book and the more
openly commercial Florida guide is apparent not only in the contrast
between their respective treatments of regional history but also in
the guides' photographic illustrations. The Alabama guide features
stark photos of the state's power plants, coal miners, and white and
black sharecropper families; and these pictures are attributed to the
then-celebrated "social" photographers--Dorothea Lange, Marion Post,
Arthur Rothstein--who took them for the Farm Security Administration in
the mid- to late-1930s (. <A HREF="7.3kadlec_1.html">1</A> and <A HREF="7.3kadlec_2.html">2</A>). The neighboring Florida guide, on
the other hand, is sprinkled with mostly unattributed portraits of gardens
and golf courses, well-posed Seminoles, and turtle fishermen who decorate
idyllic beaches ( <A HREF="7.3kadlec_3.html">3</A>). Even the federally sponsored FSA photos that
appear in the guide serve to distance Florida from nationwide political
and economic concerns. Attributed to sponsoring agencies rather than to
the witnesses who breathe behind governmental lenses, the Florida photos
depict well-groomed laborers who seem unburdened by economic hardship
and environmental corrosion (. <A HREF="7.3kadlec_4.html">4</A> and <A HREF="7.3kadlec_5.html">5</A>). Florida may well have been
a prettier place than Alabama, but in the Florida guide, the call for
popular support for initiatives such as rural electrification and farm
subsidies gives way to the siren call of tourism.

In <I>Florida,</I> not just history and industry but also the arts revolve
around tourism. Apart from Hurston, the best-known contemporary writer
to have contributed to the guide was Wallace Stevens, whose praise of
lush, dewy Florida appears in a section on "Florida Literature." Stevens
labored as an insurance executive in Hartford, Connecticut, but here he
qualifies as a Florida writer because, like many other "poets" who have
been "aroused" by the southernmost state, he was "a regular visitor"
(<I>FL,</I> 147). In a tribute to winter getaways, the Florida guide
reprinted the following lines from Stevens's "Nomad Exquisite":

The tourist Stevens, we are told in the book's "Preface," graces the
pages of the Florida guide courtesy of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., publisher
of <I>Harmonium</I> . No such fanfare accompanies the appearance
of Hurston, whose influence as a folklorist can be felt in the series of
Florida work songs that appear three pages later. Hurston's unattributed
contributions to the Florida guide appear in a chapter on the "Music and
Theater" of Florida, and they consist of a series of "Negro spirituals and
secular tunes" (<I>FL,</I> 149). The first six of the seven fragments
of spirituals and secular songs included in this chapter are work
songs. These range from a rowing song attributed to Fernandina slaves
to chain gang songs that "illustrate the Negro's relief in rhythm":

There is a tightly compacted narrative to many of these song fragments,
but the guide's "Music and Theater" commentator is more concerned to
discuss their social function and form. In apparent conformity to the
directives that Sterling Brown issued as the Editor of Negro Affairs
for the Federal Writer's Project, these work songs are transcribed in a
manner that highlights not their phonetic divergence from "standard,"
or Anglo-American, forms of "English" but rather their distinctive
idiomatic and musical properties.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  Freed from the crippling imperatives of minstrelsy, these slight
  fragments begin to challenge traditional distinctions between "low"
  forms of folk expression and "higher" literary forms. The repetition of
  single lines and verses, for example, can convey nuanced expressive
  differences. In many of the work songs of the Florida Negro,
  the guide informs us, "contrast and embellishment are obtained by
  stress and accent in the tune, rather than by a change of words" (FL,
  151). A song that is made up of a single phrase, with different words
  italicized in each of its three repetitions, illustrates such expressive
  embellishment. The last of the seven song fragments reads as follows:

This excerpt is really more of a blues than a work song, and it is
noteworthy not only because it exemplifies Brown's progressive call
for "unmeasured" transcriptions of African-American oral material,
but also because it helps us to identify Hurston as the author of the
"Music and Theater" section of the guide. Moreover, there is a story
behind this fragment--one that tells us something about Hurston's
apparent frustration with the Federal Writer's Project and with the
larger aesthetic and commercial directives that fueled the production
of state guides like Florida's. (Even in their most progressive phases
under relatively enlightened administrators like Sterling Brown, and
also Benjamin Botkin who became the head of the FWP's Folklore division
in 1938, the American Guide Series books would ultimately remain the
instruments of the liberal government that produced them.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  As it happens, the genesis of the heart-disease lyric that caps the
  Negro "Music" of Florida is as questionable as the ancestry of the
  state's "signboard" Osceolas. This blues song may not be from Florida,
  and it may not even be a Negro folk song in the way that the guide
  presents it. By tracing the heart-disease lyric to potential urban
  sources that raise doubt regarding its "authenticity," however, we can
  use this so-called Florida folk song to understand the conceptions of
  racial and cultural identity that vexed and enriched Hurston's work
  as both a cultural anthropologist and a state documentarian.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston's discomfort with her roles as both an anthropologist and
a documentarian should surprise no one who is familiar with either
modern anthropology or with state-sponsored documentary initiatives of
the late 1930s. In America, at least, both efforts were fundamentally
liberal, which is to say that they worked toward the refinement of a
fundamentally racist status quo. To call the anthropologist Franz Boas,
who was Hurston's teacher, a "racist" is probably something of a cheap
shot. Few public intellectuals contributed as much to the repeal of
blatantly racist scientific and legislative initiatives as did Boas. In
the 1920s and 1930s, however, his progressive conceptions of "culture"
were institutionalized in ways that Hurston quietly resisted. Boas himself
used the relative "difference" of the Negro's physiognomy as a tool to
combat the scientific racialist belief that Europeans could be divided
into stratified races or "sub-species"; and this may have contributed
to Hurston's privately expressed belief that "white people could not be
trusted to collect the lore of others."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  Despite her lavish tributes to "Papa Franz" in <I>Mules and Men</I>
  and then later in her autobiography, Hurston remained uncomfortable
  working under Boas's sponsorship, and she often endeavored to conceal
  her fieldwork in the rural South from the hands of meddlesome New York
  anthropologists affiliated with Boas. When she was interviewing Cudjo
  Lewis, the elderly Alabama farmer who claimed to be America's last
  surviving African slave, for example, Hurston conspired with Alain
  Locke and Charlotte Mason to keep the Boasian anthropologist Paul
  Radin from making contact with Lewis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  Later, in 1940, she complained to the anthropologist Jane Belo of the
  burden that Boas's technical crew had placed on her Sanctified Church
  project in Beaufort, South Carolina. "Now

<B></B>

I went to work right away," Hurston wrote, "to lay the foundation for the
white men to come in to take the sound pictures. I think we had better
make them [the Church members] a present because they are not taking to
it any too kindly."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If Hurston was less than enthusiastic as a participant in the project
of cultural anthropology, however, she was by all accounts a thoroughly
noncooperative member of the Federal Writers' Project. As one of the
editors of the <I>Florida</I> state guide, Hurston is said to have spent
most of her time working on her novel, <I>Moses, Man of the Mountain,</I>
and doing fieldwork for a second FWP project, <I>The Florida Negro.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  Modeled on <I>The Negro in Virginia,</I> a much-praised federal
  project headed by Roscoe Lewis and edited by Sterling Brown, <I>The
  Florida Negro</I> never quite coalesced as a historical or ethnographic
  document. Its rambling and sometimes bitterly polemical 200 manuscript
  pages remained unpublished until 1993, when they were recovered amid the
  late-century revival of interest in the literary Hurston. Importantly,
  however, several of the songs that made it into the <I>Florida</I>
  state guide also appear in <I>The Florida Negro.</I> Similarities in
  their formatting and in the commentary that surrounds them enable us
  to identify Hurston as the author of the "Music and Theater" section of
  the Florida guide. In <I>The Florida Negro,</I> for example, Hurston's
  distinctive voice rings clear when she discusses accent as an integral
  feature of "Negro blues songs."

The Negro blues songs, of which Florida has many fine examples, belong in
the lyric class; that is, feelings set to strings. The oldest and most
typical form of Negro blues is a line stating the mood of the singer
repeated three times. The stress and variation is carried by the tune
and the whole thing walks with rhythm.

The final sentence of this excerpt makes it clear that Hurston's
contributions to the 1939 Florida guide were written in concert with,
and perhaps even composed out of,

<B></B>

early versions of her "second" FWP project, <I>The Florida Negro.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For the "Folkore and Music" section of <I>The Florida Negro</I> and for
the more hastily composed "Music and Theater" section of the Florida
guide, Hurston collected, transcribed, and analyzed folk material as
a federal documentarian. As a member of the FWP, Hurston had in fact
procured a tape recorder from the government during a trip to Washington,
and she began carrying it with her as she collected folk stories and work
songs in Florida in the late 1930s. Hurston had traveled with recording
equipment before, but when she worked as an anthropologist in the late
1920s and early 1930s, she had been inclined to gather and record her
data from memory. She described her earlier song-collecting methods to
the folklorist Alan Lomax in 1935:

they tell me I can sing them just like them and then I take part and
try it out on different people who already know the song until they are
quite satisfied that I know it, and then I carry it in my memory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now, however, with her 1939 government-issue recording device in tow,
she would appear to have been participating in the more empirical
documentary methods that were being championed by various government
agencies under the Roosevelt administration. (In 1939, she did make
a series of recordings for the Library of Congress and the Folk Arts
Committee of the WPA; and these recordings can be heard today in the
Library of Congress.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It may be no accident that the federally sponsored and technologically
enhanced fieldwork that Hurston performed in 1939 and 1940 more or less
put an end to her work as a folklorist and anthropologist. She continued
writing novels and essays after 1940, perhaps in part because novels
and essays were always what she wanted to write most. None of these
writings won her as much acclaim, however, as her earlier book-length
anthropological studies and the so-called folklore fictions, <I>Jonah's
Gourd Vine</I> and <I>Their Eyes Were Watching God,</I> that she published
alongside them in the 1930s. If the mainstreaming of a documentary culture
in the late 1930s served to dampen Hurston's interest in fieldwork, it
may have been because the social realist and commercial directives that
lay beneath this aesthetic prohibited Hurston from representing Negro
"culture" in the way that she imagined it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The pithy song fragment that rounds out the Negro "Music" of
<I>Florida</I> is a case in point. For the visitor to the southernmost
state, the words "Love ain't nothing but the <I>easy-going</I> heart
disease" are indigenous words that should issue forth like dew, releasing
hymns from beholders like Wallace Stevens, who, even when vacationing in
Florida, remains, by the guide's lights, "one of America's best modern
poets" (<I>FL,</I> 147). But are these Florida lyrics? Here, Hurston
seems not to have used her Folk Arts Committee tape recorder in the way
that FSA photographers had used cameras to document Florida's culture
of migratory farm workers, citrus packers, and bean

<B></B>

canners. Rather, she drew these lyrics from an earlier anthropological
study of rural Southern African American culture. "Love ain't nothing but
the easy going heart disease" is the last stanza of a so-called social
song---"East Coast Blues"--that Hurston included in an appendix to
her 1935 study, <I>Mules and Men</I>:

Since most of her material for <I>Mules and Men</I> was taken from
migrant African American workers in sawmills, turpentine camps, and
phosphate mines in Florida and Alabama, "East Coast Blues" may not have
been the native Florida material that Hurston represented it to be in
the Florida guide. (The "East Coast" in the title may well refer to
Florida's Atlantic coast, but the song clearly describes an exile's
wish to return to a distant home: "I'm going where the chilly winds
don't blow.") But was this lyric even indigenous to the <I>rural</I>
southern African American culture that Hurston treated in all of her
Florida writings? Even this is not as clear as it would seem.

Hurston's letters to Langston Hughes indicate that the very trope that
distinguishes the "East Coast Blues"--the lines that brand love a kind of
"heart disease"--should have been known to Hurston before she began her
first round of folklore gathering in the rural South in 1927. An urban
variant of the lyrics to this so-called social song

  poet in 1926, had published words and music to a couple of blues songs
  that may be related not only to Hughes's poetry but also to Hurston's
  Florida song, "East Coast Blues." One of the two Handy songs that
  appear to have contributed to Hughes's poetic rendering of the bluesy
  heart-disease trope was "Careless Love," published in 1926.

The striking similarities between Hughes's "Gypsy Man" of 1927 and
Handy's "Careless Love" and "Shoeboot's Serenade" of 1926 and 1915 do
not necessarily mean that Hughes's blues poems are derived from Handy's
blues lyrics. Hurston, who knew Hughes well in 1927, in fact claimed
that some of his blues poems were taken straight from the mouths of
urban blues musicians themselves.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  If this is true, it is possible that the last stanza of "Gypsy
  Man" represents but one of numerous variations on a trope that
  echoed through both the rural South and the Harlem cabarets of the
  1920s. What is interesting about this particular lyric is that Hurston
  mentioned it in a letter written to Hughes at the outset of her first
  folklore expeditions in the rural South in 1927. As a Barnard-trained
  anthropologist, Hurston had had trouble "pass[ing]" among the workers
  whose culture she wished to study and record.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  Beginning in 1927, Hurston began writing to Hughes that she was reading
  his poetry in order to break the ice and to gain credibility among
  her rural Southern subjects. She described the reception of Hughes's
  poetry in great detail in a letter written in the summer of 1928:

What Hurston is describing in this passage is improvisation. The Saturday
night "skinners," or cardplayers, are not only quoting stanzas of Hughes's
"Hard Luck" from memory, but they are also adding their own verses
to the poem that yielded the title of <I>Fine Clothes to the Jew.</I>
These rural southern workers' enjoyment of poems like "Gypsy Man" may
be due to the fact that Hughes's urban blues poems derived from some of
the same sources as rural songs like "East Coast Blues." In fashioning
love as a kind of heart disease, Handy and Hughes had very likely drawn
from the reservoirs that Hurston was now trying to tap.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
  In feeding the material of "Gypsy Man" back to the work camps, however,
  Hurston was "contaminating" this folk reservoir with urban African
  American art forms. The rural southern workers who taught her the
  lyrics to "East Coast Blues," then, conceivably could have improvised
  the closing verse to that song--"Love ain't nothing but the easy going
  heart disease"--in an echo to the urban influence of Hughes and Handy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The exact genesis of the love-as-heart-disease lyric that Hurston recorded
in the Florida state guide can probably never be ascertained. This is
not due to Hurston's carelessness as a folklorist but rather to her
understanding of what sort of work she was doing when she ventured into
the field. As she stated over and over, "Negro folklore" was vibrant
not because it was authentic or indigenous to any people or place but
because it was "<I>still</I> in the making."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
  It was not something to be documented but something to be done. As
  they were used by anthropologists and government archivists alike,
  cameras and tape recorders did not play much of a role in this sort of
  vital activity; and the documentary aesthetics that underlay even the
  best FWP projects of the late 1930s were fundamentally at odds with
  Hurston's efforts to place <I>process</I> at the root of identity. The
  documentation of people and places signified for Hurston only if the
  act of documentation itself became a kind of cultural activity. This
  notion was lost not only on the social realist writers who objected
  to her "surfacey" characterization

<B></B>

of rural southern African Americans in <I>Their Eyes Were Watching
God</I> but also on the federal folk who, in administering a New Deal
for American tourists, portrayed America's emerging culture as a dewy
thing to "behold."

For a careful and compelling study of the relationship between
government photographic projects and liberal reform initiatives during
the Roosevelt years, see Nicholas Natanson, <I>The Black Image in the
New Deal: The Politics of FSA Photography</I> (Knoxville: University of
Tennessee Press, 1992). Natanson argues that reform initiatives such
as farm subsidies, and the federal photography archives that served
them, served to perpetuate a fundamentally racist status quo. Farm
subsidies in the rural South, for example, reached qualified white
farmers at up to seven times the rate that they reached qualified black
farmers . The Farm Security Administration's photographic archive
played a role in the disproportionate allocation of federal funds
(69-71). Through the FSA, government photographs were commissioned
and displayed publicly in order to garner popular support for costly
relief programs. As Natanson shows, portraits of impoverished black
farmers were often omitted from public displays of FSA photographs (217,
226). Through such omissions, poverty was "raced" as a white phenomenon
by the New Deal administration. To Natanson's discussion of the racial
management of the FSA archive, I would add that commercial imperatives
such as tourism also contributed to the erasure of black subjects, and
to the attendant disproportionate allotment of federal relief, in the
1930s. Although in the final analysis commercial pressures were closely
bound to liberal reformist ones, a comparison of the photographs in the
touristy Florida guide with those in the more reform-oriented Alabama
guide suggests that these commercial imperatives were in some cases more
damaging than liberal political ones.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Anyone entering the debate on hybridity that has transformed academic
discourse over the past decade is forced to confront two conflicting
but equally persuasive narratives of transcultural production. One is a
rather optimistic story emphasizing the types of syncretism and productive
collage that James Clifford has associated with a "poetics of process."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  According to this story, the increasingly frequent contact between
  different cultures (the

<B></B>

"syncretism" or juxtaposition of cultures that have evolved differently)
is not a phenomenon to be feared: cultural cross-fertilization merely
accelerates the historically consistent rhythm of contact, exchange,
and influence by means of which supposedly authentic and homogeneous
cultures are formed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The second narrative exposes some of the weaknesses of this seductive
view, providing a cautionary tale in which intercultural contact,
while potentially a rich resource for the development of hybrid
identities, tends nonetheless to fortify the domination of one
culture over another. By celebrating the ongoing process of cultural
cross-fertilization, the counter-argument goes, contemporary critics like
Clifford risk erasing the often bloody history that leads to intercultural
contact in the first place. Marianna Torgovnick, for instance, has accused
advocates of postmodern syncretism of being more fashion-conscious than
scholarly. To "revel in the postmodern m&eacute;lange of us and them,"
she warns, is to risk "abjuring [our] responsibilities."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  Modernists are guilty of irresponsible and ahistoricizing
  appropriations, but postmodernists, too, may be implicated on the
  same grounds.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As opposed as these two narratives obviously are--the first places faith
in hybridity, the second is highly suspicious of hybridity's compromised
pasts and contaminated futures--they nonetheless share a common plot
structure. Each depends upon a chronological and evolutionary conceit
that imposes a sharp break between modernism and postmodernism, that is,
between a coercive modernist hybridity on the one hand, and, on the other,
a liberating postmodernist syncretism. When contrasted with Bob Marley or
the Aboriginal Warumpi Band, canonical modernists inevitably appear to be
perpetrators of exploitative appropriations, patently lacking a political
consciousness and disinterested, for the most part, in the original
contexts of the "exotic" voices they introduce into circulation. For
members of both critical camps, modernists unselfconsciously exploit third
world artifacts, na&iuml;vely believe in cultural "authenticity," and
fetishize the instinctual purity of the "primitive" (often in opposition
to what they consider to be the decadence and emasculation of "advanced"
European art).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 There are certainly many instances of modernist appropriation that appear
 to confirm the arguments outlined above. But whether all modernists
 are equally insouciant, unselfconscious, and ahistorical is a highly
 debatable question. Modernist modes of appropriation are often far
 more complicated than they initially appear. In fact, the genealogies
 of cultural cross-fertilizations are lengthy and surprisingly twisted,
 and not all modernists are unaware of the implications--historical,
 political, and aesthetic--of the further twists they add to the
 chain. The case I consider here, that of Blaise Cendrars, a Francophone
 (Swiss) poet, novelist, journalist, and screen writer, is particularly
 enlightening in this regard. Cendrars's contacts with postcolonial
 Brazil produced a set of curious writings on hybridity that raise
 some disturbing questions about modernism's relation to cultural
 cross-fertilization. Anticipating the work of Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss,
 whose most significant ethnographic experience also took place in
 Brazil, Cendrars discovers in the former Portuguese colony an "authentic"
 alternative to Europe's cultural trajectory, yet views this "authentic"
 alternative as, paradoxically, the result of hybridization, of the
 commingling of heterogeneous elements occurring over

<B></B>

several centuries of colonial conquest and genetic and cultural
<I>m&eacute;tissage.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Cendrars demonstrates a high degree of sensitivity with respect to the
historical circumstances that produced the <I>m&eacute;tissage</I>
of Brazil's population. For instance, he refers repeatedly to the
violent intercultural contacts responsible for the palimpsestic Brazilian
cultural identities he so admires. Cendrars's aesthetic investment in such
contacts and their perverse and unexpected consequences is manifested
throughout his prose and poetic works, but nowhere as pointedly--or
as ambiguously--as in "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;"
(The metaphysics of coffee). By studying "La M&eacute;taphysique du
caf&eacute;" I intend to complicate the now dominant image of modernists
as Eurocentric collectors of deracinated non-Western exotica. I will
also provide a sense of the irreducible strangeness and singularity of
Cendrars's own role in the modern cross-fertilization of cultures. His
example suggests that in certain cases modernist hybrid production
participates in networks of contact and exchange that are far too complex
to be encompassed by the manichean categories critics sometimes employ.

  My intention is not to condemn or celebrate any particular modernist
  nor to "save" modernism, but rather to direct attention to the ways

  both modern and postmodern instances of aesthetic appropriation.

Cendrars's first contacts with Brazil occurred before he even set foot
on the South American continent. In 1923, through his friend Fernand
L&eacute;ger, Cendrars met the Brazilian painter Tarsila do Amaral,
who was in Paris studying with the French cubist constructivists,
L&eacute;ger, Andr&eacute; Lhote, and Albert Gleizes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Do Amaral was accompanied by her lover, Oswaldo de Andrade, a
  Brazilian modernist poet, later famous for his "Cannibalist Manifesto"
  of 1928, a provocative effort to "<I>&eacute;pater</I>" the Brazilian
  intelligentsia that placed Brazil on the avant-garde map. A friendship
  sprang up between Cendrars and the Brazilian couple, nourished by dinner
  parties in do Amaral's studio where guests included both the major
  French modernists of the day and the rising generation of Brazilian
  writers, composers, and artists (Sergio Milliet, Anita Malfatti,
  Vicente do Rego Monteiro, Heitor Villa-Lobos, and Victor Brecheret).
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 According to some sources it was through Oswaldo de Andrade that
 Cendrars made his first contact with Paolo Prado, the <I>grand</I>
 <I>m&eacute;c&egrave;ne</I> of Brazilian modernism. Prado, who had
 studied literature in Paris prior to World War I, met regularly with
 Cendrars to discuss modernism and Brazilian culture at the Librairie
 Chadenat, a bookstore specializing in the history of the Americas located
 on the Quai des Grands Augustins. It was here, in the thick atmosphere of
 erudition, that a bridge between Cendrars's brand of avant-garde practice
 and Prado's Brazilian-inflected notions of modernism was built. By
 the end of the year Prado had extended an invitation to Cendrars to
 visit Brazil that Cendrars accepted a few months later after securing
 assignments as a journalist from two French newspapers. After his arrival
 in Rio on 5 February 1924, Cendrars spent the next six months living
 with the Prados in S&atilde;o Paulo, traveling through the interior
 with groups of Brazilian painters and writers, and basking in the sun
 at his new acquaintances' coffee plantations or <I>fazendas.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Before any assessment of Cendrars's Brazilian experience can be made,
 however, it

<B></B>

must be understood that the Brazil that Cendrars encountered was
one already colored by the primitivist imagination of the early
twentieth-century avant-garde. His trip to Brazil, as well as his earliest
contacts with Brazilians, took place under the sign of France's already
well-developed fascination with third-world exotica, a fascination
that often failed to distinguish between African, African American,
and Luso-African cultures. Although Josephine Baker would not arrive in
Paris until October of 1925, the rage for African art and American jazz
had already reached a feverish pitch by the time Cendrars met Prado,
de Andrade, and do Amaral.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  At first, the Brazilians attracted Cendrars for the same reason that,
  five years earlier, African languages and jazz rhythms had interested
  him: all seemed to serve equally well as novelties to be thrown into
  the avant-garde mix.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Clearly Cendrars shared with his generation what Jean-Claude
 Blach&egrave;re has identified as a modernist nostalgia for the archaic,
 a desire for renewal in the midst of a (high) European culture seen as
 "old, sickly, inert, and bloodless."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  Similar in this respect to his modern contemporaries, Cendrars was
  also looking for "new sources of energy" and yet the specific nature
  of his interest in the "savage" and the "exotic" was somewhat different.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  In contrast to authors like Tzara or Cocteau, what Cendrars appreciated
  most was not the "new source of energy" provided by an idealized,
  childlike, and "authentic" Other, but rather the energy generated by
  internal division and hybridity, the productive tension that he saw
  emerging from a clash of conflicting velocities and rhythms operating
  simultaneously within a single (cultural, geographic) space. He
  did express admiration for what he considered the "savage" aspects
  of Brazil--e.g., the bush and the jungle; but far more striking to
  him, far more revelatory as a model for both aesthetic practice and
  cultural organization, was <I>contrast</I>: bush and city, "savage"
  and socialite. His devotion to Brazil was consistent with his earlier
  aesthetics of "simultaneous contrast," an aesthetics that sought a
  syncretic collage of distinct elements, each of which retained, despite
  the juxtaposition, its visual or linguistic independence. As Salvador
  de Reyes has put it, "Cendrars possessed a great love for Latin America
  because in its spectacular scenarios he saw a new world . . . full of
  <I>joie de vivre</I> and audacity, <I>a mixture of hyper-civilization
  and primitivism.</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 De Reyes's words capture well the peculiar nature of Cendrars's
 fascination with Brazil (as opposed to his general interest in things
 "primitive"). It was the hybridity and <I>not</I> the purity of the
 exotic Other that seduced him, a fact borne out by many of Cendrars's
 writings on Brazil, including "Saint Paul," the poem cited as an epigraph
 to this essay.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  Cendrars may have expressed a desire to visit the "<I>for&ecirc;t
  vierge</I>" of the "<I>sauvage</I>," but he also hoped to reside at
  the precarious point where "[p]roducts from the five corners of the
  world turn up in the same dish, on the same dress."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  Faithful to the aesthetic program of <I>simultan&eacute;it&eacute;,</I>
  Cendrars emulated alterity not for its own sake, but rather for the
  sake of the startling effects that foreign elements could create when
  juxtaposed with elements drawn from more familiar European fare.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Given Cendrars's marked preference for the hybrid and the
 <I>m&eacute;tiss&eacute;,</I> it appears all the more curious that
 he ever took pen to paper to compose "La M&eacute;taphysique du
 caf&eacute;." This essay, first published in Rio de Janiero's "O Jornal"
 on 15 October 1927,
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<B></B>

has been treated by critics as an unqualified celebration of coffee
cultivation, a hymn to colonization, modernist standardization,
and capitalist enterprise. Alexandre Eulalio, the first chronicler of
Cendrars's travels through Brazil, considers "La M&eacute;taphysique" to
be, without doubt, "one of the most expressive documents of the Paulist
economic euphoria and the feeling of omnipotence consequent to it,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  while Adrien Roig, without a trace of irony, calls it a "very beautiful
  text . . . of captivating realism and forceful inspiration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Indeed, on a first reading, "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;"
  does appear to invert Cendrars's habitual hierarchy, jettisoning
  diversity in favor of single-crop agriculture, the most ecologically
  devastating and dehumanizing form of land management that Brazil ever
  developed. Why Cendrars would have chosen to write what appears to be
  a propagandistic piece of journalism privileging monoculture over the
  wealth of botanical diversity he praises elsewhere is a question that
  none of his critics has answered adequately.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;" is rarely mentioned in
  comprehensive studies of Cendrars's work and, if so, then only
  in passing--usually in the context of his fascination with famous
  entrepreneurs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The critical neglect of "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;"
 probably stems from the circumstantial quality of the piece, the fact
 that it reads somewhat like an advertisement for the industrialization
 of Brazil. Yet, paradoxically, while "La M&eacute;taphysique" seems
 to address specifically the advantages of coffee cultivation <I>in
 Brazil,</I> its first six paragraphs were in fact written for an
 earlier piece on economic development in the United States entitled
 "The Principle of Utility," published separately in 1925, then
 integrated into his epic on terrorist anarchism, <I>Moravagine,</I>
 the following year. The narrator who intones the hymn to monoculture
 in <I>Moravagine</I> can only with some difficulty be fused with the
 person of Cendrars in 1927. "La M&eacute;taphysique" is therefore far
 more equivocal than it first appears and should not be classified so
 quickly as evidence of Cendrars's fondness for large demonstrations of
 the will. The equivocal nature of the essay is due in large part to the
 tension produced between two distinct discourses, one metaphysical and
 the other economic. In a sense, "La M&eacute;taphysique" is itself
 <I>m&eacute;tiss&eacute;,</I> internally non-self-identical, and
 structured as a kind of dialogue between an advocate of monoculture
 and a poet invested in difference, as a source both of diction and
 creative energy. The ambiguity of "La M&eacute;taphysique"'s point of
 view towards both monoculture and hybridity makes it significant reading
 material, not only for specialized scholars of Cendrars, but also for
 those interested in the concept of hybridity and in the important place
 this concept has acquired in postcolonial theory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The best entry to the essay is perhaps provided by the subject
 matter itself: large-scale coffee cultivation, or what Cendrars calls
 "the enigma," the "force of attraction and exchange" at the root of
 intercultural contact. Coffee cultivation, however, is not simply a
 theme, it is also a symbol of the globalization of Brazil's economy and
 of its principal protagonist, Paulo Prado. This highly influential and
 powerful re was Cendrars's closest friend and constant companion
 during his Brazilian trips; he was also, however, the head of a coffee
 oligarchy and therefore part of the power structure responsible for
 the growth of monocultural agro-economics. "La M&eacute;taphysique
 du caf&eacute;" was obviously written in Prado's honor; it is in some
 sense a metaphysics of Prado

<B></B>

himself, an attempt to understand the law that could make
coffee--personified by Prado--simultaneously a force of liberation and
oppression, of intercultural and monocultural standardization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Just who was Paulo Prado and what was the nature of his hold on
 Cendrars? In short, Prado encapsulated in his own genealogy the entire
 modern history of Brazil. The Prados arrived in the S&atilde;o Paulo
 region from Portugal in the eighteenth century, entered into livestock
 trading, slave trading, sugar growing, politics, and finally established
 ascendency in the domain of coffee cultivation. When Paolo Prado went
 to study literature in Paris before World War I, the coffee boom,
 which lasted from approximately 1840 to 1900, was already on the
 wane. But the Prado name was still firmly associated with wide-spread
 coffee cultivation, a nineteenth-century phenomenon responsible for
 an irreversible "shift," as historian Darrell L&eacute;vi has written,
 "in the nation's economic center of gravity and a major sea-change in
 Brazil's economic history."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The cultivation of coffee imposed by oligarchies such as the one
 controlled by the Prado family resulted not only in the heightened
 prosperity and greater visibility of the Brazilian economy, but also in
 mass destruction of the Amazon jungle, the repression of an economic
 underclass, the solidification of a police state, and the eradication
 of previously isolated Amerindians and their diverse cultures. However,
 coffee was also an agent of cultural cross-fertilization. It permitted
 the Prados to travel, to establish connections with important
 European families such as the Rothschilds, and to collect examples
 of European avant-garde artworks. Finally, coffee was the indirect
 cause of the famous racial hybridity of the Brazilian population:
 during the nineteenth century, Amerindians were "domesticated," slaves
 were imported from Africa, and immigrants were seduced from Italy and
 Germany in order to supply labor power to the burgeoning coffee and
 sugar cane plantations on Brazilian soil. For Cendrars, then, Prado
 emblematized the two faces of modernity. On the one hand, he stood for
 economic development, the raw force of will allowing humans to intervene
 in the constitution of ecosystems and the migratory patterns of entire
 populations. On the other, he represented internationalism, the end of
 cultural isolation, increased possibilities for intercultural contact,
 and thus the most avant-garde tendencies in the arts and letters.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 What drew Cendrars to Prado, and what underlies the strange prose of "La
 M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;," is Cendrars's sense that everything
 valuable in modernity--the openness to the new, the desire to redefine
 the locus and function of art, and, perhaps most importantly, the
 decision to jettison originality and authenticity in favor of citation,
 pastiche, hybridity, and appropriation--in short, all that was dearest to
 his generation, was in fact predicated on a deeper principle, one that
 Prado's entrepreneurial spirit illustrated perfectly. For Cendrars, the
 dynamic responsible for modernity's richness, the impulse governing its
 two major manifestations--monoculture and hybridity, The Grand Hotel and
 the carnival--was quite simply <I>appetite,</I> the "furious appetite"
 alluded to in his poem "Saint Paul."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In order to seize the relation Cendrars sketches between hybridity
 and conquest, heterogeneity and the implacable domination of the same,
 it is necessary to return to

<B></B>

the pages of "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;." Structurally,
"La M&eacute;taphysique" is presented as a kind of <I>mise en abyme</I>:
it contains two very distinct scenarios, a frame narrative in which
monoculture dominates, and an internal narrative in which increased
transcultural hybridization takes center stage. By means of this framing
structure, Cendrars implies the interdependence between imperialism and
hybridity, between cultural hegemony and greater "choice" (the multiple
"interpellations" to which, according to Jim Collins, the modern subject
is exposed).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  He begins the essay by evoking the railway, the road, and the canal,
  familiar late nineteenth-century symbols of expansionism, in order
  to suggest at once the discovery of difference and its inverse, the
  imposition of geometric regularity on previously immeasurable expanses
  of the globe:

 The opening paragraphs of "La Metaphysique du caf&eacute;" combine a tone
 of awe-- "<I>ma&icirc;trise &eacute;tonnante</I>"--with a vocabulary
 suggesting moral repugnance--"<I>dominer</I>," "<I>imposer</I>,"
 "<I>exploitation</I>," and so on. Monoculture "dissociates,"
 "disintegrates," and "masticates." Like a huge digestive apparatus
 monoculture transforms "primal matter, plants, and animals" into one
 identical substance. It is merciless ("<I>sans aucun souci</I>");
 it "prescribes" and "overwhelms," eventually "reducing" rather than
 increasing the diversity of forms of life on the planet: "In comparison
 to the vegetal overabundance of nature, monoculture only cultivates a
 very small number of judiciously selected species" .

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 All this activity of violent assimilation and mastication is motivated,
 Cendrars then explains, by man's perverse impulse to render difference
 uniform, his seemingly compulsive need to dominate nature's chaos through
 any means at his disposal: "On the part of man there is a need for
 simplification that tends to satisfy itself by any means whatsoever. And
 this artificial monotony, this monotony that increasingly takes over
 the world, this monotony that certain people deplore is actually the
 clearest sign of our grandeur" .

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 It could be argued, and indeed has been, that Cendrars was entirely
 in earnest when he wrote these words, and that, therefore, any tonal
 inconsistencies one might discern between expressions such as "artificial
 monotony" and "our grandeur"--as well as the irritating effect created
 by the thrice repeated "this monotony"--are simply inventions on the
 part of the reader. The conclusion to the essay tends to confirm

<B></B>

this reading, for it insists upon a causal link between the violent
transformation of delicate ecosystems and a "moral progression" leading
to greater civic freedoms and democratic reforms:

The optimism Cendrars expresses in this conclusion now appears
hallucinatory; however, at the time, two years before the Great Crash of
1929, capitalist expansion indeed seemed to promise a higher standard
of living, if not for the indigenous Amerindian, then at least, as
Cendrars remarks, for "the poorest colonizer." "This little coffee bean
[<I>Cette cerise de caf&eacute;</I>]," Cendrars predicts, is the capital
capable not only of financing the newest "skyscraper in the great city of
S&atilde;o Paulo," but also of supplying greater comfort and luxury, "Yes,
luxury, even to the poorest colonizer" . Only in his later, deeply
pessimistic works such as <I>Le Lotissement du ciel</I> (The parceling
out of the sky) does Cendrars fully admit the fallacy of the causal link
he had assumed previously between monoculture and altruistic reform.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Yet even "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;" shows signs of
 internal conflict; a pastiche of texts patched together, it is often
 self-contradictory on the levels of diction and tone. The conclusion
 may perhaps have been intended merely as a formal bow to the audience
 Cendrars was addressing. He should not be forgiven his formal bow,
 however; Cendrars was in fact often guilty of flirting with technocrats,
 industrialists, and repressive regimes of many colors, and thus of
 compromising his reputation as a prophet of literary and cultural
 freedoms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  At the same time, though, the destabilizing elements embedded in the
  essay militate in favor of a more thorough and careful reading. The
  essay as a whole is not reducible to the propagandistic bow with which
  it ends. Cendrars's discourse is never monocultural or monoglossic;

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Cendrars's first snapshot of Brazil is taken on the wharfs, from
 the vantage point of a geographically and narratively liminal region
 where the bustling traffic between Brazil and the rest of the world
 is most in evidence. The poet's first impression of Brazil is thus
 not of its autonomy and isolation but rather of the permeability of
 its borders. Brazil's cultural identity is shown to be in flux: the
 country is undergoing an invasion of commodity items, all of which
 serve as fetishes of modernity, "statuettes of Saint Teresa" in the
 tabernacle of capitalism. The wharf scene is an inversion of the scene
 that preceded it--the spectacle of monoculture's "artificial monotony"
 and "grandeur"; and yet the two scenes are clearly linked by a causal
 connection. If monoculture is a large stomach, a machine for devouring
 and transforming everything into the same, monoculture is also,
 he discovers, a catalyst for exchange and increased intercultural
 contact. Objects of consumption from all over the world mingle in a
 chaotic mosaic: from words ("newspapers from all over the world") and
 apparati ("scrap-iron" and "machines") to belief systems ("statuettes of
 Saint Theresa"), cultural product ("gramophones"), and household items
 responsible for the dramatic transformation of hygenic rituals and daily
 life ("rolls of toilet paper," "bathtubs," "tons of gasoline"). Cendrars
 even implies that he is himself a kind of <I>produit de consommation</I>
 brought over from abroad to be assimilated into the "magnificent
 disorder" of Brazilian cultural life. The repetition of the verb
 "disembark" to refer both to his own arrival on Brazilian soil and to
 that of the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who come to work on
 sugar and coffee plantations establishes surreptitiously a connection
 between the types of cultural crossings (and labor patterns) enforced
 by agro-capitalism and the types of cultural crossings celebrated as
 internationalism or the globalization of culture. Cendrars's relation
 to Brazil transforms him into a thing, a fetishized representative of
 European modernism, expected, in turn, to transport back to Europe
 an assimilable--and marketable--snapshot of Brazil. It is as though
 Cendrars had a precocious intimation that, in postmodernity, cultural
 hybridity would largely be a matter of consumption.

 Upon witnessing the spectacle of commodity diversity played out on the
 wharfs of Rio, the narrator then takes a vow that he will seek out its
 hidden motor; he will "go back as quickly as possible to the source of
 this marvelous richness and . . . go see, see with [his] own eyes, how
 this source overflows with such furious energy, such furious abundance"
 . The next section of the narrative then describes the author's
 visit to the plantation of S&atilde;o Martinho, a visit made with the
 ambition of locating the "source" of "such furious abundance." The
 original publication of "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;"
 was accompanied by a photograph of the main building at S&atilde;o
 Martinho, a detail lending a note of journalistic rigor to the piece. But
 Cendrars's written description is far

less informative than it is impressionistic, drawing on a metaphysical,
poetic discourse and replacing the prose structure of the earlier
paragraphs with a telegraphic, paratactic style.

 The passage's sudden shifts in tone, style, punctuation, and diction
 correspond to the nature of the experience being described. The
 abrupt revelation of the "source" or the "force of attraction and
 exchange" is staged by Cendrars as no less than a confrontation with
 the mathematical sublime. Indeed, all the traditional elements of
 the sublime aesthetic experience are in place: he and his companion
 "contemplate" the "colossal" expanse; the identical rows of coffee-plants
 are metaphorically transformed into one of Kant's privileged res for
 the natural sublime, the ocean and its innumerable waves ("an emerald
 sea, a profound ocean"); and finally, the observers of this spectacle are
 reduced to an anguished silence ("too much grandeur strangles, stifles,
 and troubles"). Descriptive prose collapses into the exclamation "What
 a spectacle!" In the end the viewer is left speechless, resonating in
 awe to the miracle of redundancy ("I couldn't find a word to say").

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Once again, the reader is arrested by the problem of tone. Cendrars
 may delight in the spectacle of agricultural standardization but he
 also indicates that such standardization "silences," "stifles," and
 "strangles." The experience as described is thus by no means uniformly
 positive; the author depicts himself as transfixed on the spot,
 immobilized, just like a coffee plant, "<I>les pieds plant&eacute;s
 dans la terre rouge</I>." He has not been energized by the spectacle of
 monoculture; on the contrary, he has been struck dumb by it, like the
 victim of an Ovidian metamorphosis dehumanized by too intense an exposure
 to passion. At least momentarily, the sublimity of monoculture transforms
 the spectator into stone: he is now reified, transformed into an object,
 "somber, taciturn, and as if immobilized." The author experiences a
 loss of his faculties, a sense that the imagination has been overcome
 and defeated by something it cannot encompass; only after a few moments
 does this experience of silencing give way to an overflow of words,
 the repetitive, appositive sentences found in the paragraphs that follow.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Cendrars's caffeinated sublime is an implicit commentary not on
 monoculture alone but rather on its relation to the Kantian sublime and
 to the laws of Western aesthetics in general. Just as the experience
 of the mathematical sublime described by Kant involves simultaneously a
 movement of recoil and a sensation of awe, so too Cendrars's experience
 of monoculture's "artificial monotony" provokes in him sensations of
 morbidity and vertigo as well as respect and admiration. The original
 title, "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;," already evoked the
 connection between Kant's theory of Universal Taste and Brazil's
 discovery of the world's taste for coffee; however, in 1931, when the
 essay was republished as part of the collection <I>Aujourd'hui</I>,
 Cendrars solidified the connection by adding an epigraph that places
 Kant--or at least his ghost--in a direct relation to monocultural
 production. The epigraph, which I have resisted citing until now, is
 drawn from a French newspaper article that appeared four days after the
 first version of "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;" was published
 in <I>O Jornal</I>. It reads:

 In a few succinct sentences, Cendrars establishes no less than a genetic
 relation between the great German philosopher and the owner of the
 coffee plantation and, as a corollary, between metaphysical principles of
 universal taste and the geopolitics of global monoculture. The connection
 Cendrars establishes is somewhat loose, however, in that Kant's sublime
 is that of the natural wonder, whereas the experience of the sublime
 he describes is one provoked by the spectacle of man's own nature, his
 unyielding will to impress his stamp on the disorderly productivity of
 the earth. The aspect of Kant that Cendrars retains intact is this:
 a law of human nature exists commanding man to seek experiences of
 immeasurable magnitudes only to search for ways to encompass these
 magnitudes by recasting them as reflections of the immeasurability of the
 human mind. According to this law, an initial feeling of repugnance or
 fear is followed by an intimation of what the human mind is capable of
 achieving: a conception of the supersensible, of that which is beyond
 estimation or, put differently, that which can only find its measure
 in the inestimable thing man's mind is. "Therefore," concludes Kant,

the feeling of the sublime in nature is respect for <I>our own
vocation,</I> which we attribute to an Object of nature by a certain
subreption (substitution of a respect for the Object in place of one

renders, as it were, intuitable the supremacy of our cognitive faculties
on the rational side over the greatest faculty of sensibility.

 In a move that will be crucial not only to the future of Western
 aesthetics in general but also to Cendrars's specific understanding of
 the monocultural sublime, Kant shifts the locus of immeasurability from
 the Object to the Subject, thereby, in a sense, absorbing the other,
 making it a re, an equivalent of the Self. The law of the mind

<B></B>

as described by Kant turns out to be the necessity experienced by the
subject to seek out equivalences, to insist upon the fungibility of
the non-fungible:

It is, in other words, "for us a law (of reason), which goes to make
us what we are," Kant explains, "that we should esteem as small in
comparison with ideas of reason everything which for us is great in
nature as an object of sense; and that which makes us alive to the
feeling of this supersensible side of our being harmonizes with that law"
(<I>Critique,</I> 106).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In essence, then, Kant proposes that our natural instinct as humans
 is to resolve every sublime experience of the external Object into
 an experience of the sublime Subject, to elevate an experience of
 terror and stifling awe to the order of an epiphany, an affirmation
 of Reason. As victims (or beneficiaries) of this law, we transform our
 silence into words, our non-knowledge into knowledge, and by doing so
 we neutralize the threat of the radically other by incorporating the
 other into ourselves. It is in this respect that the sublime can be
 seen--by Cendrars, <I>is</I> seen--as productive, capitalist, even
 cannibalistic. Our nature, Kant seems to say, is quite simply to be
 hungry, to have an appetite for--to take a "negative pleasure" in--the
 "<I>absolutely great</I>" which we then succeed in assimilating to our
 transcendental being (<I>Critique,</I> 106). It is <I>this</I> law of
 human reason, and not the little "<I>c&eacute;rise de caf&eacute;</I>,"
 that proves to be the dynamic source, the generative motor that Cendrars
 discovers in "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;."

 Cendrars; "Is it the brutishness brought on by work, by too much work,

 man's will to profit Cendrars seems to fall back on purely pragmatic
 explanations for monoculture's transformation of "each zone of the

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In what has become a familiar interrogative mode, Cendrars suggests
 that the will (or the law) governing Brazil's economic prosperity,
 its increasing political importance, and even its new visibility in the
 aesthetic domain, is related not simply to monocultural agro-economics
 in general, but to the obsessive cultivation of coffee in particular. The
 need that causes people of all ages and locales to intoxicate themselves
 with a stimulant is, he implies, identical to the law that requires man
 to experience as fully and intensely as possible the seemingly limitless
 force and acuity of the mind. To put this in Kantian terms, we might
 say that to "pass beyond the narrow confines of sensibility," to feel
 the full scope of the mind without, however, being able to identify its
 borders, is the ultimate goal towards which all this feverish activity
 strains (<I>Critique,</I> 103). Man suffers from an ineluctable need to
 "recuperate losses," says Cendrars,
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  just as Kant, employing a vocabulary that is, after all, arguably more
  economic than it is metaphysical, posits the sublime as a variety of
  investment, the experience of a loss that must be tolerated in order to
  create a surplus, an expansion of the self. For the experience of the
  sublime, writes Kant, provokes "a pleasure that only arises indirectly,
  being brought about by the feeling of a <I>momentary check to the vital
  forces</I> followed at once by a discharge <I>all the more powerful</I>
  [ . . . ]; the [sublime] object lends itself to the presentation of <I>a
  sublimity discoverable in the mind</I>" (<I>Critique,</I> 91-2;
  emphasis added).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In sum, Cendrars's "metaphysics" of monoculture produces a theory of
 human nature as essentially appetitive, forever extending its reach
 to encompass what at first appears terrifyingly Other. Paradoxically,
 humans seek not to satisfy their appetite, but to stimulate it, for any
 immediate satisfaction, any cessation of longing, would place limits
 on what appetite, and thus on what the mind, could be. Monoculture,
 like Kant's Subject with a capital "S," eats up everything around it,
 reducing difference on its own soil but simultaneously permitting
 commerce with that which, up to that point, it has not been. Greedy
 as the mind, monoculture is destructive of the other, but infinitely
 re-productive of itself. Ultimately Kant belongs in Brazil because
 his theory of the mind harmonizes perfectly with the metaphysics of
 monoculture: both propose that the non-fungible can be--must be, by
 law--reduced to the fungible, and that, through the very process of
 the Other's reduction, man should be enlarged "<I>de plus en plus</I>."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 How, then, is the reader to situate Cendrars's voice in "La
 M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;"? Exactly what attitude towards
 monoculture is one to attribute to him? There is no doubt that Cendrars
 admires the force of the law of assimilation he discovers in San
 Martinho, but it is equally clear that he appreciates its contrary, the
 non-law of uncontrolled diversity--hybrid forms such as the carnival,
 the <I>m&eacute;tiss&eacute;,</I> as well as the heteroglossic mix of
 languages and lifestyles he finds piled up along the quai. Most

<B></B>

worthy of notice is his recognition that monoculture and hybridity
are inextricably intertwined: intercultural contacts of all
varieties--ethnographic, artistic, cultural, religious, and of course
commercial--owe their existence to, and cannot take place without,
economic developments of the kind motivated by the law of the caffeinated
sublime. Although the two major forms of hybridity Cendrars confronts are
markedly different--the racial and cultural hybridity of Brazil's past
must be distinguished from the commercial hybridity of its present--both
can nonetheless trace their roots back to the same Kantian ambitions
of the agricultural entrepreneur. Cendrars does not want to relinquish
either the entrepreneurial rigor ("the need for simplification") or the
carnivalesque excess of syncretic play. The unsubstantiated premise of
"La M&eacute;taphysique" is that the former will continue to engender and
support the latter. Such a premise, however, will not be maintained as
Cendrars, like many modernists of his generation, becomes increasingly
aware of the dangers of capitalist exploitation. His attitude toward
monocultural standardization and industrial development grows increasingly
skeptical and "irreverent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
  And even in 1927 he can provide only weak assurance that monoculture's
  suppression of botanical, zoological, and racial difference will be
  offset by an exponential increase in the number of hybrid ways to live,
  worship, and make art.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A year after "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;" appeared, Oswaldo
de Andrade published what would become one of the major documents of
postmodern "hybridity-talk": the "Manifesto Antrop&oacute;fago" or
"Cannibalist Manifesto."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  Brazil's first indigenous avant-garde intervention was based on a
  recuperation of the previously pejorative term "cannibal" to refer to
  the active assimilation and transformation of foreign aesthetics by
  Brazilian-born Portuguese-speaking writers. Many contemporary postmodern
  theorists place de Andrade's aesthetics of "anthropophagy" in the
  same category as Rog&eacute;rio Sganzerla's more recent "aesthetics
  of garbage," Paul Leduc's "salamander" poetics, and the phenomenon of
  American hip-hop.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  All these examples of postmodern and, in some cases, postcolonial
  hybridity are thought to manifest the single most progressive tendency
  operating in culture today. This tendency is one that, as Kobena
  Mercer describes it, "critically <I>appropriates</I> elements from
  the mastercodes of the dominant culture and 'creolises' them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  Cannibalism is an appropriate metaphor for this positively valenced
  mode of "appropriation"; it suggests the gesture of incorporation
  (otherwise known as pastiche, collage, grafting, or sampling) and
  exemplifies such an incorporation, a parodic recycling of a pejorative
  term that displaces the term's previous value.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 No one has yet thought to resituate de Andrade's "Cannibalist
 Manifesto" either in the context of Cendrars's "La M&eacute;taphysique
 du caf&eacute;" or in that of Kant's Third <I>Critique.</I> This is
 hardly surprising, given that Cendrars is not a particularly well-known
 re in postcolonialist studies and that, further, Kant's is not the
 first name to pop into one's mind when speaking about cannibalism. But
 such a recontextualization is worth attempting, for it is reasonable
 to posit that de Andrade would have been familiar, if not intimate,
 with Cendrars's "Utility Principle," and that, moreover, he would

<B></B>

have continued to follow Cendrars's career after 1924 and therefore
would have read "La M&eacute;taphysique." Intertextuality or literary
cross-fertilization is the major theme of the "Cannibalist Manifesto,"
and de Andrade makes no attempt to disguise the fact that his own peculiar
brand of avant-garde poetics is largely a cannibalization of previous
European models, including--but not limited to--that of Francis Picabia's
"Manifeste Cannibale Dada" of 1920.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
  But there is further evidence to suggest that the influence of
  Cendrars was pertinent to the thesis of "Cannibalist Manifesto":
  in de Andrade's "Manifesto of Pau-Brasil Poetry" of 1924, where
  the author first tests out ideas he will later develop in the more
  radical "Cannibalist Manifesto," he specifically mentions Cendrars
  as an important model. Moreover, the manifesto's typography, diction,
  and argument all manifest the influence of Cendrars's work, especially
  the 1919 volume, <I>Dix-neuf po&egrave;mes &eacute;lastiques.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
  Finally, both the dominant metaphor and the specific language in which
  this metaphor is articulated in the "Cannibalist Manifesto" recall
  "La M&eacute;taphysique." "Cannibalist Manifesto" is clearly another
  troping on Kant, but a troping to the second degree.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 "Cannibalist Manifesto" begins with a gesture similar to the
 one that opens Cendrars's "M&eacute;taphysique": a matter
 of taste, or what we might call culinary ritual, is declared
 to have metaphysical implications: "Cannibalism alone unites
 us. Socially. Economically. Philosophically."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  Critics have understood the "us" in this passage to refer to Brazilians
  in particular (and indeed, the subversive nature of de Andrade's
  transformative, appropriative gesture depends to a large extent on
  the particularity of the "us"). However, it soon becomes evident that
  cannibalism is a practice that unites not simply Brazilian writers and
  artists in search of a historically resonant, indigenous aesthetic;
  rather, cannibalism is a practice that unites the entire human race:
  "I am only concerned with what is not mine. Law of Man. Law of the
  cannibal" . "Law of the cannibal" is in fact the law of the
  capitalist, who concerns himself only with what he does not already
  possess. In quest of the not-yet-possessed, or the Other, "We push
  onward," states de Andrade . If we wish to be good cannibals, he
  continues, we must transform "the equation 'Self, part of the Cosmos'
  into the axiom 'Cosmos, part of the Self'" . This latter axiom is,
  for "us," our "Law": "Subsistence. Experience. Cannibalism" .

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 By now, an echo of Cendrars's "Metaphysics of coffee" should be
 audible. Just as Cendrars discovered the "principle" behind monocultural
 assimilation, so de Andrade articulates a "Law of Man" or of the
 cannibal who incorporates every Other into the self. But behind this
 echo it is also possible to retrieve the even fainter reverberation of
 Kant's own axiomatic metaphysics. While de Andrade's cannibal inverts
 the pantheistic "Self, part of the Cosmos" to form the proposition
 "Cosmos, part of the Self," Kant's "outraged imagination" strives,
 in its own cannibalistic "onward advance," to incorporate the sublime
 Other, to assimilate it to the sublime dimensions of the mind.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In what way, then, does the cannibalist impulse of the manifesto
 differ from the standardizing impulse of "La M&eacute;taphysique du
 caf&eacute;"? How are de Andrade and Cendrars positioned differently
 vis-&agrave;-vis the devastating, exploitative program of modernist
 standardization? The aesthetics championed by "Cannibalist Manifesto"
 have

<B></B>

generally been associated with the subversive project of
<I>d&eacute;tournement</I>: the appropriation of, or troping on, an
element of the hegemonic order in order to create a new hybrid, an entity
situated in the "neither . . . nor" region of anti-essentialist politics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
  In the words of de Andrade's English translator, Leslie Bary,
  the manifesto "challenges the dualities civilization/barbarism,
  modern/primitive, and original/derivative, which had informed the
  construction of Brazilian culture since the days of the colony";
  "Oswald's anthropophagist," she concludes, "neither apes nor rejects
  European culture, but 'devours' it, adapting its strengths and
  incorporating them into the native self."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The difference between a cannibalist aesthetics and a monocultural
 economics is thus not to be located in their respective underlying
 metaphysics, for the Kantian "Law of Man"-- the law of devouring
 and appropriation--underlies them both. Rather, this difference
 is to be found in the positionality of the subject who exercises
 the Kantian "Law": Does the subject exercise it from a position of
 subservience or domination, in order to resist or, alternatively, to
 oppress, in the role of "parodic" mime or "authentic" originator? At
 several clearly identifiable moments, Cendrars positions himself on
 the side of the colonizer; "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;"
 was, after all, intended to please his benefactor, the Europeanized
 intellectual and coffee plantation owner, Paulo Prado (most likely the
 "companion" to whom Cendrars refers in the text). Entire passages of
 "La M&eacute;taphysique," not to mention the full text of "The Utility
 Principle," read like apologies for empire, hymns to the pure will
 to dominate the Other. De Andrade's manifesto, in contrast, assumes
 the position of the colonized. Although de Andrade, like Prado, was a
 Europeanized Brazilian and a member of the ruling elite, he attempts
 to speak in "Cannibalist Manifesto" as a descendent of the Tupi, not of
 the Vieira, as a son of the Great Snake, not of the Bad Mother, Cornelia.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
  Ironically, it was Cendrars himself who had encouraged de Andrade to
  identify more fully with the indigenous tribal past of Brazil.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
  However, as a foreigner dependent for his knowledge of Brazil's interior
  upon the very system that was destroying it, Cendrars could hardly have
  assumed the position of the colonized that de Andrade, perhaps with a
  bit of bad faith, could. As a member of the oligarchical elite, however,
  he was appropriating a cannibalist identity from a race to which he
  did not belong. The politics of de Andrade's gesture are thus a little
  less clear than they have been assumed to be. At the same time, though,
  de Andrade manages to execute a more radical gesture; he cannibalizes
  Kant <I>not</I> with the intention of mobilizing him for monoculture
  but, rather, in order to <I>hybridize</I> <I>Kant,</I> to unveil the
  "primitive," cannibalistic discourse embedded in and informing Kant's
  own, and thus to suggest that the "law of human reason"--that which
  "makes us what we are"--is the law of the sublime cannibal "only
  concerned with what is not mine" ("Cannibalist Manifesto," 39).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Whether de Andrade would have hybridized Kant without the intervention
 of Cendrars is a question worth asking. By making the link between
 a "devouring" monoculture and a Subject in search of the sublime,
 Cendrars provided de Andrade with a certain form of avant-garde
 nourishment. Because of this debt (not to mention his debt to European
 modernism in general), de Andrade can only with difficulty claim to
 speak from the position of the indigenous Brazilian cannibal. The
 equivocal position

<B></B>

in which de Andrade finds himself is not exceptional but rather typical
of the predicament encountered by many cultural producers speaking from
the position of the disenfranchised. As Gayatri Spivak has persuasively
argued, the subaltern--the truly subaltern--rarely (if ever) gets a
chance to locate himself or herself in discourse, and thus cannot lay
claim to the honor of introducing new (pure) voices into circulation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
  In this light, all cultural producers are cannibals, inevitably subject
  to the "Law of Man," the law that bids us find a language, a measure,
  for that which initially appears beyond "the narrow confines" of the
  hegemonic (European) self.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 A close reading of "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;" and its use of
 pronouns, diction, and citation, reveals that Cendrars's authorial voice
 is hybrid as well; it does not emanate from a self-identical position
 but is instead composed of various, and sometimes opposed discourses
 in what is perhaps ultimately not enough of a "<I>critical</I>
 syncretism," a poetics of simultaneity explicitly concerned with
 exposing power relations between heterogeneous cultural traditions or
 practices. But one thing Cendrars does at least acknowledge is that
 all forms of making, speaking, and cultivating are to some extent acts
 of homogenization (they suppress radical alterity) as much as they are
 acts of hybridization that--in the vegetal as well as the commercial
 world--produce consequences never entirely predictable or subject
 to control. By placing Kant at the heart both of homogenization and
 hybridity, Cendrars introduces an irony into all attempts to maintain
 their separation (and thus to politicize them in any simple or clear
 manner). Cendrars demonstrates that even an aesthetics of difference has
 to pass through a moment of digestive recuperation, of communication
 in which discourse--monoculture, the Transcendental Subject--absorbs
 the Other and thus risks reducing this Other to the same.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The discernably ambivalent tone of Cendrars's "La M&eacute;taphysique du
 caf&eacute;" is a bracing corrective to the kind of celebratory excesses
 of critics like Jim Collins, Iain Chambers, or Ulf Hannerz. According
 to Hannerz, for instance, multiplied contacts between first-world
 and third-world countries (contacts based, he does not mention, on
 the exploitative practices of agricultural, industrial, and chemical
 conglomerates) are not decreasing but rather increasing the number of
 cultural alternatives available to the world as a whole. "The people in
 my favorite Nigerian town drink Coca Cola," Hannerz writes, "but they
 drink <I>buru-kutu</I> too; and they can watch <I>Charlie's Angels</I>
 as well as Hausa drummers on the television sets which spread rapidly
 as soon as electricity has arrived."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  In the same vein, Collins writes with unalloyed enthusiasm that the
  problem of "accessibility [has] virtually disappeared"; there is no
  Grand Hotel "that somehow orchestrates all cultural production and
  reception according to one master system." Anyone can be interpellated
  by anything, and thus we are subjects without boundaries, constantly
  able to incorporate the Other as just another version of the self.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 There is reason to rejoice in the increased circulation of third
 world musics, art traditions, and hybrid practices. Still, as Robert
 Stam reminds us, hybridity "has never been a peaceful encounter,
 a tension-free theme park; it has always been deeply entangled with
 colonial violence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
  And Torgovnick counsels that reveling "in the postmodern m&eacute;lange
  of us and them" should not obscure other, less developed historical

<B></B>

knowledge of how, precisely, these new and exotic treats came to appear
on the dinner plate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
  All forms of cultural syncretism must struggle to remain
  <I>critical</I>; the absorptive gesture is not arrested by creative
  re-citation; without the traumatic work of memory and productive
  alienation--without, that is, the very ruptures in tone that
  characterize Cendrars's "La M&eacute;taphysique"--such gestures can
  submit too easily to the law of the cannibalistic and homogenizing
  sublime. Resisting complete assimilation, letting the seams show (as
  Cendrars invariably did), is perhaps a peculiarly modernist way of
  registering the history that brings different cultures together and
  that too often tears them apart.

James Clifford, <I>The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth-Century
Ethnography, Literature, and Art</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University
Press, 1988). As globalization proceeds, Clifford's argument goes,
economically and politically weaker microcultures will not necessarily
die out, but will instead learn to practice "strategic accommodations,"
discovering "powerful, distinctive ways to live . . . not as archaic
survival but as an ongoing process" of self-realization and renewal
. See also Edouard Glissant on "<I>cr&eacute;olit&eacute;</I>" in <I>Le
Discours antillais</I> (Paris: Seuil, 1981); Fran&ccedil;oise Lionnet on

Self-Portraiture</I> (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1989);
and Iain Chambers on "migrancy" in <I>Migrancy, Culture, Identity</I>
(London: Routledge, 1994). Homi Bhabha's treatment of "hybridity" is
a special case; he transforms the noun, <I>hybrid</I>, into a verb,
<I>hybridize</I>, and uses it to refer to, among other things, the
process of disclosing "the struggle of identifications" within any
identity and the "strategic [discursive] reversal of the process of
domination through disavowal" (Bhabha, <I>The Location of Culture</I>
[London: Routledge, 1994], 29, 112).

title of his second section from Cendrars's 1924 volume of poetry about
Brazil, <I>Feuilles de route.</I> The two European intellectuals also
assumed the same equivocal position in Brazilian culture, frequenting

Critics now believe that Cendrars did not visit Brazil eight times,

September 1924; from January to June of 1926; and from September 1927
to January 1928.

Eulalio has suggested that "La M&eacute;taphysique" expresses Cendrars's
longing for order, a longing that was satisfied in his later life
by a return to religious faith. Others have proposed that the essay
confirms the growing influence of Prado over Cendrars. The essay was
written during Cendrars's last trip to Brazil in 1926; by this time,
his relations with other Brazilian modernists such as Oswaldo de Andrade
and Mario de Andrade had become strained. Apparently, he was thinking
seriously about purchasing land and becoming a developer himself.

An important exception is Adrien Roig's "La Fazenda S&atilde;o
Martinho." Roig provides a generous historical background for the
plantation that Cendrars visited; his reading of the re of the
<I>fazenda</I> in the works of Oswald de Andrade and Cendrars is, however,
disappointing. Roig concludes that both de Andrade and Cendrars were
enchanted by the plantation's prosperity ("Prosp&eacute;rit&eacute;"
is the name of the poem de Andrade dedicated to the Fazenda S&atilde;o
Martinho in <I>Po&eacute;sie Pau-Brasil</I>); he does not attend
either to the more equivocal aspects of Cendrars's description nor
does he spend any time at all on Cendrars's use of Kant. Maria Teresa
de Freitas, "Le Br&eacute;sil en revue: 'Reportages' br&eacute;siliens
de Blaise Cendrars," in <I>Cendrars au pays de Jean Galmot,</I> 209,
is equally unsatisfactory; she concludes that the text was "realistic"

Cendrars admits that his attitude towards Brazil's ambitious development
schemes has become "<I>irrespectueux.</I>" He borrows the title from a
line found in "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;," thus implicitly
linking the earlier work to the later; however, in <I>Br&eacute;sil,</I>
Cendrars's tone is far more ambivalent, even embittered. He tells a story,

"Manifeste Cannibale Dada" was first published in the small Parisian

anthologized in Francis Picabia, <I>Ecrits 1913-1920,</I> ed. Olivier
Revault d'Allones (Paris: Belfond, 1975). For an incomplete and sketchy
rendering of Oswald de Andrade's debts to the European avant-garde, see
Benedito Nunes, "Le manifeste anthropophage," in <I>Surr&eacute;alisme
p&eacute;riph&eacute;rique.</I> Scholars of Latin American modernism,
from Nunes to Robert Stam, have neglected to analyze the relation between
Picabia's manifesto and de Andrade's, claiming that there is, in fact,
little similarity--either in content or form--between the two. However,
Picabia's "Manifeste Cannibale Dada," a testament to and criticism of the
invasion of capitalist practices into the domain of art, appears to be
entirely pertinent to de Andrade's notion of a carnivorous, acquisitive
"Law of Man." The specular relation between cannibalism and capitalism
that de Andrade implicitly establishes may be clearly identified when
Picabia's and de Andrade's manifestos are placed side by side.

Until Cendrars came to Brazil, Oswaldo de Andrade and Tarsila do Amaral's
avant-garde aesthetic had consisted of the stream-lined cubism of
L&eacute;ger and the machinism of Le Corbusier. Cendrars encouraged the
couple to explore Brazil's indigenous forms of cultural expression. He
organized group trips into the Brazilian interior--an interior that even
de Andrade and do Amaral had never seen before. It was only after the
group made a trip together to Minas Gerais in April 1924 that de Andrade
came up with the idea for <I>Pau Brasil,</I> the movement that would
establish the necessity for a properly <I>Brazilian</I> avant-gardism and
that would spawn the "Cannibalist Manifesto" three years later. (Perhaps
this is why de Andrade wrote in the dedication to <I>Pau Brasil</I>:
"To Blaise Cendrars, on the occasion of the discovery of Brazil.") Serge
Milliet writes that "the influence of Cendrars on the Brazilian modernists
was decisive. These rich young people could travel every year throughout
Europe, but they knew nothing about their own country" (Milliet, quoted
in Pierre Rivas, "Cendrars, le Nouveau Monde et l'Homme nouveau," in
<I>Europe</I> 54, no. 566 [June 1976]: 54; my translation). Cendrars
even founded a Soci&eacute;te des Amis des Monuments Historiques du
Br&eacute;sil whose mission it was to preserve colonial ruins and tribal
artefacts from neglect, destruction, and deportation to foreign museums.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Until recently, Victor Klemperer (1881-1960) was remembered, when
at all, as a professor of French literature. His best-known work, <I>The
Language of the Third Reich, LTI: Lingua Tertii Imperii: A Philologist's
Notebook</I> (published in 1947 as <I>LTI: Notizbuch eines Philologen</I>)
applied philological principles and interests to the study of contemporary
culture, in this case to language use in Nazi Germany. As this work
detailed, Klemperer himself suffered under the Nazi regime. The son of
a well-known Reform rabbi (and the cousin of conductor Otto Klemperer),
Klemperer moved to Berlin as a child, studied at

<B></B>

various universities in Germany, France, Switzerland, and Italy, married
pianist/composer/translator Eva Schlemmer in 1906, worked for seven years
as a freelance writer (publishing books of fiction and nonfiction), and
served briefly as a soldier during World War I. His first academic posts
were in Naples and Munich. Appointed in 1920 as a professor of Romance
languages at Dresden's Technical University, he edited a philological
yearbook and published numerous scholarly monographs and surveys of
French literary history.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By 1933, Klemperer was well-established as an academic. Then the
advent of the Third Reich and the implementation of increasingly
punitive anti-Semitic laws derailed his professorial career and
profoundly disrupted his personal existence. Although he had converted
to Protestantism in 1903 (and was baptized anew in 1912), he was
nonetheless considered Jewish under the Nuremberg Laws. His marriage to
a non-Jew (who stood by her husband despite repeated Nazi bullying and
admonishments to divorce him) protected Klemperer from the most lethal
forms of anti-Semitic persecution; the direct threat of deportation
to a concentration or death camp came only in 1945. He nonetheless
spent much of the Third Reich in mortal terror, under constant threat
of physical violence (and physical collapse), and cut off ever more
completely from the possessions, position, and relative privilege of his
former life. Forced into early retirement, he eventually lost most of
his pension, his house, his entitlement to use the university library,
to use public transportation, to enter a movie theater. He was compelled
to wear a Star of David in public, to move with his wife into cramped
quarters in a series of "Jewish houses" (each a kind of miniature ghetto,
subject to brutal police searches), and eventually, despite his age
and heart condition, to perform heavy manual labor in the streets and
factories of Dresden. Klemperer experienced at first hand the physical and
psychic sufferings of the Jewish community. Near starvation, near despair,
they waited for the end, the optimists anticipating the end of the war,
the realists the known death awaiting them at Auschwitz. Through all of
these tribulations, Klemperer continued writing; once he lost regular
access to a scholarly library, he began to focus his scholarly energies
on the <I>LTI</I> project and on <I>Curriculum Vitae,</I> a memoir of
his early life in Wilhelmine Germany. At the same time, he chronicled
his daily life under Nazism, continuing the diary he had been keeping
since the age of seventeen.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The belated appearance of these autobiographical writings has sparked
the current Klemperer revival. In 1989, the posthumous publication in
Germany of Klemperer's 1370 page <I>Curriculum Vitae: Erinnerungen
eines Philologen, 1881-1918</I> (<I>Curriculum vitae: memories
of a philogist, 1881-1918</I>) elicited little response. When
his Nazi-era diaries were published by Aufbau Verlag in 1995, however,
they quickly became a publishing phenomenon. In the meantime, the Wall
had fallen, Germany had been reunited, and Aufbau, like other former
GDR publishers, had begun publishing revisionist documentary volumes,
many based on previously inaccessible (or unpublishable) archival sources.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  On many levels, the publication of the Klemperer diaries epitomized this
  kind of historical retrieval and a lifting of the GDR's previous, tacit,
  historical censorship. Aufbau responded to the success of Klemperer's
  Nazi-era journal by bringing out, in numerous volumes, early and later
  stretches of his diary: the two volumes covering the Weimar Republic
  (1882 pages), a short volume covering the period from the end of the
  war to the end of 1945, and finally, in two volumes (and another
  1824 pp.), <I>So sitze ich denn swischen allen St&uuml;hlen,</I>
  Klemperer's full diary of life in the Soviet Zone of Occupation and
  the German Democratic Republic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  In Germany, all three diaries are also available (in abridged form)
  as audio books, and the Third Reich diaries are currently being made
  into a television miniseries, aimed at a mass audience.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For more than fifty years, Klemperer meticulously chronicled his own
experiences and his impressions of the social world around him; his
labors yield a body of writing of overwhelming mass and scale. The
effort of transcribing Klemperer's tiny handwriting and of annotating
the diaries was clearly immense. Each of the German volumes contains
75-150 pages of very helpful (if still not exhaustive) editorial
notes; the otherwise sound English translation unfortunately

<B></B>

reproduces only a fraction of them. Both versions, alas, omit the keywords
or headings Klemperer himself entered in the margin of the diary, in an
attempt to catalog or keep track of its subjects. More regrettable still,
both versions of the diary are abridged, the English version even more
than the German "original." Those interested in the diary either as a
socio-historical document or as a literary text have cause to regret the
editors' strategy of elision. The "multiple repetitions" the editors say
they have deleted may well have been crucial to interpreting Klemperer's
psychic disposition at a particular moment or the nature of his recurring
obsessions. The editors also note that "It was not possible to include
all notes about reading and visits to the cinema" (<I>So,</I> 2:959). Yet
for readers interested in German film history, Klemperer's diaries are
most fascinating precisely in their evocative descriptions of particular
cinematic occasions; what other gems would the unabridged edition have
contained? Scholars interested in GDR literary and intellectual history,
similarly, can learn a great deal from the reading notes that <I>are</I>
included in the diary as published; what further conclusions about
postwar literary taste and intellectual debates might have been drawn
from the unabridged diaries?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is still, of course, a lot of diary left, almost more than
nonspecialist readers can handle. For some, indeed, the experience of
tackling the diaries will seem similar, in duration and intensity, to that
of reading Marcel Proust's <I>&Agrave; la recherche du temps perdu</I>
(1913-1927); since each volume takes weeks or months to finish,
the memories of reading become mixed with the locales, details, and
vicissitudes of daily life experienced concurrently. English-speaking
readers may also experience Klemperer's journals as a modern-day
equivalent of the famous seventeenth-century diaries kept by Samuel
Pepys. In crucial respects, to be sure, these diarists remain very
different. The overt expression of sexuality, for instance, plays a
remarkably small role in Klemperer's wartime and postwar diaries (at
least in their currently abridged form). Yet Klemperer resembles Pepys
in his boundless impulse to record, his enduring preoccupation with
the details (and language) of daily life, and his continual, obsessive
need to catalogue his own financial, intellectual, and reputational
assets. If Pepys gives us an unmatched record of daily life in London
at the time of the Restoration, <I>I Will Bear Witness</I> gives us an
unmatched record of life in Nazi Germany from the perspective of one of
its victims--with the 1945 firebombing of Dresden the set piece equivalent
of Pepys's famous account of the Great Fire of London.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Germany, Klemperer is now regarded as one of the preeminent chroniclers
of the twentieth century, particularly of the vicissitudes of recent
German history. The fortuitous accidents of history that led to the
diaries' publication in the very last years of the century have helped
to give them an apparently definitive stature: recovered belatedly,
these diaries offer both the last full view of the German twentieth
century produced within it and in some ways the most comprehensive. The
original German publication of <I>I Will Bear Witness,</I> moreover,
shortly preceded the heated debates over Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's
<I>Hitler's Willing Executioners.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  For the most part, Klemperer's chronicle of daily life in the
  Third Reich refutes Goldhagen's postulation of a widely shared,
  eliminationist anti-Semitism among the German people. At moments,
  indeed, it suggests the relative unpopularity of Nazi anti-Semitism,
  which appears to have been buttressed by official actions but not,
  for the most part, by popular sentiment. What it chronicles instead
  are a staggeringly large number of personally witnessed incidents of
  resistance--if often not of conscious, organized resistance to the
  entire Nazi dispensation then certainly, repeatedly, of spontaneous,
  personal gestures of sympathy, regret, and intended compensation for
  specific injustices and cruelties suffered under Nazi rule.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Klemperer's experience, working-class Germans often prove quite
indifferent, even hostile, to Nazi doctrine. His diaries thus give
unexpected weight to long-standing Communist claims of an almost innate
antifascism among the German proletariat. They also give new credibility
to the oral accounts of daily life under Nazism that circulated in the
early postwar period. At least since the 1960s, the generational struggle
between older Germans who experienced the

<B></B>

Third Reich at first hand and younger Germans "born afterwards" (in
Bertolt Brecht's phrase) has centered partly on the credibility of the
older generation's memories and stories of Nazi Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  What older narrators remembered most vividly were their own innumerable
  small acts of defiance and resistance: a sandwich smuggled illicitly
  to a forced laborer, a complaint to the higher-ups, a critical remark
  made in public. Especially in the wake of the 1963 Auschwitz trials,
  younger auditors became increasingly skeptical of such anecdotes; to
  them, such stories seemed not only trivial, given the genocide going
  on in the background, but conveniently self-exonerating, a clearly
  self-serving filtering of memory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this respect, as in others, Klemperer's account of his experiences as a
"star-wearer" is a revelation. (His diaries also make clear the relative
crudity of even the best literary attempts to convey the atmosphere of the
Third Reich; Brecht's <I>Private Life of the Master Race</I> [1935-8]
and Anna Seghers's <I>The Seventh Cross</I> [1942], for instance,
were the works of antifascist emigr&eacute;s who necessarily lacked
first-hand experience of the milieu they described.) Klemperer retained a
(justified) fear of the Gestapo, a lingering fear of orchestrated pogroms,
and a growing fear of the very young, entirely raised and educated in
the racial hatred of the Third Reich. His dealings with the rest of the
population, however, remained deeply unpredictable. For every shattering
incident of public harassment or name-calling, Klemperer recorded several
others in which unknown fellow Dresdeners expressed sympathy with his
position. Some stopped him in the street, making a point of shaking his
hand, although they did not know him; we are the greeters, one explained,
who have resolved to express our solidarity with those forced to wear the
Star. On the street at dusk as in his various work places, working-class
men repeatedly called out to him as they passed, told him not to lose
courage, and assured him that he was not alone. Although <I>LTI</I>
retrospectively characterizes such episodes as deeply embarrassing,
the diaries suggest they made a decisive difference to Klemperer and
helped him to go on, day by day, in the face of overwhelming existential
fear. Indeed, like the rest of the Jewish community, Klemperer constantly
weighed and counted positive against negative encounters, trying to
decide which represented the majority view, which were the real Germany,
and which way the tide was turning.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The diaries also provide new answers to the lingering question of what, if
anything, the German population knew about the Holocaust as it was being
carried out. The Jews interned in Dresden's Jewish houses, we learn,
eventually knew everything: they knew where (and approximately what)
Auschwitz was; they knew that mass murder was occurring and that they
might be the next victims. Their knowledge, however, came largely from
sources "inside" the community and from illegal listening to foreign
radio broadcasts. And despite relatively frequent, sustained, and often
sympathetic interaction with the "Gentile" world, they apparently made
little attempt to share their dismal knowledge with those outside the
Jewish community; at best, they thought, they would not be believed,
at worst, denounced for defeatism or sedition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Endearingly, one of Klemperer's first responses to the political
pressures of the Third Reich was to learn to drive and to buy a car;
in an increasingly restricted and constrictive political environment,
the freedom of movement offered by the automobile seems life-saving. Soon
enough, however, the "privilege" of driving and car-ownership was stripped
from him, one of many losses of the right to ordinary life. Over the
course of the Third Reich, Klemperer and his wife became increasingly
isolated from mainstream life; the Jewish houses themselves felt not so
much like improvised communities as like places of forced proximity and
collective hysteria.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Klemperer's main refuge was his writing. In addition to their many other
fascinations, his wartime diaries stand as a moving paean to scholarship,
to the torments of scholarly writing, and to the mysterious power
of scholarly obsessions. At first encounter, Klemperer's continuing
preoccupation with the vicissitudes of his book projects seems almost
bathetic, given the shadow of death hanging over him and the world
crashing down around his ears.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Yet what the diaries finally express is an alternating or dialectical
  consciousness about scholarship and writing that

<B></B>

sees and grants all these objections only in turn to insist on and invest
once more in the intrinsic importance (and psychic unavoidability)
of the scholarly enterprise. "My book eats me up and keeps me alive
and gives me balance," Klemperer wrote in October 1935 (<I>I Will,</I>
1:136); in <I>LTI,</I> he retrospectively described his wartime writing
as a tightrope walker's balancing pole that helped to keep him upright
in the face of danger and despair.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both because of and aside from their fraught historical context,
Klemperer's diary entries are unparalleled in their ability to capture
the neurotic structure of the writing process itself. Moments, hours,
days of almost delusional grandeur (the scholar's sense of power,
originality, profound achievement in the act of writing) are regularly
followed by corresponding moments of profound, despairing abjection
(the scholar's sense of futility, imitativeness, nullity in the act of
rereading), which then give way once more to a sense of euphoria, and so
on and so on. Scholarly writing, Klemperer's account suggests, is driven
alternately by ambition and by the fear of the void, by a sense of cosmic
despair and by a hope of futurity, by the need to counteract a sense of
futility or absurdity and by the hope of sustaining the exhilarating,
intoxicating sense of intellectual breakthrough. Scholars it would seem
(and perhaps other writers too) write not out of a need to trump one
another nor even a need to preserve or reinterpret the world around them
but to rejoin, blot out, or surpass their own existing writing. Not only
when viewed at an institutional level but also already on the scale,
and in the privacy, of the scholar's own study, scholarship perpetuates
itself, proliferates itself, feeds on itself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Klemperer's case, of course, the need to write and work was driven
not only by a perpetually looping psychic mechanism but by additional
existential mandates. As Klemperer asked himself again and again, why
should someone probably sentenced to death spend his final days laboring
on a book that was quite likely doomed to be destroyed itself, never to
find its readers? The answer, of course, is that the act of writing is
itself a crucial act of self-affirmation. Such writing takes on further
dignity from the Nazis' refusal to allow it, let alone to recognize,
publish, or honor it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With every year of the Third Reich, Klemperer's scholarly work became
more tightly focused on the situation of the present; while <I>LTI</I>
was intended to offer a scholarly analysis of Nazism from the vantage
point of one trapped within it, Klemperer's diary became a place to
record, with increasing self-consciousness, the tribulations of a whole
people. In a recent review of the wartime diaries, Istvan Deak points
out Klemperer's lack of responsibility towards those he chronicled:
the unconscionable risks he took in keeping the diary throughout the
Nazi period; his deliberate decision to name names in order to preserve
the diary's status as a historical record rather than changing details to
avoid incriminating his familiars and informants (should his diaries have
fallen into the hands of the Gestapo during one of many house searches);
his odd lack of gratitude (and postwar connection) to the family friend
who at great personal risk harbored the diaries and his other scholarly
manuscripts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  Such moral objections are on one level incontrovertible. What they
  may fail to take into account, however, is the status the writer and
  chronicler assumes, under extreme circumstances, as the repository,
  voice, conduit of collective experience and trauma--the role, we are
  frequently told, that writers have played historically in occupied
  Poland, or indeed that Kafka's mouse singer Josephine plays in the
  lives of her people.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his translator's foreword to the second volume of Klemperer's wartime
diaries, Martin Chalmers borrows an epithet from <I>Jakob the Liar,</I>
the famous 1968 Holocaust novel by GDR writer Jurek Becker (himself a
child survivor) and the basis of two films (the second released only
last year). A humble pancake-seller interned in a Polish ghetto, Jakob
accidentally overhears a German radio broadcast, pretends to his friends
that he himself has a radio hidden away, and finds himself, against his
will and better judgment, turned into a moral authority for the Jewish
community. An inadvertent fabulist, his snippets of news, real and
invented, and his promise of immanent liberation become necessary for
the psychic survival of his fellow inmates. In <I>LTI,</I> Klemperer,
too, describes overhearing "a few sentences" from a 1943 radio broadcast

<B></B>

(<I>LTI,</I> 221);
it supplied him not with war news but with further material to contemplate
the Nazi uses and abuses of language (in this particular case, their
American-style penchant for the superlative). Within Dresden's ghetto
archipelago, Klemperer fulfilled a parallel but finally rather different
role than Jakob the Liar. Formerly a professor at the local university,
he was already a re of stature in the Jewish community. Once some
of his circle sensed that he was collecting information about daily
life and language, they began supplying him with materials, lending him
books, even offering to help conceal his manuscript. They looked to him,
it would seem, to give shape, meaning, and hopefully also posterity to
their collective sufferings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the end of <I>LTI,</I> he describes the constant imprecations of
one neighbor in the Jewish house, who felt Klemperer should not bother
writing anything down. "Your writing is putting you in danger. And do you
realize that thousands of others are suffering thousands of times more
than you are? And don't you think that in time there will be more than
enough historians to write about all this? People with better material
and a better overview than you? What can you see, what can you record
from your confinement here?" At "least once a day," on the other hand,
another of the Klemperers' neighbors in the Jewish House

stormed into our room without knocking . . . and each time she said:
"Write it down--you must write it down!" And then, with the same emotion,
she would report on the latest house search, the latest suicide, the
latest cut in ration cards. She believed in my role as chronicler,
and in her childish eyes it was as if no other chronicler of the age
would appear other than me, whom she so often saw sitting at the writing
desk." [<I>LTI,</I> 284]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>LTI</I> took shape, then, in the crossfire between these two positions,
each externalizing an aspect of Klemperer's own writing process: his
perennial self-doubt, his intermittent sense of mission. Throughout the
wartime diaries, indeed, he continually envisioned both the irretrievable
loss of this (and the rest of his lifework) and a postwar dispensation
in which this record and the people it described would all be famous.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the reader remains fully aware, it is largely an accident that the
more optimistic of the two scenarios actually came to pass. Throughout
the Third Reich diary, the reader has the illusion of sharing Klemperer's
suspense, anxiety, and claustrophobia. The first volume, in particular,
is often a page-turner. The situation of Klemperer and of the Dresden
Jews grows increasingly dire; it often seems that things can get no worse,
and yet the reader knows from the date of each entry that the Third Reich
still has many years to run and that the worst is yet to come. Curiously,
the diary's suspense in some ways seems most acute in 1941, before the
Holocaust was fully underway in Germany itself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thereafter, and through most of the second volume, the sufferings,
deprivations, suicides, and deportations only intensified. "All Germany,"
Klemperer wrote in July 1942, "is a meat factory and butcher shop": while
soldiers--and deportees--were being turned into corpses, pregnant women,
encouraged by Nazi pronatalism, "bear their stomachs like a Party badge"
(<I>I Will,</I> 2:111).
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  At the same time, Klemperer somehow almost learned to live with his
  harassed and vulnerable situation as one of indefinite duration--a
  partial stoicism similar, perhaps, to that eventually adopted by Anne
  Frank and her family in their cramped Amsterdam hiding place. Partway
  through the war, Klemperer was forced to work as a manual laborer,
  causing him sufferings both direct (since the work threatened his
  already weakened heart) and indirect (since it preempted most of his
  scholarly labors). Unexpectedly, however, the disadvantages and drudgery
  of this work were partly counterbalanced by the hitherto unfamiliar
  social spheres to which they exposed him; rather than spending
  the day at his desk, he was forced out of the house into close and
  frequently congenial interaction with working-class Germans. Initially,
  he imagined himself as Emil Jannings in F. W. Murnau's 1924 film
  <I>The Last Laugh,</I> reduced to demeaning labor and struggling not
  to break under the strain. Yet depleting as it was in many respects,
  this short-lived "worker's life" also offered an unexpected education
  of its own as it forced Klemperer to break

<B></B>

out of the physical and mental claustrophobia of the ghetto.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1945, only months before the end of the war, the authorities resolved
to round up and deport Dresden's last remaining Jews. Klemperer
was forced to serve as messenger, bringing the chilling summons to
friends and acquaintances and expecting that he himself would receive
the next notice. A day later--deus ex machina--everything had changed
completely; the Allied bombing of Dresden and the resulting firestorm
made it possible for the Klemperers to flee the city altogether;
hiding in the countryside, they managed to survive the rest of the war
unchallenged. Klemperer of course continued to keep his diary, but with
these unexpected developments, the journal's tone shifts completely,
often evoking what seems close to an idyll. Despite the remaining dangers
of the Klemperers' situation, they retain an acute sense of perils and
confinement escaped. And finally, with the arrival of the Allied Armies,
they celebrated their deliverance from Nazism and returned to Dresden,
now under Soviet occupation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite some lingering hardships, the postwar dispensation seemed full
of promise. Klemperer joined the Communist Party in November, 1945,
and he rapidly became prominent as a writer, intellectual, and public
re. In 1947, <I>LTI</I> was published in book form in the Soviet Zone
of Occupation but also was excerpted in newspapers, on the radio, and
in lectures Klemperer delivered to cultural groups in various far-flung
towns and villages. Thanks to such publicity, to the topicality and
innate fascination of its subject, and to Klemperer's compelling style,
<I>LTI</I> quickly became a popular classic in the Soviet Zone. In the
GDR, despite various delays, censorship threats, and other difficulties
detailed in his postwar diaries, it was reprinted repeatedly over several
decades. Yet the book never enjoyed major circulation or influence
in the West (perhaps in part due to its closing implication that the
posterity of Nazi language was to be found on the Western side of the
German-German divide). And unlike the contemporaneous work of Leo Spitzer,
Erich Auerbach, Theodor Adorno, or Siegfried Kracauer (German-Jewish
emigr&eacute;s who lived in the United States and thus developed close
connections with English-speaking intellectuals), <I>LTI</I> was never
translated into English. The cold war itself, presumably, made early
translation unlikely, especially given Klemperer's public identification
with the Communist Party, with the Soviet Occupation Forces, and with
the GDR. In its attention to the nuances and political meanings of
German word usage, moreover, <I>LTI</I> was generally thought to be
inherently untranslatable--a fear now laid to rest by Martin Brady's
graceful translation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Theodor Adorno's <I>Minima Moralia: Reflections on Damaged Life</I>
(written 1944-7, published 1951) and Erich Auerbach's <I>Mimesis: The
Representation of Reality in Western Literature</I> (written 1942-5,
published 1946), <I>LTI</I> reflects on the author's experiences during
the Third Reich.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  While Klemperer stayed and was eventually trapped in Nazi Germany,
  Adorno and Auerbach emigrated after the Nazi rise to power (seeking
  refuge in Los Angeles and Istanbul, respectively). <I>Minima
  Moralia</I> and <I>Mimesis</I> announce themselves as works of--and
  about--exile. Adorno's work meditates, as its subtitle announces,
  on a "damaged life," its fragmentary, aphoristic form mirroring its
  contents, <I>Mimesis,</I> too, is full of an exile's longings for home;
  it begins with Ulysses' return to Ithaca in Homer's <I>Odyssey.</I> A
  brilliantly synthetic book about the Western literary tradition, in some
  ways the founding work (and still, arguably, the unacknowledged Bible)
  of the postwar discipline of Comparative Literature, <I>Mimesis</I>
  was written to shore up that tradition at a moment of its threatened
  eclipse; its famous reliance on symptomatic close readings, Auerbach
  explains, was mandated by the practical limitations of a scholar exiled
  in Turkey without ready access to most Western scholarship.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>LTI</I> was conceived and researched under even more dire
circumstances, and they too leave their mark on the book's form and
method. Quite literally expelled from Germany's libraries, Klemperer was
forced to undertake a new kind of scholarship that took as its materials
memories, everyday conversations, and incidents witnessed on the street,
as well as whatever books and other publications to which he could still
gain informal (often illegal) access. Brilliant in its linguistic and
cultural analysis, <I>LTI</I> also makes virtuoso use of a very wide,
very odd assortment

<B></B>

of occasional texts: newspaper obituaries and birth announcements,
pharmaceutical journals, pre- and post-1933 "trivial" novels, school
textbooks. As such, <I>LTI</I> represents a pioneering attempt at reading
culture and at a kind of unified discourse analysis. It may draw on
nineteenth-century ideology critiques (Karl Marx, Gustave Flaubert's
<I>Dictionary of Received Ideas</I>, Ambrose Bierce's <I>Devil's
Dictionary</I>); without, in all likelihood, being known to postwar
French thinkers, it anticipates Roland Barthes's <I>Mythologies,</I>
on the one hand, and the work of Louis Althusser and Michel Foucault on
the other. Its cultural diagnostics also stand in intriguing relationship
to--but not in the shadow of--the Frankfurt School and the other famous
theoretical work of early-twentieth-century Germany. Although immersed
in the thought of the French Enlightenment, Klemperer did not appear to
follow contemporary philosophy. (Even his discovery of Martin Buber and
Franz Rosenzweig--whose aper&ccedil;u, "Language is more than blood,"
supplies <I>LTI</I>'s epigraph--occurred only accidentally, he insisted,
and only after the German-Jewish intellectual world turned inward as
a response to segregationist pressures.) Klemperer was friendly with
Kracauer during the Weimar Republic, but there is no sign in his Weimar
or subsequent diaries that he had ever read Georg Simmel, Walter Benjamin,
Adorno, or Wilhelm Reich.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As Anton Kaes, Martin Jay, and Edward Dimendberg suggest in their <I>The
Weimar Republic Sourcebook,</I> the impulse towards symptomatic cultural
analysis was pervasive among Weimar intellectuals, driving popular
journalists as much as those now renowned as "theorists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  Klemperer's own scholarly dialogue is with the scholarly traditions
  of <I>Geistesgeschichte</I> and philology and with res like
  E. R. Curtius and Leo Spitzer, fellow professors of Romance
  languages. <I>LTI</I> might be read, indeed, as a cross between
  Spitzer's "'<I>Geistesgeschichte</I>' vs. History of Ideas as Applied
  to Hitlerism"  and his "American Advertising Explained as Popular
  Art" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  Spitzer conceived "American Advertising" as an experimental attempt
  to subject the Sunkist orange advertisement billboard he spotted along
  American highways to a sustained cultural and literary analysis; in the
  United States, at least, the essay is now famous as one prototype for
  the serious study of mass and popular culture. Klemperer's <I>LTI</I>
  is not only an earlier but a more sustained, more profound, and more
  genuinely popular piece of scholarship.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Unlike Spitzer's essays and unlike most of the work of the Frankfurt
School, <I>LTI</I> is immediately accessible to a lay audience. Adorno's
use of the aphoristic fragment in <I>Minima Moralia</I> links his
work to a formally difficult high modernism. In contrast, Klemperer's
<I>LTI</I> explains its own "notebook" structure, its autobiographical
framing and materials, its verbatim quotations from the author's diaries
of the period, its short, overlapping (and to the latter-day reader,
<I>Mythologies</I>-like) essays, excurses, and vignettes as simply
a function of its circumstances of composition. Denied access to a
reference library, a typewriter, or even a safe place to store his
diary, Klemperer was forced to compose (and hide) it piecemeal; the
transcription, final composition, and publication of <I>LTI</I> took
place shortly after the end of the war, before university libraries were
fully reassembled or open again, so that Klemperer had no opportunity to
recheck sources or perform a more exhaustive review of Third Reich writing
and scholarship. <I>LTI,</I> Klemperer suggested humbly at the outset,
would therefore have to stand as "the work of the first hour"; although
not itself authoritative, it might remain useful as a starting point and
a means to spur further and more sustained scholarship (<I>LTI,</I> 14).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact, <I>LTI</I> remains one of the most vivid, incisive, and, indeed,
authoritative accounts of Nazi linguistic and cultural life, admirably
lucid in its presentation and still suggestive in its implications. On the
one hand, Klemperer focuses closely on Nazi vocabulary, expressions, and
jokes, Nazi punctuation, and the way the Nazi propaganda organs create new
categories of words and thus new moral attitudes. He argues, for instance,
in his pointed discussion of the "<I>ent</I>-" ["de"-] words (the prefix
evoking a process of sloughing off or ridding oneself of something
undesirable) that such neologisms sometimes took on murderous over-
and undertones. On the other hand, he pieces together small linguistic
details to arrive at a more general reading of the Nazi worldview. Some
of these observations have since become commonplaces. Despite their

<B></B>

heavy reliance on language and ceremony associated with or meant
to evoke ancient tradition, the Nazis were also, paradoxically,
eager participants in modernity, as is evident in such disparate
linguistic manifestations as their preoccupation with superlatives,
their reliance on the language of sportsmanship, and their penchant for
linguistic depersonalization. <I>LTI</I> seems more original, perhaps,
in explicating the Nazi relationship to time, the past, birth, death,
posterity, apotheosis, resurrection, history. "What comes after the
Third Reich?" ran a trick question posed on Third Reich apprentice
examinations. Those who fell into the trap and answered "the Fourth
Reich" (thinking forward in the series: Holy Roman Empire, Kaiserreich,
Third Reich . . . ) failed the question and the political part of the
examination. The Third Reich is eternal, of course; it will last for a
thousand years, and nothing comes after it. At the same time, any number
of "receptions, speeches and trivialities of the Hitler regime . . . were
referred to as 'historic [<I>historisch</I>]'" (<I>LTI,</I> 210).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In <I>LTI</I>'s most controversial chapter "Zion," Klemperer even
contrasts this sense of historicity and historical mission with the
earlier, related rhetoric deployed by Theodor Herzl, the founder of
modern Zionism. Like Hitler after him, Klemperer argues, Herzl became
convinced of his own prophetic importance. When Herzl "advances his
thoughts during a walk it is 'an historic hour,' and whenever he enjoys
the most insignificant diplomatic success it immediately goes down
in world history. And there is a moment at which he confides in his
diary that his private life has now ceased and his historic life begun"
(<I>LTI,</I> 210-11). The point of the Hitler-Herzl comparison is
not exactly to equate Nazism and Zionism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  What interests Klemperer rather are Nazism's historical roots,
  its degree of shared intellectual property with other nationalist
  movements, and the subterranean, paradoxical influence of Herzl's
  Zionism on Hitler's anti-Semitic nationalism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At many points, Klemperer offers learned (or at least improvised)
disquisitions about the prehistory, even the pre-1933 usage, of now
recognizably "Nazi" words. He is particularly interested in the way
words, phrases, or modes of linguistic expression already in common
usage take on (given the specific political pressures, institutions,
and apparatuses of the Third Reich) a more pointed, more politically
and temporally bound meaning. Klemperer's diaries show no sign that
he has read or heard of Ferdinand de Saussure, yet like Saussure's
influential introductory linguistics course, <I>LTI</I> carefully
balances a diachronic view of language as a historical formation with
a synchronic view of the language community. What is surprising about
Klemperer's linguistically based view of Third Reich experience is his
insistence that both proponents and opponents of the state eventually
adopt state language and that those persecuted under the Nuremberg Laws
decisively fail to cohere as a differentiable language community.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This thesis counteracts both anti-Semitic beliefs about Jewish
"<I>mauscheln</I>" or other purportedly distinctively Jewish ways of using
language <I>and</I> Zionist claims that modern Europe's assimilated and
partly secularized Jews still form a coherent people. At the same time,
Klemperer's own account frames itself as emphatically Jewish in its
perspective on and experience of the Third Reich. <I>LTI</I> insists
that to analyze Third Reich language use is necessarily to describe in
detail the Nazi persecution of the Jews, <I>and</I> the way the victims
seem, at least on a linguistic level, to internalize the worldview of
their persecutors.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What still seems most crucial in Klemperer's account is its attention
to popular usage and thus to the question of ideology as collectively
transmitted, experienced, and inhabited through language. While
continually alert to the differences in individual speakers' situations
and ways of using languages, he stresses the apparently universal
reach of Nazi linguistic coinages; by the end of the war, he claims,
they permeated public and private, elite and working-class, official
and even oppositional speech in every corner of the country. The
regime's self-proclaimed "enthusiasts" (itself a crucial LTI word),
its principled resisters, its Jewish victims, even Klemperer himself
can be found using specifically and quintessentially Nazi coinages with
all the ideological baggage they bring with them. Klemperer finds a rare
and partial exception, to be sure, in

<B></B>

the small village where he and his wife spend the last weeks of the
war, for it is inhabited solely by a Slavonic minority group that
uses Wendish, not German, in daily life. As elsewhere in Germany,
their houses are full of Nazi-issue schoolbooks and radios carrying
explicitly Nazi speeches. Yet because of their closeness as a community,
their ardent Catholicism, and their linguistic links to the "Slavic"
peoples anathematized by the Nazis, the villagers remain resolutely
(and within their own circle, quite openly) anti-Nazi.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stimulating as <I>LTI</I> is, it remains haunted by an unresolved
paradox. On the one hand, Klemperer wants to argue for the temporal and
historical specificity of Nazi language.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  A concept and a vocabulary of transcendence that means one thing in
  the nineteenth century, or in the mouth of Herzl, is transformed into
  something very different when linked to the apparatuses and public
  mouthpieces of institutionalized Nazism. Unlike Kracauer's <I>From
  Caligari to Hitler</I> , in other words, Klemperer puts the
  emphasis not on the intellectual and historical preconditions for
  Hitler but on Nazism as actual, lived, spoken practice.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  On the other hand, he seems driven not only by the need to describe a
  now-superseded political and cultural dispensation but also to prevent
  the linguistic--and thus ideological--afterlife of Nazism through the
  continued use of recognizably Fascist words and concepts.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The postwar diaries suggest a different, although related paradox. Now
Klemperer seemed to believe that the past was over and could be put
behind him . . . and then was amazed to find the echoes or specters
of the past still hovering. Like <I>Mimesis,</I> Klemperer's wartime
diaries are framed, at moments, in dialogue with Homer's <I>Odyssey</I>
as a foundational text of displacement and alienation; when the war
ended, he believed himself rescued, allowed to return to his old life,
come home. In fact, his travails and alienation were far from over.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is in the postwar period, oddly enough, once institutionalized
anti-Semitism had vanished, that Klemperer became acutely aware of the
potential for popular anti-Semitism in Germany, anxiously noting all
lingering signs of it. Yet although some of his acquaintances detected
vestiges of anti-Semitism within the ruling Socialist Unity Party, he
generally did not. As he finally acknowledged in 1959, those attempting
research on Jewish topics in GDR universities (like his nephew's wife,
a Party member interested in researching the history of the German-Jewish
medical establishment) could face powerful tacit opposition; indeed,
"The topic of the Jews is not beloved in the GDR" (<I>So,</I> 2:744). For
the most part, however, Klemperer found himself valued by the Communist
leadership not only for his publically reiterated pro-Soviet stance
but also as a principled antifascist (Jewish) victim of Nazism and
advocate of fellow victims. In the early postwar period, to be sure,
he was angered that he and his wife were not granted the most privileged
status as "Victims of Fascism"; since the Nazis persecuted him on racial
grounds rather than for active political resistance, he qualified for a
somewhat smaller state pension, somewhat smaller supplementary rations,
and so on. The distinction surfaced again, years later, when he attended
the dedication of the Buchenwald memorial as an official guest; when a
government minister expressed his surprise that Klemperer was not sporting
the latest medal given to honor "anti-fascists," Klemperer somewhat
tartly explained once more the state's own earlier distinction between
"active resisters" and those automatically slated for Nazi persecution
(<I>So,</I> 2:705). By now, however, he was preoccupied as much with
the question of his own public recognition--and the status of the GDR
academy in relationship to international scholarship--as with recognition
and restitution for all Germany's Jews. "Always being in the position of
Not-Fully-Being-Counted. From Jewish star to Jewish star. Since I have
become a big wheel in the GDR, their Academy [of Arts], &amp; Humboldt
University wear the Jewish star" (<I>So,</I> 2:601). Such rhetoric at
once paralleled Jean-Paul Sartre's contemporaneous equation of Jewishness
with Otherness and threatened to devalue Klemperer's own particular
fate during the Third Reich, suffered precisely (and nonmetaphorically)
as a Jew, as a star-bearer.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As his rhetoric suggests, Klemperer remained deeply ambivalent about
Judaism itself. On the one hand, the Church's partial abandonment of
its Jewish converts during the Third Reich

<B></B>

and Klemperer's postwar decision to become a Communist left him alienated
from Christianity, from his own earlier attempts to assimilate by
Christian baptism, and indeed from all forms of religious observance. When
his second wife, a deeply pious Catholic, attempted to interest him in
her faith, he felt only the gulf of background and belief between them
(although he eventually consented to a secret church wedding ceremony to
enable her to become a communicant again). On the other hand, his wartime
sense of solidarity--or at least of shared fate--with other Jews gave way
to a renewed attempt at assimilation into a new political situation and
sometimes outright denial about his own Jewish background. During a 1957
visit to an old Prague synagogue, one of the worshipers asked whether
he is Jewish, and he flatly answered "no" (<I>So,</I> 2:612). Already
in 1952, he objected to a forthcoming homage that contained "rather
a lot about the son of the rabbi, Jewish suffering etc. . . . to me
philo-Semitism is as embarrassing as anti-Semitism. I am a German and a
Communist, nothing else. In addition the consequences of philo-Semitism
are only a new strengthening of anti-Semitism" (<I>So,</I> 2:351). Such
objections seem at once historically obtuse and prescient. The year 1952
was to see the Soviet doctors' trial, the Slansky trial, and corresponding
GDR reprisals against Communists who advocated the restitution of
Jewish property; by the end of 1952 most of the GDR's small remaining
community of practicing Jews had left for the West. Klemperer was by no
means oblivious to these developments. Once again as during the Third
Reich, shared concerns about the political climate brought him back
into contact with his Jewish friends, yet his identification with them
remained partial, incomplete, and short-lived. And while they became
increasingly unsure of the SED's commitment to Jewish life, he continued
to trust the Party.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Throughout the postwar period, Klemperer participated repeatedly in
activities intended to commemorate the Holocaust: he attended GDR state
ceremonies on the anniversary of the so-called <I>Reichskristallnacht</I>
pogrom, he visited Auschwitz, he saw several films about Third Reich
concentration camps. For the most part, however, he remained unable
to grasp the fate of German and European Jews as a totality; like many
Communists of his generation, indeed, he struggled to put behind him both
the Holocaust and his own earlier life as a Jew. Yet a suppressed grief
sometimes surfaced unexpectedly. In 1954, for instance, the Dresden
Jewish Community invited him to sort through the "gigantic, somewhat
damp, stacks of books" left behind by several waves of emigr&eacute;s and
deportees (<I>So,</I> 2:458). Among this huge mass of abandoned books,
Klemperer found a number of French volumes that he took for his own
scholarly use or for the university institute library. The expedition,
virtually his first visit to a Jewish-affiliated building since 1945,
left him pensive and possibly somewhat melancholy. Before Hitler, he
learned from a synagogue employee, Dresden had 5,000 practicing Jews;
now, 45 were left. Only a jumble of books remained to mark the passage
of all who were gone.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Throughout both the Third Reich and the postwar period, Klemperer
was desperately anxious about how many books he himself would leave
behind. Hoping to make up for lost time, he became ever more ambitious
over the course of the 1940s and 1950s--for a professorship at more and
more prominent universities, for a National Prize, for a university
rectorship. In the meantime, his self-doubt about his scholarship
continued. The publication of Auerbach's <I>Mimesis,</I> in particular,
plunged him into a profound depression (<I>So,</I> 1:374); immediately
recognizing its brilliance, he felt the relative inadequacy of his
own scholarly work (<I>So,</I> 1:589). He was later reduced to similar
despair by reading Auerbach's other works or even by hearing the news of
Curtius's death (which reminded him of the contrast between Curtius's
scholarly achievements and his own work as a "journalist" [<I>So,</I>
1:550]). In fact, his own increasingly intense immersion in public life
(lecture tours, cultural organizations, public commissions, parliamentary
politics) and university politics, especially when linked with an
ambitious and logistically complicated series of concurrent academic
posts at universities in different regions of the GDR, left him little
time or energy to pursue academic writing or even the intense reading
he undertook during the Third Reich. By the time he finally retired in
the mid-1950s, he felt too exhausted and ill

<B></B>

to write with the intensity and rapidity he continued to expect of
himself. Meanwhile, however, his years of forays into public life and the
careful diary entries he continued to make provide latter-day readers
with often fascinating details about daily life in the postwar period,
from the lingering obsession with food to the rebuilding of cityscapes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After 1945, Klemperer spent literally hundreds of hours at Party
gatherings--conferences, commissions, parliamentary sessions--most
of which he found excruciating. His only release, much of the time,
was quite literally to sleep through the endless, largely predictable
speeches. Yet he continued to seek out participation at such events,
and despite often difficult conditions, his own terrible health,
and his growing guilt about leaving his ailing, elderly wife at home
alone, repeatedly traversed the country to attend them. In part, his
efforts were altruistic; he wanted to help ensure structural reforms
and cultural renewal that would forestall a recurrence of fascism. At
the same time, he was dazzled by his newfound ability, after so many
years of disenfranchisement, to move among the powerful. Swept up by
their rhetoric of reform--but even more by their ability to make things
happen--he willingly suspended some of his skepticism and disbelief.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Klemperer joined the Communist Party in 1945, his diary supplied
little preparation, motivation, or explanation for his conversion. His
Weimar diaries suggested ambivalence in the face of the (failed) German
Revolutions. And well into the early years of the German Democratic
Republic, Klemperer continued to style himself, half defensively,
as a bourgeois humanist (despite his Party membership, sympathy with
Soviet accomplishments, public advocacy of Marxist social, political, and
economic aims, and scholarly interest in the revolutionary legacy of the
French Enlightenment). He continually imagined himself as someone caught
in the middle, caught out, at odds with both the traditionalists and
the innovators, the Right and the institutionalized Left. Yet well into
the 1950s, he also continued to believe in the GDR as the "lesser evil"
and that the Soviets provided the best--perhaps the only--bulwark against
the recurrence of Nazism in Germany. "For me, the Soviet tanks are doves
of peace," he reaffirmed in 1953, in the wake of the workers' uprising of
June 17, crushed by those selfsame tanks (<I>So,</I> 1:390). At the same
time, he remained acutely aware of the Soviets' continuing unpopularity
among most denizens of the GDR. If another war were ever to come, if the
Soviets ever pulled out of the GDR, he worried, he and other Communists
would be persecuted as quislings and collaborators (<I>So,</I> 1:618).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At moments, he seemed caught in a kind of performative hypocrisy. On a
1952 official visit to Stalinist Romania (whose cultural climate struck
him as "the most severe and fearful dictatorship" [<I>So,</I> 2:342]),
Klemperer was continually frustrated; rather than meet with Bucharest
academics to work out plans for cultural and intellectual exchange, he
was forced into a more standard official-visitor itinerary designed to
showcase "modern Romania." One afternoon, for instance, was spent on a
mandatory visit to a museum of the socialist struggle, similar to--but
unfortunately much bigger than--socialist shrines he had already visited
in Poland and Czechoslovakia. "I was extremely bored, &amp; then wrote
admiring words in the guest book" (<I>So,</I> 2:338). A few days later, he
publicly chastised his Romanian host, charging him with behavior at once
overly timid and overly controlling, "his behavior damages his state and
his party, that he should neither preempt me nor treat me like a jailer,
that I was tempted to complain about him to his government" (<I>So,</I>
1:346). Afterwards, Klemperer regretted this display of temper, yet his
true source of anger, arguably, was the half-repressed knowledge of his
own, fully comparable combination of servility and orthodoxy. Years
later, when he allowed himself a similar outburst in a GDR store and
threatened to use his political authority to expose dishonest business
practises, his second wife reproved him sharply. Whether such anxieties
were justified or not, ordinary GDR citizens, she reminded him, lived
in fear of summary arrest and of Party denunciation; by throwing his
weight around, he only increased their paranoia.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The postwar diaries include fascinating information about daily political
life and popular political sentiment in the GDR, from angry meetings of
pacifist students opposed to German rearmament

<B></B>

to the recurrent booing in the cinemas of industrial centers like
Bitterfeld whenever newsreel footage of Walter Ulbricht and of
Stakhanovite activists appeared on the screen. Particularly interesting
are his detailed descriptions of Party operations, from repetitive
speeches and pointless official meetings to unnerving public catechisms
and self-criticism sessions. In the process, he offers cameos of many
prominent GDR writers and intellectuals--Ernst Bloch, Arnold Zweig,
F. C. Weiskopf, Johannes R. Becher, Anna Seghers, Helene Weigel, Robert
Havemann, Hans Mayer, Stephan Hermlin, Kuba (Kurt Barthel), Wolfgang
Harich, Alfred Kantorowicz--often cast in a critical or unflattering
light.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The diaries also include running commentary on Party debates over
aesthetics, as on a wide variety of cultural events and developments:
a 1946 art exhibition that retrieved and revalorized Expressionist and
Cubist artworks; the eclipse and reemergence of Jean-Paul Sartre as an
approved writer; the literally heart-stopping first run of Brecht's
<I>Mother Courage and Her Children</I> (written 1939) and the more
alienating production of Brecht's <I>Life of Galileo</I> (written
1938-9) at the Berliner Ensemble; Klemperer's ambivalent responses
to Kafka; his negative initial reaction to the diary of Anne Frank
(a "somewhat snobby teenager" [<I>etwas snobistischer Backfisch</I>]
[<I>So,</I> 2:596]) and deeply emotional response to its dramatic
adaptation; the by turns intriguing and inadequate new films produced
at DEFA, the GDR state film studio. An inveterate cinephile during his
earlier life, then barred from attending the cinema throughout most
of the Third Reich, Klemperer was largely disappointed by postwar
offerings. (During the early years of the Third Reich, he and his
wife avidly watched new German entertainment films. Now he was largely
irritated and disturbed by reprises of films from the Third Reich, only
to find himself, at moments of acute political tension, newly appreciative
of their escapist properties.) He reread Ernest Hemingway, irritated that
this great stylist was not yet published in the GDR but puzzled, also,
at the way the shift in his own reading circumstances since the fraught,
terrified days of the Third Reich changed his sense of Hemingway's voice
and affect. He puzzled over how to construe twelfth-century French poet
Marie de France as proto-Marxist and over whether the Dadaists could
properly be considered "revolutionary" in the political as well as
the aesthetic sense. He attended Brecht's state funeral but was moved
only by Ernst Busch's singing. The postwar diaries, in short, provide
a fascinating introduction to aesthetic, cultural, and academic life in
the Soviet Zone of Occupation and the early GDR.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Years after the publication of <I>LTI,</I> Klemperer still received
fan mail from some readers, especially those who had also been victims
of fascism, and anonymous letters from West German or Western-aligned
readers, who urged him to distance himself publicly from the GDR's
linguistic and human rights abuses--and to publish an <I>LQI,</I>
an equally critical/analytic work about the language of the Communist
dictatorship. In fact, Klemperer's postwar diaries are full of sporadic
notes (this time without elaborate annotations) about, and even labeled,
<I>LQI.</I> Phrases or linguistic usages he sees as forming part of an
LQI, or Language of the Fourth Reich, include "monopoly capitalism"
(<I>So,</I> 1:439); "collective" and the use of "Comrade" as a form
of address (<I>So,</I> 1:448); "class-conscious" (<I>So,</I> 1:641);
and later "cadre" (<I>So,</I> 2:469); "exploitation" and "vigilance"
(<I>So,</I> 2:512). Yet unlike the more detailed working notes made in the
Third Reich diary (which Klemperer would later characterize as "a laconic
<I>aide-m&eacute;moire</I>, like a knot in a handkerchief" [<I>LTI,</I>
9]), the running record of new linguistic usages in the postwar diaries
never seems like notes towards a publishable essay. Instead it seems
testament to Klemperer's involuntary but half-suppressed urge to go on
monitoring language use, even while he refused to draw the uncomfortable
conclusions this new material sometimes suggested.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Nazi period, Klemperer kept his diary, talked with friends,
and assessed current events as a self-conscious opponent of the regime;
now, he viewed Soviet and GDR cultural policy as a sympathetic insider
whose moments of criticism or skepticism only seldom entail more profound
questioning of his underlying, fundamental alliance to <I>this</I> side
of the cold war. Klemperer's rubric "LQI" might seem to imply a parallel
with the Third Reich--and thus to

<B></B>

indicate a "totalitarian" equivalence between Nazism and Communism. Some
of the postwar usages he noted encouraged euphemism or suppressed
historical complexity. "LIBERATING. No one conquers anymore, each
'frees': the 'Armies of People's Democracy' do it, the Partisans
did it. . . . " (<I>So,</I> 1:679) When the SED began to encourage
"voluntary" service, Klemperer knew the phrase concealed coercion;
he remembered the nonvoluntary "voluntary" sacrifices Third Reich
officials demanded of the public during the war, especially during
the siege of Stalingrad (<I>So,</I> 2:467). Other aspects of Communist
culture also seemed powerfully reminiscent of the Third Reich. He was
repeatedly disturbed, in the early 1950s, by the Free Democratic Youth
(FDJ), the official, ubiquitous Party youth organization whose massed,
uniformed singing on festive occasions reminded him fatally of the Hitler
Youth. By the late 1950s, having absorbed the damning revelations about
Stalin's terror, he also recorded popular GDR fears of summary arrest and
imprisonment. Formerly, he would have dismissed such fears as groundless
hysteria. Now he granted that they were "not even unfounded. Nazi
conditions" (<I>So,</I> 2:670).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some postwar linguistic usages, moreover, involve a direct continuation
of Nazi concepts: "<I>artstreu</I>" (true to one's own kind [<I>So,</I>
1:641]) was used by the Nazis to refer to racial essence; then
the Communists used it to refer to the lasting influence of social
formation. Yet the real afterlife of Nazi language, Klemperer insisted
repeatedly, was to be found in West Germany. And the underlying logics
of LTI and LQI were on the whole strikingly different. From his vantage
point, the Sovietization of culture in the GDR appeared for the most
part not as a cultural imperialism imposed externally and by force
so much as the ceaseless striving of German Communists to imitate
much-admired Soviet prototypes. Their conversion, in turn, effected
wide-ranging changes in popular linguistic practice as in the practice
of everyday life. Klemperer was particularly incisive on the way German
officials and Party members strove to adapt the format, tone, rhetoric,
even gestures of Soviet political culture. But he also made astute
(and somewhat ambivalent) observations about a host of smaller social
transformations, from the politicization of the weather report to the
enforced intimacy of the adoption of the informal "<I>Du</I>" (rather than
the more formal "<I>Sie</I>") as a mode of address among Party members;
from the postwar shift of sexual and social mores (public discussions
of venereal disease and abortion, profound, desacralizing changes in
the status of marriage), to the politicization of the university at the
expense of knowledge. (Caught up in political activities, Klemperer's
postwar students often came to class late and left early).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He also noted the self-conscious, deliberate "proletarianizing" of
ruling-class life, at least in its outer forms. Particularly in the early
postwar period, when public transport remained difficult and unreliable,
he and other dignitaries were ferried by private car from meeting to
meeting and speaking engagement to speaking engagement. The prewar
job-title of "chauffeur," in the meantime, had given way (LQI) to the
new designation of "driver" (<I>So,</I> 1:712). In the new dispensation,
the powerful scorned any public appearance of luxury, placed emphasis
on utility and functionalism, and strove to suggest a greater equality
between driver and driven. Klemperer's own stance towards such shifts
in nomenclature, as towards LQI in general, remained ambiguous at
best. For several generations of GDR writers, the social differences
between driver and official passenger would epitomize the continuing
gap between socialist theory and practice. In "Buckow Elegies" ,
a poem cycle protesting the government response to the 1953 workers'
uprising, Brecht crystallizes the gap between intelligentsia and working
people in the image of the poet sitting by the side of the road while
the driver changes the flat tire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  So too, in his drama <I>Hinze and Kunze</I> , his prose
  poem cycle <I>Reports about Hinze and Kunze</I> , and his
  <I>Hinze-Kunze-Novel</I> , Volker Braun anatomizes the
  relationship between "Hinz and Kunz," driver and politico, as a
  socialist updating of the master-servant duel in Denis Diderot's
  <I>Jacques the Fatalist and His Master</I>  or Brecht's
  <I>Puntilla and Matti</I> . Klemperer himself was angered to
  realize, in the late 1940s, that one of his drivers was not being
  properly fed at their official destination. When he complained to GDR
  Minister of Culture Johannes R. Becher,

<B></B>

however, he was warned against "leveling" impulses. Years later, Klemperer
still remembered and begrudged this exchange (<I>So,</I> 2:674). Unlike
most middle-class intellectuals, he had had first-hand experience
of menial status, and he retained at least a sentimental interest in
working-class conditions. At the same time, his innumerable accounts of
journeys in Party vehicles soon came to focus almost exclusively on his
own comfort and convenience; he quickly gained a new sense of himself as
an important personage whose passage through the world (or the country)
ought to be as easy and cushioned as possible. These postwar diaries
are particularly fascinating when read against more self-consciously
literary attempts to analyze GDR life, although such comparisons also
point up the aporias in his vision of the present. Compared both to
Brecht and to Braun, Klemperer was profoundly uncritical of the relative
material privilege (and greater personal freedoms) the GDR accorded to
intellectuals and political leaders--despite his intermittent recognition
of the popular resentment such differences caused and despite his own
continuing envy of those who attained greater fame, visibility, and
public recognition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Blindspots notwithstanding, Klemperer remained interested in gauging
(and at least through the early 1950s, in sharing) the spirit of the (new)
age. His complicated peregrinations across eastern Germany (as he attended
meetings, conducted speaking tours, and finally commuted weekly among
several universities) allowed him to overhear, participate in, and record
innumerable conversations between strangers on the train, to Klemperer a
particularly interesting barometer of popular feeling. Again and again in
such situations, he heard--and often intervened to refute--anti-Soviet
sentiment. At home, too, he argued with relatives and (as once before
at the beginning of the Third Reich) broke with some friends over their
differing views of the new dispensation. By the mid-1950s, however, he
had become more sympathetic to antiregime complaints. For one thing, his
second wife was acutely attuned to the hypocrisies of the SED; he trusted
her moral instincts and grew to deplore the Communists' persecution of
religion. At moments, such intolerance seemed closely linked to the
state's failure to grasp and respect the freedom of inquiry vital to
the modern university. One Leipzig professor of Old Church Slavonic,
for instance, came under repeated attack for his use of the Gospel and
New Testament as a basis for instruction; he was accused of "giving
'grammatical Bible instruction'" (<I>So,</I> 2:687). To Klemperer, such
ill-considered persecutions epitomized the ominous move, in the late
1950s, to render GDR universities more thoroughly and orthodoxically
Marxist in curriculum and in faculty, a process that he felt sacrificed
the advanced study of particular disciplines for a high-school-like
inculcation of Marxist theory and that drove ever-growing numbers of
professors (and even university presidents) to emigrate to West Germany.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the early years of the Third Reich, Klemperer still attended
movies and traveled around Dresden; he carefully recorded not only the
rhetoric of the radio and the press but also many pieces of overheard
conversation--including, for instance, the reactions of cinemagoers
to anti-Semitic newsreels and features. During the rest of the Third
Reich, he was marked by a star. Precisely because he was targeted as
an enemy of the state, he also became a re whose very presence in
public places solicited gestures of solidarity and abuse, expressions of
anti-Nazi defiance, hopes, speculations, and confidences. In the postwar
GDR, he became known as a Party-affiliated intellectual--and sometimes
wore a Party badge in his lapel. (Thus when a GDR publisher resolved
to market a literary almanac in both Germanies, he secured Klemperer's
permission to airbrush the badge from his photograph, a "detoxification"
measure intended to circumvent Western anti-Communist defense mechanisms
[<I>So,</I> 2:443].) Nonetheless, he continued to receive confidences
and to hear repeated complaints from strangers as from intimates.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Throughout the Stalinist-era GDR, Klemperer recorded recurrent political
discussion in semipublic spaces where people complained openly of
shortages, of their dislike of the Soviets, of their doubts about the
Communist project, of the GDR's failures to provide material or political
prosperity as measured against the West. To those of us who witnessed
private and public life in the GDR in the 1980s, the records of such
discussions seem finally unsurprising; under the

<B></B>

right circumstances, and having sized up the other people present, GDR
wedding guests might well indulge in anti-Honecker jokes, strangers on
a train in lengthy jeremiads. In retrospect, of course, such utterances
were probably riskier than their speakers realized since the level of
Stasi surveillance and informing was much higher, even, than most ordinary
citizens suspected. But Klemperer's records also suggest that GDR denizens
felt fairly secure in their complaints because they assumed (probably
correctly) that such sentiments were almost universal. The comparison
with the Third Reich (in which several of Klemperer's acquaintances were
arrested on the spot for critical utterances in public) is instructive. So
is the comparison with contemporaneous GDR novels; in light of Klemperer's
accounts, their characters' own highly stylized complaints about the GDR's
imperfections (often culminating in a change of heart and a reaffirmation
of state goals) seem to serve not so much an "alibi" or "ventilation"
function as an amplification and didactic stylization of highly critical
discourse apparently to be heard quite openly all around them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As his second wife pointed out to him, Klemperer yearned deeply and
ambitiously for increasingly high official honors, then, as each was
finally granted, found himself profoundly depressed. Perhaps relatedly,
he worried periodically over his 1945 decision to throw in his lot
with the Communists. He remained convinced that life in "our" GDR was a
hundred, even a thousand times preferable to life in West Germany, yet
like the voluble strangers he met on the train, he remained uneasy about
the discrepancies between Communist rhetoric and lived reality. These
doubts gained intensity during the course of the 1950s: over the
GDR's increasingly repressive and narrow cultural politics; over the
blatant and, in his view, quite unnecessary, falsification of the 1954
elections (subsequent elections would be even more flagrantly rigged);
over class-based rather than merit-based admissions to and exclusions
from higher education; over continuing unofficial reports of arrests,
arbitrary detentions, and the brutal conditions in GDR prisons (some of
them refunctioned Third Reich concentration camps).
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  In the last diary entry in each year, Klemperer typically spent a few
  sentences or pages thinking over the year's course and events. The
  "summary" for 1955 was particularly grim: "Every day a final word of
  wisdom: stubbornly onward, work, <I>don't think</I>! Deepest political
  disillusionment. The only thing left of my enthusiasm: <I>we</I> are
  the lesser evil. And: Marxism is a) better than our SED government b)
  a religion like the other religions--and I can't believe" (<I>So,</I>
  2:528). A few entries later, however, he was back in the midst of GDR
  cultural business as usual, complaining yet again of the predictability
  of the political speeches and expressing new anxieties about GDR
  rearmament. Later in the decade, his sense of an inner break with
  Marxism often sounded more absolute--yet the outer man continued to
  participate in official Party life. In November 1956, for instance,
  he was pleased to accept a silver "patriotic service medal," although
  the ceremony itself was somewhat truncated, presumably due to turbulent
  political conditions; the Hungarian Uprising was still in progress and
  the SED had arrested prominent GDR intellectuals accused of sympathizing
  with the "Pet&ouml;fi Club."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Throughout the 1950s, he continued to work on topics of
French and German cultural history--from the Marseillaise and
Robespierre to Voltaire's relationship to Frederick the Great's
eighteenth-century absolutism--that could be construed topically and
controversially. Usually, however, Klemperer did all he could to avoid
facilitating topical applications. When his nephew decided to leave
the Party, Klemperer was sympathetic; he never, despite the degree of
his own disillusionment, considered taking a similar measure himself,
however. By the late 1950s, as he began to withdraw from public life,
he occasionally allowed himself, at a party or parliamentary meeting,
to take what he saw as a strong and controversial stand on issues of
cultural and educational policy. At such moments, he felt himself a martyr
to his beliefs. Far from criticizing government policy directly, however,
these speeches usually involved what he himself styled as an old man's
plea to maintain some aspects of humanistic education in the secondary
and postsecondary curricula. And when prominent literary critic Alfred
Kantorowicz was arrested, interrogated, released, and fled to the West,
where he issued renegade denunciations of the

<B></B>

GDR, Klemperer was shocked and censorious, not because he did not agree
with some of the critique but because Kantorowicz's public stance had
supplied fodder for West Germany, a state Klemperer continued to see
as deeply Nazi-infiltrated and contaminated (even if characterized by
slightly greater political freedom). We are the <I>lesser</I> evil, he
insisted again and again in his diary. Sometimes, however, as he weighed
the two sides, the balance sheet came out slightly less favorably. "I
myself," he wrote in March 1958, "look to the East and the West with
almost the same revulsion" (<I>So,</I> 2:680). In the final entry of that
year, he reported that he was "without sympathy for the West and for the
East. Germany is a worm squashed into two; both pieces bend themselves,
both are contaminated by the same fascism, each in its way" (<I>So,</I>
2:733). Yet less than a month later, he was attending yet another round
of official meetings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The diary form not only records but perhaps exacerbates a kind of
alternating consciousness; on some days, certain aspects of the GDR
seem very troubling to the chronicler, by the next entry, they seem
forgotten, or at least to have given way to more pressing and immediate
concerns. Klemperer repeatedly admonished himself to stop brooding,
stop thinking, and just keep working, and to some degree, he managed to
live by his own advice. Some kinds of doubts recurred repeatedly over a
period of months or years, but such entries never formed a critical mass
that affected a permanent or decisive shift in consciousness--indeed,
given the seriatim form of the diary and of the diarist's thinking,
it is hard to see how they could.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet here again, there is an important difference between the Third
Reich diaries and the postwar diaries. Klemperer's dire circumstances
during the Third Reich and the oppressive weight of institutionalized
anti-Semitism forced him at moments to reevaluate his memories of the
past. In 1937, for instance, Germany's most notorious anti-Semitic
newspaper ("which is displayed at every corner") ran a picture of
two swimsuited girls at a seaside resort that, its sign announced,
was now prohibited for Jews. "How nice that it's just us now!" the
picture's caption confirmed (<I>I Will,</I> 1:233). For Klemperer,
the picture dredged up a long-forgotten incident from around 1900. As
a schoolboy, he experienced "little trace of anti-Semitism among either
the teachers or the pupils. More precisely none at all" (<I>I Will,</I>
1:233). Nonetheless, when the Jewish students returned to school the
day after Yom Kippur,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
our comrades told us, laughingly and without the least malice (just as
the words themselves were also only uttered jokingly by the altogether
humane teacher), Kufahl, the mathematician, had said to the reduced
class: "Today it's <I>just us.</I>" In my memory these words took on a
quite horrible significance: to me it confirms the claim of the NSDAP
to express the true opinion of the German people. And I believe ever
more strongly that Hitler really does embody the soul of the German
people. [<I>I Will,</I> 1:233]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In retrospect, the apparently trivial incident is full of prophetic
force. If it does not suggest an "eliminationist" anti-Semitism in
Goldhagen's sense, it does imply that the forced segregation of Jews
from the mainstream of German life offered some degree of collective
wish fulfillment, and it does suggest the fragility of the much-vaunted
German-Jewish symbiosis of the pre-1933 era.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The postwar diaries, in contrast, contain little of this kind of synthetic
historical thinking. Klemperer's main thoughts of the past revolved around
his memories of his first wife and their early life together, memories
that became fraught with guilt in light of his increasing emotional
distance from Eva Klemperer during the last years of her life and his
relatively rapid and very happy remarriage to his twenty-six-year-old
student Hadwig Kirchner. (Even here, as he frequently agonized in the
diary, he was not sure to what extent his frequently expressed remorse,
sorrow, and guilt was genuine, to what extent affectation.) To the extent
that he thought back, then, the memories were usually private ones,
the connections familial. Just as Klemperer's LQI notations rapidly
ceased (save in exceptional cases) to consider the possible parallels
and continuities with LTI, his retrospective moments in the diary rarely
involved attempts to grasp the

<B></B>

larger continuities and discontinuities in German history.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite his 1937 moment of despair, Klemperer continued to believe in
his place in German society; despite his 1955 moment of despair and his
gradual loss of faith in Marxism, he continued to support and buttress the
GDR. Overall, his Third Reich diaries provide an important counterweight
to Goldhagen's revisionist return to the "collective guilt thesis" of
the 1950s. In turn, the conjunction of the wartime and postwar diaries
provide material mainly against (but sometimes for) the totalitarianism
model so popular in the West during the 1950s that equated Nazism and
Communism as oppressive systems. LQI is not, for the most part, the
same or even an equivalent to LTI; the social transformations of the
postwar GDR are different in kind from the social transformations and
exclusions of the Nazi period (even if its judicial practices and general
political atmosphere eventually do seem reminiscent of its predecessor
state). When he himself finally begins drawing such comparisons, they
tend to be fleeting and impressionistic, usually lacking the detail and
nuance of his earlier analytic work on Nazi culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Third Reich, he was motivated to write in self-defense, in
a spirit of enmity and resistance, and in the hope of a different world
to come. In the postwar period, he recorded life under Communism not as
an opponent but as a sympathetic advocate; even at moments of greatest
doubt, he seemed unable to imagine another dispensation than the one in
which he found himself. Having failed to emigrate in time during the
Third Reich, he was forced to bear witness to the regime's crimes but
also became determined to stand fast in order to do so. In the postwar
period, he never considered emigrating--and continued to see those who
did as treacherous or opportunistic. Yet now he often appeared, even
to himself, as simply stuck, as someone who had bought into the system
around him without understanding its full ramifications and was now unable
to contemplate divestment. He continued to keep his diary faithfully,
but he was increasingly unsure to what end. "My dia. notes are becoming
ever shorter. Time is lacking, and the belief that they will ever be
able to be used," he wrote in October 1957 (<I>So,</I> 2:656). "I have
lost all belief in having any effect," he reiterated in April 1959. "All
belief in the Right and the Left. I live and die as a solitary essayist"
(<I>als einsamer Feuilletonist</I>) (<I>So,</I> 2:743).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A few months before his death and a few days before the diary breaks off
(after his final illness made it impossible for him to write anymore),
he finally arrived at the lowest depths of despair, waiting for the next
physical attack, for death, but "much too cowardly" to commit suicide
(<I>So,</I> 2:752). Yet "what is the point for me of living on, if I
cannot produce any more, and no longer believe in the worth of what I
have produced?" (<I>So,</I> 2:753) What haunted him, of course, is the
specter not only of the writer no longer able to write but of a postwar
career in support of what now seemed indefensible.

Even after seven years of marriage, in fact, Klemperer's second wife
was still a young woman and still at the beginning of her own academic
career. So despite the sincerity and depth of feeling expressed here,
there is also something theatrical, almost affected, about this belated
scene of conscience; in an unwitting parody of Brecht's <I>Galileo,</I>
this scholar toyed with recantation but could not bring himself to
renounce any of the comforts bought by conformity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Nazi period, Klemperer looks down on those who accepted and
acceded to the status quo because they lacked the intelligence or the
will to resist (even if he later helps to rehabilitate some of these
fellow travelers); he himself uses his prodigious energies and memory
to record the wrongs of the age. In becoming, in the postwar period,
a Communist, a public

<B></B>

re, a re obsessed with fame and recognition, and then in becoming
an old man, he also becomes more sympathetic to compromise--and ever less
concerned with memory as a tool for cultural and self-analysis. As he
underwent major changes in the transition from one dispensation to the
other, Victor Klemperer himself seemed oddly discontinuous. The diary
changes with him; somewhere in the process, he becomes for readers a
considerably less sympathetic or at least less comfortable narrating
presence. In the end, of course, this subtle, gradual transformation
of narrating persona under the pressure of concurrent historical
transformations is part of the diary's fascination--indeed part of the
more general fascination of the diary as historical genre.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In its critical analysis of Zionist rhetoric, <I>LTI</I> analyzed Herzl's
(inflated) sense of himself as a vessel of history, yet a similar
self-understanding, paradoxically enough, seems central to Klemperer's
own writings and persona. Sometime near the beginning of the Third Reich,
we might well say of him, "there is a moment at which he confides in
his diary that his private life has now ceased and his historic life
begun." After the war is over, conversely, he tried to leave behind
his self-appointed mission as a historical chronicler and to return, at
least in his diary, to private life. Yet even while his diary attempted
retirement, retreat, repression, he himself became a public re,
visible and exposed on the historical stage.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
German critics are right to claim Klemperer as one of the great
twentieth-century chroniclers; we must hope that both an unabridged
edition of the entire diary and English translations of the Weimar and
postwar diaries will be published soon. It is very much to Klemperer's
credit that his visibly "damaged life" (to use Adorno's phrase) yielded
both such vital scholarship and such a fascinating, if contradictory,
personal and historical record. "For me the great lesson," Klemperer noted
already in November 1918 during the failed German revolution, "is that
in the most desperate world-historical periods everyday life nonetheless
keeps going and takes up what one might call the breadth of the room."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  What is of greatest interest in this diaristic magnum opus, finally,
  is the relationship between his own subjective or at least positioned
  perspective on Germany's dramatic political, social, and cultural
  upheavals, the daily, domestic life he continued to live through them,
  and the changing nature of his own consciousness and narrative voice.

Throughout the postwar period, Aufbau had been the GDR's most ambitious
and prestigious literary press; after 1989, it quickly developed a
distinctive new profile, revising and redocumenting the political,
literary, and aesthetic history of the GDR and other parts of Eastern
Europe. In addition to fascinating documentary histories of Aufbau's own
publishing history, the press published important volumes, for instance,
on the Soviets' reusage of Nazi concentration camps to house political
prisoners during the Occupation and on the literary-political consequences
of the SED's 1965 crackdown on the arts, as well as documentary
collections that described the Stalinist career of GDR writer and
pioneering Minister of Culture, Johannes R. Becher, and that resituated
GDR writer Arnold Zweig in relationship to Zionism. See for instance

During the Third Reich, Klemperer clearly envisioned the postwar
publication not only of <I>LTI,</I> as is evident from notes
he made in his diaries, but also of some version of the diaries
themselves. <I>LTI</I> itself, on the other hand, announced that
Klemperer did not intend "to publish the entire diary for this period
with all its observations of everyday life" (<I>LTI,</I> 10). This was
probably a wise decision; as his own subsequent diaries made clear,
the publishing climate of the Soviet Zone of Occupation and early GDR
remained relatively unstable. In the heady days of the early postwar
period, Klemperer repeatedly gave public speeches on political or
literary-historical topics, then immediately found himself in dialogue
with major publishers eager to develop long-term editing, translation,
or critical projects with him. Yet although some of these projects
actually reached fruition, others were eventually halted, censored,
or suppressed. Any attempt to publish the wartime diaries in the late
1940s or early 1950s, one suspects, might have ended similarly.

Throughout the twentieth century, German Marxists have criticized
the parallel impulse to preserve, savor, and create art in the midst
of cataclysm. During the failed German revolution of 1918, bullets
damaged a Raphael hanging in a Dresden museum. In a letter to the
editor, Oscar Kokoschka, then professor of art in Dresden, lamented
this violent destruction of cultural legacy. This letter, in turn,
elicited a savage polemical attack by Georg Grosz and John Heartfield,
lampooning Kokoschka's implicit privileging of painting (and property)
over human life. But it also prompted conciliatory statements from more
orthodox Communists like Gertrud Alexander, advocating both revolutionary
upheaval and artistic conservation. For the so-called <I>Kunstlump</I>

im Klassenkampf: Zur proletarisch-revolution&auml;ren Literaturtheorie,
1919-1923</I> (Munich: C. Hauser, 1971). So too in 1938, Bertolt
Brecht's famous poem "To Posterity" ("An die Nachgeborenen") lamented
that in such times "a conversation / About trees is almost a crime. /
Because it includes a silence about so many misdeeds!" (Bertolt Brecht,
"To Posterity," in <I>Modern German Poetry,</I> 227). And Adorno, too,

In the late 1940s, Klemperer was repeatedly forced to defend the
inclusion of this chapter against objections that it could be used to
anti-Semitic ends; by the mid-1950s, he noted the historical irony
that his own critique of Zionism was now matched and bested by the
GDR's institutionalized anti-Zionist line. He himself, in the meantime,
condemned Zionist actions against the Arab population of Palestine as
painfully reminiscent of Nazi clearances.

In his initial discussions of the historicity of language and linguistic
formations, Klemperer repeatedly uses the metaphor of the "fossil"
(<I>LTI,</I> 2-3); as Susan Buck-Morss has argued at length,
the same metaphor is also central to the cultural-historical vision
of Walter Benjamin's unfinished Arcades project. See Susan Buck-Morss,

Benjamin and the Arcades Project</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1989),

has important resonances with the major intellectual projects undertaken,
in exile, by German-Jewish emigres, presumably without direct influence
in either direction.

Later GDR writers such as Hans Joachim Sch&auml;dlich, Christoph

account of the way language works--or necessarily fails to work--in
the Party-dominated GDR. At times, their analysis builds directly on
Klemperer's pioneering <I>LTI.</I> See for instance Maron's discussion
of the way Party language, with its "self-assurance . . . sentimentality
and simple-minded metaphors" is recycled in family life to discuss "such
grandiose topics as running the household or rearing children. There
was no distinct boundary between private speech and this other language"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The 1934 opera <I>Four Saints in Three Acts,</I> composed by Virgil
Thomson with a libretto by Gertrude Stein, is a landmark in the history
of American performance. Broadway had never before showcased a work in
which words served the usual function of music, not telling a story
or communicating meaning in a traditional fashion, but primarily
<I>sounding.</I> The casting was also revolutionary, as the entirely
black cast performed a work not written in dialect and unrelated to
traditional themes of black life. This intersection in 1934 of Steinian
modernism and black performance is more than an interesting episode in the
history of theatre. It is a prime moment in which to examine a modernist
text transferred to the stage, and the transformation of its poetics of
"nonidentity" when the communicative medium is a performing body inscribed
with social history. An examination of the Stein/Thomson project uncovers
a tension between a high modernist strategy that rejected linearity and
history and a visible physical racial identity that was, by definition,
the cumulative effect of historical cultural narrative(s). On one hand,
the high modernist project of Stein and others can be characterized as
unrelated to the historical realism, concerned not with referentiality,
but with the artistic capacity of syntax.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  On the other hand, race is intrinsically a historical product and
  its injection through the casting decision into this high modernist
  project presented a serious challenge to a poetics that sought to
  bypass dominant social structures.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An important question about the 1934 production of <I>Four Saints</I>
is whether the ostensible refusal of Stein's libretto to engage the
discourse of the current social structure remained intact when embodied
by a black cast in performance. I will argue that cultural narratives
of race, which were reinforced by certain directorial choices, defeated
her linguistic strategy for circumventing dominant structures. In fact,
those narratives reinforced Stein's poetic project and complemented her
artistic goals.

Landscape Theatre, Narrative and Identity
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's landscape conception of theater, which defies the traditional use
of narrative and character, has an established place among major theatre
and performance theories. The philosophical and artistic framework upon
which her landscape performance pieces such as <I>Four Saints</I> are
based can be inferred from writings such as <I>The Geographical History
of America</I> and <I>Lectures in America,</I> both compiled after she saw
the 1934 production of <I>Four Saints.</I> In <I>Geographical History,</I>
she suggests that landscape theater is the presentation of a state of
existing as opposed to a story or character sketch. The first time she
uses act and scene titles in the book, suggesting a play, they precede
a declaration of existence: "I am I because my little dog knows me."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Throughout the book she questions the role of the "little dog," or
  audience/observer, in delineating existence; it is clear that the
  Steinian theatre of <I>Geographical History</I> is concerned with the
  experience and acknowledgment of being rather than with narrative. Her
  theatrical goals find a parallel in the concept of spectacle, a
  nonnarrative flood of sights and sounds similar to a circus. Stein
  insinuated in <I>Lectures in America</I> that producing a theatrical
  experience of general, nonintellectual sensation was her goal: "All
  a child's feeling of the theater is two things. One which is in a way
  like a circus that is the general movement and light and air which any
  theater has and a great deal of glitter in the light and a great deal
  of height in the air."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The states of existence and being that are necessary for this theatrical
experience are not to be confused with identity, which is a product of
history and narrative structure. Because of identity's grounding in
history, a "state of confusion" according to Stein, it has no place
in a masterpiece, which is rooted in "the human mind": "Now identity
remembers and so it has an audience and as it has an audience it is
history and as it is history it has nothing to do with the human mind"
(<I>GHA,</I> 133, 175, 139). This observation links history not only
to identity but also to reception, acknowledging the element of social
context in performance that presents a significant obstacle to high
modernist ahistoricism in <I>Four Saints,</I> as I will show later. The
characters in Stein's landscape theatre pieces do not have identities,
as we cannot make inferences about their nature or characteristics
based on dialogue, narrative progression in the piece, or references
within it to a time "before" the staged action. Knowledge of the lives
of the historical St. T&eacute;r&egrave;se and St. Ignatius does not
effectively supplement the audience's understanding of their namesakes
in <I>Four Saints</I> because historical facts are irrelevant to the
libretto and to the staging of the opera. We know from the opera's title
and the characters' names that they are supposed to be saints, but this
information is not helpful in

<B></B>

predicting or interpreting their actions within the opera. The opera
attempted to define "saint" not based on any a priori conceptions of
identity but by constituting the label performatively in the terms of
the acts the characters carried out within it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These acts did not follow from causal relationships, nor did they build
cumulatively as is characteristic of narrative structure. Instead,
speech, movement, and action were isolated in unrelated tableaux that
proceeded in a nondeterministic flow. The series of tableaux in which
characters identified as Spanish saints were seen chatting, picnicking,
marching in a processional, and painting giant Easter eggs were snapshots
of existence rather than traditional scenes of action. Stein herself
did not even characterize the movements of the characters as "doing":
"But a really good saint does nothing and so I wanted to have Four
Saints who did nothing and I wrote <I>Four Saints in Three Acts</I>
and they did nothing and that was everything."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  Here, she defines "doing" as that which does not happen in <I>Four
  Saints:</I> history and progressive action. The hyperbolic and
  campy staging of the play by Virgil Thomson, Maurice Grosser,
  and choreographer Frederick Ashton undermined the standard
  definition of action as that which inherently contributes to
  narrative progression. This was in agreement with Stein's musings
  in <I>Picasso:</I> "A thing without progress is more splendid than a
  thing which progresses."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  The saints perform their actions for the sake of performance,
  actions that lead to nothing else "happening," but are complete
  in themselves. The actions performed early in the opera are not
  necessary for evaluating actions carried out later on and thus avoid
  the syncopative disunity that so irritated her in narrative.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to Stein, narrative is unworthy of a masterpiece not only
because it opposes unity but because it is "not interesting" (<I>GHA,</I>
142) and too common: "Everybody knows so many stories and what is the use
of telling another story" (<I>LA,</I> 118). One perspective on her regard
for stories is that it betrays her own white, bourgeois identifications
by suggesting that all narratives, versions of history, and human
experience have already been told: "It is perfectly extraordinary how
many complicated dramas go on all the time. And everybody knows them, so
why tell another one" (<I>LA,</I> 118). Such a position assumes that all
voices and viewpoints have long been present and accounted for and thus
denies any historical and social specificity in human experience. Thomson
and Grosser understood and embraced Stein's position on narrative and
consciously chose black performers to be the vehicles for her aesthetic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  The production deliberately situated black persons in a timeless realm
  devoid of history or stories. Such an artistic move is significant
  given the Jim Crow environment of 1934 and the corresponding need for
  its stories to become more visible.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In spite of her opposition to coherent narrative, Stein herself was
interested in self-definition, though only in the context of a perpetually
open-ended process. Her intention was not to ignore identity and go no
further, but to free entities from the limitations of socially constructed
identities. In her framework, a "masterpiece" is accomplished when
language, entities, and signs are freed from historically and culturally
determined referents to exist self-referentially but not definitively or
statically. She believed that her landscape writing and theatre offered
an alternative to narrative, a new way of telling what is not known. She
sought to tell the "thing" itself, which had

<B></B>

formerly been hidden at the margins: "But in my portraits I had tried
to tell what each one is without telling stories and now in my early
plays I tried to tell what happened without telling stories so that the
essence of what happened would be like the essence of the portraits,
what made what happened be what it was" (<I>LA,</I> 121).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The conveyance of nonnarrative essence defined a masterpiece for Stein;
she wrote that this is what the human mind sees, a vision that is
textured yet free of conventional dimensional form. Stein's favorite
visual metaphor for landscape theatre was the view from her first airplane
ride, which was aptly en route to see a production of <I>Four Saints</I>
in the United States. The view from the air is complete without linearity,
without progression; everything can be seen in one look. In the view from
the human mind, all time is collapsed into the present, resulting in a
complete unitary entity: "When you look at anything and you do not see
it all in one plane, you do not see it with the human mind but anybody
can know that. It is naturally that. And so it is because there is no
time and no identity in the human mind" (<I>GHA,</I> 175). In a recent
article on <I>Four Saints,</I> Daniel Albright further described her idea
of landscape theatre as a "notion of eternity as an unrolled filmstrip,
a simultaneous presentation of an image in all its possible projections
into time . . . everything that has been and will be is there and merely
needs to display various angles of itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  Since all possible elements of the landscape are already there, any
  drama is a result of their various formations and arrangements rather
  than their creation or discovery. History and time become irrelevant.

The Implications of the Performance Medium
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The main obstacle to such a performance landscape, one that distinguishes
it from a written landscape, is the inherently social and historical
nature of the audience-performer relationship in which race and gender
are visible. The audience members in 1934 carried with them theatrical
and social experiences, including the viewing of other productions,
that formed their expectations about what white and black people
usually did and signified in performance. In at least a very basic
way, these experiences structured <I>Four Saints</I> around narrative,
despite Stein's intentions. They provided guidelines for the audience
members as to how they might interpret the happenings on the stage, as
well as when they should sit and stand, when they should be quiet, when
they should applaud. These dynamics of theatrical reception introduced
history and identity into the <I>Four Saints</I> production, and the
disunity resulting from using the past for interpreting the present
arguably survived regardless of Stein's artistic efforts to the contrary.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Four Saints</I> juxtaposed her textual fort&eacute; of
nonreferentiality with the nature of performance, which, using Joseph
Roach's definition, is primarily referential: "Offer[ing] a substitute for
something else that preexists it . . . stand[ing] in for an elusive entity
that it is not but that it must vainly aspire to both embody and replace";
it is always a reenactment, always refers to another performance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  This view of performance as an intrinsically citational act has long
  been argued for by performance studies scholars according to the
  paradigm of repetition with critical difference. In this model, meaning

<B></B>

emerges from repetition and the instance of critical difference represents
the potential for change. The referential nature of a performance enables
the actions and images to signify to a viewer, while the idiosyncratic
nature of nonmechanical repetition necessarily reinterprets the referent,
nuancing the sign within the particular conditions of its expression. This
paradigm is similar to Stein's approach to defamiliarization in writing,
which also relies upon repetition and the related possibilities for
rearrangements and change. If Stein's approach can be compared to that
of Louis Zukofsky, however, the emphasis emerges differently: "We tend
to write an expressive and musical verse rather than a magniloquent
one. We seek the plasticity of words and their interrelations and musical
connections rather than denotations."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  This statement downplays the citational component of repetition that
  structures the performance model and instead focuses on the materiality
  rather than referentiality of language in hopes of moving beyond
  the preconceived and towards the horizon of the new. For instance,
  a portion of Stein's libretto for <I>Four Saints</I> reads: "If a
  magpie in the sky on the sky cannot cry if the pigeon on the grass
  alas can alas and to pass the pigeon on the grass alas."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  The citational quality of the word "pigeon" is secondarily significant
  (after all, "pigeon" is not arbitrarily situated "on the grass," the
  association of the two referents having obviously been considered),
  but Stein is primarily concerned with the music resulting from the
  manipulation and repetition of sounds and words. In the medium of
  physical performance, such a concern with pliability and rearrangement
  finds itself in tension with the dynamics of the visual--the citational
  quality of raced and gendered bodies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The visual performance text, intentionally or not, makes intertextual
references to previous cultural performances. To adapt the "blank page"
metaphor of Rachel Blau DuPlessis, the directors and actors of <I>Four
Saints</I> did not face an empty stage upon which to perform. It was
a stage crowded with previous representations of blackness, of opera,
and of the avant-garde. When DuPlessis notes, regarding women's writing,
"All our words are ringed by Words," the capital means all the uses of
language that have been used to define the identity "woman."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  In the same way, the actors in <I>Four Saints</I> stepped onto a
  stage on which their identities as black performers had already been
  historically constituted: "The body onstage, through its carriage,
  gestures and spatial relationships to other bodies, resonates with
  social history."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  The visual presence of a racialized performing body evoked a cultural
  narrative that constructed blackness in opposition to whiteness. Aldon
  Nielsen agrees that certain a priori assumptions about modernist poetry
  were attached to the suggestion of race: "They all shared a common
  vocabulary of racial images. When modernist poets thought blackness,
  their thoughts were confined within the frozen metaphors of the language
  they thought in."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  This quotation might be altered for a performance context as "when
  they <I>saw</I> blackness" to anticipate the largely white audience's
  reception of <I>Four Saints</I> and their situation of the opera
  in their current social context. In the case of <I>Four Saints,</I>
  Stein's libretto was more successful at helping words forget their
  usual contexts than helping bodies forget their races.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Her text, on paper, was necessarily incomplete as a performance text
since it waited upon the interaction of the audience with performing
bodies, a situation that injected

<B></B>

social history into the performance of her otherwise nonreferential
text. Stein herself wrestled with the implications of reception and the
way it constructs identity. In <I>Geographical History</I> she decides
at one point to wish away the problem of audience: "An audience cannot
be layed away. Of course it can. It can but is it. Of course it can. Any
audience can be layed away of course it can" (<I>GHA,</I> 149). At another
time, she acknowledges the audience, but dismisses its defining power:
"Being I I am I has really nothing to do with the little dog knowing me,
he is my audience, but an audience never does prove to you that you are
you" (<I>GHA,</I> 105). To apply this statement to the first production
of <I>Four Saints</I> is to hypothesize the opera's existence apart from
what was perceived by the audience from the various cultural locations
that comprised it. Charles Bernstein seems to agree with this hypothesis
in his discussion of Stein and identity: "Any cultural production can be
viewed through the lens of its socio-historical circumstance. To ignore
such contexts is to deny the social truths of the work. Yet such contexts
are inadequate to establish a work's identity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  Albright went even further in this regard in his assessment of <I>Four
  Saints:</I> "[It] differs from its predecessors [Stein's earlier plays
  and writings] in that it contemplates a vacuum--an empty canvas, a
  region of the earth from which all finite objects have been removed"
  ("ONA," 3). This claim cannot possibly be true for the ephemeral
  medium of performance that, unlike other forms of art, exists only in
  the social context of its initial moment. Arguably, all other forms
  in which it is "preserved," such as play scripts, recordings, and
  written descriptions, cease to be "the work" Bernstein is referring
  to and are better characterized as residue or traces.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  Hence, though the identity that consolidates around performance traces
  may evolve and change in time, the identity of the performance work
  itself is fixed, fleeting, and inevitably unrecoverable in its entirety.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  In the case of the 1934 production of <I>Four Saints,</I> those
  conditions included the history of race in the United States, especially
  race in performance.

Minstrelsy and Black Performance Tradition
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though black operatic casts were effectively unheard of when <I>Four
Saints</I> opened in 1934, the representation of blacks in theatre had
a long history. The range of ways for blacks to be represented or to
represent themselves in performance had always been extremely narrow,
so that the appearance of black performers on stage would have evoked
a limited number of expectations. The triggering of these expectations
presented a problem for the adaptation of Stein's writing and her artistic
goals of nonreferentiality to the stage in the case of <I>Four Saints.</I>
At the time, most representations of black performers and characters were
grounded in the American minstrel tradition, which certainly had been
modified and expanded by new forms and performers as time passed. The
very appearance of black performers on stage still referred to tradition
despite the ahistorical nature of Stein's text.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Scholars debate the precise origins of American minstrelsy, though it is
agreed that white entertainers such as Thomas Dartmouth Rice developed
blackface burlesque acts for theaters and circuses as early as the 1840s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  After the Civil War, minstrel

<B></B>

performers were more often African American, but the shows remained
nonnarrative and nondramatic, emphasizing song, dance, and the spectacle
of the overcostumed, overpainted construction of race.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  In the twentieth century, as black performers became more common on
  the legitimate stage, their race often functioned as a stock stage
  device that carried certain comic and tragic inferences handed
  down from minstrelsy. The inferences especially important to this
  discussion involve the childlike nature, lack of intellectualism,
  and na&iuml;vet&eacute; associated with the minstrel character.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  These connotations were still well-understood at the time of the
  production of <I>Four Saints,</I> as evidenced especially by the
  success of Marc Connelly's <I>The Green Pastures,</I> which opened
  on Broadway in February 1930, won the Pulitzer Prize for that year,
  and was subsequently a cultural sensation on a national tour.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  Like <I>Four Saints,</I> <I>Green Pastures</I> dealt with religious
  themes, albeit in a more conservative and traditional fashion. The
  play was presented as a collection of Bible stories retold from a
  na&iuml;ve viewpoint and in the stereotypical vernacular of southern
  blacks. The production represented blackness with obvious links to
  minstrelsy and "made it on the faith of those who had no pretense of
  sophistication and who, therefore, could believe in an uncluttered
  and simple way. Doubt seemed impossible in a black child's fantasy"
  (<I>HR,</I> 251). A genealogy of Thomson's ideas about black people on
  the stage and his decision to cast <I>Four Saints</I> with black actors
  leads back to <I>Green Pastures.</I> Hall Johnson, the African American
  choir director for <I>Green Pastures</I> was the writer and director
  of a play in 1933 that also dealt with a variation of black culture
  centered on a religious theme called <I>Run, Little Chillun'!</I>
  Like <I>Green Pastures,</I> <I>Run</I> was a musical and was best
  known for its inspired choir numbers. Carl Van Vechten claimed that
  it was during the intermission for <I>Run</I> that Thomson decided to
  use black performers for <I>Four Saints.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  Considering his interest in theatre, it is reasonable to assume
  that Thomson also saw <I>Green Pastures</I> (which was much more
  celebrated than <I>Run</I>), though there is no concrete evidence
  to this effect. But even if he was not directly influenced by the
  production, he easily would have been able to reconcile its portrayal
  of simple people of faith with his own ideas about black people:
  "They are not afraid of religious subject matter; they do not overly
  intellectualize everything."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  The review in the <I>New York Times</I> concurred with this view,
  leaving no doubt as to the function of the black actor as a cultural
  symbol in <I>Green Pastures:</I> "It follows the chronicle of biblical
  history as ignorant religious negroes of the South might conceive it
  in the childish terms of their personal experience. . . . At first
  you are delighted by the naive incongruities of the spectacle."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  The use of the word "spectacle" foreshadowed later descriptions of
  <I>Four Saints,</I> though the two shows would on the surface appear
  to have little in common other than the color of their casts and their
  seemingly diverse treatments of religious faith.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Green Pastures'</I> use of blackness as a stage device made it possible
for white audiences to become "ignorant" themselves and vicariously
experience a comforting, simple faith in an increasingly faithless time
colored by the Depression, scientific advances, and persistent memories
of the horrors of World War I. In spite of significant cosmetic and
thematic differences, <I>Green Pastures</I> functioned much like a
minstrel show as it "created a distance between white men's normative
selves (what they had to be) and

<B></B>

their natural selves (what they feared but were fascinated by)"
(<I>HR,</I> 257). The play was successful because white Americans wanted
to reclaim a simple faith, but class expectations and modern adulthood
required that they remain intellectually grounded. Lott hypothesizes
that this desire for regression could be found at the base of minstrel
show humor with its "ability to reduce not only black people but white
spectators themselves to children" (<I>LT,</I> 144). <I>Green Pastures</I>
offered such an opportunity. Through this play, a white audience was able
to project its desire to reclaim faith and childhood onto the epitome of
ignorance and simplicity, the southern black, presumed to be untouched
by class expectations and modern logic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The spectacular, benign, fairy-tale quality of <I>Green Pastures</I>
masked its promotion of white racial ideology regarding black people,
which assumed that their cultures did not progress as those of whites did.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  In this regard, black people epitomized Stein's conviction that
  "people really do not change from one generation to another, as far
  back as we know history people are about the same as they were."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  Thomson may or may not have believed in the general stasis of
  humanity, but he did see black people as a link back to the time of
  St. T&eacute;r&egrave;se:
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
  "I often marveled at the miracle whereby slavery (and some
  cross-breeding) had turned them into Christians of an earlier stamp
  than ours . . . very much as Saint Th&eacute;r&egrave;se had been"
  (<I>VT,</I> 239). The casting decisions for <I>Four Saints</I> take
  on new significance in this light, especially regarding Beatrice
  Wayne, who portrayed St. Teresa I and is even remembered today
  as the "eternal, unchanging" black woman: "She was <I>positively
  saintly,</I> a <I>plain strong woman</I> who radiated inner beauty"
  (<I>VT,</I> 249, emphasis added). The social inscriptions of African
  American bodies, combined with Thomson's pronouncements regarding
  blacks, such as, "They live on the surface of their consciousness,"
  encouraged an interpretation of the cast's performances as "natural"
  and a perpetuation of the idea that black people, untouched by progress
  and history, were somehow intrinsically suitable for religious subject
  matter (<I>VT</I>, 253). The label of "natural" was commonly applied to
  black performers of the day, obscuring the roles that artistic skill,
  technical training, and hard work played in their successes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Four Saints</I> continued the tradition of black performance as
nonnarrative spectacle. As a musical without a plot, it did not violate
the white audience member's expectation shaped by minstrelsy, which did
not encompass dramatic narrative. Granted, by 1934, plays such as Eugene
O'Neill's <I>The Emperor Jones</I> , Willis Richardson's <I>The
Chipwoman's Fortune</I> , and Wallace Thurman's <I>Harlem</I>
 had showcased black actors in mainstream theaters in dramatic
productions, but the majority of roles for black actors were still in
musicals. The extremely popular black musicals of the 1920s, led by Eubie
Blake and Noble Sissle's <I>Shuffle Along</I>  had no plot to speak
of. By the time <I>Four Saints</I> opened, musicals such as <I>Green
Pastures</I> and <I>Run</I> had introduced dramatic plots of varying
degrees and experienced success on Broadway, but these shows still clung
to traditional, stereotypical representations of blackness. While <I>Green
Pastures</I> capitalized on the symbol of na&iuml;ve southern blacks,
<I>Run</I> emphasized black sexuality, voodoo, and primitivism. In any
case, the majority of narrative dramas were still portrayed by white
casts. This lack of black bodies within dramatic

<B></B>

narrative structure carried significant meaning where racial identity
was concerned. The cultural meaning attached to the narrative form was
explained by the great dramatic actor Charles Gilpin, famous for starring
in <I>The Emperor Jones,</I> in 1919:

Thomson betrayed a similar attitude with regard to the artistic
initiatives of his black cast members, insisting, "I don't really want
them to act. I want them to be moved"; he wanted Frederick Ashton to
"make choreography . . . so that all movements will be regulated to the
music, measure by measure and all our complicated stage-action made into
a controllable spectacle."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
  Thomson's approach to the production, though motivated mainly by
  aesthetic intent, sought to deprive the black actors of agency in
  creating the art in which they were represented. Even such "purely
  aesthetic" goals of harmony and unity are worthy of a social critique
  when their achievement requires viewing black bodies as pawns on stage,
  to be moved to serve the purposes of the white directors. Considering
  the racial and social hierarchy in 1934, black actors were the logical
  choice for comprising a "controllable spectacle." This approach to
  performers is consistent with Stein's aversion to character in her
  modernist landscape vision of theater, in which persons should not stand
  out as actors or agents but should merely "be." As one critic has summed
  up the characters in the opera: "Saint Therese [<I>sic</I>] and Saint
  Ignatius are stage props: talking stage props. . . . Their appearance
  is justified by what they contribute to the set, the landscape."

Nonnarrativity is not the only possible comparison between <I>Four
Saints</I> and the minstrel tradition. One of the traditional bits in
the minstrel show was the oratory segment, which depended upon linguistic
travesty for humorous effect. The black body of the orator, indicated not
by the body of the performer but by exaggerated make-up and costuming,
was coded as less intelligent than the white subject, yet aspiring to
whiteness. With the audience understanding this meaning of the sign of
the black body, a formal oratory performance by the minstrel actor was
considered humorous. Typically, the orating performer, in the guise of
a government official, preacher, or other public speaker, would use
pretentious language incorrectly, failing to differentiate between
homonyms and shades of meaning as, presumably, a white speaking body
would not.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
  Further, the mere use of the formal oratory convention was in itself
  humorous travesty because the social constructions of race stipulated
  that a black speaking body would have no legitimate use for such
  conventions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Aside from this general travesty of language, the speakers might be
performing a more sophisticated satire on a different level, imitating
well-known orators or politicians or spoofing current events of the day.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  An interesting aspect of such a performance is that presumably a black
  performer actually would have to understand the

<B></B>

correct usage of the language, as well as the normative versions of
current events, in order to spoof them in the person of his blackfaced
character. Thus, the oratory segment contained both an appeal and a
threat: its appeal was that it erased adult responsibility and social
codes of behavior through a mocking of those codes, allowing a comforting,
childlike regression for the audience members; its threat was that it
raised the possibility of <I>real</I> black orators who could stand in
for or replace whites, introducing the possibility of whites' loss of
social control.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  The dynamic of <I>Four Saints</I> was such that it emphasized the
  oratory segment's appeal and erased its threat. Like the minstrel
  orators, the black performers in <I>Four Saints</I> used language in a
  pleasurable, nonsensical, childlike way. Since Stein's libretto provided
  no opportunity for character differentiation, however, the saints did
  not assume the positions of speaking individuals, even parodically. By
  creating "roles" in which performers need only function as pawns to
  be moved around the stage, Stein and Thomson minimized the threat
  of social replacement posed by black people speaking in public and
  retained a measure of control over the pleasure the travesty scenario
  produced. The combined forces of her refusal of character and his
  approach to staging reinforced a dominant social order in which the
  black performer appeared as the site of pleasure for whites but removed
  the threat of social replacement that traditionally accompanies mimicry.

The glistening cellophane set and elaborate costumes of <I>Four Saints</I>
was Stein's landscape version of spectacle, embodying what she described
as a child's feeling of the theatre: "A great deal of glitter in the light
and a great deal of height in the air." Her libretto was a circus for
the ear, a nonnarrative flood of pleasant-sounding nonsensical language,
repetition, and linguistic trickery. The parallels between minstrelsy
and <I>Four Saints</I> bring into relief the way the black cast may have
worked in Stein and Thomson's favor in the production. As Weinstein has
noted about Thomson's reasons for choosing an all-black cast, "There is
something of a Barnum and Bailey flavor to a play about Spanish saints
taking place on a stage with scenery composed entirely of cellophane,
performed by an all-Negro cast choreographed to move like Balinese

My negro singers, after all, are a purely musical desideratum, because of

The reference to the possibility of painting cast members' faces white
bore on aesthetic problems perceived by the show's designer, the artist
Florine Stettheimer, who had "been concerned that the various shades of
brown and black faces in the cast would disrupt her perfect color scheme"
("O<I>FS,</I>" 110). In a solution that hearkened back to minstrel
shows in which white and black performers alike blackened their faces
with burnt cork to meet a white audience's expectations of blackness,
Stettheimer used a single shade of brown makeup on the skin of the <I>Four
Saints</I> cast members. She also insisted that their bare hands be made
uniformly white through the use of gloves, having judged the bare black
hand inelegant.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
  The need to present a seamless, undifferentiated version of blackness in
  culture proceeds from a social structure in which white power defines
  itself in opposition to a black subaltern.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Variety in blackness was threatening to the security of the place of
whiteness because it suggested the possibility for unstable, shifting,
less certain markers of identity and, hence, an unstable power
structure. As Elin Diamond has stated, "The concept of 'differences
within' complicates as well identity narratives (of nationhood or
racial purity) and their bipolar structure of (true) self versus (alien)
other. . . . If an identity is always different within itself it can no
longer be an identity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  The repetition of artificially consistent black faces in <I>Four
  Saints</I> complemented Stein's literary trope of undivided landscape
  and her desire for artistic unity. Such a racial costume, however,
  was also in tension with her aversion to identity construction since
  it suggests a definite social identity in which all black people are
  the same. This tension raises the prospect of incompatibility when
  race is at issue between Stein's landscape aesthetic and her refusal
  to establish identity through character. In this situation, landscape
  itself <I>becomes</I> a recognizable social identity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This status of black identity as a coherent "given" in performance
furthered the fulfillment of Stein's wish that the audience should
not need to take time to acquaint themselves with the performance
terrain. She writes in <I>Lectures in America,</I> "I felt that if a play
was exactly like a landscape then there would be no difficulty about
the emotion of the person looking on at the play being behind or ahead
of the play because the landscape does not have to make acquaintance"
(<I>LA,</I> 122). In a landscape, all the elements are already present,
transparent in that they do not have to "make acquaintance," that is, be
discovered or found. A fragmented, complex, unfamiliar representation of
blackness rather than the undifferentiated, character-less, monochromatic
one created by Stein, Thomson, and Stettheimer in <I>Four Saints</I>
would have required a process of familiarization and discovery by the
audience, resulting in the emotional syncopation that so annoyed Stein
in performance and narrative in general. That the audience did not have
to sort out unexpected, nontraditional performances of black identity
thus suited Stein's artistic goals perfectly. It is ironic that the
presentation of subtly <I>familiar</I> (or at least unchallenging)
constructions of race complements Stein's libretto, which, like so much
of her work, emphasizes the <I>defamiliarization</I> of language.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The uniform presentation of race in the opera also complemented her
landscape objectives because it was more conducive to abstraction than
complexity and individuality: "The saints in Stein's opera are like
people beheld at such a remote distance that

<B></B>

they have receded into abstraction; they constitute a landscape" ("ONA,"
7). Indeed, like many modernists, Stein held the view of black culture
as an unchanging background. Her best known statement on blackness is
the infamous passage from <I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas:</I>
"Gertrude Stein concluded that Negroes were not suffering from
persecution, they were suffering from nothingness. She always contends
that the African is not primitive; he has a very ancient but a very narrow
culture and there it remains. Consequently nothing does or can happen."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other modernist poets concurred that blackness is a state in which
"nothing does or can happen." Nielsen points out that for such writers,
blackness fills the need for a poetic backdrop, or landscape: "There
are a number of . . . passages in which Pound reduces the Afro-American
soldiers to abstract blobs of color"; "Blacks in Williams' verse seldom
complete significant actions; their value is lodged in their merest
presence"; and Stevens has a "pattern of employing nonwhites as local
color . . . go[ing] so far as to incorporate the debris that black people
might leave behind them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
  Though Thomson, not Stein, chose the black cast, it fit the prevalent
  modernist assessment of black culture perfectly.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to the perception of black identity as uniform and unchanging,
the stereotypical assumption that blacks were childlike and somehow
more "natural" than whites fit the high modernist project of <I>Four
Saints.</I> Though the project did not benefit from the sexual stereotypes
accorded to blacks, this too was an aspect of white-constructed black
identity that surfaced during the production. Stein herself was worried
about the possible distraction that cultural associations with black
sexuality might present, and her friend William Aspenwall Bradley
recounted her comments in a letter to Thomson:

And I suppose they have good reasons for using negro singers instead of

One interpretation of this comment links it to the coding of the black
body in culture as more sensual and sexually suggestive than the white
body. She may have assumed that the appearance of black dancers on stage
in transparent flowing skirts would lend a sexually suggestive tone to
her language that she did not wish.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
  This interpretation of her comment is bolstered by evidence of
  excessive sexualization of black bodies by white intellectuals
  including Van Vechten, Thomson, and Ashton--for whom Harlem was in
  vogue in the 1920s and 1930s--Thomson's biographer explains that for
  many white gay men black bodies were symbolic of a sexual world not
  open to them in white society: "The possibility of illicit pleasure
  was one of Harlem's attractions: it was where men could find men to
  have sex with . . . well-dressed, deferential Harlem gentlemen acted
  as discreet providers" (<I>VT,</I> 225). There is evidence that these
  sexual exchanges between black Harlem and white New York did not
  always transcend the unequal social structure of society-at-large. A

  The photograph might be interpreted as of questionable significance

  "landscape."

Though it is uncertain exactly what effects stereotypes of black sexuality
had on the production, <I>Four Saints</I> unquestionably capitalized
on the simple, primitive, and natural qualities associated with black
people. Similar to the function minstrelsy served for

the lower and middle classes, one effect of <I>Four Saints</I> was
escapism and relief from anxiety for upper class New Yorkers and
intellectuals using the trope of blackness. The composition of the
audience on the evening of the opera's opening has been well documented,
as in this description by society writer Lucius Beebe, "The intelligensia

monocles descended in an avalanche of ermine and broadcloth on the old
Forty-fourth Street Theatre.

  A review from the <I>Chicago Daily News</I> supports the view that
  <I>Four Saints</I> reinforced cultural stereotypes of black simplicity:
  "No race is so gifted in simplicity as the Negro. The Negro is

  every child's mind in a contented, a soliloquizing, a creative but
  inert state."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
  Van Vechten similarly described the effect of the black cast in a letter
  to Stein, "The Negroes are divine, like El Grecos, more Spanish, more

  extraordinary plastic line that <I>any</I> white singers could ever be."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The mere appearance of black bodies on stage was not itself
responsible for the perception of the performers as uncommonly simple
and natural. Stein's libretto certainly contributed to this effect with
its childlike syntax, its structural bias toward natural speech, and its
similarities to the minstrel show oratory segment. In an analysis of her
"How to Write," Albright points out that she "elaborates, at great length,
Ernest Fenollosa's (and Pound's) belief that a language--or a prose
style--should be judged according to the relevance of its grammar to the
grammar of the <I>natural</I> world" ("ONA," 4, emphasis added). Keeping
in mind that Thomson chose a black cast because he presumed that they
would not overintellectualize her libretto, the cultural stereotypes
attached to blackness complemented her "natural," flowing grammar
in which any noun will do where a noun is required. Her repetitive,
nonnarrative prose invites a childlike, playful approach to language
that would have been suggested and reinforced for a white audience by the
presence of black performers. Eric Lott's description of the minstrelsy
oratory segment discussed above echoes common descriptions of her use
of language as pre-Oedipal:

Onstage these fantasies were partly represented by a vexing and unmeaning

of painted lips. Through them could be relived the forgotten liberties

Stein and Thomson's strivings toward the high-modernist goals of childlike

above all judgment of similarity and dissimilarity" sounds astounding
after an analysis of how the production engaged with, benefitted from,
and emphasized social constructs of racial difference ("ONA," 10).

Travesty and Camp in Four Saints
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Four Saints</I> can certainly be read as referring to the comic device
of travesty central to black performance in the United States. Travesty
was "the single comic mode in the minstrel tradition," and its
effectiveness depended upon the obvious disparity between the blackfaced
performer and his costume, dress, or appropriation of social standing
(<I>HR,</I> 263). In an effective illustration of the concept, Huggins
explains that a little girl may dress up in makeup and high heels, but "no
matter how she stretches and struts . . . it is impossible for the little
girl to be her mother" (<I>HR,</I> 263). The humor of travesty required
a similar racial understanding among audience members. The use of this
brand of travesty in <I>Four Saints</I> can be reexamined in the light
of queer camp, usually theorized as a liberating form of expression, but
one that in this case depended upon a foundationally racist comic mode.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On paper Stein's libretto may be whimsical, even charming, but the
laughter reportedly elicited from the audience at the performances
could not be predicted from reading words from the printed page such as:
"He did be categorically and did he did he did he did he did he did he
in interruption interruption interruptedly leave" (<I>FS,</I> 53).
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Where, then, did the show's humor come from? I have no doubt that the
 timing and skill of the performers provided one significant component,
 but another may have been that the audience took its cues from the same
 cultural framework of travesty that was necessary for a minstrel show
 to be funny. Faced with her nonreferential text floating seemingly
 aimlessly from pleasant imagery to word games to nonsense, audience
 members must have sought an existing metaphor with which to frame it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
  I would suggest that the audience viewing <I>Four Saints,</I> a play
  unlike any previously witnessed on the mainstream American stage,
  searched for a frame of reference in which to understand the show and
  found such a frame in the familiar travesty mode.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Black bodies assuming the identities of serious opera singers
provided a unique opportunity to use travesty as the primary
interpretive frame. Opera was perceived as a "serious," European-based
pursuit. Classically trained black singers were still relatively few and
were known best for singing folk forms such as spirituals accompanied
by orchestras. The only well-known cast member was Edward Matthews as
St. Ignatius, who was enjoying "as much of a concert career as a black
American in the 1930s could hope to have" (<I>VT,</I> 246). Other cues
that travesty was the operative frame come from comparisons of the opera's
libretto and the minstrel show's oratory segment, which also depended upon
travesty for its humorous effect. Stein's words were apparent nonsense
to listeners, yet they were sung with perfect seriousness, as if they
made some sort of "sense." The sight of black opera singers singing her
libretto could have been analogous, in the recesses of cultural memory,
to the stump speech of a minstrel preacher or politician.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other possibilities for travesty were suggested by the appearance of black
performers on stage named Saint Teresa and Saint Ignatius. Similarly
the charm of <I>Green Pastures</I> depended upon the fanciful nature
(from a white cultural perspective) of the suggestion that personalities
from the Bible--even God--could be represented as

<B></B>

black. Likewise, a black Saint T&eacute;r&egrave;se and a black Saint
Ignatius would be slightly humorous and innocently charming to a white
audience because of the general cultural agreement that saints are not
black. This brand of humor has more insidious roots in the culture of
slavery, in which slaves were similarly and satirically given names
"above their stations" such as "Cicero," "Caesar," or "Moses" for the
entertainment of their masters.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An analysis of <I>Four Saints</I> as a work of travesty becomes even more
meaningful and complex when it is also considered as a work of queer camp,
a form of expression that may intersect with travesty but maintains a
distinctly specific status. Moe Meyer defines camp as an intrinsically
queer expression that is more than "some kind of unspecified cognitive
identification of an ironic moment." Instead, it is a type of parody
"whereby the marginalized and disenfranchised advance their own interests
by entering alternative signifying codes into discourse by attaching
them to existing structures of signification."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
  In <I>Four Saints,</I> the existing structures of signification included
  the operatic form, Catholicism, Christian hymns, children's games,
  and cultural constructions of black identity. Thomson described
  the opera's dealings with religious subject matter in this way,
  "'High camp is the only thing you can do with a religious subject,'
  anything else gets 'sentimental and unbelievable,' whereas high camp
  taps into the innocence of true faith" (<I>VT,</I> 229). In the light
  of this statement, Thomson's opera can be viewed as a camp response
  to <I>Green Pastures</I> (wholeheartedly a part of the "existing
  structures of signification"), which used a black cast in a more
  sincere, sentimental treatment of Christianity. In <I>Four Saints,</I>
  Christianity provided a structure, including saints' names, musical
  references, and a general aura of piousness, but the content of the
  libretto and the tableaux had virtually nothing to do with these
  initial structuring references. Instead, the opera portrayed what
  might be called a religion of childhood, the site of "true faith." So a
  camp reading of <I>Four Saints</I> might uncover an alternative queer
  signifying code in which, behind the dominant culture's signifiers of
  opera and religion, lies nothing more than the silliness and irreverence
  of Stein's libretto, a playful pastiche of familiar hymns and patriotic
  songs, childhood games and, of course, <I>black</I> saints.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As for the black saints, a camp reading of <I>Four Saints</I> contains
the possibility of an interpretation in which the production's use of the
cultural tropes of blackness does not <I>directly</I> refer to existing
cultural constructions in a literal way but instead <I>refracts</I> and
<I>critiques</I> them through a lens of queer parody. One analysis of the
mechanics of camp suggests that a work of camp exposes the high/popular
art binary as a social construction (for instance, incorporating nursery
rhymes into the operatic form) and by extension also begins to deconstruct
structures of gender and sexual orientation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
  Further, such a work might imply a questioning of racial binaries
  as well. In the case of <I>Four Saints,</I> the character-less,
  undifferentiated saints could be read as a parody of white constructions
  of blacks as unchanging and simple (were it not for Thomson's comment
  that black performers were perfect for the production because "they
  do not overintellectualize everything" [<I>VT,</I> 226]).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Aside from the <I>slight</I> possibility that the opera used parody to
mock historically grounded racial stereotypes, the show's treatment of
blacks may alternatively be redeemed by a possible open-ended model of
identity latent in Stein's libretto and the

<B></B>

production's camp aspects. Meyer suggests that the queer origins of camp
provide for a performative model of identity that would seem to benefit
black performers at the time of the opera and that echoes Stein's own
stance toward the concept.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
  This interpretation of camp evokes both the opera's nonnarrative,
  nonlinear "action" discussed above and theories of the way Stein
  constructs an open-ended identity through language; as Bernstein has
  contended, "Stein celebrates her suspension of identity, this holding
  off naming to see what otherwise emerges" ("SI," 487). Constructing
  identities through performance rather than adhering to a preexisting
  definition, the combination of the camp aesthetic and Stein's approach
  suggests possibilities within the 1934 production of <I>Four Saints</I>
  for broadening the definition of black identity in America.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Working against both of these possibilities for viewing the production
as socially subversive with regard to race are the necessary conditions
for the opera's social visibility and historical intelligibility. The
achievement of these conditions requires invoking the dominant symbolic
order to some degree. Though <I>Four Saints</I> looked very new and
different compared to prior offerings on the American stage, its
success was due in a large part to the recognition of tropes gleaned
from the dominant culture. Thus, references to the culturally accepted
simplicity of blacks were necessary for <I>Four Saints</I> to function as
delightfully irreverent religious parody and queer camp. The disturbing
aspects of this arrangement are the "use" of black cultural identity to
twist other dominant social structures as well as the possibility that
the invocation of dominant ideology in camp practice may be "misread"
and actually reinforce the dominant order ("RDC," 11). As an amusing
example of the potential for the latter, Beatrice Wayne (St. Teresa I)
perceived Thomson's own personal camp performance as a sincere attempt to
model himself on "high society"; "With his slicked-back hair and superior
airs, puffing on a cigarette through a long-stemmed amber holder he was
'the most ridiculous picture' she had ever seen" (<I>VT,</I> 248).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As an example of the use of black social identity, Thomson's strategy
for his camp opera included placing black skin where it was not usually
expected, using the color of his cast members to "sully" the white world
of opera (<I>VT,</I> 227). The skin color of the opera singers was the
physical counterpart to Thomson's musical allusions to nursery rhymes
and church music in his score; neither was supposed to be present in
opera. <I>Four Saints</I> succeeded in challenging the elite, serious
nature of the operatic form, but to do so needed to invoke the dominant
cultural (or, white) assumption that black people do not perform opera.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's approach to language and identity in the opera's libretto
can also be linked to camp. As Albright has pointed out, Stein tends
to create a pattern of substitutions for "normal" words and sentence
structure in certain places ("ONA," 4). It is in this rearrangement
of familiar words and parts of speech that she saw her art: "There
is complete familiarity but there is no <I>proportion</I> that has
hitherto been known and it is this which makes the real scene exciting"
(<I>LA,</I> 108, emphasis added). In this line from <I>Four Saints:</I>
"Four saints have to have to have at a time," the prepositional phrase
"at a time" occurs where one would normally expect an object (<I>FS,</I>
18). A pattern of substitutions like this one cites the dominant "normal"
sentence structure we would expect, highlighting

<B></B>

Stein's choice as "abnormal," exposing the constructedness of the "normal"
and raising questions about what counts as a paragraph, sentence, or
meaningful communication in general. In the same way, the black cast
in <I>Four Saints</I> functions as a kind of citation of the "normal"
white operatic cast that fails to appear. The black operatic cast
appears "abnormal" by contrast, and in the most positive end result,
raises questions about what can qualify as legitimate opera at all.

Roach's definition of performance suggests a further theorization about
these two instances of substitution (linguistic and racial) in <I>Four
Saints,</I> "I believe that the process of trying out various candidates
in different situations--the doomed search for originals by continuously
auditioning stand-ins--is the most important of the many meanings that
users intend when they say the word performance" (<I>CD,</I> 3). Applying
this definition, Stein's language and the cast of <I>Four Saints</I>
expose the myth of the original and the correct, suggesting that words
and performers are always only provisional stand-ins. Herein lies the
potential for camp performance's power. While both refer to the dominant
symbolic order through purposeful noncompliance with it, they expose
the arbitrary nature of its dominance and its defining power. Black
performers <I>can</I> successfully sing an opera. Poetic language does
<I>not</I> depend upon adherence to the usual systems of grammar and
expression. Further, an opera <I>can</I> contain musical references to
common hymns, patriotic songs, and nursery rhymes and still be an opera
(or, alternatively, "opera" itself comes into question).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thomson found Stein's linguistic use of "stand-ins" especially freeing
when he was composing <I>Four Saints:</I> "There was no temptation toward
tonal illustration, say of birdie babbling by the brook or heavy heavy
hangs my heart" (<I>VT,</I> 90). The few instances of racialized language
in the libretto, however, do not refuse such an illustrative tendency
when combined with a black cast. St. Teresa I and St Teresa II exchange
these lines: "And make him prominent. / Could a negro be be with a beard
to see and to be. / Never have to have seen a Negro with it there and
with it so" (FS, 25). Even considering only the written text and not the
performative dimension, Stein arguably fails to defamiliarize the word
"negro." One reading of the text proposes a question about "prominent,"
"negro," "beard," "to see," and "to be." This question is answered
in the negative in the case of the Negro: "Never to have seen a Negro
with it there," inviting a reaffirmation rather than a challenge to the
never "prominent," never "seen" status of black people in society. The
addition of the performative dimension of black people singing these
words makes successful defamiliarization even less likely. No matter how
Stein plays with the language, such racially charged words are never
reducible to mere sounds. They consistently invoke the white/black
racial dichotomy. Likewise, the bodies of the <I>Four Saints</I> cast
members were never reducible to mere "neutral" bodies, nor apparently,
were they intended to be. Their obvious status as stand-ins was made
possible by the camp critique of opera and religion that the original
production of <I>Four Saints</I> effected.

Conclusion

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Four Saints</I> did not explicitly rely upon traditional white
constructions of black life that theatergoers were used to seeing in hit
plays such as <I>Green Pastures.</I> The actors did not sing in a dialect
that reflected a white author's interpretation of black speech nor did
the physical setting on the stage attempt to signify a black cultural
space. Based upon these facts alone, the 1934 production of <I>Four
Saints</I> would seem to present an opportunity for black performers
to escape an imposed cultural narrative, to start fresh in Stein's
nonrepresentational utopia, free from the preconceived identities that
often bound black artists in the 1930s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
  This opportunity unfortunately did not materialize.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As further testimony of <I>Four Saints'</I> failure to displace,
challenge, or defamiliarize racial structures that privilege whiteness,
the production has survived as no more than a footnote in histories of
black theatre in the U.S. Considering the buzz in the white press and on
the streets of New York that surrounded the opera's opening and Stein's
visit to the United States, surprisingly little reaction to the opera
appeared in the black press during the show's run. A short piece in
the Pullman Porter-distributed <I>Afro-American</I> sheds a less than
favorable light on Stein, quoting her from <I>The Autobiogra</I>phy of
Alice B. Toklas on the "nothingness" of Negroes and dwelling on the fact
that she "flunked her classes" at Johns Hopkins medical school.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
  A piece in the Harlem-based <I>Amsterdam News</I> laments the misuse
  of the talented cast for the exposition of Stein's libretto, "All of
  this seemed a waste of beautiful voices capable of higher attainments
  on a nonsensical extravaganza."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
  As testament, perhaps, to the failure of <I>Four Saints</I> to be
  relevant to the lives of African Americans, the black papers gave much
  more space and attention in the same month of February to a play called
  <I>They Shall Not Die.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This play was a black-authored version of the events of the Scottsboro
trial, a case portrayed unanimously in the black press as a racially
motivated miscarriage of justice. At the same time as the premiere
of <I>Four Saints,</I> a production of <I>They Shall Not Die</I> was
canceled by the National Theater in Washington D.C., ostensibly because
children younger than sixteen were cast members. The <I>Amsterdam News</I>
points out that <I>Green Pastures</I> played the same theater with many
young cast members. While <I>Green Pastures</I> was a nonthreatening,
fantastical representation of blackness, <I>They Shall Not Die</I> was a
narrative highlighting a real-life cause for anger among black people. A
reviewer for the <I>Amsterdam News</I> described the emotional content
of the play:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And you and every other witness of the stirring drama on Forty-fifth
street, will leave the theatre with the same feeling of choking bitterness
and seul-searing [<I>sic</I>] horror that the writer carried from the
small courtroom in Decatur in December of last year. Except that you
know that this thing has actually happened, you will be moved to mutter:
"Such things could not be. Human beings could not do this thing. This
is the twentieth century. We are civilised."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The papers speculated that the theater did not want to provide an outlet
for such a provocative and controversial show: "A play of this type
disseminating propaganda against race prejudice which resulted in the
conviction and death sentence of eight

<B></B>

youths for a criminal assault they did not commit on two white mill girls,
was not wanted on the boards of the National Theater."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
  Albright maintains that the "absolute goallessness" of the saints in
  <I>Four Saints</I> seems frightening, but apparently African Americans
  with social and political goals were even more frightening to the
  theatrical establishment in 1934 ("ONA," 9).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Judging from the space and comments allotted to the two shows in
the black press, the right to claim a self-created narrative, a new
social identity in the theater was far more important for black people
than the Stein/Thomson production with its modernist aspirations of
avoiding identity and its camp comments on religion, language, and
opera. While black theatre had yet to create an identity of its own
choosing, Stein and <I>Four Saints</I> were already dismissing the
concept's limitations. This dismissal, rather than erasing tropes of
black identity, had the unfortunate effect of perpetuating the stereotype
of black people as changeless and outside history. Bernstein remarks on
Stein's absence of identity politics, "Such a writing beyond identity
is utopian. But then only someone who has felt trapped needs to imagine
freedom" ("SI," 487). I would counter that one cannot advocate freedom
unless the advocate's historical condition is first established as
"trapped." Without a revision of the prevailing social narrative, as
was the purpose of <I>They Shall Not Die,</I> the social conditions and
rights of black people would remain lost in the smile of the minstrel
clown. White society had long taken the liberty of constructing the
identity of black people as na&iuml;ve, primitive, unchanging in their
essential "Africanness," without history, incapable of progression, and
used that identity to justify their inferior status in society. "Holding
off naming" is only possible if one possesses the power to name in the
first place.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The <I>Four Saints in Three Acts</I> of 1934 was a revolutionary
production. In many ways it was an important triumph for both theatrical
high modernism and camp expression. Most analyses of the opera are
textually based, however, lauding the poetry of Stein's nonreferential
language and the deceptively simple beauty of Thomson's musical
composition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
  Considerations specific to the identity of the work in performance,
  such as the social history of race on stage, are rarely critically
  addressed, though they contributed to the acceptance and understanding
  of the opera in the mainstream theatre. Yet the production's modernist
  and camp successes were inextricable from this social history, and these
  successes ultimately reinforced an oppressive social identity rather
  than defamiliarizing it. Kenneth Burke's wry assessment of the opera
  during its original run speculated on its meaning in a hypothetical
  cultural setting free from race and class struggle: "Perhaps it is one
  kind of light entertainment which all the world will someday care for,
  when a new day has imposed the privileges and problems of leisure upon
  all and the wealthy patrons of this bounteous performance will have
  been generously admitted into the ranks of the spectacle-loving masses."

The evidence clearly shows that the idea of casting black performers in
the opera was not Stein's. The extent of her contribution is represented
by the libretto, which she did not even divide into parts for individual
actors. Thomson consulted her on significant modifications to the
libretto (such as spelling change for St. T&eacute;r&egrave;se) and
kept her informed about significant developments in the production
process. Thomson composed the music, divided the libretto into parts for
actors, and made casting decisions. Maurice Grosser devised the scenes and
tableaux. Stein remained in Paris during the entire production process
and did not even see the opera until it opened for the third time,
in Chicago on 7 November 1934. For a detailed look at the specific
