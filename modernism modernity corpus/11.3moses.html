Nearly all theorists of drama from G. W. F. Hegel to the present assume that the advent of modernity increasingly renders classical forms of tragedy aesthetically moribund and politically irrelevant. According to this historicist view, the dramas of Aeschylus and Sophocles survive, but only as historical artifacts within the culture museum of modernity. They may inspire modern thinkers and artists, but their forms, themes, and contexts cannot be revived except as an exercise in antiquarianism. Friedrich Nietzsche and W. B. Yeats provide striking, if rare instances of the critic and dramatist who refused to accept the historicist premises underlying the modern view of Attic tragedy. Nietzsche, no less than Hegel, regards the tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles as antithetical to many of the values and institutions of European modernity, but for that very reason,

<b></b>

in his <i>The Birth of Tragedy,</i> he looks to the modern operas of Richard Wagner as both marking a genuine rebirth of the spirit of classical tragedy and heralding a revolutionary antimodern turn in the cultural history of modern Europe. Yeats, whose dramatic and critical works were influenced by Nietzsche, attempted, in no less hubristic a manner, to effect a rebirth of premodern, ritualized, and aristocratic tragedy within the apparently uncongenial confines of contemportary Irish politics. What Yeats found so attractive in Nietzsche was a shared hostility, even repugnance, to what both men considered the defining features of European modernity, and a common conviction that the forces of modernization might be resisted by bringing about a cultural rebirth of the spirit of ancient tragic drama. Yeats's drama and theatre criticism thus represent a sustained effort, a l&#x000E1; Nietzsche, to resist the notion that aristocratic tragedy and ritual theater are historically irrecoverable. 
</p>

<p>
Yeats saw his efforts to assist in the rebirth of ancient tragedy as an essential part of a militant cultural and political program to free modern Ireland from imperial British rule. Yeats's literary midwifery aimed to establish a free and independent Irish nation that would offer a counterweight to the forces of (English or British imperial) modernity. Though nationalism itself might be said to be a distinctively modern ideology, Yeats hoped to cultivate an independent Irish nation on nominally premodern or non-modern grounds. As the twentieth century wore on, however, Yeats grew increasingly disenchanted with the actual Irish Free State that emerged after 1921 and with the forms of Irish nationalism that predominated in the 1920s and 1930s. Oddly, his disappointment did not lead him to abandon, but rather to intensify his efforts to promote an "anachronistic" form of dramatic tragedy, which he imagined would serve as a kind of cultural counterweight to the increasingly modernizing Irish nation-state that came into existence after formal independence. Yeats's continuing efforts to create a ritualistic, heroic, cultic, and antidemocratic form of dramatic tragedy from 1916 onwards represented his vigorous attempt to cultivate an "alternative" form of Irish modernity that was as much at odds with the British imperialism (and English culture) as it was with the predominant and increasingly official strains of modern Irish nationalism of the 1920s and 1930s.
</p>

<p>
As a founding member of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1899, and later a leading dramatist, co-director, manager, and polemicist for the Irish National Theatre Society (founded in 1902 and better known after 1904 as the Abbey Theatre), Yeats looked to an "ancient" form of tragic verse drama to play a leading, even decisive role in revivifying and remaking Irish national culture at a time when prospects for Irish Home Rule, to say nothing of Irish national independence, were bleak. But despite his dominant position in the Abbey Theatre in its early years, Yeats ultimately found that his own heroic verse tragedies were exceptional, rather than typical of the dramatic works favored by the National Theatre Society. In 1937, reflecting back on his early career as a dramatist for the Abbey, Yeats lamented, somewhat disingenuously: "my audience was for comedy&#x02014;for Synge, Lady Gregory, for O'Casey&#x02014;not for me. I was content, for I knew that comedy was the modern art."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  His disappointment with the direction of the Abbey had led him in 1910 to limit his direct involvement in its daily management.

<b></b>

From 1910 until the mid-1920s, Yeats largely abandoned the Abbey as the primary venue for his dramatic works. Turning to coterie or private theatre (often staged outside of Ireland), Yeats invented a distinctively avant-garde form of tragic drama that reflected his deepening discomfort with the direction of Irish political nationalism in particular, and (from 1922 onward) with the institutions of the Irish Free State in general.
</p>

<p>
If Yeats was ultimately unsuccessful in shaping the Irish national theater, to say nothing of the Irish Free State, according to his own Nietzschean vision, his attempt to found a new national culture on the basis of a tragic re-presentation of heroic Irish legends and myths nevertheless provides a revealing instance of how a modernist experiment in reviving the anachronistic forms of aristocratic tragedy could be intimately related to the twentieth-century political projects of anti-imperial struggle and state formation. Yeats's decades-long career as a vociferous exponent of a "conservative" nationalist cultural ideal (the term will prove less and less satisfactory in the course of this essay), gave birth not only to a radically avant-garde form of dramatic practice, but also to a surprisingly progressive and forward-looking cultural critique of the political dangers and cultural deformations of modern nationalism. Exemplifying many of the characteristic features of what Terry Eagleton has termed the "archaic avant-garde," Yeats's explicit rejection of dramatic realism, democratic aesthetics, and the tastes of the contemporary commercial theater, his seemingly vain endeavor to recuperate moribund forms of ritual theatre and aristocratic political tragedy, made possible not only many of the most celebrated examples of modern Irish drama, but also a series of prescient cultural interventions that resonate in unexpected ways with the most advanced postcolonial critiques of the nation-state.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

Yeats's indebtedness to Nietzsche is well documented and widely acknowledged. As Roy Foster has noted, Yeats would have been introduced to Nietzsche's thought at least as early as 1896 through the reviews and essays of Havelock Ellis and Arthur Symons.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Symons's essay, "Nietzsche and Tragedy," provided Yeats with a sympathetic review and synoptic description of the main lines of argument of <i>The Birth of Tragedy.</i> Here Yeats would have encountered for the first time Nietzsche's theses that Attic tragedy grew out of the Dionysian religious festivals, music, and ecstatic rituals of pagan Greece, that the flourishing of Greek tragedy depended on a productive if unsustainable opposition between the Apollinian and Dionysian forces in ancient Greek culture, that Greek tragedy had been undermined by the rationalism of Socrates and the dramatic realism of Euripides (both harbingers of modernity), and that the spirit of tragedy had been reborn in Wagnerian opera.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Even if he did not encounter Nietzsche's work directly (which seems unlikely) and merely relied upon a secondhand knowledge of Nietzsche's writings on classical Greek drama, Yeats's early critical reflections on theater, tragedy, myth, ritual, and the revival of Irish culture are nonetheless deeply indebted to <i>The Birth of Tragedy.</i> In his essay of 1900, "The Theatre," 

<b></b>

Yeats maintains that drama "began in ritual, and it cannot come to its greatness again without recalling words to their ancient sovereignty" (<i>EI,</i> 170). Yeats opposes the <i>modern</i> "theatre of commerce" to the "remote, spiritual, and ideal" "poetic drama" that he hopes will be staged by the newly founded Irish Literary Theatre (a forerunner of the Irish National Theatre Society) (<i>EI,</i> 166). For Yeats, Irish cultural conditions are particularly favorable for the revival of ritual theatre insofar as the audiences of Sophocles most nearly resemble those Irish country folk who eagerly listen "in Irish cabins to songs in Gaelic" "or to some tale of Oisin and his three hundred years in Tir n&#x000E1; nOg" (<i>EI,</i> 167). Yeats argues that a folk revival might be modeled on the cultural achievements of those urbane priests of the ancient world who transferred primitive pagan rites performed in a natural setting to "the hidden places of temples" in the city (<i>EI,</i> 168). For Yeats, it is only through ritualized drama that the natural emotions of pre-urbanized (and premodern) country people can once more be set free in the contemporary theater. 
</p>

<p>
In "Ireland and the Arts" , Yeats argues that the modern arts have failed. As the arts in ancient times were "almost inseparable from religion," those Irish artists who would revive them in the present age must conceive of themselves as a "priesthood of an almost forgotten faith" (<i>EI,</i> 203-4). There are two passions on which this new priesthood can found a religio-aesthetic renaissance: "love of the Unseen Life and love of country" (<i>EI,</i> 204). For Yeats the return of the Irish spirit entails a self-conscious recovery of the Celtic myths and heroic stories of Ireland such as those of Cuchulain, a recuperation not unlike that of Nordic myths in Wagnerian opera that Nietzsche praises as "a return to itself of the German spirit."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  If Bayreuth provides modern precedent for an Irish cultural revival, Yeats also looks back to classical Greece for inspiration. Contemporary political conditions in Ireland (such as imperial English rule) will only intensify the Irish "love of country," a passion shared by the ancient Greeks. Yeats's ambitions are at once revolutionary and retrograde, populist and antimodern: "I would have Ireland re-create the ancient arts, the arts as they were understood in Judaea, in India, in Scandinavia, in Greece and Rome, in every ancient land; as they were understood when they moved a whole people and not a few people who have grown up in a leisure class and made this understanding their business."(<i>EI,</i> 206). Suggestively, the ancient arts flourished in a number of countries&#x02014;Ireland, Judaea, and India&#x02014;currently under British imperial control.
</p>

<p>
It is an 1897 essay, "The Celtic Element in Literature," in which he expressly praises Wagner and the composer's use of the ancient myths of Scandinavia, that Yeats seems closest to the Nietzsche of <i>The Birth of Tragedy.</i> Yeats enthusiastically describes those ancient worshippers of nature whose "supreme ritual" was a "tumultuous dance among the hills or in the depths of the woods, where unearthly ecstasy fell upon the dancers, until they seemed the gods or the godlike beasts;" it is in these ecstatic rituals that the frenzied worshippers came "nearer to ancient chaos" (<i>EI,</i> 178). Whereas ancient peoples delighted in tales and myths that ended "in death," their modern counterparts respond to "tales that end in marriage bells" (<i>EI,</i> 182). Primitive rituals and ancient rites 

<b></b>

encouraged a popular love of tragedy, while modernity encourages only an all too common taste for comedy and domestic concord. It is therefore no accident that "all the august sorrowful persons of literature, Cassandra and Helen and Deirdre, and Lear and Tristan, have come out of legends and are indeed but the images of the primitive imagination" (<i>EI,</i> 182). Yeats thus looks to the popular Gaelic poetry of his day (a surviving legacy of ancient Ireland) and to the "fountain of Gaelic legends," those concerning Deirdre, Cuchulain, Emer, Grania and Diarmuid, and Oisin, to provide the "vivifying spirit" "of excess" that will make the arts and imagination of Ireland blossom once more (<i>EI,</i> 185-7). Yeats insists that Ireland's Celtic myths and Gaelic legends have a regenerative power not only for modern Anglo-Irish literature, but also for the whole of modern European literature. A return to ancient myth and ritual is the predictable "reaction against the rationalism of the eighteenth century," and "the materialism of the nineteenth century" (<i>EI,</i> 187).
</p>

<p>
Yeats's serious commitment to an Irish national theater and to tragic verse drama, which began with the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1899, and his composition of a series of critical polemics in favor of a return to ancient ritual, myth, legend, religion, and magic thus coincided with and was inspired by his introduction to Nietzsche's theory of tragedy. Both in his dramatic works and in his cultural criticism Yeats called for a simultaneous repudiation of modernity (which he understood to be characterized by rationalism, materialism, commercialism, science, mechanical philosophy, liberalism, secularism, and the rise of the middle class), and a rejection of British imperial rule (which was the engine by which modernity had reached Ireland). In the early days of the Abbey Theatre, Yeats took particular satisfaction in the fact that the anachronistic laws that required the theater to hold a patent granted by the English Parliament paradoxically freed it from <i>de jure</i> political censorship to which English theaters were subject: "we are better off so far as the law is concerned than we would be in England. . . . In England there is a Censor, who forbids you to take a subject from the Bible or from politics, or to picture public characters or certain moral situations which are the foundation of some of the greatest plays of the world . . . <i>Oedipus the King</i> is forbidden in London."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Yeats's polemic res Ireland as the potential home of ancient freedoms and classical tragedy as against the restrictive modern, conformist, puritanical, utilitarian, and middle-class commercial tastes of Edwardian England. Indeed, as early as 1904, and again in 1909, Yeats hoped to stage <i>Oedipus the King</i> at the Abbey as a political protest against British imperial authority.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Yeats envisioned a newly independent Irish nation that might constitute a radical political alternative to British modernity. Despite his current reputation as a mere "cultural reactionary," Yeats nonetheless also oddly anticipates those postcolonial intellectuals and artists who defend the rights of minority cultures against the homogenizing threat of economic globalization and cultural imperialism. In his hands the rebirth of tragedy promised to be at once a radically retrograde <i>and</i> a revolutionary nationalist cultural phenomenon.

The 1904 premiere of <i>On Baile's Strand,</i> which, along with Synge's <i>Riders to the Sea</i> and Lady Gregory's <i>Spreading the News,</i> inaugurated the Abbey Theatre as the new home of the Irish National Theatre Society, represents Yeats's first major realization of the theatrical project he advocated in 1901: getting "our [the Irish] Heroic Age into verse" (<i>E,</i> 78). The first of five verse dramas Yeats devoted to Cuchulain, the hero of the Ulster or Red Branch cycle of Irish poetic sagas, <i>On Baile's Strand</i> met with considerable public and critical acclaim. Not long after its premiere, Yeats wrote triumphantly in <i>Samhain,</i> the journal of the Irish National Theatre Society, "Ireland in our day has rediscovered the old heroic literature of Ireland, and she has rediscovered the imagination of the folk" (<i>E,</i> 183). In 1906, the same year that he significantly revised <i>On Baile's Strand</i> for a new Abbey production, Yeats contrasts the common literary culture of the premodern past when the arts "belonged to a whole people," with that of the modern era (<i>E,</i> 209). Implicit in Yeats's polemic is his questionable assumption that whereas predominantly oral premodern European cultures had been characterized by an organic social and artistic unity, and were accessible to the poor and the rich, the peasantry and the nobility alike, modern mass culture is increasingly fissured and vertically stratified. In Yeats's view, an isolated intellectual aristocracy, a leisured class, has in contemporary Europe, and especially in imperial Britain, cut itself off from the world of the folk. This stratification of tastes is an unfortunate development akin to that which Nietzsche criticized in Euripidean drama and late Hellenic culture as inimical to the tragic spirit of the earlier dramas of Aeschylus and Sophocles: it is due to the distancing of an increasingly hypertrophied and intellectualized audience from the folk beliefs, primitive passions, and religious ceremonies that gave birth to Attic tragedy. Yeats lays the blame for this accelerating cultural disunity on the engines of modernity: new technologies, such as the printing press, and the spirit of commerce&#x02014;the dubious cultural "benefits" of imperial English rule (<i>E,</i> 203-9).
</p>

<p>
<i>On Baile's Strand</i> is Yeats's attempt to bridge the cultural divide that threatens contemporary Irish culture a result of the deleterious influence of <i>modern</i> English culture on native Irish traditions. A drama featuring chanted or "sung" dialogue and music, <i>On Baile's Strand</i> is a heroic tragedy written for the people, a play meant to recuperate for a contemporary Irish audience the lost unity of a nearly extinct Gaelic oral culture. And yet, as Yeats would have acknowledged, there is no simple turning back, no unmediated return to the heroic world of the Irish legends or to the oral culture of ancient Ireland before the coming of the English. Yeats's careful revisions of a printed and published text, his need for a modern Irish theatrical venue in Dublin, his reliance on sophisticated financial arrangements and licensing agreements to bring the Abbey Theatre into existence, even his dependence on the <i>English</i> language, as opposed to the Gaelic or "Irish" tongue as the basis of his dramatic art, all mark his first major heroic verse tragedy as ineluctably a product of modern material culture. Though ostensibly set during the "Irish Heroic Age" (the pre-Christian, Celtic epoch, traditionally held to correspond chronologically with the beginning of the Christian 

<b></b>

era outside of Ireland), the play enacts a tragic historical conflict between, on the one hand, an archaic and anarchic, premodern and "stateless" phase of Irish culture and, on the other, an increasingly centralized, regulated, and routinized form of political life, one that foreshadows the unappealing features of modernity in general, and the British imperium and the modern Irish nation-state in particular.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by Lady Gregory's famous English prose translation (or more properly redaction and free adaptation) of the Ulster cycle, <i>Cuchulain of Muirthemne</i> , <i>On Baile's Strand</i> dramatizes a political struggle between Conchubar, King of Uladh, and Cuchulain, King of Muirthemne. The dramatic action initially turns on Cuchulain's reluctance to swear an oath to Conchubar, who claims the title of High King of Ireland for himself and his heirs. Cuchulain argues for a radical untrammeled form of personal freedom, one untempered by the rule of law and intrusive administrative oversight of a High King: "I'll not be bound / I'll dance or hunt, or quarrel or make love, / Wherever and whenever I've a mind to" (ll. 177-9).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  By contrast, Conchubar argues for the values of political unity, stability, and order, for peace and security: "I would leave / A strong and settled country to my children" (ll. 181-2). Cuchulain dismisses Conchubar's political vision of a centralized, safe, and domesticated Ireland in scathing terms: 
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
And I must be obedient in all things;
<br />
Give up my will to yours; go where you please;
<br />
Come when you call; sit at the council-board
<br />

<br />
I whose mere name has kept this country safe, . . .
<br />

<br />
Had pulled you from it, swear obedience
<br />
As if I were some cattle-raising king?

<p class="noIndent">
By contrast with the epic hero, whose romantic yearnings and lyrical celebration of individual liberty more nearly reflect Yeats's own artistic sensibility, Conchubar seems singularly prosaic and tediously legalistic. Nonetheless, Yeats endows the High King with sufficient rhetorical power to call to mind the rare worth of hard-fought Irish political unity, of the political benefits of binding all subjects to the rule of law, and above all, of the profound responsibilities incumbent on those would-be founders of a nation who would merit the gratitude of future generations in a free and independent Ireland. In proper Hegelian fashion, the play dramatizes a conflict between two ethically defensible, if politically incompatible, alternatives.
</p>

<p>
If we were tempted to see in Cuchulain simply the carefree spirit of the artist as against the doleful responsibilities of political life, it would be well to recall that Yeats told Joseph Holloway in April of 1905 that "he had Charles Stewart Parnell in his mind when he wrote <i>On Baile's Strand.</i>"<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Cuchulain must not be reduced to a merely "aesthetic" antagonist of Conchubar's prosaic version of political duty. Whatever his affinities for the ethos of "decadent" aestheticism, he is no less a political hero who emblematizes

<b></b>

an increasingly outmoded form of social life, one incompatible with the new administrative centralization championed by the High King. When Cuchulain describes a state of affairs in which he would be reduced to just another flabby councilman and "cattle-raising" king in the boardrooms of Emain Macha (the site of Conchubar's court), he prophetically foreshadows the sort of Ireland promised to its people by progressive English liberals such as Gladstone, (or later by de Valera): a country of domesticated middle-class merchants, shopkeepers, strong farmers, and law-abiding (and docile) citizens who looked unfavorably upon the amorous libertinism, social hauteur, and individual liberties characteristic of a Parnell (or a Cuchulain); a nation of respectable patriots who would happily put behind them the violent heroic struggle required to make Ireland an independent domain.
</p>

<p>
Cuchulain's tragic fate in <i>On Baile's Strand</i> follows as a direct consequence of his decision to accede to the demands of Conchubar and to swear an oath of allegiance to the High King. While an oath to a monarch might seem a quaint and highly artificial plot device drawn from the mists of Irish antiquity, the matter would have resonated for Yeats's "Edwardian" audience. In 1906 (the year in which Yeats revised <i>On Baile's Strand</i>) all Irish subjects were still bound by their allegiance to an English king (a matter of intense debate and a contributing cause of civil strife after 1921 because the citizens of the Irish Free State had to swear an oath to the British crown under the terms of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty); even radical Irish nationalists, such as Arthur Griffith, journalist, cofounder of the <i>Sinn F&#x000E9;in</i> party, and vocal critic of many of the Abbey Theatre's dramatic productions, had argued for a dual <i>monarchy</i> for Ireland, thereby lending a contemporary political significance to the matter of an oath of allegiance.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  In any event, it is the exclusive and exacting terms of his oath to Conchubar that prove to be Cuchulain's undoing. Shortly after Cuchulain pledges his allegiance to the High King, he encounters an impetuous young warrior from Alba (Scotland) who has killed an Irish soldier guarding the coast against foreign intruders, and who challenges Cuchulain to ritual combat. Cuchulain demurs because he intuits that the young man is his own (illegitimate) son by Aoife, Queen of Alba. Conchubar insists that Cuchulain's oath binds him to t on the High King's behalf, against all enemies, both domestic and foreign. Despite Cuchulain's initial defiance of the King and his desire to befriend the young man, Conchubar ultimately persuades the hero that he has been bewitched, and prevails upon him to honor his oath. In a frenzy, Cuchulain slays the young man, only to discover, too late, that he has killed his only son and potential heir. Overcome with grief and incipient madness, Cuchulain seeks revenge on Conchubar, but succeeds only in rushing madly into the sea, where he vainly does battle with the waves until he is mastered by their violence.
</p>

<p>
In its day, <i>On Baile's Strand</i> was hailed as a modern tragic masterpiece of the new Irish National Theatre. Irish patriots such as Padraic Pearse, a poet and friend of Yeats, who would ultimately distinguish himself during the 1916 Easter Rebellion as commander in chief of the Irish Volunteers and president of the Provisional Irish Republic, adopted Cuchulain as a heroic symbol of Irish national identity. And yet, <i>On Baile's Strand,</i> despite its celebration of Cuchulain as the heroic symbol of an emergent Irish 

<b></b>

national identity, suggests that modern political independence will be achieved only at the cost of what is most inspiring and admirable in the "ancient" Irish character. Cuchulain's tragedy is that he must sacrifice what is most noble in himself, his aristocratic autonomy, for the sake of a homogenized national collective. In Nietzschean terms, the Apollinian hero and representative of the emergent "state" must be sacrificed to the Dionysian forces, here represented by Cuchulain's madness and by the waves themselves, which in Irish mythology, represent the divine and destructive powers of the sea god, Manann&#x000E1;n, and his daughter, Fand of the Sidhe.
</p>

<p>
There is tragic irony in the fact that Conchubar exaggerates the immediate threat to his realm from Aoife and Alba. By virtue of his libertinism and his ethos of individual freedom and aristocratic liberty, Cuchulain has established a material (and biological) basis for union with a foreign race. Cuchulain would forge an alliance with his illegitimate son, one based on personal preference, class affiliation (he is impressed by the young man's aristocratic bearing and noble speech), consanguinity, and a common disregard for the law, sovereign political authority, the geographic limits of "nations," and matters of state. Cuchulain represents an alternative form of Irish independence and of Irish culture that comes into tragic conflict with Conchubar's more modern, practical, and restrictive form of national identity: an archaic, aristocratic, and cosmopolitan conception of community. Moreover, Conchubar's political <i>conservatism</i> ironically serves only to subvert the order of his "government." He risks civil strife with one of his strongest and most loyal supporters, while fomenting a needless and bloody conflict between his newly unified kingdom (Ireland) and a foreign power (Alba), a nation with which his own people have occasionally enjoyed friendly and even intimate relations.
</p>

<p>
Alba&#x02014;Scotland&#x02014;was the land from which came many of those Anglo-Irish Protestant families who forcibly settled Ulster during the plantations of the seventeenth century. In Yeats's day, Scotland was regarded as a center of Protestant (and unionist) political sentiment. In terms of his divided personal and political allegiances, Yeats's Cuchulain is rather like his creator, who despite his impressive credentials as an Irish nationalist (he was a one time member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a Fenian organization devoted to attaining political independence through physical force) nevertheless spent much of his life happily living and working in imperial England. More generally, Cuchulain resembles those Anglo-Irish Protestants (Bram Stoker, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, Lady Gregory, John Millington Synge, and Yeats), whose cultural, personal, and even political connections with a land ruled by another queen, Victoria, were frequently at odds with their support of greater political autonomy for Ireland. 
</p>

<p>
If Yeats relished the opportunity to defy British imperial authority, he was also concerned with the censoriousness of certain Irish nationalist and Roman Catholic intellectuals who yearned to exercise unofficial authority over the productions of the Irish National Theatre. The Anglophobic jeremiads of D. P. Moran, a leading journalist, author of <i>The Philosophy of Irish Ireland,</i> and outspoken advocate of a Gaelic (speaking) and Roman Catholic Irish nation, or the political chauvinism and economic protectionism

<b></b>

of Arthur Griffith and <i>Sinn F&#x000E9;in</i> (meaning "Ourselves Alone"), were notable instances of the competing exclusionary nationalist movements against which Yeats inveighed. In his 1903 essay, "An Irish National Theatre," Yeats argued strenuously against any form of nationalist or religious ideology that would restrict the artistic liberty of the Abbey Theatre. In language that might have been applied to the heroic ethos of Cuchulain in <i>On Baile's Strand,</i> Yeats maintains that (dramatic) literature "must take the responsibility of its power, and keep all its freedom"(<i>E,</i> 117). He defends the commitment of the Irish National Theatre to produce "foreign masterpieces" at the Abbey and the right of its dramatists to derive inspiration from foreign models, as against those who would restrict its fare to works of purely Irish origin and subject matter (<i>E,</i> 122).
</p>

<p>
The ultimate triumph of Yeats's <i>On Baile's Strand</i> depends on the paradoxical fact that Cuchulain epitomizes a heroic conception of the Irish national character by tragically resisting the political and cultural norms of the High King of Ireland and his court, rather than happily conforming to them. Cuchulain's insistence on personal liberty, his aristocratic disdain for mere security and stability, his singular attachment to the "non-political" activities of love, music, song, and dance, and, above all, his cosmopolitan, as opposed to an exclusionary and xenophobic, conception of patriotism and nationhood, all denote him as the exceptional Irish hero par excellence. And it is precisely this exceptional character that necessitates his tragic fate. Yeats's play thus dramatizes the tragic tension between the Apollinian and Dionysian elements present in Irish culture: the spirit of the nation as the exceptional political individual, the aristocratic patriot and rebel (Cuchulain or Parnell) versus the spirit of the nation as a transindividual collective of average Irishmen, of ordinary (middle-class) subjects who require the periodic sacrifice of the individual hero and political martyr to insure their security.
</p>

<p>
In the wake of the riots ignited by the premiere of Synge's <i>Playboy of the Western World</i> at the Abbey in1907 (Moran and other nationalist intellectuals criticized the play for its alleged obscenity, its lack of patriotism, its inaccurate, irreligious, and demeaning portrait of the Irish people), Yeats defended the nationalist credentials of the Irish National Theatre Society. He noted (with some satisfaction) that nationalists and unionists alike had attacked the Abbey. But his most energetic polemic consisted in defining the artist as a heroic re who finds himself tragically in conflict with his own people, his own nation. Yeats insisted that the truly extraordinary and representative artist defines the national character of his people in the face of popular animosity and public controversy (<i>E,</i> 237-9). Yeats's version of the Nietzschean culture-hero bears a striking resemblance to his Cuchulain of <i>On Baile's Strand.</i> Both the greatest artist and greatest epic hero of the Irish nation are inevitably (if only temporarily) the enemies of the people; their greatest success consists in their tragic struggle to define the nation against the popular will, to impose a form upon the nation's identity. For Yeats, the tragic conflict, at once Hegelian and Nietzschean, between hero and people ennobles and destroys the singular individual who ultimately gives shape to the national character; this tragic agon threatens to subvert even as it saves the community, which requires the sacrifice of the hero that paradoxically defines the nation's identity.

In April of 1916, a mere three weeks after T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound attended the premiere in the drawing room of Lady Cunard's London home of Yeats's <i>At the Hawk's Well,</i> a play inspired by Japanese Noh drama featuring Cuchulain, Padraic Pearse stood before the General Post Office in Dublin where he read aloud the Proclamation of the Irish Republic to the Irish people. That Yeats should have achieved a formal and generic breakthrough in the modern English-language theater at almost the exact moment as his friend and fellow poet, Pearse, played a leading role in mounting the Easter 1916 rising, invites an investigation into the relationship between Yeatsian avant-garde drama and the anticolonial struggle in Ireland.
</p>

<p>
Whereas, the brilliance of Yeats's poetry after 1914 does not chiefly depend upon its formal innovation and technical innovation, Yeats's dramas of the same period are radically experimental works that struck even Beckett as revolutionary. In his first series of so-called "dance plays," which includes <i>At the Hawk's Well</i> , <i>The Dreaming of the Bones</i> , and <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> , Yeats employed masks for some actors, highly stylized face makeup for others (so that their faces might resemble masks); minimalist and often discordant music (often relying upon only drum, gong, flute, and zither); a virtually empty stage with abstract or symbolic non-naturalistic props; the absence of a curtain to mark scene changes; nonspeaking parts for dancers; compact and economical physical gestures, as well as dance movements mimicking those of "marionettes" or Bunraku puppets; and highly stylized rhymed and blank-verse spoken, sung, or chanted as the scene demanded. Yeats's collaborations with an impressive array of contemporary artists enhanced the high modernist texture of these plays. Among those who made particularly notable contributions to their staging over two decades were the Japanese actor, Michio Ito, who was trained in Noh drama, Ninette de Valois, who described her choreography as a form of "abstract expressionism," the Dutch sculptor Hildo van Krop, who provided a famous set of full-head masks for the players, George Antheil, who composed music that Yeats praised as "heroic and barbaric and strange," and Edmund Dulac, who designed masks, costumes, and wrote the musical score for the first private performance of <i>At the Hawk's Well.</i><sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Significantly, Yeats's turn to high modernist theatrical experimentation did not signal his abandonment of tragedy, nor of the Celtic myths, nationalist histories, and folk materials that had characterized his earlier plays for the Irish National Theatre. <i>At the Hawk's Well</i> and <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> are the third and fourth of Yeats's five plays to make use of the Ulster cycle, and both feature Cuchulain as their protagonist. But if Yeats once again relies on Irish mythic and legendary materials, his avant-garde dance plays signal a new and decisive development in his conception of tragic theater and its cultural and political function. Explicitly cultivating a small private coterie audience, Yeats reconceives of the theatre as occupying a ritual space that is sometimes inside, sometimes outside the body politic, but in any case one that no longer conforms to the "traditional" dimensions of an Irish <i>national</i> theatre. Yeats intended his 

<b></b>

avant-garde theater to be the center of an aristocratic religio-aesthetic cult; its intricate ceremonies and refined theatrical mysteries will enact a tragic spectacle, but at a critical remove from the public space of an emergent Irish nation. Rather than <i>directly</i> provide the ritual basis of a revivified Irish culture, this new dramatic cult will maintain a more mediated, distanced, if still significant symbolic relationship with the emergent "postcolonial" nation-state. Yeats's theatrical cult will project an alternative vision of community, one knowingly at odds with the actual "state" of the Irish nation and with modernity more generally. Yeats thus seems to embrace that very thing, the mystery cult, which Nietzsche had argued both preceded and followed (in a late decadent form) the historical apex of Attic tragedy.
</p>

<p>
In April of 1916, in one of his most famous essays of drama criticism, "Certain Noble Plays of Japan," Yeats described his revolutionary conception for a new form of drama: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I am writing with my imagination stirred by a visit to the studio of Mr. Dulac . . . I saw there the mask and head-dress to be worn in a play of mine by the player who will speak the part of Cuchulain, and who, wearing this noble, half-Greek, half-Asiatic face, will appear perhaps like an image seen in reverie by some Orphic worshipper . . . I have written a little play [<i>The Hawk's Well</i>] that can be played in a room for so little money that forty or fifty readers of poetry can pay the price. There will be no scenery, for three musicians, whose seeming sunburned faces will, I hope, suggest that they have wandered from village to village in some country of our dreams, can describe place and weather, and at moments action and accompany it all by drum and gong or flute and dulcimer. Instead of the players working themselves into a violence of passion indecorous in our sitting-room, the music, the beauty of form and voice all come to climax in pantomimic dance.
<p class="blockquote">
In fact, with the help of Japanese plays 'translated by Ernest Fenollosa and finished by Ezra Pound,' I have invented a form of drama, distinguished, indirect, and symbolic, and having no need of mob or Press to pay its way&#x02014;an aristocratic form. When this play and its performance run as smoothly as my skill can make them, I shall hope to write another of the same sort and so complete a dramatic celebration of the life of Cuchulain planned long ago.

<p>
This passage suggests both continuities and divergences in Yeats's long-contemplated cycle of Cuchulain plays. Yeats has apparently abandoned the very notion of a public national theater. For what could be less in keeping with his previous goals for the Irish National Theatre than a private performance before a cosmopolitan group of international artists and well-to-do patrons of the arts staged in the drawing room of a wealthy English aristocrat? Even in the early years of the Irish Literary Theatre, Yeats had defined the dramatic art of a new priestly caste <i>in contradistinction</i> to what he derisively referred to as "the orthodoxy of the commercial theater" unfortunately imported into Ireland from its financial and political overlord, England (<i>E,</i> 101; 81). But even as he opposed commercial middle-class Victorian tastes, Yeats championed a "People's Theatre" for Ireland (<i>E,</i> 244). In his early articles for the National Theatre Society, Yeats specifically warned against "plays about drawing-rooms and written for 

<b></b>

the middle-classes of great cities, for the classes who live in drawing rooms;" moreover, he insisted on the "imitation of nothing English" (<i>E,</i> 97). However, by 1919, Yeats felt that his early hopes for a national theater had met with "discouragement and a defeat;" the People's Theatre that he, Lady Gregory, and Synge had envisioned had proved ineffectual (<i>E,</i> 250-3). Their attempts to meld Irish folklife with heroic nationalist feeling had failed; "the modern world" had proved "more powerful than any propaganda" (<i>E,</i> 253). To be sure, Yeats's characterization of this failure is self-serving, and in the wake of the 1907 Abbey riots over <i>The Playboy of the Western World,</i> freighted with his increasingly intense antidemocratic convictions. More particularly, his (as it proved, temporary) abandonment of the Irish National Theatre, suggests that his own distinctive brand of nationalism had failed to carry the day against its more popular Irish competitors, versions of Irish nationalism with deeper roots in the actual modern Irish Catholic populace, as opposed to the ancient "folk" Yeats had imagined. 
</p>

<p>
Having failed to shape the Irish people according to his own heroic and nationalistic ideals, Yeats predictably turned his back on the very notion of a popular theatre: "I want to create for myself an unpopular theatre and an audience like a secret society where admission is by favor and never to many" (<i>E,</i> 254). Yeats blames the degraded popular tastes of Ireland on England's colonization and subsequent democratization of his native country: "Ireland has suffered more than England from democracy, for since the Wild Geese fled who might have grown to be leaders in manner and in taste, she has had but political leaders. . . . I seek, not a theatre but the theatre's anti-self."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Yeats's notion of the "theatre's anti-self" was the recuperation of a ritualized "aristocratic" form of drama that was at once <i>premodern</i> and <i>non-Western.</i> It may surprise us that the outlines of an avant-garde cultural project aimed at resisting the encroachments of modernity, counterbalancing a strong bias in favor of Western cultural values, transgressing the artistic and cultural tastes of the bourgeoisie, challenging the religious prejudices of a pious middle class, subverting a commercial and capitalist ethos, and envisioned by an artist with impressive anti-imperialist credentials should take such a politically disturbing and antiprogressive form. But such is the nature of Yeats's revolutionary conception of drama.
</p>

<p>
In "Certain Noble Plays of Japan" Yeats provides a counter-imaginary to the popular theater of Ireland prior to the Easter Rebellion: "Noh was made a necessary part of official ceremonies at [the Shogun's court] at Kioto, and young nobles and princes, forbidden to attend the popular theatre, in Japan as elsewhere a place of mimicry and naturalism, were encouraged to witness and perform in spectacles where speech, music, song, and dance created an image of nobility and strange beauty" (<i>EI,</i> 229). Not withstanding Yeats's preference for an antipopular, nonrealistic, aristocratic dramatic form, his yearning for an aesthetic rootedness in folkways abides. The "god, goddess, or ghost" that often appears at a crucial juncture in Noh drama reminds Yeats "at times of our own Irish legends and beliefs, which, once it may be, differed little from those of the Shinto worshipper. . . These Japanese poets, too, feel for tomb and wood the emotion, the sense of awe that our own Gaelic-speaking country people will sometimes show when you speak to them of Castle Hackett or some holy well" (<i>EI,</i> 232). And 

<b></b>

despite its formal derivation from the exotic dramatic traditions of Tokugawa Japan and the necessity of first staging it in the alien environment of a London drawing room, his new form of ritual theatre, Yeats hopes, might yet be naturalized in the Irish landscape at some future date: "For some weeks now I have been elaborating my play in London where alone I can find the help I need . . . yet it pleases me to think that I am working for my own country. Perhaps some day a play in the form I am adapting for European purposes may excite once more, whether in Gaelic or in English, under the slope of Slieve-na-mon or Croagh Patrick, ancient memories" (<i>EI,</i> 236).
</p>

<p>
In his quest for a ritual theatre at home in the Irish natural landscape, one that might serve his country, Yeats reinvents a form of drama in which the distinctions among political, aesthetic, and religious practices are collapsed in ceremonies of the elite court or the mystery cult. Yeats remarks, with evident enthusiasm, "these [Noh] plays arose in an age of continual war and became a part of the education of soldiers. These soldiers, whose natures had as much of Walter Pater as of Achilles, combined with Buddhist priests and women to elaborate life in a ceremony, the playing of football, the drinking of tea, and all great events of State, becoming a ritual" (<i>EI,</i> 235). The convergence of Irish folk beliefs and Shinto religious rituals is significant for Yeats, not least because Celtic and Shinto religious traditions are premodern and non-Christian. A theatre based on non-Christian rituals and premodern (pre-Reformation) ceremonies would, at least theoretically, be free from the sectarian religious rancor between Irish Catholics and Anglo-Irish Protestants that plagued the Irish National Theatre Society; a dramatic movement founded by an elite group of Anglo-Irish Protestants for a national citizenry that was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. But if Yeats fancied that his revitalized and Celticized Noh theatre might suppress certain forms of Hibernian sectarian conflict, the plays he wrote for this new cultic theatre were, no less than those he had written for the Abbey, rooted in a fundamentally tragic conception of Irish political history.

By the beginning of April 1916, when Yeats undertook his first crucial steps in his avant-garde theatrical revolution, his interest in <i>political</i> drama seemed on the wane. However, the events of Easter week changed utterly his artistic ambitions, and once more imparted to his subsequent dance plays the urgency and power of political tragedy. Yeats was taken aback by the fact that he, an avowedly nationalist Irish poet, had been in England enjoying the comforts of Sir William Rothenstein's Gloucestershire estate while his fellow Irish poets (Pearse and Thomas MacDonagh) had sacrificed their lives as leaders of the Rising in Dublin.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  It was in his third attempt at the avant-garde form of the tragic "dance play," <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer,</i> that Yeats found his most stage-worthy vehicle for representing, however indirectly and allegorically, the changed political conditions of revolutionary Ireland. Written at the end of 1917 and the beginning of 1918 (for private production), first published in 1919, originally performed in a public theater in Amsterdam in 1922, subsequently produced at the Abbey 

<b></b>

in 1926, and later revived there in 1929 under Yeats's supervision in a substantially revised prose version, <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> marks Yeats's attempt to link retrospectively his Cuchulain plays in a logical narrative sequence. Whereas Yeats had kept relatively close to the Irish source material for his earlier three Cuchulain plays (<i>On Baile's Strand, The Green Helmet,</i> and <i>At the Hawk's Well</i>), in <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> he freely adapts the Irish sagas for his own purposes. In this play, Cuchulain has apparently expired as a consequence of his t with the sea at the close of <i>On Baile's Strand.</i> Having once been the active and undaunted protagonist of Yeats's earlier Cuchulain plays, the Irish national hero now lingers helplessly between the world of the living and the dead. Why, we may ask, in the immediate aftermath of the 1916 Rising, at the historical moment when the endlessly deferred goal of Irish nationhood seemed finally at hand, does Yeats represent Cuchulain as a vague specter? Why should Yeats's heroic representative of Irish national identity suddenly seem a less substantial, less worldly, less politically potent re in 1919 than when he first graced the stage of the Abbey in 1904? Surely it is ironic that when <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> was published in January of 1919 the Irish War of Independence was beginning, and that by the time Cuchulain returned in his grave clothes to the Abbey in 1926 the Irish Free State had been in existence for four years.
</p>

<p>
The dramatic crux of <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> concerns the tragic choice that Emer, Cuchulain's wife, must make. To resuscitate Cuchulain, and bring his ghost back from the realm of the dead, Emer must renounce before Bricriu of the Sidhe any claim to her husband's love. So that she may break the spell that the otherworldly Woman of the Sidhe (Fand) has cast upon the Ghost of Cuchulain (who is not the same character as Bricriu&#x02014;who is called the re of Cuchulain), Emer relinquishes all claims on the hero's affection, surrendering first place in his heart to her earthly rival, Cuchulain's young mistress, Eithne Ingube, who has failed to revive the seemingly dead hero. I would suggest that by 1918, when Yeats completed the first version of the play, and had refined his revolutionary conception of an "aristocratic" cultic theatre, at a time when he had for many years ceased to be either at the center of Irish nationalist politics and had been living for all intents and purposes in his adopted country, England, he has come to understand that his powers to summon up an Irish national identity out of his imagination, to impose that vision by virtue of his creative will on the people of Ireland, to define in real terms the political culture of a new and independent Irish state, has ebbed away. He for the first time acknowledges that he must forgo his heroic or aristocratic vision for the Irish nation. In terms of the dramatic action of the play, for Cuchulain to be revived as a representative of the Irish nation, his beloved Emer must give him up to a new generation of suitors&#x02014;younger, more vibrant, less reflective, more materially interested, less spiritually elevated, better attuned to the realities and demands of (implicitly modern) political existence. That is to say, in order to preserve Cuchulain as a national symbol, Yeats must, like Emer, give him up to the young nationalists who have been his rivals, who have "stolen" the affections of the nation from him. Once more the Nietzschean formula seems pertinent: the Yeatsian dramatic cult serves the nation by performing the sacrifice of 

<b></b>

its own heroic demigod. The god must die in order to be reborn; the cult must will the destruction of its own sacred re in order that he might be transformed into a nationalist icon that serves the "mundane" aims of modern Irish politics. 
</p>

<p>
In 1918, Yeats's position vis &#x000E0; vis the emergent Irish nation was not quite so desperate as <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> might suggest or as the dramatist might have feared. From 1922 until 1929 Yeats served in the Irish Senate, and having won the Nobel Prize in 1923, he could legitimately claim to wield cultural influence in the Ireland of the 1920s and 1930s. But it is characteristic of Yeats's senatorial speeches that he generally sounds like any another late nineteenth-century liberal politician and not the ferociously nationalistic and antimodern artist and critic he was during the early years of the Irish National Theatre Society. Nevertheless, <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> seems cannily accurate in anticipating the increasingly insurmountable divide between a Yeatsian ideal for an Irish national culture and the actual "postcolonial" nation-state that emerged in the 1920s and the 1930s. The poignancy of Cuchulain and Emer's fate issues from the tragic choices they both make. If Emer must give up Cuchulain as her own, Cuchulain must abandon his pursuit of the ideal hawk-woman, the otherworldly woman of the Sidhe, for whom he has yearned since the days of his youth. In the original 1919 version of the play, the Ghost of Cuchulain finally turns his back on the Woman of the Sidhe in favor of Emer. But as he returns to the contemporary world of the living he (unwillingly) forgets both Fand and Emer (and his love for them); he awakens in the arms of his youthful if superficial mistress, Eithne Inguba (who herself remains oblivious to the otherworldly tragedy enacted before the eyes of Emer and the audience).<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Cuchulain's heroic stature is accordingly diminished. He settles for a "real life" mistress, young and attractive, but also vain, ignorant, silly, and possessing an unwarranted faith in her own powers and talents, rather than pursuing an ideal relationship that transcends the confines of the mundane domestic world. <i>The Only Jealousy of Emer</i> thus points to Yeats's recognition that in achieving a laudable worldly goal&#x02014;bringing Cuchulain back to life, achieving a real measure of political independence for Ireland&#x02014;certain ideal poetic, aristocratic, and heroic possibilities must be foreclosed. However much Yeats once contributed to the cultural construction of a national ideal as a poet and dramatist in the early days of the Irish National Theater Society, the political realization of that ideal requires, at least in the dramatic economy of the play, that the one who has yearned longest and most passionately for its instantiation, will in the end, feel alienated and cast aside. Just as the reborn Cuchulain is only a diminished version of his former self, so too the national ideal is a lesser thing for having been embodied. What has been lost in the act of incarnation is the freedom and poetic possibilities of a noble, if archaic and therefore unachievable, form of cultural and national identity.

In the twilight of life, Yeats returned one last time to dramatize the re of Cuchulain. At the time of his death in 1939, Yeats left completed a final "Noh play on 

<b></b>

the death of Cuchulain."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Not produced until 1949, and then not by the Abbey, <i>The Death of Cuchulain</i> is a postmodern work <i>avant la lettre;</i> like Beckett's plays, it self-consciously hybridizes theatrical styles, modes, and genres.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  It is a peculiarly self-reflective and intertextual drama that comments upon Yeats's earlier Cuchulain plays and on the political uses which the Irish Free State had made of the Cuchulain myth in the 1930s. But if Yeats anticipates postmodern theatre, he also achieves something of the tragic atmosphere and intensity of his earlier plays. Like the last work of Sophocles, <i>Oedipus at Colonus,</i> which Yeats adapted for the Abbey Theatre in 1927, <i>The Death of Cuchulain</i> dramatizes the apotheosis of the tragic hero, who willingly resigns himself to death and transration. It fittingly concludes in the present day  with the literal monumentalization of Cuchulain as <i>the</i> heroic political symbol of the modern Irish nation. In many respects, Yeats's final play recapitulates and reworks the antimodern theories of tragedy that he developed forty years before under Nietzsche's influence. It stages the ritual sacrifice of the Apollinian hero, executed by a wretched representative of a degraded folk, an old beggarly blind man and the dramatic double of Conchubar from <i>On Baile's Strand,</i> who now returns to slit the dying Cuchulain's throat for a mere dozen pennies. As in a Dionysian rite, the Irish Goddess of War, the Morrigu, directs the slaughter of Cuchulain and ceremonially offers his severed head to Emer, who concludes the play with a ritual dance in praise of the sanctified hero. 
</p>

<p>
If Yeats offers a final and remarkably literal reenactment of the Dionysian ritual, he shockingly frames his cultic tragedy with two "modern" scenes. The play opens with an Old Man, who resembles the aged Yeats, inveighing against his audience. He rages against the "vile age" in which he lives, describes himself as "out of fashion and out of date like the antiquated romantic stuff the thing [the play] is made of," and announces that he will produce a drama called <i>The Death of Cuchulain</i> for a small select audience who know Homer and the "old epics and Mr. Yeats' plays about them." He emphatically rejects a modern mass audience comprised of "people educating themselves out of the book societies and the like, sciolists, pickpockets and opinionated bitches." He concludes his diatribe against modernity by cursing his audience and spitting in disgust before them (ll. a-mm). This Brechtian or Beckettian introductory scene is structurally complemented by a concluding scene in which a ragged Irish Street-Singer of the late 1930s performs a song "the harlot sang to the beggar-man" (l. 196). Surprisingly, out of the mouth of the urban folk of the present day come verses celebrating Cuchulain:

<p>
In the final words of his dramatic career, Yeats calls to mind the fact that in 1935 the Irish government erected a bronze statue of the dying Cuchulain, designed by Yeats's friend, the sculptor Oliver Sheppard, in the General Post Office in Dublin, former headquarters of the Irish rebels during the 1916 Rising, site of some of the fiercest ting during Easter week, and a national landmark sanctified by the blood of Irish political martyrs. The mystery revealed in these final ironic verses is that it is Yeats's Cuchulain who stood with Pearse and Connolly in the GPO; it is Yeats himself who "thought Cuchulain till it seemed / He stood where they had stood." Paradoxically, the Yeatsian cult of Cuchulain has triumphed in the end, or at any rate, Yeats has succeeded in reappropriating the political and nationalist symbols of the Irish Free State into his own heterodox, anachronistic, and ironized form of Irish cultural nationalism. Sheppard's statue attests not only to the sacrifice of the political martyrs of 1916, who first proclaimed the Irish nation, but also to the fact that Yeats's tragic hero has come to be officially acknowledged by the Irish government as the very symbol and abiding spirit of the Irish Free State. Yeats, the Irish tragedian who had rejected the modern Irish nation-state in favor of the ancient cult, because the Irish folk refused to conform to his untimely antimodern and antidemocratic ideal of Irish culture, paradoxically has become the father of <i>modern</i> Ireland. The Yeatsian rebirth of tragedy brings forth, in the end, the spirit of postmodern irony.
