      Meditating upon the emblem of St. Mark in a sequence of poems devoted to the “Evangelistic Beasts,” D. H. Lawrence casts a question at Mark’s God: “Would a wingless lion lie down before Thee, as this winged lion lies?”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> This man, both animal and saint, fascinates him, this “lion” who “welped, and was Mark.” A re plunged equally in darkness and light, in body and spirit, in revelation and enigma, he embodies Lawrentian primitive vitality. Yet the question implies, too, that the mere cat—the “wingless lion”—remains uncertainly apart from his God, resists salvation and retains its strangeness, even as its assimilation to the man, its hybridized kinship, paradoxically confirms this human spiritual perfection. Where does that animal fall, into a new heaven or a darkened earth? And is it <span style="font-style:italic;">a</span> particular cat (Tibby or Marmelade, lion or leopard, domesticated or wild?), or is it the cat in general, or even more generally its animality, which is found at once to transform and evade the human, so? It is unclear how the cat matters to the idea: if we discover in the elusive animal, as Lawrence wishes us to, a redemptive, sensual and spiritual vitality suppressed by modern industrial life, do we thereby leave all individuality and history behind for some primitivist mirage, for a superficially down-to-earth but subtly transcendental assertion?
    </p>
<p>
      Thus argues literary scholar Philip Armstrong, though he maintains that Lawrence, along with the modernist avant-garde, also establishes a valuable critique of reigning humananimal relations: “In its distaste for modernity,” the primitivist project in high modernism draws Western society towards the post-Darwinian, “biocentric” animality identified by modernist scholar Margot Norris, and pushes it away from sentimenta  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and anthropomorphic clichés of non-human life consistent with ideologies of human supremacy and progress. Yet this critique comes with its own ideological cost, for modernist writing characteristically makes of the animal an abstract synecdoche for the plenum of asocial, feral Nature that is the transcendental signifier of biocentric writing. Modernism steps “outside of history altogether, seeking solace or guidance in a timeless dimension where animals, human environments, and the relations between them can be seen essentially, as they are, as they always have been.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> I will argue that while it is true that both critique and abstraction are endemic to modernist writing about animals, neither is history programmatically abstracted and transcended, nor does biocentrism readily signify without it. And the cat does matter.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Modern Icon</h1>
<p>
	In a sweeping historical argument, Michel Foucault argued that Western knowledge has been conditioned by three epistemic epochs. Such grand schemas, dedicated as they are to generalities, have hardly survived a postmodern critical fetish that has unceasingly sought, collected, deconstructed, and rearticulated the differential and the particular. Yet Foucault’s early, tripartite history of knowledge discourses moving from the machineries of pre-modern resemblance, to those of Enlightenment classification, to those of organic historicity in the modern period, which he supposed to have reached an ambiguous, posthuman limit at the end of the last century, seems to describe very well the typology if not history of one transhistorical kind of image: that of the creature at once human and non-human. There have always been popular stories and images of anthropomorphic animals and theriomorphic people. In folk tales corresponding to Foucault’s pre-modern period, for example, werewolves or mermaids partly assimilate the human re to a dangerous, non-human nature; but as we see in heraldry, in the werewolf and birds in <span style="font-style:italic;">lais</span> of Marie de France, in the pre-Christian animism of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</span>, in the scholarly cat of the Old Irish poet, or in many other instances of appropriation of non-human lives to human cultural iconology, these mediatory creatures with a foot, fin, paw, wing, branch, or claw in the realm of a frightening non-human nature also lend attributes of power to a henceforth re-articulated and re-affirmed human institution.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Such totemic creatures are distinct from the friendly or villainous tricksters that populate other folk tales such those collected by the Grimms—the talking fox, the clothed cat, the pigs and goats with human houses—which keep their human and animal parts exclusively signified and merely combinatory. Such combinatory play in what Foucault considered a later, Enlightenment classificatory mindset, however significant as a symptomatic cultural practice, is easily surpassed by the uniquely modern iconography in which human and animal traces fused into a new creaturely sign. Walt Disney’s Donald Duck is neither a bird that talks, nor a human who quacks, but a unified organic re with traces of duck and human drawn into each vocal syllable and graphic line, a re whose identity and coherence is sustained not by the recognition of individual parts but by the dynamic and functional orchestra of parts in motion, organizing its own space and time.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	In a similar if more somber iconographic mode, in his graphic-narrative memoir, <span style="font-style:italic;">Noa Noa</span> , Paul Gauguin joined a Tahitian woman in mocking the dour, industrious ants and carelessly singing grasshoppers of La Fontaine—and in doing so did more than re-code a conventional morality in reverse, a familiar mark of the bohemian artist. In writing this anecdote into his fictionalized memoir, he transposed the singing voice of the grasshopper into Maohi language—“<span style="font-style:italic;">Ia Orana</span>”—in the mouth of the woman Vaïtua, herself seen to metamorphose into a purring cat whose “feet caressed the wooden bedpost like the tongue of a tiger around a skull,” and who laments to Gauguin of the collective, singing voices of a pre-colonial, now dispossessed Tahiti. In that Tahiti, Gauguin tells us, the grasshopper was a very different kind of human-animal hybrid, the reincarnated spirit of a killed child.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> The segments of signs and histories in Vaïtua’s ration are here entangled in an overtly intoxicated, erotic encounter with the bedridden Gauguin, with the trade in alcohol, with animal-human metamorphoses that give birth to heterodox desires and social relations, and with a lethal undertone that is at once personal and political. This grasshopper-colony-child-cat-woman whose portrait Gauguin sketches in <span style="font-style:italic;">Noa Noa</span> is thus incomprehensible except as a primitivist chain of metaphors and relations whose roots grip Vaïtua’s and Gauguin’s personal encounter and political histories—a complex chain made coherent by the fluid, contingent interface between a colonial Tahitian subject and a cosmopolitan modernist style. In this flickering, shadowy succession of human and animal, of individual and social, of political and aesthetic signs, we confront neither allegory nor code, but a semiotically heterogeneous, historically evolved, unique icon. To make sense of it, we are obliged to adopt Foucault’s modernist episteme, in which the recognition of a relational “organism takes precedence over the search for taxonomic characteristics,” just as classificatory “language loses its privileged position and becomes, in its turn, a historical form coherent with the density of its own past.” For Foucault, such an episteme at once and paradoxically establishes “man” as the master of history, and suspends this mastery over the occultation of his being in language, a being that must, however, reabsorb and erase him in turn.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> In modern primitivism and popular comics alike, this fragile, <span style="font-style:italic;">chiaroscuro</span> suspension reveals its gender and animal troubles most acutely.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Avant-Garde and Cat-like</h1>
<p>
	Perhaps an anxiety to distinguish humans from animals has served or dogged Occidentals throughout history, but a modernist turn to that history will be the subject of the following pages. While res of all species are drawn into this new vortex, and notably the ape, it is the <span style="font-style:italic;">cat</span> that will embody most fully and contradictorily modernism’s fears and exhilarations.

	  The star of the cat, I think, is just now in the ascendant, as we emerge little by little from the dreams of ethics and conformity which clouded the nineteenth century and raised the grubbing and unlovely dog to the pinnacle of sentimental regard –The  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> insipid nineteenth century, when people were wont to praise dogs “because they are so human” (as if humanity were any valid standard of merit!) –

<p class="continued">
	The apologist for this felinomorphic modernism is the master of weird fiction, H. P. Lovecraft. Writing in 1937, his words reflect the spirit of a diverse modernist caste. Oscar Wilde, W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, James Joyce and T. S. Eliot were cat people. H. D. and D. H. Lawrence were cat people. e e cummings, W. C. Williams, and Tennessee Williams were cat people. Hieratic cats pad their way through the writing of Yeats, Eliot, Lawrence, and Pound, half-remote, teasing res of estranged desire and revelation. Both an Egyptian cat divinity and the lion lend their names to E. M. Forster’s errant clerk, Leonard Bast. The cat appears as a pictographic icon of Pound himself—and as the icon of a generation—on the stark, totemic cover of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pound Era</span> [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>].<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Joyce tried to adapt cat speech to human language. Eliot wrote verse portraits of cats. Zora Neale Hurston became a talking cat, defying White American readers to outwit her and assimilate her writing. Meanwhile, across North America, “dark humanoid” cats multiplied in cinema cartoons, newspaper comics, and their spin-off toy industries.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> A closer look at several of these felinomorphic res will help to explain their curious iconic significance as “runes” of a threatening but seductive post-human condition.
      </p>
<p>
	Having just heard Lovecraft, it is natural to begin with his own cat people, whose consubstantiality with the horror of the “unnamable,” yet also embodiment of cuteness, mark them as modernist antetypes of the myriad weird-cute res generated by today’s manga aesthetic.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Lovecraft’s talking cats are “more ancient than the Sphinx” whose “language” they speak; they are “heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister Africa”; they bear “tales from forgotten cities in Meroë and Ophir; they are “cryptic, and close to strange things which men cannot see.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Yet they are sweet little things, too. After one of Lovecraft’s travelers into dark realms entertains a black kitten, who jumps into his lap “to purr and play” before curling up beside him to sleep, then leaves the kitten a “saucer of rich cream in the morning,” this traveler’s obscure, “ancient friendship with the species” is recalled by the kitten’s feline clan. The cute scene thus expresses what is revealed to be a <span style="font-style:italic;">social</span> bond with the cats, legitimates it, and leads to his later rescue from a monstrous death by an army of cats metamorphosed into a “cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws” unleashed “tidally and tempestuously upon it,” after which the cats return him cozily and gracefully to the human world.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> In Lovecraft’s terrifying borderline world, in which a darkly obscure, shapeless, inarticulate, violent, chaotic, inhuman substratum of existence seethes beneath the fragile, artificial, articulate surface of humanity, cats are privileged mediators: they are furry little Nietzscheans, knowing the horror of that existential reality, yet refusing its <span style="font-style:italic;">anomie</span> with aesthetic integrity protected by a chivalric code.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	The same integrity and code, a similar cuteness, and a parallel mediating function— between dark, existential violence and diminutive aesthetic order—is condensed into the house cat of D. H. Lawrence’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Women in Love</span>. Birkin’s “young grey lord” presents an emblem of “superfine stability” to Ursula, as they hotly debate the nature of love and equality of the sexes. The pet’s fluid, graceful manner compels admiration, comprising both order and violence as he masterfully pummels a trespassing stray—and erotic interest—into submission.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The cat here again represents the <span style="font-style:italic;">Übermensch</span> as animal, but unlike Nietzsche’s allegorical lion, the small domestic species is animal in a minor key: an icon not of feral Mastery but of a more contingent, social mastery; not of autochthonous Stability but of ephemeral, performative stability; not of Beauty but, in Birkin’s and Ursula’s differing views of the cats and each other, of debatable beauty—a smaller, more intimate sign. This refusal to equate animals with anthropomorphic absolutes, while providing parables of the human, might seem muddled. But for Jeff Wallace, these discursive ambivalences as instructively dialectical: the sign of the animal is a contingent, corrigible anthropomorphism, in which the question of the human as such is never obscured.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Hence the cat who plays its part in <span style="font-style:italic;">Women in Love</span> is not a sign of the Human, for Birkin and Ursula, but of the diminutively and contingently, merely here-and-now human, a human that may become something else in a future that both these lovers <span style="font-style:italic;">as lovers</span> ultimately look forward to, in a modernist undoing of boundaries and assertion of creative self-definition. And again, just as for  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Lovecraft, this minor mastery, which mediates the human and existential life with style, is provisionally coded male. The woman is on the side of the stray (here a female cat, feral, coming from outside upon Birkin’s and his pet’s domestic property), thus of the pure wild, of absorption into the very chaotic otherness that is the felinomorphic modernist’s penumbral resource for creative, transgressive possibility. Yet the roles of mediating agency (male) and mediating representation (female) are difficult to keep separate, and these too crisscross and become interchangeable, so that in Lawrence’s novel neither Birkin nor Ursula can be straightforwardly masculine or feminine, but flirt with androgyny. We have already seen this flirtation in Gauguin’s performance of Vaïtua, a narrative re (both agent and object) in which voices (his and hers) and styles (Maohi and European modernist) mingle in one icon.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Such ambivalent gendering shows itself in the “Tame Cat”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> amidst Ezra Pound’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Personae</span>:

<p class="continued">
      Using quotation marks, the male poet marks his own speech as a snippet of actual conversational speech, and moreover, as just the sort of languid, tossed-off stuff that he associates with women. Yet despite the emphatic emptiness of meaning, there is another mode of communication going on, beneath the visible surface, that is felinomorphic: the purring that is not soporific, but stimulating, a revitalizing resource, a prick. The male poet is from one perspective here a re of mastery, like Birkin’s cat, subduing wild, inarticulate truths held by the cat-woman and her ambiguous species. Yet the cat-woman is already a mediator, purring in a language that the poet merely cribs—or indeed, as I began by suggesting, that is indistinguishable from his in style. If that were not all, the cat-woman’s antennae must inevitably recall Pound’s famous theriomorphic re of the poet as the “antenna of the race,” an inhuman creature feeling ahead into the darkness of the future.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> In this <span style="font-style:italic;">persona</span>, one might well ask, who is male and who female, who the cat and who the poet, who the actor and who the representation? The modernist icon evokes and fuses categories into chains of association, rooted in a contingent, historically marked situation. The aloof, cryptic cat is again a sign of boundary crossing and mediation, one in which language—purring, tactile, stylish—expresses a post-human, and hence liminally linguistic limit.
    </p>
<p>
      Modernist cats morphed across lives. H. D.’s daughter recalls the small turquoise cat that hung around her mother’s neck, which like a “mantra,” she “sat gazing at . . . for hours, fingering it, running it up and down the [black] velvet ribbon” while thinking, reading, and writing. This totem resembles those of Pound, Lawrence, and Lovecraft:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	Genuine or fake, a link with the Pharaohs or merely a souvenir from this century—she is beautiful. She sits inch high, with a proud elongated posture. Her features are finely drawn. They vary—lofty, remote, almost disdainful at times; then tender, then again, inscrutable; always aristocratic. Between her front paws, pressed against her chest, she guards a microscopic replica, her kitten.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      The cat’s deconstruction of dualisms of serious and cute, of hieratic and domestic, of autonomous and kinship-bound, of exotic heritage (relic) and modern tourism (souvenir), and after all, its affirmation by an aesthetic code, is felinomorphically identified with H. D. herself, as both the memoir’s title announces and H. D. herself makes clear its writer.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Does it matter if this cat-woman is “genuine or fake”? To question the distinction—in what one inherits from H. D., as daughter or as reader—is to embrace an identity that refuses to impose the truly literary, truly feminine, or truly human, and to affirm beauties of one’s own and their nurture on a “microscopic” scale, perhaps invisible to others at large.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Posthuman Desire</h1>
<p>
      The assertion of a radically indeterminate humanity is hardly limited to private or hieratic icons: the same is found in the most celebrated comic strip of the age, George Herriman’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Krazy Kat</span> (1913–1944), reputed to have been read by Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Edmund Wilson, e e cummings, Louis Zukovsky, and T. S. Eliot.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> In this anthropomorphic animal strip syndicated by Hearst, a carefree cat, Krazy, is in love with a scornful mouse, Ignatz, whose compulsion is to throw bricks at the cat’s head. The cat interprets the missiles as love messages, but the mouse is punished by a watchful dog, Offissa Pupp. On this narrative basis, Herriman played thousands of variations, daily and weekly, over thirty years of the strip’s run. The racial and sexual ambiguity of the Kat, and the modernist aesthetics of language, narrative, and image in the strip, were evident to fans (indeed, the strip was adapted to jazz ballet, with a comics libretto by Herriman, in 1922) and have drawn renewed attention from scholars today.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> The Kat, like other funny animals in comics and animated cartoons, is a stylistic synthesis of the human and the animal in a creature that is both and neither. The style rendering him/her is an erratic, scratchy line always on the verge of falling into a stumble of crosshatches or a tangle of jarred squiggles. This absorption of re into style is a familiar modernist project, and its effects here are particularly striking, where it asserts the fragile material identity of beings from panel to panel. The identifiability of creatures and of actions follows a razor’s edge along Herriman’s ecstatically hasty, insistently un-masterful line. The same applies to settings, panels, and layout, which morph surrealistically across narratives held together by his creatures. The setting is an imaginary desert in Kokonino Kounty, a stark world based on the American Southwest much loved by Herriman, where native icons like cactuses, buttes, joshua trees, pueblo houses, and kivas emerge from and vanish into the blank, fertile surface of the page, along with palm trees, giraffes, clocktowers, and Chinese laundries. As with images, so with words. The Kat’s dialect is synthetic, a seamless, be-bop blend of part-languages that evoke an array of Englishes, and becomes its own. “<small class="caps">oy</small>, ‘<small class="caps">ignatz</small>’.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> !!! <small class="caps">where four is thou</small>, <small class="caps">ignatz</small> ? [ . . . ] <small class="caps">oi</small>, <small class="caps">woi is me woi is me</small>” complains Krazy in a 1925 episode, when a seal unexpectedly flops by. “<small class="caps">my goo</small>-<small class="caps">niss sakes</small>, <small class="caps">l’il sill</small>—<small class="caps">widow goest thou at</small>?”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> The Kat is a creature of ineradicable sympathy, good will, and fun. In another episode, when Krazy finds a solitary coconut palm, s/he obtains balloons from a wandering salesman and uses glue, oakum, and paint to counterfeit “<small class="caps">a child coconut or two</small>” so the tree will be “<small class="caps">heppier with his lonesim sitiwation</small>” [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>].<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Here Herriman’s playful subversions of what Giorgio Agamben calls the anthropological machine are rampant.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> The tree itself is paradoxically both suggestively anthropomorphized and insistently inhuman, having an uncanny appeal. Graphically, it has no animal/human features, so lacks the essential convention of living being in comics, according to Scott McCloud the basis of human identification, a face.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Yet when first introduced, its fronds are shedding iconic tears. The caption reads: “<small class="caps">with only the shifting sands</small>, <small class="caps">the dancing dunes</small>, <small class="caps">and the echoing cliffs of kaibito to keep him company a coconut tree grown to pulsating palmhood grieves for the parent grove in coconino</small>—<small class="caps">and silently sheds a modest nostalgian tear</small>.” The last attributes of modesty and nostalgia nudge us beyond animalization to human personification, but only precariously. In most panels following, we only see the tree’s inexpressive lower trunk (a perspective identified with Krazy in panel 7), while what we have been taught to recognize as its “head” is out of sight. There are two exceptions: (a) a central panel shows the balloon-coconuts just attached by Krazy, and a lack of teardrop icons implies that the tree is “heppier,” as four “coconut” faces now stare out from it; (b) Ignatz has chopped through the trunk to steal the coconuts while Krazy sleeps beneath, and the iconic tears reappear—but are these renewed tears of sorrow, or the more ambiguous “anxiety” icons also conventional to comics? (without a face, impossible to tell).<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> The contrast between Ignatz’s selfish and objectifying view of the coconuts and Krazy’s generates the unexpected sentiment of the story: the tree need not be fooled by the fake coconuts for these surrogate children to have the value Krazy intends. The Kat has laboriously made them, produced them as “children” of his/her idiosyncratic activity and imagination, and given them to the tree as a gift; they embody Krazy’s relation to the tree, his/her sympathy for another, however inscrutable and ambiguous, Kokonino being, and the tree’s nonverbal response. This bond is emphasized in seven panels that show the Kat with head affectionately resting against the trunk. As the strip progresses, therefore, we are drawn away from the narrative problems to enjoy the birth in recognition (what is a tree without a face? what is a balloon with a face? what is a Kat, an animal, a human, an icon, a cartoon?) of unexpected lives and the bonds between them. Such bonds are not based on any universal mode of mutual identification, and the individual mystery of what is the Kat, the tree, or other res in the strip remains suspended in the pleasure of this discovery. This is allegorized when the balloon-buoyant tree floats a surprised Ignatz alone into the night, above the Enchanted Mesa that is home to Joe Stork, the bringer of all new lives to Kokonino.
    </p>
<p>
      This light-hearted story offers a modernist vision, attributed to Walter Benjamin by Agamben, of a “new in-humanity,” in which “the anthropological machine no longer articulates nature and man in order to produce the human through the suspension and capture of the inhuman. The machine is, so to speak, stopped; it is ‘at a standstill,’  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and, in the reciprocal suspension of the two terms, something for which we perhaps have no name and which is neither animal nor man settles in between nature and humanity,” such that “neither must man master nature nor nature man”: an experience of mundane beatitude whose icon is Krazy, rather than the egocentric Ignatz or the disciplinary Offissa Pupp.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> “<small class="caps">there is a heppy land</small>—<small class="caps">fur</small>—<small class="caps">fur away</small>,” sings a cheerful Kat, blending the ineffably utopian with the furry, lyrical here and now.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Felinomorphism and Plasticity</h1>
<p>
      In his/her idiosyncratic creatureliness, Krazy Kat, like the other felinomorphic res discussed above, conforms to the profound ambivalence expressed by Agamben  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and other recent writers who have considered modernity in the guise of a posthuman project whose shifting biopolitical exercises have rendered the human-animal distinction a mechanism variously emancipatory or oppressive. It is this ambivalence that Steve Baker registers in his analysis of the talking-animal comics genre itself, when he writes that because of the “instability of the anthropomorphized animal’s identity,” “the animal story’s invitation to pleasure is invariably an invitation to a subversive pleasure.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> I will here tie the modernist iconography (style) and iconology (symbolic condensations) of the Kat and other cat icons, both popular and avant-garde, to a growing modern awareness of and engagement with what H. G. Wells called the <span style="font-style:italic;">plasticity</span> of the human—to the deregulation of what it means to be human by the shattering of clichés of temporal progress and expanding civilization amidst unprecedented experiences of industrial, urban, technological, and military history.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> By deregulation, I mean the subjection of human/nonhuman distinctions to myriad contingent, competing, uneven powers in modern society, where the latter is increasingly conditioned by what Agamben, drawing from Foucault, calls biopolitics: the organization of “animality” or “bare life” under signs of economic necessity, security, and well-being.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> This theme is shared by high art storytellers such as Lawrence and Faulkner with popular fantasy artists like Herriman and Disney.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> However, where an iconography produces the fantasy of a totally mastered animality, an edenic or cyborgian paradise in which all lives are transparent to each others’ agencies and interests—as Sergei Eisenstein has brilliantly observed in his essays on Disney—the modern anthropological machine is fully operative, and the animal mask conceals a universal, indeed imperialist, re of the human. Where the fantasy is riven by stubborn, opaque differences and surprising, seductive transvaluations, by a creative humility before an inescapable heterogeneity of the animal and the inhuman—“I can’t go on, I’ll go on,” cries Beckett’s volatile, barely human “I”—then the machine is derailed, its anthropomorphic structures of feeling brought to a liberating standstill.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>
      This last process belongs to what Armstrong concludes about modernist writers, who variously rebelled against what they perceived to be sentimental anthropomorphism in nineteenth-century ideology, and who used an animal primitivism to promote new structures of feeling about the animal in human life. This entailed a new assertion of animal distance and otherness—though one paradoxically assimilable as abstraction, programmed by primitivist thought and put to work for modernist self-creation, to envision a world of strangers to ourselves, to borrow Kristeva’s phrase, as well as to others. With the <span style="font-style:italic;">chiaroscuro</span> icon of the human-animal hybrid prowling in the foreground, what Agamben pictures on the most abstract scale as an indeterminate, obscure, ontological landscape of posthistory, I prefer to picture on the minor scale demanded by Foucault’s modern episteme, in which grand ontology collapses into the unique welter of biopolitical root systems from which modern times and places have grown. At this scale, contingent politics of class, race, sex, and gender are not transcended, but feed the ambivalence of plasticity, the local fears and hopes of biopolitical fantasy, self-consciousness, and agency. At this scale, the felinomorphic icon asserts its genetic composition in historical contingency, and especially, in a multiplicity and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> open-endedness in the human-animal environment, in which cross-sexual and cross- cultural meanings engaged with the lived worlds of the icon may be read.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Cat and Woman</h1>
<p>
      Artistic engagement with modern plasticity can be more or less progressive, more or less critical, even if it expresses radical changes in feeling. It may fuse conservative with emancipatory urges, fear with hope. Such is the historical knot of meanings, alternately grim and playful, of the Batman villain born in 1940, a year after Batman and in the first issue of his own comic book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Catwoman.</span> Batman, a superhero re created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger in 1939, is the first animalized superhero icon. Like his myriad spawn, he embodies that sovereign “state of exception” that Agamben links to the modern animalization of human life: he uniquely stands outside both the law and the human, in order to master the law and the human; he personifies an anthropological machine. What of Catwoman? When she first appeared, her reader was unlikely to be bothered by resemblances to Batman’s dark-haired fiançée, Julie Madison (or by Julie’s resemblance to another early villain, Dala).<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> They belong to a typage more important than individual personality: an idealized feminine body and face, fashion sense and manners proper to the early 40s, and also, independence and strong will, registering a nervous male fascination with modern women’s ongoing break from patriarchy. When Julie breaks up with Batman, she becomes an actress, performs in costume, and recreates her public identity as a celebrity with a new name (Portia Storme). Thus Batman’s own shadowy plasticity, his gothic shape-shifting in form and identity, is doubled in the light of day by this career woman. Catwoman will be another independent, woman professional in disguise. Wayne himself is a performer while not Batman: he pretends to be an <span style="font-style:italic;">ennuyé</span> socialite allergic to work. Asked at a party what he has been doing, he replies, “<small class="caps">nothing</small>, <small class="caps">jim</small>, <small class="caps">nothing. work is too strenuous</small>! <small class="caps">it bores me</small>!!” Jim thinks, “<small class="caps">bored</small>! <small class="caps">everything bores that fellow</small>! <small class="caps">if he ever got excited about anything i think they would declare a national holiday</small>!” while an onlooker comments, “<small class="caps">they say he is probably the laziest</small>, <small class="caps">most useless chap in our set</small>!”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Batman/ Wayne expresses the anxiety binding masculinity to work in modern America. He expresses both a fantasy of escape from masculine work as meaningless labour (in his Wayne persona, we admire his cool indifference to a busy world of commerce and crime, and indulge vicariously in a serene, wealthy lifestyle), as well as a fantasy of dedication to meaningful masculine work (a vigilante night shift that serves the community, expresses a male power not so securely available in “real” life, and lies outside the economy). Thus, while a modern apprehension of human plasticity expresses itself in new kinds of posthuman icons like Batman and Catwoman, such res are always embedded in symbolic chains articulating historical forces and changes.
    </p>
<p>
      As soon as Catwoman herself appears, she goes through several iconographic developments. One of the most important is her coming explicitly to double Batman: both as a “weird” creature of the night, shrouded in language of fear and mystery and depicted in purple and black shadow worlds, and as a persona obsessed with animal  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> imagery and paraphernalia, a totemic being [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>].<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> That Catwoman does not settle easily into a costume (like the Joker, for example) is due to the explicit conception of her power as a shape-shifter, as a master of disguise. This is a salient feature of Catwoman in relation to comics form—for here the medium develops an icon who can preserve her identity between frames and stories, yet look utterly different, and often impossibly so. Until the 1950s, Catwoman had no “original” or “real” identity. Batman is Bruce Wayne in costume/disguise, but Catwoman for ten years has no real name or background story. In her first few years, she disguises herself in the roles of a maid, a fashion magazine editor, a society hostess, a beauty salonist, a newspaper writer, a rival fiançée for Batman, and more. Her range of faked public and private, work and leisure social identities suggests that she does not merely reflect misogynistic anxiety about the independent career woman (she does), but she also expresses an alluring fantasy of fluid transformation between such often competing realms: she can be it all.
    </p>
<p>
      Catwoman’s plasticity, like that of Batman, is most obviously expressed in her blurring of distinction between human and animal—her selection of a totem animal, and her identification with it, that mysteriously grounds her exceptional powers. The possibility that the human has no divine destiny or sanction, that it is a biological and historical construct, that it cannot be distinguished definitively from the animal, is expressed in fantasies that combine fear with pleasure. The human-animal divide is only the most traditional one in which to play out this fantasy, however. In comics, it is possible to go to the furthest limit of the human-nonhuman divide by marking a division between the recognizable or significant, the iconological itself, and its other—between the icon and its mere background. Catwoman is sometimes not only unrecognizable in disguise, she is also unremarkable as a re in the background, having no iconological status at all. In her first and second appearances, she appears as a tiny re, indicated by hardly more than a few quick lines, dwarfed by narrative and visual emphases elsewhere. From this insignificant background she will unexpectedly emerge as an icon—henceforth an icon of what remains outside iconography in comics, and what is outside the human. This micronarrative of emergence from the mise-en-scène of setting and style into character and agency illustrates, in nonverbal form, the modernity of the Foucauldian sign, its minor organic contingency, and the uncertainty of the human re itself. Catwoman’s face is a modernist version of Foucault’s ephemeral cartoon drawing in the sand—a human re at once obliging identification and defying mastery.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>
      As a villain who is strictly non-violent, Catwoman more particularly offers the fantasy of identifying safely with transgression; this fantasy is akin to those offered by Batman and other superheroes, but inverted; not safe violence to others, but violence to property, and without recontainment by moral or institutional law. It is likely that such identification extends to male readers, and that such a cross-sexual identification process is assisted by Catwoman’s essential plasticity—a transgressive identification mirrored in the heterosexual comedy of Batman and Catwoman’s own mutual attraction. This attraction of doubles, veiled in mutual autonomy and mystery, offers a parallel to the twin, dark satellite relationship that Rupert and Ursula struggle to put into words and to live, like the cats whose nature they debate, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Women in Love</span>. In mid-century  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> America, this avant-garde vision emerges in pulp fantasy: Batman and Catwoman circle each other endlessly, devotedly, barely known to each other, mastering each other’s mastery by force or sentiment. But where Lawrence’s characters can only connect in their leisure hours, Kane’s do so in their vocational lives. For the avant-garde Lawrence, the human is originally a question of culture, of how to think and represent its volatile modernity, whereas for the comics artist Kane, thought, feeling, and the problems of representation are reduced to telegraphic conventions, and the human becomes instead a fantasy of work, of what to do, and with whom.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Of Cats and Kin</h1>
<p>
      The alignment of the modern felinomorphic icon with woman, and the problem of learning a new kind of social bond, can be traced in the pulp genealogy of Kane’s Catwoman. In Mary Elizabeth Counselman’s “Cat-Woman” story in <span style="font-style:italic;">Weird Tales</span> in 1933 (with its uncannily coincidental bat-woman cover), the cat woman is a supernatural shape-shifter who compels desire and fear in the story’s male narrator. Yet like Kane’s Catwoman, she is harmless. She is only, in her human shape, a kind of foreigner whom the narrator befriends, and her tragic death seems to allegorize the intolerance and fear that villainizes the “other within” multi-ethnic urban life. But as a symbol, she exceeds that: I say a “kind” of foreigner because not only does she have no marked ethnic origin, but like Krazy Kat, her strange language (and Americanicity) remains indeterminate and may even be unique: “Her voice was a purring, throaty contralto, very pleasant, with a slight accent—not French, not anything I had ever heard.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Indeed, she seems to represent ethnic otherness that is endogenous to her urban English-speaking America—an internal plasticity—just as she represents the animal within the human. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Mules and Men</span> , Zora Neale Hurston presents a similarly didactic if more complex icon whose roots are in 1930s race politics yet also, in shortcircuiting the imagery of race and ethnicity, an icon that grows beyond them. After recounting Black American oral tales and experiences hearing these and learning occult hoodoo, Hurston closes her narrative with a tale of Sis Cat and Rat. Sis Cat catches Rat, who escapes by convincing Sis Cat that she should not eat without washing her face and hands, or she has no manners. But Sis Cat catches the Rat again, eating him first, explaining that she has “plenty manners,” and now “eats mah dinner and washes mah face and uses mah manners afterwards.” Hurston concludes the book: “I’m sitting here like Sis Cat, washing my face and usin’ my manners.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Here the civilized and the savage are introduced as conventionally opposed concepts. But this dualism fails to map directly onto conventional categories of race (or an animal allegory thereof): it is employed as a discursive pawn in a game of identity trickery and raw power between one anthropomorphized animal and another, the eater and the eaten, both indeterminately civilized, both ambiguously akin to the human. This biopolitical fable applies the argument of Hurston’s mentor in anthropology, Franz Boas, that culture is not a racial characteristic but a social development contingent upon history and geography, to a power conflict between two contending animals. Culture, and indeed any notion of human difference founded upon it, belongs to that human iconology that is drawn in the sand, and may be transformed and contested at flash points of social conflict, in this instance racial and sexual, in mid-century America.
    </p>
<p>
      Hurston’s fable shares the quality identified by Armstrong in modernism at large, of a rejection of sentimental relations to and among animals as a basis for identification or bonding. Yet like Rupert Birkin’s cats and other felinomorphic icons, they are sympathetic in another, perhaps ineffable way. (Lawrence can be moved, for example, after seeing the face of a dead puma, to feel that “in this empty world there was room for me and a mountain lion,” and to mourn the “gap in the world” its face has left, compared with “how easily we might spare a million or two of humans / and never miss  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> them.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a>) Sis Cat is a seductive re, but not assimilable to any clearly recognizable abstraction of the cat or the animal. Hurston’s voice, when she identifies with Sis Cat, assimilates a Black American oral dialect to the White literary form of her narrator, creating a unique synthesis. As the folktale universe of Sis and Brer anthropomorphic animals suggests, such a creature may be recognized as an imaginary type of kin. The pleasure of re-imagining modes of kinship among animals, as if free from a biopolitics of identity and difference from the human, is what seduces and binds. Such freedom requires the suspension of the anthropological machine, glimpsed again here as in Counselman’s story. This would explain the other outstanding instance of felinomorphic identification on Hurston’s part, when she relates her ultimate hoodoo apprenticeship ritual with Father Watson, known as the Frizzly Rooster: “He said to me, ‘You will do well, but you need the Black Cat Bone. Sometimes you have to be able to walk invisible. Some things must be done in deep secret, so you have to walk out of the sight of man.’”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> So Hurston passes the small white bones of a ritually killed cat through her mouth until she tastes the bitter one she will carry in order to walk, like a black cat, to one side of normal human knowledge and perception. The modernist paradoxically wishes to assimilate the insistent otherness of non-human nature to a renewed human life. But the imagined synthesis is not here, as in Krazy Kat and diverse res considered above, merely to regress to a primitivist abstraction; it is to produce the icon of a new modernity, a unique historical re that re-organizes reigning biopolitical categories in mid-century America of black and white, animal and human. Hurston’s title, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mules and Men</span>, undertakes the same subversive play. It refers to a tale that again short-circuits the biopolitical categories of race, the story of a mule who surprises its owners by talking back to them, refusing, like a defiant slave, to continue to follow orders and work. The humourous twist comes when the owner’s dog expresses the same surprise at the mule. The dog is identified with the owner, who runs away in terror, the faithful dog following him at every step.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> The talking animal appears both as a re of the Black man, a racist stereotype projected externally by White culture (but here seen as reasonable and seductive as Bartleby) and as an internal avatar of the White man himself. Such animal res are not interested in actual or individual animals in any direct sense, which is consistent with Armstrong’s other observation about modernism, that it depends upon abstracting the animal into types. But they are not simply primitivist either, and depend upon the historical associations of mules, men, and race in America to signify—as humour and as didactic subversion.
    </p>
<p>
      What the plastic animal icon teaches us, therefore, is that the modernist impulse, in diverse expressions across pulp and avant-garde genres, defied sentimental and anthropomorphic visions of the animal-human divide in significantly different ways. Not only or even generally did modernists produce a theriomorphic primitivism, an abstracting discourse that re-imagines the (human or non-human) identity of historically existing animals as timeless entities and values. However subversive and emancipatory of our understanding of the human, that project is one of Agamben’s anthropological machines in full operation, distinguishing the authentically human as a particular, self-reflexive relationship to animal otherness. There, the inauthentic human lurks not far away, ready  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to be pitilessly cast off as brute exceptions—as the Nietzchean herd that dies without leaving a gap in Lawrence’s world, or that masses itself in servile stupidity beneath Lovecraft’s individual spirit. More often, such primitivist abstraction worked to render that biopolitical machinery ideologically inoperative by imagining the new, possible identity of synthetic creatures that exist only in literary or graphic representation, but with historical and authorial production exposed, held together by style and circumstance.
    </p>
<p>
      Some common modernist icons expressed the fear of human-animal transformation or indistinction: the ape, the insect, the dinosaur. But of all animal icons, the felinomorphic trickster seems uniquely invented to express the tremendous desire simultaneously with the fear associated with the plasticity to which these modernist imaginations responded in their search for new structures of feeling for social kinship—and in so doing, unexpectedly combining the empowering magic with the obscure terror of walking “out of the sight of man.”

	  Lovecraft is singled out by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari as an exemplary writer of “becominganimal,” a concept that articulates the fluid ontology of plasticity I will develop in this essay, as well as its social determination of a kinship—just like that, according to Claude Lévi-Strauss, of the animal totem—of filiation or alliance rather than blood descent. Deleuze and Guattari are, like the modernists, not interested in the “real” animal, in the sense of a recognizable, categorizable type: “We fall into a false alternative if we say that you either imitate or you are. What is real is the becoming itself, the block of becoming, not the supposedly fixed terms through which that which becomes passes. Becoming can and should be qualified as becoming-animal even in the absence of a term that would be the animal become” (“Becoming-Animal,” selection from <span style="font-style:italic;">A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia</span>, trans.

In Lévi-Strauss’s context (see Kalof and Fitzgerald, 268), blood descent refers to extended family systems, whereas in the modern age, it  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> may refer to race, and modernist animal icons of cross-racial or post-racial filiation, as I argue in this essay, have political significance.

He knows all their histories—the brindled cat looked like a skeleton until he began to feed it; that fat grey cat is an hotel proprietor’s favourite, it never begs from the guests’ tables and it turns cats that do not belong to the hotel out of the garden; this black cat and that grey cat over there fought on the roof of a four-storied house some weeks ago, fell off, a whirling ball of claws and fur, and now avoid each other” (<span style="font-style:italic;">A Vision</span> [London: Macmillan, 1981], 5–6).

	  See H. G. Wells’s 1896 novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Island of Dr. Moreau</span>, as well as the Paramount 1933 film version, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Island of Lost Souls</span>. The 1932 poster for the film foregrounds the sexy “Panther Woman” who is a creation of the renegade scientist, Dr. Moreau, and who ultimately kills him. The icon of metamorphosis without an original is suggested even here, where the mysterious cat woman is billed as one of the cast, without revealing the actress’s name. The earlier novel is where Wells develops his ideas about human plasticity in fictional form, and his Panther Woman is perhaps the archetype of the modernist felinomorphic icon; for his relevant journalism, see writings collected in Leon Stover’s edition, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Island of Doctor Moreau: A Critical Text of the 1896 Edition, with an Introduction and Appendices</span> (Jefferson, NC: McFarland and Co., 1996). Wells believed that the biological human being, as well as the psyche, had cut moorings in religion and cultural tradition that had stabilized definitions of the human, and that the coming modern age would be one that might create and recreate the human freely, for better or for worse. In the amoral Moreau, with twin roots in aestheticism and the will to power, Wells foresaw the darkest realization of genetic engineering and biopolitics. Wells borrowed the scientist’s name from the nineteenth-century painter famous for haunting animal paintings, especially the reknowned <span style="font-style:italic;">Oedipus and the Sphinx</span> , with its seductive yet terrible beauty, posing the riddle of “man” to the hero. Philip Armstrong has provided a perceptive, detailed reading of the animal in Wells’s novel in the context of his more optimistic socialist politics of the time. Further discussion may also be found in my forthcoming <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Animalism: Habitats of Scarcity and Wealth in Comics and Literature</span> (University of Toronto Press, 2011).
