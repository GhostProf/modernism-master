<p id="lead">In his collection of essays, <i>Conversations in Bloomsbury</i>, the celebrated Indian writer Mulk Raj Anand describes the early beginnings of his novelistic craft as a young university student in England. Joyce's <i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> speaks to him across the divide of culture and nurtures his desire to write: I "recognized myself in the hero of <i>Portrait</i>" he says.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  In <i>Portrait</i> Joyce presents not only Stephen Dedalus's inner world, compelling to Anand in its own right, but also, significantly, a version of what is taking place within Anand himself. Comparing Joyce to his mentor, the important Islamic poet Iqbal, and his poetic cycle <i>Secrets of the Self</i>, Anand prefers to follow Joyce, claiming him as a kindred spirit and model, if not strictly a compatriot. He decides that "the portrait is a good model for me, if I want to stage the recovery of self . . . in a novel," and resolves to begin that novel almost immediately. Anand secretly determines to pattern himself after Joyce, taking specific instruction not merely from Joyce's mode of narration and his representation of self-development, but also from his rejection of religion or mysticism, and his use of sound to transmit extra-linguistic meaning in prose (<i>CB</i>, 7). From this moment, he begins his effort to forge a new English language tradition in fiction for India. </p>

<p>What sense do we make of Anand's remarks about Joyce? This essay will begin to address the complex intertextual web linking Joyce's <i>Portrait</i> to Anand's early writings, most notably his novel, <i>Coolie,</i> written between 1933&#x2013;35. In this comparison I will argue that we can see important elements of Joyce's style also appear in Anand's work, especially his insistence on reality rather than what Anand calls "religious illusionism," his use of 

<b></b>

limited perspective and focalization as a means of representing and critiquing Bildung, and his emphasis on sound as a marker for the uncontrollability of language. Further, I will suggest that Anand's use of Joycean techniques to trace the life of a displaced, wandering coolie highlights the political implications of <i>Portrait</i>. That Anand becomes a follower of Gandhi and embarks upon a long career as a social activist and writer of engag&#x00E9; fiction, even as he remains a follower of Joyce, points to the path between Joyce's experimental prose and the politically engaged novels of Anand. Indeed, the connection asks us to rework and redefine our understanding of engaged writing. Sartre long ago claimed that "art loses nothing in engagement. On the contrary . . . the always new requirements of the social and the metaphysical engage the artist in finding a new language and new techniques." <sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Yet in practice, experimental fiction has often been described as separate from engaged writing, with modernism being distinguished from the more directly political work often dubbed "thirties literature."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Reading Joyce and Anand together works against this separation, asking us to consider stylistic experimentation as a spur to new possibilities of engagement while offering modes of political expression not possible within a conventional realist novel. </p>

<p>Further, if Anand, as displaced colonial subject, encounters Joyce's phrase, "I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race," as meaningful for his own political situation (and this is the specific passage he cites), then we must also see Anand's use of that phrase as important for understanding Joyce.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Thus the connection between the two authors provides us with a new way into the ongoing discussion of colonial textuality from a crucial transnational perspective. The question is not simply a unilateral matter of influence&#x2014;though to be sure Joyce influenced Anand. Rather, this encounter highlights the multidirectional flow of global literature and culture, where streams of discourse move not just from metropolis to colony, or even back from colony to metropolis, but as in this example, from colony to metropolis to another colony and back again. As Elleke Boehmer points out,  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>oppositional nationalist, proto-nationalist, and anti-colonialist movements learn from one another as well as drawing from their own internal political and cultural resources or the political culture of their oppressors. Looked at from this perspective, anti-colonial nationalism emerges as an allusive, cross-cultural, intertextual, or interdisciplinary phenomenon.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Though this allusiveness or intertextuality is most often remarked in a much later, post-independence group of writers, I will claim that we can already see it nascent in the contact between Joyce and Anand. Critics have pointed out the ways in which early twentieth-century Indian writers felt connected to the Irish struggle. Irish writers, such as Yeats and the Theosophist Joseph Cousins, also turned to Indian writing, often as source material for spiritual and formal exploration.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Political writers in Ireland had, by the early years of the twentieth century, begun writing about the commonalities between British colonial rule in Ireland and in India.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  But what I want to argue in this essay goes beyond remarking upon influences or commonalities, which presume a 

<b></b>

certain arbitrariness. Discussing connections between the colonies and the metropolis, Boehmer remarks,  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>merely tracing correspondences . . . can appear to leave too much, as it were, to coincidence. In that the new colonial writers themselves represented dissent and difference from source, their contribution can perhaps be interpreted in a stronger sense. Can they be seen as forming a constitutive part of the modernist movement rather than as being merely its symptom, or sympathetic effect?<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">I will argue that the "correspondence" between Joyce and Anand moves beyond coincidence and demonstrates Anand's position as a constitutive part of modernism, thus helping to realign modernism along global lines.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  I will also argue that placing Anand in this way forces us to reconsider Joyce's writing within the context of Anand's direct political engagement, which was perceived as so dangerous in pre-Independence India that his first three novels were banned there.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  When we read Joyce and Anand together, what emerges is a complex intertextual exchange that highlights the specificity of their colonial critiques; the challenges their work poses to conceptions of a representative, ethical subject; and the very real political engagement, extended and made more overt in Anand's oeuvre, of their modernist narrative modes. </p>

<p>First, consider the question of Anand's use of Joyce as a model for representing self-development, or Bildung, in literature. Mulk Raj Anand was born in Peshawar in 1905 to the family of a civil servant, and distinguished himself as a teenager by his studiousness, his voluminous reading in Urdu, Persian, and English (especially the British Romantics), and his interest in poetry. He began writing poetry at an early age as a disciple of the poet Iqbal. In the heady period after 1918, Anand became swept up in growing rebellion in the Punjab. He was arrested and caned in Amritsar, where his family had been living, for innocently breaking curfew during the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre of 1919, one of the most bloody and infamous conflicts in the history of the Raj, in which soldiers opened fire on ten thousand civilians.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  He was again arrested in 1924 for political activism in Lahore. His father, a government functionary, became infuriated by Anand's involvement in politics and punished Anand's mother in retaliation. To stop this punishment, with money from his mother and his mentor, Iqbal, Anand traveled to London where he studied philosophy at the University of London, while also attending lectures by luminaries such as G. E. Moore and C. D. Broad. His connections within the London literary world brought him into the living rooms of Leonard and Virginia Woolf, and into contact with E. M. Forster, T. S. Eliot and most of the res of literary Bloomsbury, though he became increasingly uncomfortable in that milieu. He experienced the 1926 General Strike in London as a watershed event in which he recognized similarities between the British workers and the Untouchables in India. He realized that "not only were the British imperious and strong-minded in the colonies, but [they] also could suppress their own working people."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  But his long and illustrious career as a writer of fiction began in 1922. In that year he first read Joyce, devouring both <i>A Portrait of the Artist </i>and later <i>Ulysses</i> (which he found on a trip to Paris) and discovering in them a new vocation. That he should speak of Iqbal 

<b></b>

and Joyce in the same sentence when describing his early literary influences highlights Joyce's importance to Anand. </p>

<p>In fact, what Anand tells us is that Joyce seems to offer a <i>better</i> model for describing the development of self, at least as Anand sees it, than Iqbal&#x2014;a somewhat surprising comment for an Indian who grew up under Iqbal's tutorage. Anand seems explicitly to embrace the idea of the novel as a vehicle for representing self-development within material and social life, which clearly owes much to the tradition of the Bildungsroman, and he patterns his comments about Joyce in order to emphasize the Bildungsroman's focus on the hero's development as a worldly journey which also has world-historical significance. As Bakhtin states, in the Bildungsroman </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[the] hero emerges <i>along with the world</i> and he reflects the historical emergence of the world itself. He is no longer within an epoch, but on the border between two epochs, at the transition point from one to the other. This transition is accomplished in him and through him.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">While novels in the Bildungsroman tradition from the twentieth century may not reflect the same order of faith in this epochal transition as do those in the eighteenth, the question of transition remains paramount, as does the coincidence of the hero's attempted emergence with that of his country or milieu.  </p>

<p>Joyce's model, Anand says, also rejects "religious illusionism" in favor of an insistence on material reality as the scene of the self's struggle toward definition and therefore of its significance. In contrast, if we look briefly at Iqbal's <i>Secrets of the Self</i> we find a section entitled: "Exposition of the theory that order in the Universe originates from the self and that the continuation of the life of individual existence depends upon the self." The poet claims: "The form of all existence is / effect alone of the self."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The situation of the self in the world is a question made subservient in Iqbal to the expansion and power of self that becomes, over the course of the long poem, mystical and religious. And yet for Joyce in <i>Portrait</i> as for Anand in all his work, the very crux of the problem of self is its embeddedness in the material world and its hierarchies of language and behavior. While Stephen might <i>wish</i> that all existence be the effect of his own self (and certainly he is subject to the sin of pride), the world of <i>Portrait</i> and its multiplicity of discourses prevent that. Further, as I will discuss, the problem of whether or not the self can be seen as universalizable or representative subject, as in Enlightenment versions of political citizenship, becomes key for both Joyce and Anand, and a means by which they build anticolonial politics into their reengagement with the Bildungsroman. To put it bluntly, part of what Anand is finding in Joyce, and not in Iqbal (despite the fact that Iqbal was to become crucial political re during the struggle for independence), is engagement with the self within the context of a colonial reality rather than the metaphysical world. </p>

<p>I want to turn, then, to Anand's work and ultimately to the idea of Bildung in his novel <i>Coolie </i>and in <i>Portrait</i>. Anand, who died in 2004, was the author of, at best count: eighteen novels, three collections of short stories, several books of essays, including such seminal works as "Is There a Contemporary Indian Civilization?" and many collections

<b></b>

 of Indian fairy tales. He also wrote art history and literary criticism, gathered Indian recipes, and published assessments of the philosophies of Gandhi and Nehru. In general, though, treatments of his work in histories of Indian writing in English focus on the novels written between his return trip to India in 1932 and Independence. Because his work is influenced by his reading in socialism, which he began in London at the time of the General Strike, and by his effort to provide a detailed account of the lives of ordinary Indians, Anand is often referred to quite simply as a "social realist" with attendant remarks upon his "limitations," especially in his later works.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Anand's first novel <i>Untouchable</i> (written between 1928 and 1932) is his most famous, and the one most often discussed in connection with his early literary influences, perhaps because it was championed by E. M. Forster (who arranged for it to be published after its having been rejected by nineteen presses) (<i>WH</i>, 26). An apocryphal story is often recounted about Gandhi's influence on this novel, which Anand brought, half written, with him from London to Gandhi's Sabarmati Ashram. According to this story, Gandhi himself edited the manuscript, cutting the excess from it, and insisting that its hero become less of "a Bloomsbury intellectual" (<i>HIL</i>, 175). Though there is no extant manuscript and no evidence for this story, the assumed trajectory of Anand's early career still rests on this tale, guiding critics to comment on Anand's return to India as a "decisive shift," a return to authenticity, and an embrace of social realism (ibid.).  </p>

<p>On the other hand, <i>Untouchable</i>, like much of the succeeding work, also continues to speak to the European fiction of the period, which Anand still read and admired. As Paul Saint-Amour observes, "though the substrate of its first 120 pages is a documentary, 'day-in-the-life' realism, this unfussy surface is warped and ornamented by a boggling variety of other styles, modes, and lexicons" many of which owe recognizable debts to European narrative modes.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The hero, a poor sweeper boy named Bakha, is in a distinctly Indian situation of being abused by upper class Indian and British characters, suffering both the indignity of being forced by caste to clean latrines for others, and the rejection, even when trying to rescue an injured boy, that his "polluted" status brings upon him. The novel takes place over one day, in which Bakha is also exposed to the preaching of Christian missionaries, the charismatic speeches of Gandhi, and the Socialist lectures of a British-educated poet. Yet, as many have remarked, Bakha's self-awareness forms the core of the novel, allowing us to look at the material circumstance of his restricted life through his limited perceptive, and from time to time presented in interior monologue.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Anand said of the work, he had wanted to show Bakha's "unique sensitiveness as against the people of the upper caste who thought that merely touching him is a degradation" (qtd. In <i>WH</i>, 30). In the published novel Bakha could in no way be termed a "Bloomsbury intellectual"; indeed, he is most often described by critics as "na&#x00EF;ve." Yet the novel clearly speaks to the European tradition of realism and its development of interior perspectives and focalized narration as well as to twentieth-century developments in narrative form. The novel's "one day in the life" structure must also certainly be discussed in connection with <i>Mrs. Dalloway </i>and<i> Ulysses</i>, which we know Anand read and recommended to his friends, and in relation to Joyce's emphasis on material existence within the context of a focalized narrative. 

<b></b>

The novel's triumph is in the combination of the view of its untouchable hero through the complexity of his inner thoughts and emotions, and "its prose [that] subtly picks up the dense corporeality and tactility of Bakha's existence" (<i>HIL</i>, 177). </p>

<p>Anand's next novel, <i>Coolie</i>, which follows the short lifetime of a poor Indian laborer, is more closely linked to the Bildungsroman tradition and its critique in <i>Portrait</i> and thus helps raise political questions about the status of the "universal man" within that tradition. In <i>Coolie </i>we see the young hero Munoo forced out of his home in a hill village and sent to find his way through a number of menial jobs in an extraordinary series of locations throughout India. While working as a servant for a bank official, in a pickle factory, in a cotton mill, or as a rickshaw boy, before his death at fifteen from consumption, Munoo encounters the entire social fabric of India. He is befriended in unexpected places: among other servants, coolies, and cotton mill workers but also in the house of the pickle factory owner and in the home of an emancipated Anglo-Indian woman.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Yet the brilliance of the novel is not in the specific details of the various trials that Munoo is made to face: rather as in <i>Untouchable,</i> it lies in the novel's focus on Munoo's internal life and his struggle to respond to the varieties of discourses that surround him and the power hierarchies associated with them. </p>

<p>While the style of the novel contains few of Joyce's moments of fixed internal focus, it is focalized in much the same way, with a third person perspective that is limited to what Munoo can know and understand, and which develops over the course of the novel as Munoo grows up. Munoo's lack of experience in the opening chapters, while not quite on the order of Stephen Dedalus's, is strikingly represented in a tone both limited in perspective and deeply ironic. For example, in an early scene that takes place in the house where his uncle leaves him to work as a servant, he suffers constant reprimand because he has no idea of the rules of proper servant conduct, and no one bothers to tell him. We follow along with Munoo as he blunders over and over again and is punished. When the lady of the house turns on the gramophone, Munoo wanders in from the kitchen, dripping utensils in hand: "He felt emboldened. He wanted to hear the music, to see and touch the singing machine . . . 'how lucky I am, he thought, that there is a wonder machine in the house where I have come to serve'" . Munoo's naivet&#x00E9; guides the narrative here, which can only hint at what he does not understand. He gets carried away by the music and begins to dance around on all fours like a monkey, but Munoo is completely unaware that he is literally fulfilling the expectation of the lady of the house, who has been calling him a monkey all along. A few pages later, the same dynamic of subservience is played out between the householder and his boss at the Bank of India, aptly named Mr. England, whom he has invited to tea. The household does its utmost to impress the Englishman, who recoils in disgust at their food and cannot wait to leave. By the end of the scene, however, it is he who has been called "monkey-faced" by the highly educated Indian doctor who lives there.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  The ironic stance of the narrative is such that only we as readers are aware of the many levels operating here; for Munoo, our eyes and ears, the visit of the Englishman is all spectacle. This scene highlights the layering of irony in the novel, which, like the rest of Anand's work, is too often simplified as a "social chronicle" (<i>HIL</i>, 177).

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>This scene also recalls, however, several episodes in <i>Portrait</i> in which the combination of a focalized perspective and a variety of competing discourses and power relationships serves to introduce irony into the serious subject of Bildung. First, the scene where Stephen is asked "Do you kiss your mother?" by the older fellows at school operates in much the same way to highlight a na&#x00EF;ve subject caught between multiple layers of discourse. As Trevor Williams comments, "the scene illustrates the crossover from linguistic innocence . . . to one in which words become charged with meaning depending upon one's position in the social group. The struggle for dominance, for the right to provide 'the right answer' is here engaged."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In this short scene, the power relationships are similar to those in <i>Coolie</i>: Stephen, not knowing the codes of conduct among the school boys, presents himself as eager and direct, which causes him trouble. He quickly answers "yes" when asked if he kisses his mother at night, reverses his answer, then succumbs to confusion not just about what the "right" answer is, but about the very meaning of the word "kiss." The fact that he asks "what did it mean to kiss?" indicates that he is outside the discourse of sexuality employed by the bigger boys (<i>P</i>, 11). They exert power by withholding this level of meaning from him. Yet we as readers know he is caught in an oedipal struggle here, and that the language of sexuality will become a crucial element in his development. Further, the power hierarchies at play here, while not overtly a matter of colonial status, nonetheless are significant and part of the broad structure of authority surrounding Stephen&#x2014;the boys are in positions of authority over him because they withhold the social and metaphorical meanings of kissing from him. As Williams makes clear, the rules of the "schoolboy fraternity" are "more open than the virtually unnoticed recruitment into the ideology of church and state . . . [yet] at the level of language the interpenetration is so complete as to seem natural."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  For Williams, this episode revolves around Stephen's becoming socialized into the male values of the school, which in turn are imbued with the languages of church and state. Then we can read this moment, and Stephen's inability to choose one answer or another, as the beginning of his trajectory toward exile at the end of the novel.  </p>

<p>Beyond that, however, we can see that the specific terms of the choice make less difference than Stephen's instruction in the vagaries of the performative. In this episode, Stephen is not in control of the way his performance is coded. Whatever words Stephen utters will be "wrong," and even worse is his vacillation from one to the other. What is required of Stephen at the moment is not an assertion of his meaning-making ability in language but the reverse&#x2014;his complete disavowal of the power to make meaning, and his performance, with his answer, of subservience to the other boys. Thus, the semiotic imperative, as it were, of the episode is not within the specifically linguistic realm. Like Munoo, who is unaware of what it means, socially, to play a monkey, Stephen does not know what social meaning attaches to the verbal performance of a kiss or how to respond to a question whose answer is always already known. In both novels, the withholding of this social level of meaning-making by those in authority is made a crucial component of the hero's coming of age and his insertion into power hierarchies.  </p>

<p>Stephen's visit with the Dean of Studies in <i>Portrait</i> is the scene most often discussed in terms of the question of coloniality in the novel, though it is surprising how infrequently

<b></b>

 <i>Portrait</i> res in the many treatments of Joyce and colonialism.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  In Derek Attridge and Marjorie Howe's excellent edited collection, <i>Semi-Colonial Joyce</i>, only Howe treats <i>Portrait </i>at any length.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Surely we have all been taught to see the complexity of the interchange about the word "tundish" between Stephen and the Dean of Studies. But the passage immediately preceding that, where Stephen discusses Newman's use of the word "detain" and confuses the dean, is equally interesting. Stephen here is the one in control of multiple levels of language, running verbal circles around the dean, and he is aware that in using them he is attempting to exert power. Stephen highlights John Henry Newman's particular use of the word "detain," which Newman takes from the version of Ecclesiasticus used as an antiphon in Catholic services.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  The longer passage reads: "And so in Sion was I established, and in the holy city I likewise rested, and in Jerusalem was my power. And I took root in an honourable people, and in the glorious company of the saints was I detained. I was exalted like a cedar in Lebanus, and as a cypress in Mount Sion." The word "detain" here carries an unusually positive connotation that comes closer to the sense of being celebrated or embraced rather than hindered. Stephen refers to this as the use of the word according to the "literary tradition" rather than the "tradition of the marketplace." The dean misses Stephen's point on two levels, answering according to the "marketplace" use of the word ("not at all") when Stephen quotes the use of detain in the phrase "I hope I am not detaining you," and ignoring the "literary" reference to Newman (<i>P</i>, 164). In this short passage we can thus see Stephen not only lay claim to the literary tradition for himself but also demonstrate that the dean is completely outside it in the common world of the marketplace.  </p>

<p>Further, Newman's "Discourse" provides a deeper context for this discussion, which serves to extend its implications for Stephen's attempts to claim literary power. In the discourses on the Virgin Mary, Newman seeks to justify and promote the worship of the Virgin by gathering scripture that endorses her "tranquil influence" as a natural process and one devoid of challenge to the primacy of Jesus.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Much has been written about the many instances in <i>Portrait</i> where Stephen grapples with images of the Virgin Mary and with her worship, but none describe this as a tranquil process.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Mary and the Marian observances undergird the harsh piety of the retreat chapters in Section III where Stephen calls to "Mary refuge of sinners" to intercede for him and becomes a member of the sodality of the Blessed Lady (<i>P</i>, 115). As Christine Froula has pointed out, reference to the Annunciation also reappears frequently in <i>Portrait</i> (as in <i>Stephen Hero</i>), connected not only with Emma Cleary and Stephen's conflict over his desire for her, but also to Stephen himself in his role as artist. The language surrounding his creation of the villanelle&#x2014;" O! In the virgin womb of the imagination the word was made flesh. Gabriel the seraph had come to the virgin's chamber"&#x2014;thus employs the Annunciation as a metaphor for Stephen's poetic inspiration even as it marks his conflict among religious duty, authorship, and desire (<i>P</i>, 188). If in invoking Newman's discourses on the Virgin Stephen demonstrates his command of the religious and literary tradition behind the word "detain," he is also demonstrating his ability to put this tradition to his own uses. The virgin who is promoted in the chapters that follow this 

<b></b>

scene is a "virgin . . . of the imagination" wherein the "word is made flesh," not the one of the previous sections who would force renunciation. Implicit in this short passage about the word "detain," then, is the expression of Stephen's effort to remake both literary and religious tradition to his own worldly purposes, which directly challenges the dean's authority. </p>

<p>This short section of <i>Portrait</i> also invokes the Newman subtext in its formal arrangement. The source of the word "detain" in Newman's Discourse is an unspecified antiphon that would have been used as part of the mass or in vespers. An antiphon (from "antiphonen": sounding against, responsive sound, singing opposite, alternate chant) is a liturgical chant sung in response to a psalm, often emphasizing in some manner the key meaning of that psalm.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Originally "the verse serving as the antiphon text would be repeated on an independent melody after every verse of the psalm" and sung by the congregation.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In later church practice it became customary to repeat it only once before and after the psalm. However many times it repeats, the antiphon must always be seen as an interplay between voices, or an alternate chant, which serves to highlight underlying meanings in the main text. If we turn to the page in <i>Portrait</i> where Stephen's conversation with the dean appears, we can see that the intercut dialogue between the two functions much like this kind of "alternate chant:"  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>The use of the term in the marketplace is quite different. <i>I hope I am not detaining you</i> <br />
&#x2014;Not in the least, said the dean politely. <br />
&#x2014;No, no, said Stephen, smiling, I mean . . . <br />
&#x2014;yes, yes: I see, said the dean quickly, I quite catch the point: <i>detain</i>.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
[<i>P</i>, 164]
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The focus of emphasis here, unlike in a standard antiphon, seems not to be the particular meaning of a verse or speech but the absence of meaning in the conversation made salient by the confusion over the word "detain." Or, what emerges in this scene is Stephen's recognition of the dean's inadequacies and his own better command of the tradition. Thus, a form that is meant to highlight deep spiritual meanings in psalms, dissolves into empty repetition ("No, No . . . yes, yes") and wordplay that instead highlights the barrenness of what the dean can offer Stephen.  </p>

<p>Still any power gained by this word play is fleeting, as the familiar tundish scene that follows demonstrates. In that scene, the dean is ignorant of the word "tundish" which Stephen uses, in Irish fashion, to name a funnel used to fill a lamp. The dean seems innocently to want to acquire this new word, when Stephen recoils, remarking famously that "the language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine" (<i>P</i>, 166). But the word also comes to stand for the battle for authority between the dean and Stephen, in which Stephen must finally come out the loser. As Stephen thinks, "the little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe" (P,166). The possession of the meaning of the word does not confer power on Stephen here, since the word belonged to the English and after this conversation will, once again, belong to them. The ease with which the dean can expect Stephen to provide him with the definition and repossess it is the real story in this situation, and 

<b></b>

the source of the hurt Stephen suffers. In both the previous discussion about "detain" and this interlude concerning the tundish, Stephen must offer his knowledge and linguistic ability for the use of the (less gifted) dean, and even in resisting internally, must ultimately reinforce his own subservience. There is nothing he can say that will prevent this reenactment of power in this scene. Thus the profound lesson in coloniality here is not just about possession of the literary tradition or the power to control language (the: "it is his before it is mine"), but beyond that, the notion that among the colonized, real-world discursive authority trumps language play at all levels. In that sense, this scene is much like the one in Anand's <i>Coolie</i> where Mr. English is mocked and called a monkey, as we realize that no degree of verbal mockery, no matter how telling, will undermine the real world authority of a low-level Anglo bank official. In both of these novels, as I will discuss further, successful resistance requires the <i>rejection</i> of signification rather than its direct implementation or control, through the use of the extra-semiotic aspects of language such as sound, or what has been called the linguistic "remainder." </p>

<p>How do these episodes of disempowerment intersect with the representation of self-development in these novels? How can we understand the rejection of the direct power of signification within the tradition of the Bildungsroman to which, I argue, both of these writers are responding? In references to the history of the Bildungsroman Joyce's <i>Portrait </i>often appears as its twentieth-century apotheosis. As Buckley comments "Joyce sums up, even as he transforms, the traditions of the nineteenth-century Bildungsroman."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  This model of the novel of development is intimately tied to a sense of universalizable subjectivity and the notion of the hero as a representative man. Even Bakhtin, who makes Goethe's historicity and attention to location a key point in his discussion of the Bildungsroman, focuses on the notion of the emergence of the hero as "a new unprecedented human being" who has significance for the "historical future" writ large.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Moretti describes the goal of the Bildungsroman as the final synthesis of self and normative world into the "free individual of liberalism," a universal model of subjectivity and political citizenship.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  On the other hand, Hegel refers to the Bildungsroman as an inherently conservative genre, emphasizing the socialization of the hero rather than his continual individuation. Benjamin also considers the Bildungsroman to accomplish the justification of the social order that absorbs the hero.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  This seems to be the choice&#x2014;either individuation combined with a kind of exemplary status, or reincorporation&#x2014;but in both cases Bildung refers to an exemplary subject locked in a kind of discursive struggle with society. Presupposed are the separability of the two discursive positions, and the transparency of the subject's presentation in language, not to mention the function of narrative in advancing self-development.  </p>

<p>But it is not so clear that most twentieth-century Bildungsromane successfully accomplish even the primary goal of advancing self-development. According to Jed Esty, many modernist Bildungsromane have a surprisingly anti-teleological shape. Whether they describe characters like Woolf's Rachel Vinrace who, like Munoo in <i>Coolie,</i> dies before she can reach maturity, or others like Wilde's Dorian Grey who become caught in the time warp of endless youth (and we might certainly include Stephen Dedalus in 

<b></b>

that group), modernist Bildungsromane often subvert what seems to be the most salient component of the genre&#x2014;development&#x2014;even as they cling to its language, structure, process of characterization, and even ethical claims. Further, Esty also points out that in many of these anti-teleological Bildungsromane, what disrupts the development of the protagonists is often a colonial plot or setting. They "are anti-developmental fictions set in underdeveloped zones" that speak to us about the "connection between modernist aesthetics and modern colonialism."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Thus in most of the novels Esty studies, once the hero is positioned within or in relation to a colonial situation, the lack of development of the hero becomes intertwined with the failures of imperial politics. For Anand, whose entire oeuvre emerges out of the colonial context, there seems to be no possible alternative version of this story. The hero can not even dream of development. </p>

<p>Further, this question of the intrusion of imperialist politics into the Bildungsroman tradition disrupts it in more ways. To be sure the Bildungsroman emerges alongside the development of Enlightenment liberalism, it coincides with and contributes to the development of modern versions of nationality, and its heroes can often be seen to stand as heroic emblems of their nations. Bakhtin phrases it differently, writing of Goethe: "his creative imagination is also restricted and subordinated to the <i>necessity</i> of a given locality, the iron-clad logic of its historical and geographical existence."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  The intrusion of the imperial or colonial situation into the tradition, then, serves to interrupt not only the Bildungsroman itself but also the model of the nation that is red there. Esty asserts, </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Colonial modernity unsettles the discourse of national culture by breaking up its cherished continuities linking a people to its language, its territory, and its political history. It is not just the accelerating pace of economic and technological change that has this effect, nor even the values conflict between, for example, Britain's liberal heritage and the New Imperialism, but also &#x2014; and more directly to the narratological point &#x2014; it is that imperialism brings the Bildungsroman and its humanist ideals into the zone of uneven development, breaking the Goethean bond between biographical and "national-historical time".<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Said and others have made clear that imperialism develops alongside modernity and the modern nation-state&#x2014;it is not a later addition. What changes with the turn to the twentieth century is the possibility of thinking about the nation overtly in relation to empire, and, for some, of imagining a postcolonial world. But in many ways this new possibility runs contrary to what is necessary to sustain national identity. When Ernst Renan, at the end of the nineteenth century, claims that what holds a nation together is not language, territory, or common experiences, but rather its will to unity and its ability to forget what has divided it in the past, he is thinking of historical events, like the Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre in France, that pitted neighbor against neighbor. If we think about the 1920s and 1930s in Europe, I would argue, what occupies this crucial role of national forgetting is a kind of collective determination to overlook the role of the colonies in shoring up national unity and to ignore the constant possibility of the fall of the Empire (and thus the Imperial nation). For the growing national movement in India the question might be reversed, but no less intertwined with the question of 

<b></b>

empire. National identity in a former colony might be imaginatively constructed as "the absence of imperialism," and yet in the twentieth century it by necessity develops directly in response to empire.  </p>

<p>We also see here very clearly how a transnational perspective, especially one that moves our focus to the question of empire and colonialism, adjusts our understanding of modernism. Where critics looking only from within the European tradition might debate the success or failure of various twentieth century Bildungsromane, like <i>The Voyage Out</i> or <i>Portrait,</i> based upon the traditional form of the genre, from a transnational viewpoint we might see these European novels as raising concerns that are only made overt in the work of those like Anand. If <i>Portrait</i> leaves Stephen at what critics have seen as a moment well before maturity (and we may disagree about how mature he is even as he enters <i>Ulysses</i>), <i>Coolie </i>cuts its hero down in his mid-teens. Perhaps then <i>Coolie </i>is teaching us a lesson about how to read <i>Portrait</i>. The imbrication of nation and biography within a Bildungsroman set in a colony struggling for its independence ensures that the biography can not go far. The demands of the Bildungsroman tradition for a hero who emerges along with the epochal transition of the world around him are necessarily thwarted. The politics of the Bildungsroman in this place and time must be one of disruption, disillusionment and dislocation, even as we begin to glimpse the possibility of another kind of story. Thus, reading Anand into the body of modernism rather than as its appendage, mirror, or mime, means that the heroism of a coolie who suffers every conceivable setback on his road to maturity, even while becoming a spokesman for a grassroots movement of rebellion before his death at an early age, ought be seen as a model of modernist engagement with the consequences of Enlightenment historicism and the Bildungsroman. </p>

<p>Further, in neither <i>Portrait </i>nor <i>Coolie,</i> I would argue, are the main characters presented as either "free individual subjects of liberalism" or isolated heroes who become reincorporated into social life at the end of the novel. Breon Mitchell claims that in <i>Portrait</i> concrete separation of the hero from society, as in earlier Bildungsromane, gives way to "unbridgeable spiritual distance."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  And yet, we see in Stephen's interior musings, in his interaction with others, and even in his focalization of the narrative, the constant appearance of other voices and concerns that always surround his moments of isolation or distance and interrupt his reverie. Munoo in <i>Coolie</i> is even more contained within a communal discursive world, but one that keeps shifting as his social context changes: He can neither be separate nor, because of his class, his hill background, or his growing political awareness, become incorporated into the social world around him. Because both of these characters are from beginning to end implicated within multivocal, socially-constructed identities, and within various hierarchies of discursive power that are often treated ironically, they can neither be absorbed in nor escape the social realm and so cannot accomplish the traditional project of Bildung. </p>

<p>In <i>Portrait</i> we can see this linguistic embeddedness easily in the beginning and the end of the novel. The opening pages quickly demonstrate this structure: "Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road." Whose voice are we hearing? How is it presented to us? Whether understood as a direct 

<b></b>

transcription of the father's voice telling the young Stephen a story, the story told in indirect discourse through the main narrator's perspective, or a recasting of an oft-told story in the young Stephen's voice, we can see that Stephen's voice at this moment is inseparable from his father's. And even as we continue: "his father told him that story; his father looked at him through a glass; he had a hairy face," narrative perspectives merge (<i>P</i>, 6). We are also being told this story by a narrative voice focalized through Stephen and must struggle as does he, to distinguish self from other, son from father refracted through the glass, as if through a Lacanian specular image turned outward. We know from John James's letter to his son (Jan. 31, 1931) that this was a story Joyce heard from his father, and we also know that it was a version of an Irish myth.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Thus in beginning Stephen Dedalus's story of development with this tale, Joyce inserts him into a narrative matrix that immediately widens from the specific and personal (Simon Dedalus speaking to Stephen) to the cultural and mythic. Given that the status of the founding mythologies of Irish culture is precisely what is at stake in the Irish struggle against colonial rule, this moment also begins the novel's constant engagement with anticolonial struggle and the pitfalls of national consciousness.  </p>

<p>This same overdetermined social embeddedness appears at the end of the novel, where the diary represents the collapse of the appearance of narrative unity into the assemblage of its parts and voices. Within the space of five pages we read quotations from Blake and Yeats, references to Dante, Shakespeare, and the Bible, transcriptions of conversations with Davin, Cranly, and others, as well as moments where Stephen appears to be speaking to himself. "O, give it up old chap! Sleep it off!" he tells himself, voicing what many readers also wish they could tell Stephen in his final moment of self-aggrandizement. At no other time in the novel is it so apparent that Stephen's narrative is a conversation of many voices, dialogic in the most profound meaning of the term. These dialogic and deeply ironized final sections indicate that the narrative does not support Stephen's belief that he can retreat into a personal aesthetics, or into a way of understanding his place in the world separate from those around him. If he says to Cranly that he does not fear to be alone, he demonstrates a near addiction to conversation (<i>P</i>, 208). His claim to "silence, exile, and cunning" is of course spoken aloud and his talk of exile fraught with the potential (and the knowledge, once we have begun <i>Ulysses</i>) that it will be impermanent. The end of <i>Portrait</i> signifies neither the hero's triumph, maturation, nor his reincorporation into society; but rather the explosion of the conventional Bildungsroman along with its enforcement of liberal subjectivity, its insistence on a unified perspective, and its insistence on language as a transparent expression of that perspective. </p>

<p>Further, what replaces the "fusion of the liberal subject" in Joyce's novel is not the universal representative man but something more like what Hannah Arendt has called "enlarged thinking"&#x2014;that which moves us from an isolated individualized perspective to one always cognizant of its place among others." This perspective is in some respects akin to a Levinasian being-towards-the-others, yet importantly for Arendt (as opposed to Levinas), it also makes the transition from ethics to politics, moving concern from an abstracted or internal attitude about what ought to be towards a matter of engagement

<b></b>

 with what might be for an actual polity. Thus Arendt's notion helps to highlight relations among subjectivity, discourse and politics in Joyce and Anand. Arendt argues that, though we agree that morality concerns our conduct towards others, philosophers (Levinas notwithstanding) continually present moral maxims in terms of what they indicate about the self's relationship to itself, and not to public or social realms. Yet, as she argues, "I am only with my own self or the self of another when I am thinking, whereas I am in the company of the many when I start to act. Power for human beings . . . can only reside in one of the many forms of plurality."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  If we follow Arendt this far, we meet an impasse, and a predictable one at that. Morality, or ethics, opposes politics; thought seems to differ in kind from action, and these are dichotomies that appear final and compelling.  </p>

<p>However in another essay, Arendt describes the way that we engage in ethical thought: "we judge and tell right from wrong by having present in our mind some incident and some person, . . . that have become examples . . . our decisions about right and wrong will depend upon our choice of company, of those with whom we wish to spend our lives" (ibid, 145). The dichotomy weakens: we begin to reason morally by entering into company with others, expanding the realm of our thinking from the self or other, to the several. The leap to politics and to action is then one of degree rather than of order, from the one to the several, and finally to the realm of a social collectivity.  </p>

<p>There are moments in Kant where we can see the potential for this sort of a connection between ethics and politics by way of the collectivity, most notably in the section on the Doctrine of Right in the <i>Metaphysics of Morals</i>. Kant there argues for the primacy of communal possession of land, and therefore for the community as the origin of the right to property. "<i>A right to a thing</i> is a right to the private use of a thing of which I am in (original or instituted) possession in common with all others."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  The individual's right to use an object must derive from the community's possession of it for Kant, because there is no other way to derive the possibility of an individual possessing something outside itself. Thus a quality ascribed to the universal individual comes to that individual from society and not the other way around. This is the basis of all the other rights described in the Doctrine of Right, which has been used by theorists like John Rawls as a basis for political notions of justice. If we presume with Arendt that we are in some control of our associations beyond the family, creating our own communities, then the very process of associating with others becomes a constitutive process of the doctrine of rights.  </p>

<p>Arendt also foregrounds the notion of the company we keep, or the community we join, as one created in part by the models, real or fictional, that come into our minds and are perpetuated by the dialogue we carry out with that imagined company. This way of describing ethics makes clear that in order to exert power in the world, or to <i>move</i> from ethics to politics, one would not only strive toward being otherwise, as Levinas suggests, but also seek to create in the world a version of ethical company or community. Thus Kant's <i>sensus communis</i>&#x2014;the "sense that fits us into a community with others, makes us members of it, and enables us to communicate things"&#x2014;becomes a call to political action, a call to create a community where we can communicate our ethical positions and where they matter (<i>RJ</i>, 139). 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>But what does this say to the question of universality and the representative man? Certainly the notion of a social or political world surrounding the ethical subject does not work against the aspiration to universality in Kant, or in most post-Enlightenment ethical thought. On the other hand, once we begin to consider with Kant the claims upon a self of a specific right held by another, or the "judging and talking" that Hegel argues are the activities of selves in contact with others in the world, then the absolute wholeness of the subject and its ability to stand in for any other become diminished.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  If, in Hegel's terms, the consciousness is placed into a position of subservience to the state (as embodied in an individual), then it will be virtuous conduct on the part of that consciousness to obey&#x2014;to sacrifice "the single individual to the universal."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  In other words, the situation of being in the world and among other people, for both of these thinkers (as in a different manner for Arendt), introduces specific dynamics of power and reciprocity and challenges the absolute universality of the representative man. Being among others, even as imagined in a fantasy conversation within a narrative, puts in motion a specific instantiation of ethical conduct, which brings with it the potential for politics.  </p>

<p>For Arendt, narrative also helps us move from this "enlarged" way of thinking to a potentially active political engagement with others. She will emphasize that the company with whom we spend our lives are chosen from examples both real and fictional, and that we think through dilemmas in a form of dialogic narrative.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  These are distinctly literary ways of linking ethics to politics; not only does Arendt begin from imagined situations and characters, but she progresses through storytelling and the narrative creation of a community of interlocutors all the way to direct political action. The result is a conception of engagement that acknowledges the role of fiction in the creation of social identities and that assumes dialogic narrative as one of its primary modes.  </p>

<p>Arendt's linked conceptions of enlarged thinking and engagement thus hold profound implications for understanding the potential modes of social engagement in experimental fiction. For example, what might be seen as the failure of the Bildungsroman in <i>Portrait </i>might instead be read as its entrance into politics, where the question of just how self and community are implicated in each other overrides the possibility of Stephen's reincorporation into his social world. Further, politics becomes here clearly a narrative matter, where the breakdown of narrative self-certainty and coherence also connotes the breakdown of the conception of the representative man with his aspirations to universality. Joyce's experimentation with focalized perspective, with the problem of language and its potential as at once a form of social control and its undoing, and with the matter of Stephen as decentered subject, all ask us to think politically about Stephen's relationship to his community, and to revise our notions about both the conservative force of Bildung and the moral power of the singular, representative man.  </p>

<p>The same dynamic is much more obviously true of Munoo in <i>Coolie</i> who never has the potential to aspire to universality or self-completeness, and whose failure to mature as in a proper Bildungsroman is even more starkly drawn than in <i>Portrait</i>. If Anand has given us an ordinary hero to follow on his journey towards death at the end of the novel, his title <i>Coolie</i> makes clear (as in the earlier novel <i>Untouchable</i>) that he is one of a class of individuals rather than an exemplary re. Once again, the political

<b></b>

 engagement of the novel begins with this critique of the Bildungsroman tradition, because we know that the colonial power hierarchies and discourses surrounding Munoo prevent him from ever approaching the possibility of civic citizenship. But that he nonetheless commands our attention and compassion, and eventually rises in the climax of the novel to direct political engagement as a member of a worker's action, also means that the novel has proposed an alternate logic of politics and selfhood, one based in nonuniversalized subjectivity and enlarged thinking, which we can also use for reading Joyce.  </p>

<p>The matter of the uncontrollability of words and the impossibility of restricting their meaning, even within the multiple power hierarchies surrounding them, plays a crucial role in this alternative political logic for both Joyce and Anand. Certainly, it is clear that at the textual level language itself often escapes limitation to strict meaning-making and operates by other principles. This is what Derrick Attridge, echoing Derrida, has identified in the Joycean context as "the remainder, that aspect of language's functioning, which in spite of its necessity is often repressed from our consciousness."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Sound often takes the place of semiotics as the focus of language use, with the result that another level of play complicates the social terrain our heroes must traverse. Of course Joyce is notorious for this&#x2014;though it is more often remarked in his later work. But as Attridge points out, there are many moments in <i>Portrait</i> where nonsense, or repetition, or rhythm and melody emerge.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  From the "tra, la la" on page one, to "Apologize put out his eyes," to the repetition of "stephaneforus" later in the novel, the musicality of pure syllables plays an important role in presenting what escapes Stephen's attempts to control his own development, thus furthering Joyce's critique of Bildung. He asks himself the question: "Did he then love the rhythmic rise and fall of words far better than their associations?" but we know that whichever way he answers, <i>both</i> realms of language determine the character Stephen and his text (<i>P</i>, 140).  </p>

<p>This is precisely what Anand responds to in pointing out the musicality of Joyce's language as an important element that connects them. For Anand "the sound of the words dictating sense" in Joyce's writing was like his "mother's mumbo-jumbo prayers" (<i>CB</i>, 7). We know from Anand's autobiography that this was not a criticism, since he loved listening to his mother's Sikh prayers, which were in a language he didn't understand. So, when the first three paragraphs of <i>Coolie</i> each begin with the repeated utterance of a version of its hero's name "Munoo ohe Munooa oh Mundo," turned into a musical mantra, much like the schoolboys' shouts of "stephaneforus" in <i>Portrait</i>, we know that we are being asked to attend to "remainder," to the level of language use that escapes semiotics and the control of the user, and that can confuse or resist conventional discursive authorities.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  These kinds of moments appear regularly throughout <i>Coolie</i>&#x2014;indeed more frequently than in <i>Portrait</i>. Sometimes it is in the form of a cry of fear or surprise uttered by Munoo as he is accosted or derided; other times it is in the form of a string of abuse ("ohe you seducer of your daughter!"; "you illegally begotten . . . you son of a pig") that is not meant to be interpreted literally (<i>C</i>, 143, 154). Still other times it is the rhythmic repetition of syllables or sounds, which add extra dimension to the connotative power of speech. It becomes, however, directly 

<b></b>

political in the climactic scene when the union leader Sauda exhorts the factory workers to strike, and the crowd calls back "Shabash! Shabash! Sauda Sahib!" (Bravo! Bravo! Sir Sauda!) (<i>P</i>, 260). Here the political importance of linguistic remainder emerges as the workers begin to take on force through their appropriation of a mode of meaning-making not within the purview of conventional systems of discursive power. This speech is in many ways the climax of the novel and one of its most moving moments, as we sense the potential for collective action among the disenfranchised crowds and see Munoo rise to real engagement. Despite the fact that the authorities successfully break up the strike by pitting Hindus against Muslims, it unites the workers&#x2014;or more broadly speaking, the coolies&#x2014;as possessors of the remainder: of play, of the power of language outside the bounds of authority, and of layers of meaning not glimpsed by their British and Indian overlords.  </p>

<p>The unusual quality of language in Anand's fiction has also been marked as crucial to the development of Indian writing in English and its representation of India's linguistic diversity. As Feroza Jussawalla points out, in the 1930s and 1940s the question of what kind of language might best be used to represent Indian experience in literature becomes a crucial subject of debate.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Critics take R. K. Narayan to task, for example, for using English almost exclusively, especially when at times his English seems either stilted or impoverished (<i>FQ</i>, 70&#x2013;5). Others defend the unusual syntax or vocabulary in Narayan's work as an effort at representing Tamil speech patterns within an English language narrative. As one critic maintains, "Narayan's novels are so satisfyingly Indian perhaps because they are so authentically South Indian . . . through skillful use of the English language he delineates people whose actions, behaviour, and responses are shaped by a language different from English" (qtd. in <i>FQ</i>, 74).  </p>

<p>Anand, on the other hand, in those moments of nonliteral meaning-making and emergence of the remainder, also takes a significant step toward the incorporation of local languages and habits of speech into English language writing. At times he attempts to translate Hindi and Punjabi phrases into English; at other moments what emerges is a representation of the sound of that language in English, without concern for its absolute intelligibility. In his words, </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I found, while writing spontaneously, that I was always translating dialogue from the original Punjabi into English. The way in which my mother said something in the dialect of Central Punjab could not have been expressed in any other way except in an almost literal translation, which might carry over the sound and sense of the original speech. </p>

	<div class="attrib">
[qtd. in <i>FQ</i>, 84]
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">At other times Anand will mix the two languages, putting snippets of English within a Hindi phrase or vice versa. He incorporates new coinages without apology, arguing in his essay, "Pigeon-Indian: Some Notes on Indian Writing in English," that the real everyday use of a combined language, whether it is transparent in meaning or not, ought to be represented in the fiction that emerges out of India.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Anand's resistance to verbal transparency and his synthesis of more than one language often prompts critics to praise his attempts at mimetic realism and verisimilitude. 

<b></b>

Feroza Jussawalla, whose book <i>Family Quarrels</i> focuses a chapter on this question, argues strongly for the appropriateness of Anand's revisions of English. Still, she feels the need to cite linguists who endorse the linguistic combinations in Anand's novels as accurate. Other critics simply note that "although awkward" Anand's novels " are pioneering in their attempt to render into English the exuberant dialects of Northern India" (<i>HIL</i>, 179). On the other hand, I would argue that reading Anand from a transnational perspective, and in light of Joyce, makes clear the inadequacy of describing these quasi-Hindi, quasi-English moments in Anand purely in terms of verisimilitude. However important they may be to the development of a new vernacular in India, they are equally crucial as moments of disruption and play. If the new "pigeon-English" of the Coolie or the Untouchable cannot be assimilated into either the standard English of Empire or the Hindi of a caste-conscious India, then it contains the possibility of resistance to both. This neither/nor language provides the moment of potential power for those shut out of conventional hierarchies, since it creates its own system of signification. This language use also points the way out of Stephen's conundrum regarding the dean's use of the words "detain" and "tundish," for a newly developed syncretic language can never be called "his before it is mine," nor will it always succumb to the possessor of power over the marketplace tradition.  </p>

<p>Thus, this use of language&#x2014;of style, if you will&#x2014;carries heavy political and social weight here. It belies the truism that engaged writing lacks interest in stylistics and that political novels tend toward stripped-down realism. It also expands the political dimension of our understanding of style in both <i>Coolie </i>and<i> Portrait</i>. What escapes control in Anand's novel is Munoo, his name, what he stands for, the Coolie, the orphan nation, just as Stephen escapes his definition not only by family, religion, and Ireland but also within the rubric of the representative man. If we see Anand's <i>Coolie</i> as very definitely and dramatically an anticolonial novel because it musters the forces of a revised model of Bildung to the side of an orphaned laborer; because it insists on material reality and not the mystical or religious realm as the scene of self-development and enlarged thinking; and because it presents the many layers of discourse, within a highly-focalized novel, as still leaving a remainder that might be the domain of the disenfranchised; then we might also read those elements, which Anand saw and admired in Joyce's <i>Portrait</i>, as important to political struggle. Reading Joyce and Anand together from a transnational, comparative perspective helps bring Anand to the center of the conversation about modernist experimentation and its connection to politics and makes a case for his work as a constitutive element of international modernism. Reading Joyce and Anand together also forces us to see the "cross-cultural, intertextual" fabric of anticolonial writing in the 1920s and 1930s, as well as its use of linguistic remainder to escape the dominance of the colonial powers over everyday language use. We are thus encouraged to look beyond the words in <i>Portrait</i> "I go . . . to forge in the smithy of my soul . . ." to see a political struggle for discursive authority that brings Stephen, Munoo, and us as readers, into the realm of enlarged thinking and political engagement.

<p><a name="FOOT9" href="#REF9">9</a>. Kristen Bluemel argues that we class Anand's work as "intermodernism" since the bulk of it is accomplished in the 1930s and 1940s. Despite the importance of her effort to highlight often neglected writers from those decades, I would like to claim that rather than adopt a new term, what we need to do is revise and expand our understanding of modernism so that it can be focused just as easily on the writings of an engag&#x00E9; Indian as on the experiments of Joyce. This essay, and the larger project of which it forms a part, is one attempt at that expansion. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT45" href="#REF45">45</a>. Here we might also think about the recurring chant of "esmiss esmoor" at the end of the trial chapter of Forster's <i>Passage to India</i> (New York: Harbrace, 1924), 225. At that point in the novel the proper name "Mrs. Moore" gets transformed into a similar kind of non-literal maker, which takes on a political meaning not contained in its ordinary use. We can code this as a remainder, since for most 

<b></b>

of the people chanting in the streets "esmiss esmoor" is pure musicality, and has no real connection to Mrs. Moore herself. And yet it does not serve quite the same function in Forster's novel as does remainder in Anand's since the use of the name of Mrs. Moore does clearly invoke the position she has taken in the chapters surrounding the trial. Of course, since the novel emerges mainly out of the perspective of the British characters, the use of this chant is also caught up with the orientalist sense of Indian "mystery" that surrounds the caves and other native elements. If the Malabar Caves are a floating signifier that can be coded in many different ways depending on context and perspective, so can "esmiss esmoor." This gives it power primarily as the "other" of rational language use, and not as a true alternative to it. </p>
