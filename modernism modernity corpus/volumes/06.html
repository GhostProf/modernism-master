The original motivation for this paper was an invitation to provide the
opening address for a conference on "Rethinking Englishness: English
Art 1880-1940," held at the University of York in England in 1997,
under the aegis of the Department of History of Art, in association with
the Henry Moore Institute. In announcing an agenda for the conference,
the organisers referred to an admonition which I published in 1981
in the original preface to my book <I>English Art and Modernism
1900-1939</I>: "There is a need for a study of this period of
art which is not subject to the traditional closures on art-historical
writing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The organisers' implication was that the need still existed, and that
 the project in question was one to which the conference should attend.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I accepted the invitation with some trepidation, conscious that in the
course of the past near-twenty years, I almost alone among those likely
to attend had conducted no significant research into the English art
of the period under review. (Since the time my book was published there
has been a massive growth in studies of the subject). At the time of my
acceptance I tried the patience of a friend by describing the difficulty
I anticipated in contributing to the rethinking of Englishness. "Well",
he suggested, "imagine that someone has a gun to your head and you've
got to come up with a series of lectures on early twentieth-century
English art. What are you going to say?" The answer came easily enough:
"I'd say pull the trigger."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And yet, of course I felt obliged to answer to the statement to which
I had put my name some sixteen years before. The

<B></B>

results are represented in the paper that follows. Its purpose was
to make some sense on the one hand of the retrospect to which the use
of the quotation seemed to commit me, and on the other of my present
distance from the enterprise to which the quoted statement was originally
addressed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 I make no pretense to an overview of the present state of scholarship
 regarding early-twentieth century English art. As a form of individual
 testimony, this paper stands or falls by its relevance to the more
 general study of modern art, and by its bearing on conditions by which
 those engaged in comparable areas of study are variously if sometimes
 unwittingly affected.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In its original context my admonition was followed by a necessary
disclaimer: my book, I said, was not the project that I had prescribed. In
including that disclaimer I meant in part to acknowledge my inability--and
indeed my disinclination--to provide the kind of detailed social history
that seemed then to be required. My task as I saw it was simply to
review the terms upon which the modern in English art had been singled
out, and in the process to work for a more sophisticated understanding
of the nature of modernism in general. It certainly surprised me that
the book was seen as "Marxist" by some of its English reviewers and
by all of the very few Americans who noticed it. But it was certainly
<I>not</I> so seen by Timothy J. Clark, whose identification with the
Marxist intellectual tradition was more properly earned, and who supplied
a generous testimonial which the publishers in their wisdom declined to
print. Why was I so sure, then, that it was by a detailed social history
that the traditional closures on art-historical writing might be opened?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To answer that question I need to provide some background. The work on
which <I>English Art and Modernism</I> was largely based was done in
the 1960s, and it was driven by two primary motives. On the one hand I
wished to jettison a hopelessly untheorised sense of identification with
the modern in art; on the other I meant to establish some intellectual
distance from what was at the time the dominant mode of modern art
history in the English-speaking countries, which I saw as a form
of unquestioning modernist liberalism resting uneasily on a base of
snobbish antiquarianism. At the outset, I assumed that these motives
were complementary and self-supporting. But during the long period over
which I tried actually to write the book<I>,</I> that assumption was
subject to drastic revision. I was alerted to the uncomfortable truth
by friends I made among the artists of the Art &amp; Language group
at the very end of the 1960s: an untheorised identification with the
modern in art is virtually <I>indistinguishable</I> from unquestioning
modernist liberalism. It followed that an enthusiasm for the modern could
be worth little unless the culture of that enthusiasm were itself opened
to inquiry and to explanation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the original preface to my book, I represented this lesson to myself in
terms of a barely veiled reference to Clive Bell, who had suggested that
works of art speak for themselves to those who have ears to hear--which
is to say to those sufficiently sensitive to "formal qualities."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 If there were any readers who still wished to persist with this
 notion, I implied, my book would disappoint them. In the spirit of this
 declaration, Clark wrote of my book that "it begins the process, which
 will surely continue,

<B></B>

of rescuing modern art from its admirers." Ironically, it was probably
just that verdict that alarmed the original publishers, who, since the
book was also to contain pictures, could only conceive of it as a kind
of coffee-table item directed explicitly at the admirers in question.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The simple explanation for my sense of the need for social-historical
detail, then, is that it was the standard counter to what has been
represented as modernist formalism, which, like so many others at
the time, I tended mistakenly to conflate with the culture of art
appreciation. If Clive Bell and others claimed that art spoke to those
who had ears to hear, then the riposte would be that the constituency
he had in view was more effectively picked out in sociological terms
than on grounds of any criterion like sensitivity. Those who had ears
to hear, in other words, had actually been identified as such long
before they had demonstrated their actual competence as interpreters or
explainers of art--or of art, at least, that was not preselected for
its congeniality to their worldviews and self-images. They were that
social section already active in France by the mid-nineteenth century
as the self-appointed proprietors of modernist culture and as arbiters
of aesthetic virtue: the advanced section of the haute bourgeoisie or
hereditary middle class; that class's semiautonomous avant-garde in a
historically significant struggle for power with the rising commercial
bourgeoisie or lower middle class. In explanation of any cultural item
favoured by the members of this avant-garde, the claim that the artist
did his work out of some inner necessity must always be asserted in
face of the vulgar "He did it for the money"--to quote a formula from
<I>Art-Language</I> of the early 1980s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Clive Bell described artists as people who "do not produce to live--they
 live to produce,"<SUP> </SUP>thus strategically putting them outside the
 human species as defined from a historical-materialistic perspective,
 since from within that latter perspective it is precisely the need
 to provide the means of subsistence that defines humans as historical
 beings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 If the likes of Clive Bell could be made adequately to represent
 the English culture of modernism, it followed that the appropriate
 tool for the critical and oppositional job must be some form of
 historical-materialist explanation: the social-historical scenario
 of <I>everyone</I> doing it for the money--or doing it, at least, in
 accordance with some commensurable material determination.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the rare occasions when I can now bear to open my book on English
art, it is the untidy joins and conflicts and contradictions that tend
unfailingly to catch my eye. Attempts at a form of historical-materialist
criticism sit side-by-side with statements about individual works
of art that presuppose a form of autonomy both for the compositional
aspects of those works and for the responses they avail. So the simple
explanation for my broader assertion that a social history of English
art was needed was this: I meant to acknowledge the incompleteness of
my own scepticism regarding the values works of art had been supposed
to enshrine. Perhaps <I>English Art and Modernism</I> might have been
more coherent had it been finished earlier and before I began to have
"doubts". Then I could have more easily put it behind me and tried to
become a full-blooded social historian or social anthropologist.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This conjecture raises an alternative possibility. Might it have been
possible to sort out the contradictions in more positive fashion had
the publication been delayed even longer? The question itself goes to a
non-disconfirmable hypothesis and is no doubt fruitless to pursue. But
what can be said is that I was contracted to write a sequel on the art
of the following forty years, that I made various attempts to do so
throughout the 1980s, and that the more I wrote the worse it got.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There were many reasons for the difficulties I experienced, and of course
some of them are personal and irrelevant to the matter in hand. But my
principal problem was one that has bearing on the possible agenda for a
"rethinking" of "Englishness." The truth is that it seemed ever harder
to treat English art as a case study of the character and development of
modernism without adopting one or the other of two contrasting modes:
to contain the subject and thus to maintain its integrity, by letting
a nationalistic interest control what came up for the count as modern;
or, alternatively, to maintain a larger sense of proportion, but at the
risk of a kind of continual and unpatriotic carping at small achievements.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course neither of these modes needed to be problematic, so long as
the issue of purely aesthetic merit could be kept at bay. But there
were two reasons why that proved impossible. First, was that aesthetic
merit is never pure or uncontingent--for all that some modernists are
supposed to believe that it is--so that aesthetic considerations tend
to insinuate themselves even into those texts from which they have been
most determinedly banished. Second, if the question of aesthetic value
<I>could</I> somehow be relegated to a second-order discourse--such as a
social-historical discourse about the mechanisms of fixing of value--then
there would be nothing left to distinguish and to contain Art History
as an intellectual discipline; nothing, that is, apart from professional
self-interest and bad faith.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There seemed, then, to be two equally unattractive alternatives to
consider: a social history of later twentieth-century English art
which would effectively be a form of broad socio-economic history
yet one crippled by the weakness of its examples and the evasiveness
of its judgements; or an analysis of the aesthetic character of
late modernism--in all its impurity and contingency--in which a few
English artists might just get walk-on parts. In fact the nature of the
dichotomy was already clear enough by the time my first book was finally
published. The English artist Tom Phillips was among those who reviewed
<I>English Art and Modernism 1900-1939. </I>He complained that I had
not said enough to establish a sense of proportion: to make clear--for
instance--that the best of Vorticism wasn't up to the best of Cubism. I
published a snotty letter in response, advertising my projected sequel
and assuring Phillips that I would properly delineate the confines of
the pond in which he swam, "lest the brilliance of his own splashings
be lost to view."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 I felt smug about my riposte at the time, but of course it was my own
 dilemma I was really exposing. That I would somehow have to locate Tom
 Phillips and his ilk in my art-historical tableau was one of the many
 reasons I couldn't proceed with my text.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It took me a very long time to silence the voice of what I came in the
end to recognise as a repressive conscience, and to admit to myself that
the sequel was a book I

<B></B>

was never going to write. The admission was liberating when it finally
came. My conclusion was that a social history of English art might well
be written, albeit not by me; but that there could be no viable study
of the modern, whether in English art or in art at large, without some
non-sociological grounds upon which to determine what is and is not
deserving of attention. And by non-sociological I mean adequately
theorised in aesthetic, or formal, or, let us say, Greenbergian
terms--a requirement which seemed to rule out any use of Englishness as
a criterion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was not entirely coincidental that my appearance at the conference on
"Rethinking Englishness" came as an interruption in teaching at a Summer
School of the British Open University, to which I was obliged to return
as soon as my paper was read. In the yearlong course on Modern Art of
which this Summer School forms a part, there is no discussion whatsoever
of English art as such.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 If selection is to be made from the period 1880-1940, how many
 works of English art are likely to be treated as exemplary in teaching
 students about art? Not about art history, but about art, for that is
 what most of the Open University's students come to learn about. The
 simple answer is that it is the negative cases that come most easily to
 mind. There are certainly didactic points that can be made by reference
 to John Byam Shaw, to Stanley Spencer, to Henry Moore at his worst. But
 we should be suspicious, I think, of the very usefulness of such work
 to the task of connecting art history to the local concerns of more
 popular disciplines: literature or history or sociology or psychology. If
 we rely on them too much, how are we to interest our students in the
 work of Van Gogh, or Matisse or David Smith, difficult as it can be to
 connect such work to anything at all without lapsing into irrelevance?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So far as art is concerned, then, it now seems hard to see an interest in
Englishness per se as <I>other</I> than inauspicious. It is less clear
that the social history of English art is an endemically unpromising
project, but it may well be. Of course the idea that works of art
"speak for themselves" is still deserving of examination. There is a
continuing need to trace those works back into the complex conditions of
their production, and to demonstrate that historical accounts of those
conditions may be--indeed must be--various and mutually inconsistent. But
over the past twenty years works of English art seem to have discovered
plenty of people to speak for them and to interpret them as the products
of a history. Social-historical exegesis does indeed have the capacity
to render any object apparently vivid so long as it can embed it in
a ramified discourse, or otherwise build a sufficient human context
around it. I say <I>apparently</I> vivid, however, because the price of
this ramification is often to render the work in question effectively
irrelevant to the larger concerns of the discourse. The harder task,
it seems, is to extract from the work of art as an intentional object
that light that reveals its own specific ramifications--harder because
these ramifications may not be such as to confirm any well-established
set of historical generalisations or any well-supported account of the
surrounding culture. It follows that the more the art is complex in any
critically significant sense, the more it matters that one stay with
it and not bury it in anecdote. It has to be said that this demand runs
counter to the prevailing professional tendency of modern art history,
which is to

<B></B>

position the work of art according to what are now seen as the defining
complexities of the discipline. Through such positioning we advertise a
degree of intellectual and methodological sophistication. This may be
all very well, but it is not necessarily the same as facing up to the
complexities and opacities that art itself may present.

This lesson was brought home to me at about the time when
<I>English Art and Modernism</I> was first published, when Art
&amp; Language's engagement with the art of painting made me both
a witness and a contributor to inescapable acts of discrimination
in the studio--acts of discrimination which tended to start with
some form of the question, "What is this thing we have made?" (<A
HREF="6.1harrison_1.html"> 1</A>). The realization that it
was modernism and not "Englishness" that I was interested in thus
coincided with a conclusion of a slightly different kind: that what
really distinguishes art from other cultural materials is its aspect
as something made, and made to be regarded as intentional under some
description--the point being that the description in question

<B></B>

will be more or less otiose or irrelevant to the making unless it poses
problems for available historical generalizations and cultural theories
and self-images. Surely, it is just this power to pose problems that we
recognize in calling a work modern. For modernism is itself a form of
criticism, and a far more complex one than many critiques of modernist
art history or modernist art criticism have been able to allow. So much
for the supposed conflation of modernism with mindless art appreciation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It seems then, that I need to reinterpret the admonition that was borrowed
to announce the agenda of "Rethinking Englishness". If the inhibiting
closures on art-historical writing are not such as to be opened by
social history, just what was the failing to which my statement was
meant to call attention? I can best explore this question by means of
a kind of case study. In the process I will try to fill out what I mean
in referring to modernism as a form of criticism.

The culminating moment in the narrative of <I>English Art and
Modernism</I> was the avant-garde phase of the mid-1930s, when
Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth pursued a highly refined form of
abstract art. Looking back to this moment as an earnest researcher in
the 1960s I saw it as the point at which Englishness became successfully
merged, however briefly, with cosmopolitan modernism. In fact to talk
of merging is to fail to catch the value I then associated with that
moment. For me, the particular virtue of Ben Nicholson's white reliefs
(<A HREF="6.1harrison_2.html"> 2</A>) and

<B></B>

of Barbara Hepworth's abstract carvings (<A
HREF="6.1harrison_3.html"> 3</A>) was that they represented the
very extinction of Englishness--of Englishness, at least, as an attribute
that might be indexed with any real critical effect to their formal
and stylistic properties. It was clear enough from comments published
at the time that this was how those works were seen by some of their
contemporary viewers. It was also clear that this extinction was felt
to be dangerous--somehow totalitarian and inhuman--and by none so much
as the articulate British representatives of a more moderate and more
domesticated modern art; people like Geoffrey Grigson, Myfanwy Piper
and, later, Robin Ironside, each of whom wrote with some sense of
responsibility and even proprietorship with respect to the values of
the national culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 I have argued elsewhere that the sophisticated litt&eacute;rateurs had
 already turned the critical climate against modernist abstract art in
 England even before the Second World War came to replenish the reserves
 of insularity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The more reason for my admiration of the artists' enterprise. Not only
 were they working against odds to bring the native artistic tributary
 into the international mainstream, in the process they were struggling
 against the inhibiting cultural power of the literary, and against the
 desires of those anxious to secure the natural world in the image of
 their own values. I'm grateful to the art historian David Masters for
 allowing me to borrow a quote that he recently elicited from Myfanwy
 Piper. Denying that her eclectic anthology <I>The Painter's Object</I>
 of 1937 was in any sense intended to make it better for the national
 culture in face of the publication of <I>Circle--</I>the determinedly
 international "<I>Survey of Constructive Art</I>" published in the same
 year--she claimed that she would have invited Nicholson and Hepworth
 to contribute had they only been "better writers".

I do not now mean to withdraw my assessment either of the singularity of
the artists' work or of the repressive nature of the writers' recourse
to insular and primarily literary values. But it seems to me that the
point may now be of limited critical interest. From the perspective of
the end of the century, we look back over a different

<B></B>

thirty-year gap, to the moment of the late 1960s and early 1970s, and
to another avant-garde, also determinedly anti-literary, for all its
preoccupation with the relations of art and language. The pursuit
of the modern in art has become associated with different kinds of
critical enterprize. For my own part I recall how involvement in the
Art &amp; Language indexing project of 1972-74 seemed gradually
but decisively to transform the practical grounds of thought, and in
particular of thought about the relations between history and modernity
and between art and criticism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 More generally the study of art history has become accommodated to
 critiques of modernist historicism, to forms of recuperation of the
 previously marginalized, to a dissolution of the containing boundaries
 between artworks and the world, and to an extensive questioning of
 concepts of medium, canon, mainstream and so on. From this changed
 perspective it would not be hard to represent Nicholson's white reliefs
 as late and bureaucratized forms of a historicistic modernist culture
 which had already by the late 1930s been shown up as unrealistic
 in its international and utopian pretensions. When set against the
 self-interested temporizing of the <I>litt&eacute;rateurs</I> in the mid
 to late 1930s, the idea that the European modern movement represented
 authentic mainstream culture might still seem attractive. The derogation
 of Nicholson's principled abstractions to the advantage of John Piper's
 topographical whimsies (<A HREF="6.1harrison_4.html"> 4</A>)
 must remain an irredeemably conservative and

<B></B>

provincial gambit, which is to say that it could never be justifed on
aesthetic grounds. But we have now learned to look behind the supposedly
authentic for the unsightly material it serves to occlude--and in the
case of Nicholson's white reliefs the occluded material seems to cover
all and any trace of biological determination upon psychological life. In
contrast, what now seems to distinguish such works as Hepworth's <I>Three
forms </I>in white marble ( 3) is less its modern-movement austerity
than its quasi-metaphorical identity as a trio of individuals conceived
in terms of physical touch and containment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 This may turn out to be a sentimental assessment of Hepworth's work,
 and thus one in the end irrelevant to the matter of its aesthetic
 interest. But however we decide on that issue, modern-movement claims
 for the universality of abstract art are unlikely now to recover their
 credibility.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="5" HREF="6.1harrison_5.html">
<IMG

ALIGN="LEFT"
SRC="button/6.1harrison_5b.gif"></A>

Let me come clean, though I risk a certain loss of face in doing so. An
interest in the art of Ben Nicholson was the principal motivating force
for the work that led to <I>English Art and Modernism</I>. He played
a central role in the story it was written to tell. The painter Gwen
John, on the other hand, is not even mentioned in the book. Yet if
I were now required to choose a work by one or the other--let us say
to live with--it is the picture by Gwen John that I would take. (<A
HREF="6.1harrison_5.html"> 5</A>) Of course, such statements
of preference tend to combine rhetorical effectiveness with theoretical
emptiness. In this case, who is to decide whether I am guilty of that form
of intellectual fashion by means of which a born-again anti-modernism
gets to parade in the clothes of the postmodern; whether my eyes have
been opened by a desperate need for the

<B></B>

approval of my feminist colleagues; or whether there is no more to be made
of my decision than that the Gwen John would go better with the wallpaper?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact I have to allow each of these potential explanations to be a kind
of half truth. On the first count, as the hope of socialism sinks ever
further beneath the horizon, it would indeed be vain to look for stability
in the relations between modernism, conservatism, and Englishness. On the
second count, it would be equally vain to deny the work that has been done
by women working in the field of art history, power not simply to draw
new attention to the art of derogated women artists, but also to render
insecure many common assumptions about how and with what interests we
look, and about how we represent that looking to ourselves. And on the
last count, while there may actually be no wallpaper in my home for the
Gwen John to chime with, my reluctance to give imaginary house room to
Nicholson's work is based on the not entirely unfounded expectation that
it would sooner or later disappear without remainder into any congenial
scheme of decor--as I suspect a Mondrian or a Rothko would not.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I had better try to explain myself. In England in the 1960s it seemed
appropriate and necessary to identify modernism first and foremost with
the critique of insularity, and with the search for some broader basis
for self-criticism and for stylistic development than the native culture
on its own could furnish. In part, no doubt, this was because there
were parallels to be drawn between the significance of the European
modern movement to the English art of the 1930s, and the significance
of American modernism to the English art of the 1960s. But of course new
kinds of critical material were carried within the later developments, and
some of these, as they filtered down into art-critical and art-historical
practice, were such as to require revision of the principles upon which
those practices conducted their own forms of self-criticism. One clear
change was that the concept of art as exemplary design for a better world
came to be replaced by a view of art as necessarily resistant to the
priorities of design. It is precisely the lack of this resistance that
now makes Nicholson's work look relatively meagre in its credentials
as art. I think of a passage from a letter published by Mark Rothko in
1945: "If previous abstractions paralleled the scientific and objective
preoccupations of our times, ours are finding a pictorial equivalent
for man's new knowledge and consciousness of his more complex inner self."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 All too often now, Design History acts as the mere lubricant that
 smoothes the descent of Art History into Cultural Studies, where
 Nicholson's work remains exemplary of a certain taste, but where work
 such as Rothko's could hardly expect to meet with that combination of
 need and spirit that he looked for in his audience.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Let me make clear what I am <I>not</I> saying. I am not saying that
works of art have no stable and intrinsic properties. That they do have
intrinsic properties and that these do not change without physical decline
or intervention seems to me to be precisely what assures their abiding
value. There may be a tendency over time for judgements to converge
with regard to this value. It is this tendency that the likes of Clement
Greenberg had in mind in claiming objectivity for the consensus of taste.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<B></B>

It does not follow, however, that our views are likely to converge
upon some one true account of the properties by which that value is
established. Why should they? To paraphrase Barry Barnes, while we may
allow the work of art to be the final arbiter of any account of it,
there is no reason to suppose any tendency to convergence either in our
interpretations or in the reasons we give for our judgements.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 On the contrary, how we perceive and understand the work of art
 is a matter which is subject to continual change in accordance with
 shifts in our knowledge, interests, cognitive capacities, and material
 circumstances, however banal. I am saying neither that Nicholson's work
 has somehow got worse, nor that my judgement has got better. I am saying
 that as the projective political implications of that work have come
 to seem less interesting, it has become harder to ignore those aspects
 which were always present as signs of its psychological conservatism. By
 the same token it has become easier to perceive the relative technical
 and psychological sophistication of Gwen John's work, and to connect
 that sophistication to a renewed sense of modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Specifically, her work may be associated with a current of concerns
by which painting was animated from the 1860s for about fifty years
(for instance in the work of Manet, Degas, C&eacute;zanne, Bonnard and
Matisse), which was then broken and remained largely marginal until the
1940s, but which seems to have been recapitulated first in some American
modernist painting (notably Rothko's) and subsequently in the painted
work of Gerhard Richter and Art &amp; Language over the past twenty years.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 What I have in mind is the use of the opaque picture plane as a kind of
 frontier across which self-critical imaginative exchanges are conducted
 between the absorbed and self-exerting spectator on this side and
 whatever may be contained or connoted by an evoked or illusionary depth
 on the other. It is a distinctive feature of the surfaces in question
 that they are not so much the containers of mimetic worlds as scripts
 for imaginative self-transformations, among them transformations of time
 and place, of class, and even of gender. (What is it like for a man to
 be the fully imaginative, fully absorbed spectator of a self-portrait
 by a woman?
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Simply to ask that question is to bring to self-consciousness all that
 has customarily been assumed in the interpretation of self-portraits
 by men).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course the traditional form of these imaginative exchanges was
established in paintings containing depicted res. Gwen John's
paintings are thoroughly traditional in this sense. But at a certain
point the presence of the re proved unnecessary--and possibly even
inimical--to the business of modernization of the scripts in question. It
was at this point, I think, that the second major phase of abstract
painting was initiated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The important point here is that the characteristic work of this second
 phase had more in common with certain earlier rative painting than
 it did with the abstract art of the first phase, to the latter part of
 which Nicholson's work remained irrevocably attached. This is the sense,
 then, in which Gwen John's work now appears more readily assimilated
 to the critical aspect of modernism than does Nicholson's. And that is
 why she may now appear the more plausible artist.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So what is the point of this lengthy case study? What does it have to
say about the traditional closures on art-historical writing and about
the means by which they

<B></B>

might be opened, if not by social-historical work? My principal point
is that it is in the practice of art that reasons are discovered for
rethinking the history of art. At present the damaging closures in
art-historical writing are thus not those that divide it from economics
or from sociology or from social anthropology; they are those forms of
professional and intellectual decorum that serve as hedges against the
inflations and deflations of criticism in practice, though the latter
change too in response to currents other than those that flow through the
academy. Wherever that academic decorum rules, the more insistently will
it be tempted to fix (and asphyxiate) the more elusive, more critical
potential of art by adopting such predicates as prove negotiable within
academic discourses--predicates like "Englishness".

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This then, is the justification I offer for my sense of distance from
the enterprise of rethinking Englishness. It is from modernity in the
practice of art that motivation to intellectual work most fruitfully
comes. When I commenced my study of English art I told myself that I
was engaged on a significant critical enterprise: that attention to
local detail would serve to expose modernism as a form of globalizing
and bureacratic abstraction. But it was always a mistake to confuse
modernism with the ideological pretensions of capitalism, or to treat
modernist theory as if it offered a complete system of speculative
logic. It is one of the most secure findings of modern philosophy
that there is no such complete system. On the other hand, we need to
account to ourselves for the processes whereby we make a kind of sense
of the world, including the world of art. What we call modernism is a
form of this accounting. To say that modernism is a form of criticism,
however, is to acknowledge that this making sense has continually to
be revised, given that there is no fixed measure of its adequacy. The
practice of art furnishes empirical--though not systematic--grounds for
the revisions in question. In other words, the intelligibility of art or
of anything else is a matter of its being continually thought about in a
manner productive of self-consciousness--of its being reflected upon and
reflected from. The necessity and continuity of this self-consciousness
is also what modernism means. It is not to be foreclosed--in the name of
"Englishness" or anything else--without a loss of critical and cognitive
vitality. It follows that there can be no end to the project of modernity,
once the process of self-questioning has been initiated and internalized,
for modernism is itself the end of epochality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If we are to look for the <I>social</I> bases of a modern art, they
will be discovered in the uses to which that art is put by those in
search of other self-conscious agents, and of forms of reconciliation
with them. To concern oneself in the course of this search with a value
such as Englishness would be to behave as if there might be adequate
measures of the validity of our representations, or secure and local
points of reference for the intelligible world--possibilities which the
condition of modernity will not admit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To be methodologically modern, then, is to generate that which must
necessarily be deflated. In this sense the likes of Clive Bell and
Clement Greenberg stand not as res of the failure of modernism but as
guarantors of its continuity as a critical project. It seems appropriate,
therefore, to conclude by retrieving two of their more

<B></B>

distinctive contributions to that project. Clive Bell claimed,
notoriously, that "to understand art we need know nothing whatever
about history".
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 He also proposed, however, that history might be read "in the light
 of aesthetic judgements," and even that the history of art might be
 revealing of "the spiritual history of the race".
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Clement Greenberg said that "art has its history as a sheer phenomenon
 and it also has its history as quality"; but he also said of Mondrian's
 most pared-down abstract compositions that when they are good there
 is a whole world of experience in them, and that this is not a matter
 of accident.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
These are powerful and interesting hypotheses. One speaks of the
human race, another of a whole world. If either were made to bear upon
questions of national culture and national characteristics, however, it
could only be to note the limiting effect of such considerations. With
these hypotheses in mind, it can at least be said alike of Nicholson,
of Hepworth and of Gwen John, as of my friends in Art &amp; Language,
that it was not an English art that they were working to produce.

It would be disingenuous to assume that this distance could be maintained

this paper, under the title "Leaving go and Going on", for inclusion in

been taken to exclude it from the publication on the grounds that it was
"out of keeping with the interests of the other contributors" and that it
"effectively mounted a challenge to the rationale of the collection." It

"Our sense of the relative orders of discourse is as follows. Within
any practice a first-order discourse characterizes the normal terms in
which discussion, business, exegesis etc., is conducted. A second-order
discourse is conventionally understood as conducted in a type of
metalanguage by means of which the terms and concepts etc. of the
first may be related, analysed etc. and their referents explained. The
requirement upon a second-order discourse is that it should be capable of
'including' the first (i.e. describing what it describes and explaining
what it explains) but that it should also furnish an explanation of
<I>how</I> (and perhaps <I>why</I>) that describing and explaining
is done. A second-order discourse thus presupposes a position somehow
'outside' but engaged with the contexts of the first. It is suggested
that a cognitively defensible discourse for the recovery of meaning from
art will have a second-order character with respect to the normal and
current means of interpretation. To the extent that this is true the
second-order discourse might be expected to supersede the first, except
insofar as it is prevented from doing so by the agency which invests
and maintains the normal order . . ." From Michael Baldwin, Charles

I think in particular of the following statement from the third of
Greenberg's Seminars on aesthetics. "Certain works are singled out in
their time or later as excelling, and these works continue to excel:
that is they continue to compel those of us who in time after look,
listen, or read hard enough. And there's no explaining this durability
which creates a consensus--except by the fact that taste is ultimately
objective. The best taste, that is; that taste which makes itself
known by the durability of its verdicts; and in this durability lies
the proof of its objectivity." This is from the text to be published

account of it, or, needless to say, with any way of perceiving it, or
pictorial representation of it. Reality is the source of <I>primitive
causes</I>, which, having been pre-processed by our perceptual apparatus,
produce changes in our knowledge and the verbal representations of it
which we possess. All cultures relate symmetrically to this reality. Men
in all cultures are capable of making reasonable responses to the causal
inputs they receive from reality--that is, are capable of learning. That
the structure of our verbal knowledge does not converge upon a single

Only a few weeks before the German capitulation, Joseph Goebbels
used the premiere of the feature film <I>Kolberg</I> in April 1945
as an opportunity to hammer home the credo of his unique approach to
politics once more.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 "Gentlemen, in one hundred years' time
they will be showing a fine color film of the terrible days we are
living through. Wouldn't you like to play a part in that film? Hold

 Informed by Walter Benjamin's
famous thesis that "the logical result of Fascism is the introduction
of aesthetics into political life," generations of critics have read
remarks such as these as self-explanatory testimonies to the Nazis'
theatrical blurring of boundaries between reality and fiction, appearance
and essence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Aesthetic resources, following such readings,
transformed the Nazi state into a Wagnerian total work of art, a carefully
choreographed spectacle of ethereal bodies and geometrical shapes. Nazi
art not only helped posit a deceptive identity of art and life, image
and original, but also glorified gestures of surrender and idealized
rations of death. Nazi aesthetics taught us how to hold out--manly
and heroically--in the face of total destruction. It reshaped common
ideas of beauty in order to render aesthetic pleasure a direct extension
of political terror: a form of violence in the service of future warfare.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Nazi rule and society, as seen from the perspective of contemporary
historiography, were of course much less homogenous

<B></B>

than Benjamin's
aestheticization thesis would suggest. Not all the pleasures and aesthetic
materials that circulated under fascism took the form of masochistic
feasts of submission, and we therefore--as so many historians have pointed
out--can no longer take for granted the fact that popular attitudes
towards the Third Reich coincided with what we see in historical images
of cheering crowds, images dexterously designed and mass circulated by
Goebbels's media industry. More recent research, which has mapped the
topographies of popular culture during the National Socialist period,
instead suggests that large sections of the population led a double life:
delivering vows of political loyalty in public rituals <I>and</I> pursuing
apolitical leisure activities in the niches of private life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

Contrary to the regime's rhetoric of political coordination and total
mobilization, the Third Reich not only promised new career opportunities
but also new tactics of diversion and commodity consumption. Apart
from short periods of political euphoria, the allure of racing cars,
radios, Coca-Cola, swing, and Hollywood-style comedies--rather than the
choreography of Riefenstahl's spectacles--provided the stuff dreams were
made of. Instead of bracketing Nazi mass culture as kitschy or trivial,
we need to face and think through the fact that the popular, as Eric
Rentschler argues, "played a prominent and ubiquitous role in everyday
life, in cinemas, radio programs, dance halls, advertisements, tourist
offerings, and the latest consumer items."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Very well aware of the fact that over-politicization might quickly
lead to apathy, the Nazi government endorsed seemingly unpolitical
spaces of private commodity consumption so as to reinforce political
conformity. At variance with the strict demands of ideological
correctness, American-style consumerism in Nazi society delineated an
ideal stage for what Theodor W. Adorno in his analysis of American mass
culture considered pseudo-individualization--the "halo of free choice" on
the basis of standardization itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Unlike the homogenizing
rituals on the Nuremberg rally grounds, the commodity spectacles of
Nazi mass culture entertained the individual with the utopian illusion
that certain spaces remained beyond control, beyond politics, beyond
the effects of coordination. By satisfying the popular demand for
material and cultural commodity items, the agents of power were able to
undermine articulations of solidarity that had the capicity to contest
Nazi politics. The cult of private consumption impaired alternative
definitions of German identity and solidarity coupled to notions of
individual autonomy and emancipation. While hoping to remake the Third
Reich as a national family, the Nazi culture industry domesticated
un-German sights and sounds in order to set individuals apart against
one another and thus to produce lonely crowds.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 It allowed
for private consumption, but only to deflect the formation of counter
publics, to arrest and rechannel the popular's "ineradicable drive
towards collectivity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's famous catchphrase of fascism as the aestheticization of
politics has often led to definitions of Nazi aesthetics which are
formulated exclusively in terms of Leni Riefenstahl's mass rituals or
Albert Speer's architectural appeals to timeless dignity and monumental
symmetry. Benjamin, we should recall, argues that fascist aestheticization
describes a form of domination by means of which a post-liberal

<B></B>

state
symbolically hopes to settle social and economic struggles while it
simultaneously promotes the charismatic image of strong and unified
political action.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The fascist assault on the procedural
complexity and normative substance of twentieth-century politics coincides
with a peculiar way of tapping the dialectics of modern culture and
mechanical reproduction. Aesthetic conrations in fascism reckon
with distinctly modern structures of experience: the masses' hunger for
distraction and scopic pleasure. More precisely, it is by recycling within
the boundaries of postauratic culture the affective registers of auratic
art that fascism hopes to recenter the workings of a differentiated,
secularized, and bureaucratic state and to give political operations
the reenchanted look of willful and resolute action. Under facism, the
aesthetic is charged with the task of emancipating the public image of
political decision-making from the putatively emasculating effects of
self-sufficient economic, military, or administrative imperatives.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet we misunderstand Benjamin's argument if we consider fascist
aestheticization simply as a shrewd strategy of wrapping alluring
veneers around bad realities. While the function of the aesthetic in
fascism clearly halts a revolutionary turn of society and abets the
further diffusion of political power into increasingly independent
and competing but fascist agencies of domination, at the same time
it actively reshapes individual and collective modes of reception and
channels disparate hopes for charismatic redemption into the uniform
gestalt of collective mobilization. Fascism gives expression to the
seeds of utopian desires. It appropriates certain properties of social
and cultural modernity in order to reconstruct the modern state as a
phantasmagoria of power and community, as a shifting series of deceptive
appearances that change the very parameters according to which people
perceive the real. By doing so in effect it changes reality itself. The
aesthetic moment in fascism does not just target the preservation of
past dependencies. Instead it reconres existing social spaces and
perceptions in a way that both preres and culminates in warfare, for
imperial warfare presents fascism's ultimate answer to the pathological
elements inherent in the dialectics of capitalist modernization. The
fascist spectacle pictures violence and warfare as the climax of an
alternative modernity, one in which selective components of social,
cultural, and technological modernization eclipse the normative substance
of political modernity, i.e., any reasonable claim for equality, justice,
freedom, and any concomitant acts of recognition across existing lines
of ethnic, social, or gender difference.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Contrary to some of Benjamin's premises, recent scholarship on everyday
practices under Nazi rule suggests that to think of the Nazi spectacle
solely as a technology of seamless unification misses the point. In effect
the Nazis followed two different but overlapping strategies. In their
pursuit of a homogenous community of the folk, the Nazis made numerous
concessions to the popular demand for the warmth of private life and
pleasure in a modern media society, even when such concessions, as David
Bathrick has argued, often "left the government caught in ludicrous
forms of self-redress and strategic withdrawal before the commodity
fetish."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 But simultaneously the Nazi government clearly
hoped that the depoliticized practices of cultural

<B></B>

consumption
could be aligned with their larger political agendas. In this view,
the spectacle of modern consumer culture would break the bonds of old
solidarities and prepare the atomized individual for the auratic shapes
of mass politics, for mass rituals that promised a utopian unification
of modern culture. Nazi cultural politics and spectacle, in other words,
relied on both at once, on the charismatic power of public mass events
and the lures of privatized consumption, on the mass-mediated staging
of political rituals as much as on the appeals of an American-style
leisure culture, on total mobilization as much as on the atomizing
pleasures of imaginary escape. Guy Debord's famous aphorism holds true
of Nazi society as well: "The spectacle is nothing more than the common
language of this separation. What binds the spectators together is no
more than an irreversible relation at the very center which maintains
their isolation. The spectacle reunites the separate, but reunites it
<I>as separate</I>."

To the extent to which it brings into focus the relative heterogeneity
of politically domesticated pleasures in Nazi Germany, more recent
historical research asks us to rethink a number of aspects of Benjamin's
aestheticization thesis. Benjamin's theory is helpful to explicate the
unifying powers of the Nazi spectacle, but it seems to ignore cultural
technologies of atomization as well as the nexus of domination and private
commodity consumption during the National Socialist period. Explaining
fascist aesthetics as a monolithic space of false reconciliation, as
a postauratic renewal of aura, Benjamin did not yet address the ways
in which mass culture and the popular in Nazi Germany openly avowed
postauratic diversions, shaped new attitudes toward beauty and pleasure,
and in so doing provided a government willing to permit ideologically
incorrect distractions with diffuse loyalty.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Furthermore, in spite of Benjamin's emphatic notion of individual
and collective experience, what remained absent in his analysis of
fascist aestheticization is any sense of how Hitler's subjects explored
the landscapes of political culture and transformed them into their
life-scapes. While it would be foolish to tax Benjamin's fragmentary
remarks on fascism with all of these omissions, it is equally important to
understand that Benjamin--confined to the condition of exile--primarily
deciphered the politics of fascist culture from "above." With highly
limited data at his disposal, he was unable to examine in further detail
how Hitler's subjects inhabited both the political spectacle and the
symbolic materials of a modern leisure and media society in order to
take position and construct their identities, however precarious and
inconsistent.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet to point with historical hindsight towards some of these blind spots
in Benjamin's critique of German National Socialism and Italian fascism is
to consider, mistakenly, the epilogue of Benjamin's 1935/36 artwork essay
as his last word about the aestheticization of politics. As I will argue
in the following pages, Benjamin's unfinished <I>Arcades Project</I> in
fact provides an intriguing framework in order to theorize the nexus of
domination <I>and</I> commodity consumption, power <I>and</I> leisure,
homogenization <I>and</I> fragmentation, and thus may help supplement
what seems strangely absent in the artwork essay. In order to probe
the compatibility of

<B></B>

Benjamin's aestheticization thesis with the
results of contemporary research, this essay shall reconsider Benjamin's
notion of aestheticization in light of the <I>Arcades Project</I> so as to
emphasize the role of private consumption under fascism, of <I>spectacular
atomization rather than all-inclusive coordination</I>. According
to this expanded version of Benjamin's aestheticization thesis,
fascism constitutes a phase of capitalist modernization in which the
political dimension itself becomes a market item, a target of the
kind of commodification and mass consumption Benjamin so intriguingly
analyzed in the <I>Arcades Project</I>. As it embraces the mechanisms
of an American-style culture industry, fascism not only accelerates
the fragmentation of traditional environments, it also grafts onto acts
of political representation the logic of nineteenth century commodity
fetishism. Politics, I conclude, becomes aesthetic in fascism because
fascism explicitly utilizes the charismatic promise of Great Politics
into a viable consumer good, a carefully designed and marketed product
that appeals to dormant desires of modern consumers and window shoppers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Peter Labanyi has argued that Nazism--as a highly incoherent political
ideology--relied on advanced marketing strategies to sell itself as "a
multi-purpose ideological commodity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 It put principles of
modern advertising in the service of the production of mass loyalty and
political consumer satisfaction. It was only because Nazism managed to
package itself as offering something to everyone that it was able to gain
mass support. German fascism confiscated the aesthetic dimension, the
domains of pleasure, desire, and representation, in order to massage
the masses and bridge the gap between ideological use-values and
exchange-values, between real and imaginary needs. Circulated as one of
many other objects of popular desire, the politics of fascism should
thus ultimately be understood as a form of commodity aesthetics: "An
ideological product--the F&uuml;hrer, folk community, or whatever--is
supplied with a brand name and a trade-mark--the swastika--and a
product-image is carefully designed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reread in light of the <I>Arcades Project</I>, Benjamin's aestheticization
thesis helps elucidate this broader understanding of the Nazi interfaces
between power, pleasure, and the popular. It allows us to interpret
fascism as the incorporation of militant and ultranationalist agendas
into the operations of a modern culture industry, and to define fascist
aesthetics as a historically unique endeavor of breaking older bonds of
solidarity while simultaneously rendering modern consumerism, including
the consumption of charismatic politics, a privileged ticket to national
rebirth.

Ever since the 1930s German intellectuals have mostly seen the role of
National Socialist ideology as a substitute for authentic meaning. Nazi
ideology, according to this view, fabricated fake dreams in the service of
disabling a critical understanding of social realities; it disseminated
powerful delusions that sweetened domination. But National Socialist
ideology, as Michael Geyer has argued correctly, did not simply aim at
a change of discourse or a remaking of symbolic expression. Rather,
its

<B></B>

specific character consisted in what might be understood as
its progressive concreteness. "This is what the German intelligentsia
disliked about it. It was not words, symbols, and discourses. Ideology
was contained in the material practice of politics in the Third Reich. In
fact, it increasingly became politics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 National Socialist
ideology was not dedicated merely to transring social realities;
it radically altered and restructured existing social relations. If
National Socialism was able to muster mass support, it did so mostly
because it responded to real needs and desires, because it understood how
to build individual wish fantasies and diffuse utopias into the material
architectures of public and private life. Not only sex, romance, glamor
or exotic lures, but the political itself became the stuff of the popular
imagination. Ideological politics provided the masses with the powerful
experience of a new national family, yet at the same time--in pursuing its
core agendas--it "broke families apart, alienated young women from older
ones, children from parents, and reshaped the relation between men and
women--as far as it could. It poisoned the life in villages and houses,
broke apart friendships and associates."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 To the extent
that it rebuilt reality as dream (and nightmare), ideological politics
in Nazi Germany became an exercise in a kind of radical materialism:
it changed the world by reinterpreting it. National Socialist ideology
"spoke" to sentient bodies rather than minds. Reckoning with the people's
mimetic faculty--their ability to imitate the other, to bridge rather
than collapse differences between subject and object, and to produce
resemblances; their desire to connect with or be transformed by the
other so as to develop sympathetic, noncoercive relationships between
nonidentical particulars-- Nazi cultural politics engineered emotions
and domesticated perception in order to recast the nation's political
body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's nineteenth century Paris--the capital of high
capitalism--anticipates the cunning ways in which Nazi politics
embodied ideology in plastic forms. As a heaven of consumption,
fashion, and conspicuous luxury, the Paris of the <I>Arcades
Project</I> signifies a modern-day Babylon where people--unable to
structure their social relationships--happily surrender to the magic of
objects-turned-commodities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Like Nazi Germany, Benjamin's
Paris is a dreamed one: everyday phenomena bear the signatures of
collective wish fantasies and age-old utopias. As they constitute
themselves as modern masses in front of the spectacular displays of new
department stores, shopping arcades, and world fairs, customers and window
shoppers find ancient myths embodied in the very gestalt of the latest
lures and inventions. Just as importantly, however, nineteenth century
commodity culture also preres the logic of fragmentation that is at
the core of Nazi ideological politics. The progressive commodification
of objects and human relationships makes Paris into a latter-day
Babel. The commodity form destroys traditional notions of unity and
organic totality; it devalues objects and meanings, strikes experience
with a shock of petrification, and thus separates from one another the
speechless individuals of the crowd. Far from solely yielding a totalizing
spectacle of frenzied but coordinated mass desires, nineteenth century
commodity culture recycles the allegorical regimes of the seventeenth
century, including the Baroque's melancholia, forlornness, and mortifying
secularization:

<B></B>

"The emblems recur as commodities."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

"The devaluation of the world of objects in allegory is outdone within
the world of objects itself by the commodity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These strange and subterraneous links between high capitalism and
National Socialism on the one hand, and between the seventeenth and the
nineteenth century on the other, between allegory, commodity form, and
social fragmentation, clearly beg for further explanation as Benjamin
seems to amalgamate his no doubt unconventional reading of Marx with his
no less idiosyncratic Baroque studies of the 1920s. Babel and Babylon
alike, nineteenth century commodity culture--so much seems clear at the
outset--casts into embodied form what in the context of Benjamin's earlier
Baroque studies was understood as reflex and refraction of a melancholic
gaze, as a re of the poet's artistic inventory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Far
from simply rejecting nineteenth-century commodification and reification,
Benjamin embraces it as part of the progressive deauraticization of the
world. The emergence of the commodity form represents a historical phase
in which objects are yanked out of their habitual contexts and delivered
to the demands of distracted consumers. Like seventeenth century allegory
or twentieth century montage cinema, the commodity destroys both the
representation and the experience of organic totality and meaningful
unity. It shatters an object's aura, transforms the world of objects
into a petrified landscape that may cater to the specifically modern
urge to get hold of objects at very close range. Nineteenth-century
capitalist modernization, therefore, administers within the sphere of
economic production what mechanical reproducibility does to cultural
artifacts: it obliterates an object's here and now by transforming this
object into a commodity wandering across traditional boundaries between
private and public spaces, the local and the global; it empowers the human
collective to appropriate things according to their always peculiar needs,
desires, and experiences. In contrast to the falsifying transration of
classical symbolism and auratic art, the commodity potentially undermines
any cult of beauty and rative transcendence as it extinguishes all
appearances of harmonious, timeless perfection. The commodity form is
both vehicle and expression of the disintegrated character of modern
life. It bears testimony to the fundamental untruth of a society struck
by the logic of alienation and fragmentation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And yet this testimony is far from complete or successful, for capitalism
is at pains to mask the very fact that objects are commodities. Capitalism
hides what is allegorical about the commodity form under the veil of
spectacular displays and symbolic arrangements. It grafts onto the
commodity's postauratic character the autographs of auratic art. "Ever
more callously," Benjamin argues, "the object world of man assumes
the expression of the commodity. At the same time advertising seeks
to veil the commodity character of things . . . This attempt has its
equivalent in the simultaneous attempt of the bourgeoisie to personify the
commodity (<I>vermenschichen</I>): to give the commodity, like a person,
housing. This then was the promise of the <I>etuis</I> (small box), the
covers, the sheaths with which the bourgeois household effects of the time
were being covered."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Nineteenth-century capitalism cannot
admit its own truth. It recodes the petrified outlook of commodities as
phantasmagorias, as animated, self-sustaining entities. It glorifies
the exhibition values of marketable goods

<B></B>

in order to undermine
their allegorical thrust, their potential to introduce a new chapter
within the development of the human senses and the relation of the human
collective to the world of objects. Nineteenth-century capitalism, in
sum, sells allegories as symbols, disempowerment as empowerment, and in
so doing it cunningly engenders a state of fragmentation underneath a
magic label of unified meaning and symbolic totality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's remarks about the enigmas of the commodity form have
continuously provided material for heated discussions. Not surprisingly,
the question as to the relation between Benjamin's critique of capitalism
and Marx's notion of commodity fetishism, between Benjamin's and Marx's
different conceptions of use value and exchange value, has red
prominently in these debates. In the final analysis, however, as
Heinz-Dieter Kittsteiner rightly argues, Benjamin's assumptions about
the extinction of use values and the concomitant concealment of the
commodity form in high capitalism has very little to do with Marx. Unlike
Benjamin, Marx "never simply extinguished 'use value'; rather, he always,
and for good reason, held fast to the unity of use value and exchange
value."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 From the perspective of a classical Marxist,
Benjamin's postulates about the commodity form and the eclipse of use
value remain undialectical: "To the extent that such allusions appear
in Benjamin, they are based not on a well-grounded knowledge of Marx
but on the widespread schematics of a rather conservative critique of
civilization which became amalgamated in the 1920s and 1930s with the
position of the 'Left.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Be that as it may, rather than once
again pondering the authenticity of Benjamin's Marxism, it will prove
much more fruitful to follow the links Benjamin's work indicates between
the aborted allegories of capitalist modernization and the emergence
of what one might call with Andreas Huyssen the great divide of modern
culture, the split between the commodified realms of mass culture and
diversion on the one hand and the terrains of enigmatic modernism on
the other.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's phantasmagorias of capitalist modernization provide
the cultural material around which the modern mass constitutes and
experiences itself as mass: "With the establishment of the department
stores, consumers began for the first time in history to feel like
a mass. (Previously, only privation had taught them to feel this
way.) Thus the circus-like or exhibitory aspect of trade increased to a
quite extraordinary extent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 What Benjamin understands as
the glorification of exchange values in capitalism coincides with the
emergence of cultural practices that are deeply enmeshed in commodity
consumption and industrial standardization, practices which no longer
have anything in common with older forms of popular or folk art. Popular
culture in the strict sense originated as the quasi-organic expression of
distinct social communities. Existing in the plural alone, it reflected
the always particular and contingent values, traditions, institutions, and
lifeworlds of well-defined social bodies. As remystified disenchantment,
Benjamin's fetishized commodities, by way of contrast, appeal to each and
every cultural constituency regardless of their social and historical
specificity. Nineteenth century capitalism, on the one hand, atomizes
traditional communities and lifeworlds into isolated private individuals
and

<B></B>

market competitors. On the other hand, however, it wraps
commodities into a magic aura in order to appeal to archaic utopias
of homogenous meaning and collectivity amidst the heteronomy of the
market. Phantasmagorias embody collective wish and power fantasies. They
soothe the minds of lonely crowds while entertaining the amorphous mass
with the illusion that meaningful experiences are still possible in
spite of the fragmenting force of capitalist modernization. Instead
of understanding Benjamin's phantasmagorias solely in terms of
manipulation, diversion, or degradation, as empty distraction or mere
false consciousness, we must therefore conceive of them as predecessors
of the works of twentieth-century mass culture: as transformational
works on social anxieties and political fantasies that--in Fredric
Jameson's words--"have as their underlying impulse--albeit in what is
often distorted and repressed unconscious form--our deepest fantasies
about the nature of social life, both as we live now, and as we feel in
our bones it ought rather to be lived."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Nineteenth-century
phantasmagorias, like the products of the twentieth-century culture
industries, entertain relations of repression with fundamental anxieties,
concerns, and hopes, even if in most cases such fissures are resolved
into imaginary resolutions and illusions of existing social harmony. As it
conceals the allegorical thrust and reason of the commodity form, modern
consumer society engenders modes of mass cultural entertainment in which
repression and wish-fulfillment, fantasy and symbolic containment, join
together in the unity of a single mechanism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If nineteenth-century commodity capitalism, by simultaneously producing
and concealing allegorical experiences, designates the origin
of modern mass culture, it is at same time also the hidden force
behind the emergence of aesthetic modernism in the works of Charles
Baudelaire. Baudelaire revalorizes the Baroque's allegorical gaze--the
"armature of the modern"--because it allows him to outfetishize the
fetishes of consumer capitalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 "The allegorical mode of
seeing which shaped style in the 17th Century no longer did so in the
19th. Baudelaire was isolated; as an allegorist his isolation was in
certain respects that of a straggler."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 With the help of
allegory, Baudelaire lays bare the allegorical reason behind the shining
wrappers of commodity displays. He makes the commodity's synthetic
aura the object of allegorical devaluation, and reveals the commodity
as commodity, reveals what is allegorical about the commodity form
itself. Writing poetry for an age no longer concentrated enough to read
poetry, Baudelaire's modernism responds to similar experiences, anxieties,
and concerns that structure the outlook of the nineteenth-century popular
dimension. In contrast to mass culture's imaginary resolutions, however,
Baudelaire invents compensatory structures that are meant to speak the
truth about the commodity and work through the loss of organic totality
under the reign of capitalist modernization. Baudelaire's aesthetic
modernism is modern mass culture's other side. Both emerge against the
background of one and the same condition, namely capitalism's need to
conceal the allegorical thrust of the commodity form, but both suggest
mutually exclusive strategies of translating the experience of modernity
into symbolic expressions. Whereas industrial mass culture casts anxiety
into exhilarating fantasies of harmony, Baudelaire's modernism maps
modern life as fundamentally

<B></B>

fragmented and petrified and, in so
doing, uncovers the melancholy, boredom, and isolation that prevails
behind the scenes of enthused consumerism. Deeply connected to the
poet's allegorical intention, Baudelaire's spleen "is that feeling which
corresponds to catastrophe in permanence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But what, then, does Nazi aestheticization and consumer culture have to
do with Baudelaire's modernism, the allegory of the commodity form, and
the dialectics of modernism and mass culture? How does fascism inherit
what Benjamin considers the legacy of the nineteenth century?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to answer these questions, let me recapitulate the argument
thus far. Benjamin suggests that the formation of the modern masses
vis-&agrave;-vis nineteenth-century commodity fetishism not only
coincides with a progressive mechanism of atomization and privatization,
it also results in the division of modern culture into two dialectically
opposed tracks of cultural and aesthetic modernization: high modernism and
popular mass diversion. High modernism articulates what is glossed over in
commodified mass culture; it reminds us of the despair and fragmentation
that is at the bottom of the experience of capitalist modernity. Adorno
and Horkheimer, in their seminal analysis of industrial culture, believed
that the American culture industry sought to paper over the peculiar
dialectics of modern culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Hollywood during the classical
studio era did not eclipse Schoenberg or Beckett, but it tried to adorn
mass cultural products with the charm of autonomous art and thus forge
into a false and ruthless unity what no longer could add up to a whole. If
we continue Benjamin's unfinished line of argumentation, we will come to
the conclusion that Nazi culture in fact itself by far outdid Hollywood's
technologies of power not only in its mass spectacles at Nuremberg, but
also in the context of its own American-style culture industry. National
Socialism curtailed the expressive registers of aesthetic modernism and
autonomous art, while it at the same time--domesticating the popular
imagination--sought to engender mass culture from above, to ensure
something was provided for all and that none could escape.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Benjamin calls the aestheticization of politics, then, signifies
fascism's peculiar way of resolving the antinomies of modern culture. Not
only did German fascism reckon with the fact that a full-fledged
politicization of public life would render this empty and provoke the
retreat into non-political apathy. Nazi Germany in fact transformed the
political itself into an item of mass consumption, a commodity concealing
its status as a commodity (and allegory), a symbolic spectacle meant to
produce lonely crowds and unite the masses as separate. Detlev Peuckert
has argued that even the regime's own symbols such as the Wireless
Set and the Volkswagen "served in practice to promote individualism in
leisure and transport, albeit in the standardised form determined by the
needs of mass consumption in a modern industrial society."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

Understood in light of Benjamin's account of modern consumer capitalism,
such strategies of aestheticization--far from simply signifying seductive
mechanisms of social homogenization--must be conceptualized as techniques
of power that sought to confiscate the popular imagination within the
domains of a homemade culture industry in order to unbind traditional
bonds of solidarity, to engender isolation,

<B></B>

to entertain relations
of repressions with fundamental anxieties and utopias, and to provide
compensatory structures of symbolic integration. Though Benjamin himself
did not explicitly fuse his remarks about commodity capitalism with his
theory of fascism, his work suggests that perhaps not Hollywood, which
even during the studio era was much more heterogenous than Adorno and
Horkheimer believed, but the union of politics and commodity consumption
in Nazi Germany was the most pertinent historical manifestation of the
system of the culture industry as well as its various mechanisms of
producing loneliness and mass consent through pseudo-individualization.

"The purpose of the Fascist formula, the ritual discipline, the uniforms,
and the whole apparatus, which is at first sight irrational, is to allow
mimetic behavior. The carefully thought out symbols (which are proper
to every counterrevolutionary movement), the skulls and disguises, the
barbaric drum beats, the monotonous repetitions of words and gestures,
are simply the organized imitation of magic practices, the mimesis of
mimesis."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 According to Benjamin's confreres Adorno and
Horkheimer, fascist aestheticization mimics mimetic behavior because
fascism wants to enlist a rebellion against domination as a useful tool
of domination itself. Fascism opens up symbolic spaces in which suppressed
nature--sentience, spontaneity, and the desire to imitate and connect with
the other--may articulate itself only to succumb even more effectively to
the mechanisms of disciplining and suppression. Benjamin's valorization
of allegory as an armature of modernity results from his hope not to do
away with the magic of mimesis altogether but to find antidotes to this
political organization and manipulation of "primitivist" residues. In
Benjamin's view, allegory undercuts the possibility of seizing nature
and what seems forbidden or repressed in actual life for projects of
domination. Anti-mimetic in character, allegory allows us to experience
the world as one in which the realms of nature and of human affairs are
radically separate. As a discontinuous structure of representation,
allegory sharpens our awareness for the constructedness of meanings,
institutions, and values; it disrupts symbolic totalizations within
the public sphere that try to imitate and organize mimetic urges, to
naturalize meaning and history, and thus to engage in a fateful mimesis
of mimesis.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's theory about the imbrication of allegory and commodity form
urges us to reconsider what for many contemporary scholars marks the
striking gap between ideology and practice during the Nazi period. Read
in light of the <I>Arcades Project</I>, Benjamin's remarks about the
aestheticization of politics in fascism suggest that the spectacular
stage-managing of Nazi ideology and the vicissitudes of Nazi leisure
culture form the verso and recto of the same sign of capitalist
modernization. Instead of seeing Riefenstahl's political choreography
and Nazi consumerism as signs of a split consciousness of Nazi society,
Benjamin's formula of aestheticization emphasizes

<B></B>

that both aspects
are implicated in larger processes of commodification, processes which
increasingly render consumerism the primary tool and ideology of social
integration. The public spectacle and the cult of private consumption
alike eclipse what is potentially emancipatory about the deauraticization
and disenchantment of the world in modernity. Both result in a regressive
mimesis of mimesis. Both remystify and retotalize the world while turning
individuals into atomized consumers and pleasure-seeking monads.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What makes fascism so abominable, then, is the fact that it aspired
to subsume everything under the logic of a modern culture industry,

 Through
styling, packaging, and advertising, Nazi power invested its products--its

Horkheimer's description--"gained mass appeal because it managed to
offer something to almost everyone."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
Benjamin defines
fascism as that final state of capitalism in which the political itself

 Under the condition of fascism even the politician

Ian Kershaw has demonstrated the extent to which this logic of Nazi
commodity aesthetics was projected even onto the person of Adolf Hitler
himself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Often at odds with the rising disdain for the
Nazi party, Hitler's popularity particularly during the prewar years
resulted mostly from a masterly achievement of image building. The
making of Hitler skillfully catered to anxieties, desires, and values
which "conditioned the acceptance of a 'Superman' image of political
leadership."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Constantly refashioned according to the
shifting needs and fortunes of the Nazi movement and state, Hitler's
image was to promote the highly desirable commodity of autonomous
politics. It was mass circulated as panacea for diffuse hopes to
recenter the state, to reassert the sovereignty of the political
vis-&agrave;-vis the progressive pluralization of power in modernity,
and to replace the putatively effeminate structures of procedural
politics with masculine action. Accordingly, Hitler was stylized into
a symbol of the nation. Goebbels's ministry of illusion manufactured
Hitler into a ruthless, resolute, and uncompromising yet simultaneously
self-sacrificial, modest, and righteous individual in whose appearance
the people and the nation could find their identity. Hitler's star persona
incarnated a triumph of Germanic male virtues over the feminized order of
the Weimar period and its parliamentary system. Similar to the dreams of
nineteenth century political romanticism, Nazi propaganda marketed Hitler
as a site at which the existential affairs of the German nation and its
individuals were at stake.

<B></B>

But unlike the romantic theory of the
state, the body of the leader was not solely designed for the purpose of
giving a metaphorical expression to transcendental values, for making
the unspeakable visible.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Instead, though Nazi propaganda
advertised Hitler as an extraordinary intervention into the weary domains
of everyday routines, it at the same time surrounded his appearance with
a pathos of human, "earthly" qualities. The remarkable catalogue of human
virtues--Hitler's toughness, severity, determination, loneliness, sadness,
and care for the nation--"was set alongside the political genius of the
F&uuml;hrer as a human counterpart to the image of the lofty, distant
statesman. It amounted to almost a mirror of contemporary bourgeois
values--characteristics with which almost everyone could find some
point of association."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Making Hitler human by packaging the
commodity into an affective coat, Nazi politics and mass culture sought
to ensure that something was provided for everyone's peculiar needs.

popular desires for a strong and uncompromising state authority, for a

the autonomy of the political and in fact advancing resoluteness to
the primary value of political action. With the Hitler myth as its
flagship, Nazi politics was dressed as a realm in which--in Alfred
Baeumler's words--"action means 'setting off in a direction,' 'taking
sides,' by virtue of a mandate of destiny, by virtue of 'one's own
right.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Increasingly isolating Hitler from the growing
unpopularity of the Nazi party, the Hitler myth thus packaged the
F&uuml;hrer as the prime creator and architect of national reassertion
and economic recovery: a leader who was remorselessly devoted to act
against the nation's inner and outer enemies; a military genius who
outwitted the foe with brilliant strategies; a humble servant of the
folk putting aside all particular, material, and private interest for
the sake of the nation--in sum, an alluring alternative to the allegedly
monotonous, sterile, self-centered, and unsensual routines of procedural
politics and liberal-democratic will-formation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It has often been noted that, in couching Hitler's persona in an aura of
heroic leadership and political redemption, Nazi propaganda established
Hitler as a representative of what Max Weber only a few decades earlier
had theorized under the rubric of charismatic authority. Charisma
in Weber's conceptual framework denoted the aura of self-appointed
leaders who appeal to their followers by virtue of their "supernatural,
superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

Charisma, literally meaning the "gift of grace," interrupts the profane
continuum of history; it discontinues exhausted value orders and habitual
modes of thinking, fleshes out pristine semantic reference points, infuses
fresh meaning and vitality into history, and thus restores authentic
creativity, sensual pleasure, and intellectual integrity. According to
Weber, charismatic authority results as much from the actual qualities
of a political leader as from the peculiar ways in which his followers
perceive his performance. Charisma is a social product.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>

Like Benjamin's category of aura, Weber's charisma describes a relation
of subject and object, a mode of experience rather than an empirical
fact.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nazi propaganda elevated charisma to Hitler's universally recognizable
trade-mark. It advertised charismatic experiences as the most captivating
appeal of the product "Hitler." To the extent to which the Nazi movement
lost momentum, the Nazi culture industry was therefore forced ever-more
aggressively to fend off what--according to Weber--constitutes the
dialectics of charismatic authority: charisma's ineluctable routinization
and self-consumption. In order to warrant Hitler's aura of exceptionality,
mass cultural representations progressively severed Hitler's persona
from reality and the orders of the day. Ironically, however, the myth of
Hitler thus experienced a curious return of the repressed: the spiraling
idolization removed him from any possible enactment of what his image was
meant to promote, namely existential resolution and manly action. Like
the Hollywood star cult, the Hitler myth instead "surrounded Hitler
with toadies, flatterers, and sycophants, shielding him from rational
criticism and genuine debate, and bolstered increasing detachment from
reality . . . His own person gradually became inseparable from the
myth."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hitler's charisma and the popularity of the Hitler myth was surely
by no means complete or unified. Hitler's image required continuous
realignment in order to maintain its impact on a progressively
disillusioned population. But what is striking are the parallels
between the making of Hitler into a multi-purpose vehicle of symbolic
integration on the one hand, and Benjamin's analysis of the integrative
appeal and power of commodity fetishism on the other. Benjamin invites
us to understand the fabrication of the Hitler myth as the most
extreme chapter within modernity's transmogrification of commodities
into phantasmagorias. Accordingly, fascism surrounded its ideological
good, namely autonomous politics and the promise of a resolute rebirth
of the nation, with the affective wrapping "Hitler," thereby hoping
to appeal to diverse consumer desires and to constitute the masses as
masses. Pumping Hitler's far from monosemic image through the circuits of
a state-controlled culture industry, fascism furthermore constantly tried
to humanize and sentimentalize its ideological commodity, transform it
into a spectacular symbol of national and individual rejuvenation, and
thus eclipse the supreme commodity's commodity form. "Hitler," then,
like the texts of modern mass culture, was a transformational work on
social anxieties and diffuse utopias of successful collectivity. His
image allowed for a playing out of fantasies as much as for their
symbolic containment. To understand Hitler solely as an agent of
ideological mobilization and mass politicization therefore would
clearly underestimate his role and effectiveness. Understood as a
multi-valent object of consumption, "Hitler" inhabited a key position
within the popular imagination. Like the Hollywood movie star,
the image of the F&uuml;hrer represented "the focal point at which
identical reactions of countless citizens intersect." Hitler was a
function of the Nazi propaganda machine, "not so much a father-re
as a collective and overexaggerated projection of the powerless ego of
each individual."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 In conjunction with countless other and
often conspicuously unpolitical products delivered by the Nazi leisure
industry, the charismatic commodity "Hitler" helped atomize consumers
into self-entertaining monads while simultaneously elevating consumerism
to the most effective engine of mass loyalty and social integration. Nazi

<B></B>

aesthetics designed "Hitler" as a cultural icon that could be read
and appropriated in many ways. Similar to the standardized texts and
objects of modern mass culture, the unique brand-name "Hitler" appealed
to diverse needs, desires, and wish-fantasies; its success resulted from
the fact that consumers were able to incorporate the fetish "Hitler" in
far from univocal ways into the realm of everyday practices.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Contemporary cultural criticism, informed by the work of British
culturalists, is quick to assign subversive meanings to such heterogenous
appropriations of mass cultural symbols. Polemically challenging older
accounts of the culture industry as a crucible of conformity, this new
generation of cultural critics emphasizes how the consumers of mass
culture creatively reshape popular artifacts and images according to
their own needs. John Fiske does not hesitate to understand the mass
cultural consumer and reader as a "poacher, encroaching on the terrain
of the cultural landowner (or textowner) and 'stealing' what he or
she wants without being caught and subjected to the laws of the land
(rule of the text)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Nazi mass culture and the fetishism
surrounding the commodity of resolute politics reveal some crucial blind
spots built into such positive notions of cultural poaching. For, as I
argue, Nazi Germany clearly anticipated what contemporary audiences might
have seen and today's revisionists celebrate as enactments of plurality
and resistance. A counterpart to a highly politicized public sphere, the
Nazi culture industry and its circuits of commodity consumption reckoned
with cultural poachers. Whether it delivered Volkswagen, Hollywood-style
comedies, or the image of Hitler, Nazi mass culture invited people to
appropriate according to desire, to consume the illusion that within
Nazi Germany certain spaces could remain free of politics and ideological
imperatives. It enticed poachers to poach and provided local sources of
individualization and empowerment, only to strengthen--to extend Fiske's
metaphor--the laws that regulated the distribution of land outside the
distraction factories. The cultural poachers of the Nazi era transformed
cultural poaching into a pleasurable experience of consumption itself,
a commodity. Instead of consuming illegitimate meanings, they ended up
being consumed by the very objects of their pleasure.

Realigned, then, in light of both recent research on Nazi everyday culture
and Benjamin's own studies of modern consumer capitalism, Benjamin's
aestheticization thesis reads quite differently compared to what
generations of Benjamin scholars have suggested. Neither does Benjamin's
catchword of fascist aestheticization simply signify the ornamentalization
of the masses &agrave; la Riefenstahl, i.e., a choreography of public
life meant to provide phony scenarios of affective integration within a
highly conflict-ridden society. Nor does it solely denote a quasi-Romantic
reduction of procedural politics to aspects of sensual perception, to
a stimulation of the imagination, to sights and sounds that discipline
the masses' desire for distraction. Rather, Benjamin defines fascism as
a catastrophic phase of capitalist modernization in which the logic of
political action and representation themselves become subsumed

<B></B>

under
the laws of commodification and commodity fetishism. Fascism aestheticizes
politics because it transforms its ideological core--the promise of a
strong, autonomous, and resolute state--into an eminently marketable
object of mass consumption, a multi-purpose commodity circulated by a
peculiarly modern and Fordist culture industry.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin's expanded formula has the advantage of calling into question
popular myths of Hitler's Germany as a fully coordinated spectacle
of seduction and manipulation. Addressing the conflicting vectors of
public and private, homogenization and atomization, Benjamin underlines
how the role of the aesthetic under fascism was not simply to offer
symbolic placentas, deceive the masses, and freeze possible unrest, but
rather that it was a sinister means of resolving in a unique fashion the
dialectics of modern culture. Aesthetic politics shaped fundamentally
new social realities, it reconstructed the nation through imperial and
genocidal warfare.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But in understanding fascist aestheticization in the above terms as an
integral step within a process of capitalist modernization that links
the Wilhelminian Reich, the Weimar Republic, the Third Reich, and in
fact postwar Germany, the Benjaminian concept also seems to support
a normalizing or even trivializing view of the National Socialist
period. While it may appear already perverse to interpret Hitler's role
in recourse to a larger theory of commodity fetishism, it may be seen
as even more troublesome to reconstruct arenas of (consumer) agency and
multiplicity in Nazi everyday culture and to understand fascism as only
one among several paths of social modernization. How modern, then, we
should ask ourselves, is Nazi consumer culture, and in what ways does
fascism's modernity compromise the entire project of modernity? To what
degree does the expanded notion of fascist aestheticization propose a
universalizing model which levels necessary historical distinctions and
substantive meanings? And how can we argue with or beyond Benjamin for
an interpretation of fascist aestheticization in the above sense that
recognizes the historical uniqueness of fascism and resists contemporary
hopes to normalize the most gruesome chapter of German history?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Any attempt to answer these questions constructively requires
a preliminary clarification of what entrenched concepts such as
normalization, historicization, and trivialization actually mean. Products
of the 1986 historians' debate on the one hand
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 and of
post-unification battles over the putative need to repunctuate German
national history on the other, catchwords such as normalization and
historicization have more often clouded than illuminated the task of
contemporary German historiography and the critical recognition of the
legacy of fascism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Launched as a debate over the putative
need to revaluate the meaning of the fascist past and to redefine the
parameters of German national identity, the historians' debate and its
post-unification follow-ups provided a variety of conservative historians
with a platform to reconsider the National Socialist period within the
context of European totalitarianism, i.e., to understand the Holocaust
as one among other comparable expressions of barbarism during the 1930s
and 1940s. For historians related to the so-called Bavaria Project and
dedicated to researching everyday practices during the Third Reich,
the

<B></B>

notion of historicization primarily entailed the suggestion
to subject Nazism to the same methods of scholarly rigor as any other
period--even if it implied that in portraying the patterns of normality
and continuity underneath Nazi barbarism Nazism itself might fade away
from the picture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Although fundamentally different in intent
and nature, both strategies of historicization often resulted in a similar
normalization of the German past, that is to say, in an effort--deliberate
or not--to consolidate things German after unification, to reinterpret
Nazi culture as an integral chapter within the larger narratives of
European modernization, and to excise the memory of Auschwitz from the
inventories of collective identity today.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is important to note that this contemporary drive to reevaluate
the Third Reich and free German nationalism from the shadows of fascism
coincides with belated German struggles over the meaning of postmodernity
and a vociferous critique of the overall project of modernity. Although it
is important to explore patterns of social change that form a continuum
from the Weimar period to the Federal Republic, it is disturbing to see
that scholarly research about the ways in which Nazi culture continued or
even accelerated various trajectories of modernization often serves as a
screen for undifferentiated attacks on the entire modern condition. The
right-wing position of the Berlin historian Rainer Zitelmann, arguing
that Hitler Germany demonstrated "the other, the totalitarian side
of modernity," is a good case in point here.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 While he
rightly draws our attention to the modernizing function of Nazi Germany
within the arenas of technology, mass culture, welfare policy, and
social mobility, Zitelmann at the same time wants to blame all ills of
Nazism on modernity. In order to do so, he categorically purges the
notion of modernity from any reference to the normative substance of
post-Enlightenment politics--the ideas of emancipation, equality, and
justice. Firmly standing on his postmodern vista, Zitelmann vigorously
denies that the concept of modernity should or could include any
consideration of peculiarly modern political achievements such as the
practice of a participatory and constitutional democracy, or the vision
of unconstrained collective will-formation. Rather, what Zitelmann
understands as modernity amounts to a regime of symbolic totalizations,
a theology of progress: modernization aims at an ever-increasing
annihilation of difference and a formal rationalization of power
and social management. It therefore does not come as a surprise that
his analysis of the modernizing functions of Nazism collapses into a
fundamental critique of modernity, one which in many respects repeats the
conceptual pitfalls of Horkheimer and Adorno's universalizing critique
of reason. To the extent to which he renders fascism as one among other
equally possible concretizations of modernity, Zitelmann ends up leveling
all meaningful political distinctions. Arguing with postmodern hindsight
that emancipation, humanity, and democracy can be just as modern as
terror, dictatorship, and inhumanity, Zitelmann resorts to the very kind
of totalization that he denounces as the alleged core of modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Any examination of Nazi aesthetics and everyday practice today must
face the fact that the acts and consequences of Nazi culture have to be
critically integrated into the cultural history and collective memory of
German identity, and above all in their

<B></B>

postunification forms. "The
discrete treatment of Nazi culture as separate from Weimar on the one
hand and postwar culture on the other will no longer do."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>

The decisive challenge, however, is to accomplish this integration of the
Nazi past without trivializing the Holocaust, to critically recognize
the kind of continuities that link the Third Reich to nineteenth- and
twentieth-century developments without normalizing the darkest chapter
of German history. In mapping the question of fascism directly onto
larger debates about the conration of modernity and postmodernity,
Zitelmann simultaneously solicits and undercuts a critical reevaluation
of the modernizing effects of Nazi culture: already safely displaced by
Zitelmann's own regime of postmodern reason, the actual culprit behind
Nazi terror--modernity--emerges as an inhabitant of a galaxy far,
far away.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Detlev Peuckert's calibration of Nazi culture, everyday practices,
and social modernization suggests a much more viable model. For
Peuckert, the normality of cultural practices during the Third Reich,
i.e., what ties fascism to the Weimar or postwar era respectively,
is rooted in a theory of an asymmetrical, pathological, and hence
<I>fundamentally unfinished</I> unfolding of the diverse tracks of
nineteenth- and twentieth-century modernization. Similar to Zitelmann,
Peuckert argues that the modernity of Nazi everyday culture--leisure
activity, private consumption, and nonpolitical pleasure--does not
constitute a counterpoint to the barbarism of Nazism but a framework
within which criminality became possible. Unlike Zitelmann, however,
Peuckert points out that this barbarism was not one normal outcome
of modernization <I>per se</I>, but rather the unique result from a
strategic prioritization of technological, social, and economic over
political, legal, and moral modernity. What links Nazi culture to both
the Weimar and the postwar era are not individual achievements within
the arenas of social policy, technological progress, or social mobility
so much as the ways in which Nazi Germany succeeded in destroying
prevalent bonds of solidarity and produced coherence primarily through
bureaucratic procedures, institutions of incorporation, and the charms
of modern mass consumption. Nazi culture sold images of homogenization
and communality, yet in fact produced lonely, separated individuals. "If
the Third Reich could boast any achievement, it was the destruction of
public contexts and responsibilities and the dislocation of social forms
of life, even in traditional environments which provided some measure
of refuge and scope for resistance. Private spheres of behaviour were
impoverished and isolated, relapsing into a self-serving individualism
devoid of all potentially dangerous social connections and meanings. The
<I>Volksgemeinschaft</I> that had been so noisily trumpeted and so
harshly enforced became, in the end, an atomised society."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>

Culture under fascism, then, constitutes an extreme case within a twisted
process of modernization. It evidences the extent to which normal daily
obsessions, leisure activities, and commodity consumption can consume
such energy that they result in fundamental indifference to barbarism,
and thereby provide indirect, but highly effective sources of political
support.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even in his most pessimistic moments, Benjamin lends powerful arguments to
support a view of the "modernity" of fascist culture as differentiated
as Peuckert's.

<B></B>

Surely, Benjamin's account about the location
of culture in fascism, like Zitelmann's, at first seems to level all
meaningful distinctions between prefascist and fascist modernity. What
Benjamin calls the aestheticization of politics--the interlocked
aesthetics of stage-managed political action and American-style
mass consumption--directly appropriates elements pertinent to the
overall process of capitalist modernization ever since the middle
of the nineteenth century. Yet Benjamin's apocalyptic epithet about
Baudelaire's Paris and the logic of commodity consumption equally holds
true for the examination of fascist culture as well: "That things 'just
go on' <I>is</I> the catastrophe. It is not that which is approaching
but that which is. Strindberg's thought: Hell is not something which
lies ahead of us,--but <I>this life here</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 A closer
inspection reveals that in the context of what I have suggested above as
Benjamin's expanded formula of fascist aestheticization, catastrophic
modernism in fact undergoes an additional turn towards a qualitatively
different stage, a turn that constitutes the diabolical uniqueness
of fascist culture. For fascist aesthetics, according to Benjamin,
secretly seeks to transform hell itself into a commodity, an item of
pleasurable, albeit self-destructive mass consumption. Although the
Nazis in 1939 clearly failed to repeat the spontaneous enthusiam of
1914, imperial warfare in Benjamin's analysis res as the logical
outcome of the prewar spectacles; only war can finally uphold the kind
of repression that is at the heart of the aestheticizing celebration of
order, dynamism, power, and community. If nineteenth-century capitalism
entertained the masses with phantasmagorias of utopian collectivity and
mythic totality, fascism, in contrast, captures the minds and emotions of
the masses by appealing to diffuse popular desires for resolute politics
and national rebirth. In order to do so, it does not even hesitate to
render warfare a utopian panacea for all ills of modern culture, a most
enticing commodity powerful enough to suture atomized individuals into
a virtual community of seemingly equal window-shoppers and consumers:
"Mankind, which in Homer's time was an object of contemplation for the
Olympian gods, now is one for itself. Its self-alienation has reached
such a degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic
pleasure of first order."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However "theological" and overdetermined in character, Benjamin's
thesis that the roots of fascism are related to fundamental asymmetries
of capitalist modernization ought to remind us that contrary to what
historians such as Zitelmann suggest there is nothing genuinely "normal"
about Nazi culture after all. Fascism does not simply do what the
allegedly totalitarian dimension of modernity wanted all along. Rather,
fascism brings to a climactic conclusion progressively radical
attempts to contain the liberating aspects of modern disenchantment and
deauraticization, their power to disrupt symbolic totalization and impede
any regressive mimesis of mimesis. In doing so, fascism ironically allows
us to distinguish for the first time between what was utopian and what
catastrophic about the overall process of modernization. Though rightly
arguing against a discrete treatment of fascism, Benjamin's remarks
about the nexus of fascism and modern experience therefore do not yield
a universalizing conception void of any historical specificity. Nor do
they allow us retrospectively to normalize the National Socialist period
within the history of the German

<B></B>

nation or the larger European
or Anglo-American context of modernization. What to many of today's
historians appears "normal" in Nazi culture, in the eyes of Benjamin in
fact participates intimately in technologies of power and legitimation
that make strategic use of distinct pathologies of modernization. Even if
we consider the fact that Nazi cinema, for instance, directly adopted the
grammar of contemporary Hollywood films, Hollywood's generic conventions,
modes of spectatorship, and the star system, we would misjudge the
function of Nazi mass culture if we rendered it compatible with other
nationally specific cristallizations of nonpolitical diversion. Nazi
leisure culture, in other words, does not form an odd counterpoint to
the politicization of the public sphere and the stage-managing of the
political. Rather, both the political spectacle and the private cult
of pleasure-seeking formulate fascism's peculiar and combined answer to
the dialectics of modern culture. Instead of theorizing the relation of
ideology and leisure in Nazism in terms of a split consciousness, as a
hiatus between ideological imperatives and everyday practices, Benjamin
suggests that political spectacle and everyday consumption are integral
moments of an attempt to enlist the auratic logic of commodity fetishism
for the projects of ideological politics and thus to restrain modernity's
allegorical sparks of liberation. Fascism, for Benjamin, plays out all
relevant political questions within the field of commodity consumption
while it at the same time masks the respective commodities' commodity
form, reenchants the disenchanted, and thus wraps capitalism, modernity,
and alienated labor in the symbolic cocoon of an organic, anticapitalist
community. What Benjamin calls fascist aestheticization denotes a
historically specific regime of production, representation, and cultural
consumption in which political leadership and war can be advertised,
packaged, and consumed like mass-produced <I>Volkswagen</I> cars.

This essay was written as a critical response to the exhibit "Art
and Power: Europe under the Dictators 1930-1945"--sponsored
by the European Council, curated by the London Hayward Gallery, and
installed in London (26 October 1995-21 January 1996), Barcelona (26
February-6 May 1996), and Berlin (11 June-20 August 1996). A
longer version of this paper will appear in  <I>Walter Benjamin and the
Aesthetics of Power</I> (forthcoming, Nebraska University Press). A
highly controversial spectacle, "Art and Power" sought to recall the
interfaces between totalitarian power and modern culture between 1930
and 1945 in a broader European context. Its point of departure was the
monumental mise-en-sc&egrave;ne of the 1937 World Fair in Paris, a
mega-spectacle itself, used particularly by the regimes of Germany,
the Soviet Union, Italy, and Spain to showcase their respective
appropriations of modern culture. "Art and Power" construed its
notion of fascist aesthetics--understood as part of a larger European
formation of totalitarian modernism during the interwar years--against
the backdrop of the desirability of an innocent and timeless realm of the
beautiful. The exhibit defined fascist aesthetics via stylistic criteria
such as monumentalist gesture, symmetrical indulgence, heroic posture,
futuristic coolness; it mapped the politics of art as a relatively
coherent system of representation rather than a crucible of cultural
practices, affective agendas, and contingent appropriations. Reducing
the iconographic language of art to a direct expression of power,
totalitarian modernism--the exhibit suggested--systematically taps the
erosion of boundaries between art and life prered in the agendas
of the historical avant-gardes; totalitarian regimes can effectively
politicize art only because modern art itself seems to have lost faith in
preserving its autonomy. Significantly, in all of its four major sections
the exhibit also brought to view the work of artists who tried to resist
the stylistic vocabulary of totalitarian modernism by insisting on
anti-realist and anti-monumentalist, on non-heroic and abstract idioms
of representation. A selection of Rodtschenkos, Fontanas, Beckmanns,
Kollwitzes, and Schlemmers was meant to document the existence of an
expressive inventory that defied the appropriation of art as a vehicle
of totalitarian self-aggrandizement, a beleaguered island of modernist
experimentation amidst the violent storms of what is presented as the
full and perverse unfolding of the hopes of the avant-garde.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Art and Power" blamed art for ending up as an organ of totalitarian
mass deception. It is not difficult to see, however, that the exhibit's
alternative between the iconographies of totalitarian and of enigmatic
modernism oversimplified the politics of cultural expressions during
the 1930s and 1940s. "Art and Power" completely missed the fact that
the disintegration of aesthetic autonomy was not just the product
of an inner-aesthetic or stylistic development, but a reflex of the
comprehensive redefinition of cultural spaces taking place ever since
the middle of the nineteenth century, a response to the ever-increasing
commodification of aesthetic expressions as much as to the emergence
of mass cultural practices and new and technologically mediated forms
of diversion. It is precisely this reductionist reading of totalitarian
modernism and fascist aesthetics as merely a chapter of art history that
linked the exhibit to the kind of revisionist projects of normalization
popular ever since the so-called German historians' debate of the
1980s. "Art and Power" interpreted fascist aesthetics as an integral
and quite normal expression of a broader European phenomenon. More
importantly, instead of thinking through the more complex force field
of art, power, and mass culture, of social and cultural modernization,
of culture and genocide, the exhibit's merely stylistic concept of
Nazi aesthetics and totalitarian modernism invited the viewer simply
to invert--and thus reaffirm rather than explode--the very categories
according to which Nazi ideology itself sought to classify the value of
art: "Art and Power" granted Hitler and Goebbels a posthumous victory as
it reconstructed the past according to the Nazis' self-perceptions. An
integral part of a shared European catastrophe, the concept of Nazi
aesthetics thus replayed in reverse the taxonomies that informed Nazi
ideology itself instead of yielding new insights into the sources and
structures of domination during the 1930s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Scholars of modernism employ the notion of rupture in two different
ways. Critics interested in establishing a difference between high and
low cultural productions introduce it emphatically and deliberately,
while many other commentators on English literature use the idea less
self-consciously and more chronologically to partition the Victorians
from the twentieth century. This difference tends to collapse in the
field of the English novel, where scholars do not consider fiction high
art until modernism takes it up. Literary criticism finds a place for most
novels and most novelists to one side or the other of this simultaneously
aesthetic and historical divide. Not so for Joseph Conrad, who usually
ends up in the middle. Michael Levenson, for example, locates Conrad at
English modernism's moment of emergence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 For Levenson, as
for many, Conrad divides the pre-literary from the literary; his work
announces that the modernist break has occurred. According to Fredric
Jameson, Conrad's writing thematizes "the emergence not merely of what
will be contemporary modernism . . . but, also, still tangibly juxtaposed
with it, of what will variously be called popular culture or mass
culture."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Conrad convinces us that the Victorian era is over,
in other words, by accurately forecasting the shape of the culture to come
next. Because he so effectively represents this "strategic fault line,"
Conrad's place in the literary field is singularly "unstable," Jameson
argues, "his work unclassifiable .  . . floating uncertainly somewhere
in between [that of] Proust and Robert Louis Stevenson."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This characterization of Conrad's position has a long history. We
discover it as early as F. R. Leavis's <I>Great Tradition</I>, where

<B></B>

Leavis describes Conrad's writing as combining literariness
with the extra-literary authenticity based on his experience as
a sailor. Thus the best Conrad texts maintain a relationship with
"ordinariness" even as they mine the aesthetic depths of a profoundly
modernist "heroic sublimity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Ian Watt testifies to the
classificatory difficulties posed by such an admixture of high and low
when he depicts Conrad as "both more contemporary and more old-fashioned
than his modern peers." Watt's <I>fin de si&egrave;cle</I> Conrad both
leans back toward the "solidarities of human experience . . . much
commoner among the Romantics and the Victorians" and lurches forward
to a modernist interest in "alienation and exile."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Such
unstable allegiances structure Conrad's biography as well. In Frederick
Karl's authoritative version, Conrad's life story breaks into distinct
thirds--Pole, sailor, and novelist--that persistently bleed into one
another and, ultimately, violate their own terms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By canonizing Conrad for the transgressive, ironic quality of his life
and work, modernist criticism has granted Conrad's precarious position
a curious kind of stability. Such stability in instability is, I argue,
precisely the dynamic imagined in Conrad's letters and his aesthetic
writings. Conrad portrayed himself as an author who transformed popular
material into art, who crossed over from high to low and back again in a
never-ending search for raw material. He defined his work as a salvage
operation, as an act of textual rescue.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Scholars who fix
on the mix of high and low in his novels are therefore reiteratating
Conrad's own representation of his writing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his letters, especially, Conrad made rewriting the specialized focus of
his mode of literary production. By thus portraying his labor as revising,
recrafting, and retooling preexisting narratives, I will demonstrate,
Conrad defined it as a professional task, locating his writing in a
service sector that, at the end of the nineteenth century, was well on
its way to supplanting commodity production and consumption as the engine
of the English economy. In doing so, moreover, he characterized himself
as a manager of literary economics and as conservator of the value
of literature itself. This may seem an odd claim to make, especially
given that Conrad's aesthetic instability was complemented by his
equally well documented poverty. Add to this the fact that Conrad was
never very healthy, and he becomes a distinctly unlikely candidate for
managerial employment. While Conrad's letters do indeed provide ample
evidence, as Frederick Karl and others have shown, that his was a writing
life troubled by chronic mental and physical disability and haunted
by persistent financial calamity, the letters reveal far more than
Conrad's personal suffering. They use that suffering to make a larger
point. When he describes himself as an author in letters to friends,
publishers, and his literary agent, Conrad appropriates the stereotype
of the suffering artist in order to redefine the professional writer in
terms of the difficulty of his labor.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The severity of the
writer's suffering, in other words, underscores the intensity of his work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The letters make suffering the hallmark of modernist authorship. They
use Conrad's gout, furthermore, as the primary register for measuring
the value of the professional services that author performs. By giving
evidence of his suffering, the

<B></B>

letters authenticate Conrad's
labor. They make clear that his writing is his property and, regardless
of its circulation in the market, will remain identifiably his own. The
letters solidify the re of Joseph Conrad, finally, and provide the
terms for his canonization. Conrad is not the only modernist novelist
to have been consecrated for his failing health. Woolf, Lawrence,
Joyce, Forster, and Stein have all, at one time or another, had their
respective achievements narrated as genius born of suffering.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

In noting this larger pattern, I want to suggest that Conrad's letters
contain a model for rethinking how modernism broke with its Victorian
past. By observing Conrad as he negotiates his unstable, uncertain,
and incomplete version of that break, we should be able to discover,
moreover, why suffering was such a common ingredient in the making of
the modernist author.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even as a child, Conrad struggled with a variety of afflictions. By
all accounts, he was never truly well. As he grew older, the one malady
that began to overshadow all others was his gout, a metabolic condition
characterized by an intensely painful inflammation of the joints. During
one especially severe attack in 1891, Conrad's hands swelled so that
his doctor was compelled to send him off to Geneva, Switzerland for a
special "water-mountain cure."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 This crisis occurred while
he was hard at work on his first novel, <I>Almayer's Folly</I>. From
this moment forward Conrad's letters associate writing fiction with
attacks of gout. Gout accompanies inspiration--"Gout. Brought on by-by-by
agitation, exasperation, botheration--You know; those things you laugh
at and bite your thumbs at--O! Lord! And I write! I write! I write! I
write! Certainly. Write quick"
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
--and is part and parcel of
writer's block as well--"When I face that fatal manuscript it seems to
me that I have forgotten how to think--worse! how to write . . . I knock
around blindly . . . till I am positively, physically sick" (<I>CL</I>, 1,
296-97). It is the author's constant companion--"I got up and went
down again some four distinct times since that time; having nevertheless
managed to do some 13 thousand words--the last paper of the Mirror of the
Sea vol." (<I>CL</I>, 3, 287)--and, ultimately, a metaphor for authorship
itself--"a short story of about 5.000 words . . . like a fell disease got
me under" (<I>CL</I>, 1, 298)--all of which leads Conrad to conclude,
in a letter to John Galsworthy in April, 1906, that "perhaps . . . the
hard, atrocious, agonizing days are simply part of my <I>method</I> of
work, a decreed necessity of my production" (<I>CL</I>, 3, 327).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This description does not represent a simple attempt to naturalize
writing. Rather, when Conrad depicts gout as the vital component of his
writing method, he socializes his disease. He narrates his gout--an
inherited illness no less--as an aspect of his working existence, as
part of what might be called his professional persona. That is, he
indicates the specialized quality of his labor through a representation
of his personal suffering. Although this approach may seem surprising,
Conrad's tactical connection of his work to his person is hardly
unique. Magali Sarfatti Larson notes

<B></B>

that professional work
frequently appears "inextricably bound to the person and the personality
of [its] producer."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Often enough, what makes professionals
working in the same field stand out--what distinguishes one doctor
from another, for example--is the personal flair they bring to the
job. Personality names a service. It makes the service distinctive, rare,
and valuable. Furthermore, it forestalls the alienation that characterizes
nonprofessional labor, since it particularizes the professional's labor
in a way unavailable to most workers. Holding alienation at bay is no
small task, however. Because the service sector is intertwined with that
of manufacturing, distinguishing professional labor from that of the
assembly line is a tricky proposition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 In fact, "because
they are personally involved in their work," as Marshall Berman notes,
and because professionals effectively "sell themselves piecemeal," in
Marx's apt turn of phrase, capitalism's demands seem to impinge on them
in an especially intimate way.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 The person and personality of
the professional are affected by the market even as they also produce
effects within it. As Conrad's gout makes apparent the specialized
quality of his writing method, therefore, it also proves his membership
in a professional class of uniquely situated market victims. The letters
provide further evidence of the particular animosity the market has for
Conrad when they show how it eagerly commodifies his work and offers him
next to nothing in exchange. Even as the market robs him of his writing,
however, Conrad manages to retain control over his writing method. Though
his texts become commodified, his means of production remain his own.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"All societies turn on their concept of property," Harold Perkin argues,
and professional society turns on a concept of property expressed
in the performance of a professional service (<I>RPS</I>, 377). What
professionals own most securely, according to Perkin, is their ability to
perform specialized work. They possess this ability only so long as they
continue to perform, however. Professional property is, in this sense,
contingent, which puts it at odds with the more absolute property forms
of inherited land or contracted labor (<I>RPS</I>, 377-79). For this
reason, the idea of professional property emerged in England as part of an
opposition to aristocratic and industrial economic thinking. In the last
half of the nineteenth century, Perkin shows, incipient professionals
organized themselves into career hierarchies and competed with the
partisans of those older proprietary ideals. They attempted to shape an
economic and class logic based on cultural capital rather than industrial
and landed capital. Accountants and auctioneers, hospital administrators
and sanitation engineers all sought to distinguish themselves from members
of the working class proper--who supposedly lacked the education and
training required to perform their specialized labor--as well as from the
constituencies of the upper echelon of England's tripartite class system.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As it turns out, they were largely successful. By the turn of the
century, the majority of Great Britain's economic growth came from
services. From their home base in London and outposts around the world,
service professionals reorganized English domestic and imperial politics,
established a new welfare state bureaucracy, and reinvented English empire
according to their guiding precepts of merit-based qualification

<B></B>

and
the value of cultural capital.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Their work heralded a sea
change in the economic outlook of the country. As Britain's economic
center shifted from the factory towns of Manchester and Birmingham
to the southeast portion of England, the City of London became "more
than ever, the switchboard for the world's international business
transactions, so that its commercial and financial services alone earned
almost enough to make up for [Britain's] large deficit in its balance of
commodity trade."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 The newly dominant professional class made
managerial skill and insider knowledge the preeminent forms of capital
in the world and, furthermore, made itself the only class qualified to
evaluate holdings in this particular form of wealth.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to keep the value of services high, professionalism needed
to induce an economics of scarcity. As Perkin reminds us, "that is
why the organized professional bodies . . . operated 'strategies of
closure' including control of entry, training and qualification, and
sought a monopoly of the name and the practice" of their respective
services (<I>RPS,</I> 378). In his letters, Conrad puts in play his
own criteria of qualification by establishing an opposition between
writing in general and his own specialized craft. As he does so, he
shows that even a skill as increasingly common as writing can be made to
appear scarce. Conrad elaborates on the qualifying criteria pertinent
to this field of professionalized writing in a review of the work of
Hugh Clifford, a friend, a decorated imperial officer, and the author
of several well-received volumes of prose on life in the colonies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1898, the editor of <I>Academy</I>, a literary weekly, contracted
Conrad to review a book of Clifford's entitled <I>Studies in Brown
Humanity</I>. Conrad agreed. In his review, he describes the volume's
prose as full of "sympathy" for its characters, "&Ucirc;mat, the
punkah-puller" and "the coolie, Lim Teng Wah."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Despite
its obvious merits, however, Conrad urged readers not judge the book
as art. In fact, "to apply artistic standards to this book would be a
fundamental error in appreciation," he cautions, since "art veils part
of the truth of life to make the rest appear more splendid, inspiring,
or sinister. And this book is only truth, interesting and futile, truth
unadorned, simple and straightforward."

"the truth," according to Conrad, a definition that he expands on in his
Preface to <I>The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'</I>. "[I]t is only complete,
unswerving devotion to the perfect blending of form and substance," he
argues in the Preface, "only through an unremitting, never-discouraged
care for the shape and ring of sentences that . . . the light of magic
suggestiveness may be brought to play for an evanescent instant over the
commonplace surface of words: of the old, old words, worn thin, defaced
by ages of careless usage."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The author privileged by Conrad
in this description does not create texts so much as recreate them. He
revises, rescues, and rewrites them. He makes them better. In a letter
to his publisher, William Blackwood, Conrad provides an example of this
service from his own oeuvre. "The favourable critics of that story [i.e.,
'Youth'], Q[uiller-Couch] amongst others remarked with a sort of surprise
'This after all is a story for boys yet--' Exactly. Out of the material of
a boys' story I've made <I>Youth</I>" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 417). The beauty of
Conrad's specialized mode of rewriting is that it works with all sorts of
texts. It can take adventure

<B></B>

stories, as with "Youth," or, indeed,
any kind of generic prose "worn thin . . . by ages of careless usage,"
and, by servicing it, make that writing into something new.

In the months following the <I>Academy</I> review, Conrad and Clifford
began exchanging letters. Clifford paid Conrad a visit at his home
in Kent. And, when his next book came out, Clifford mailed Conrad
a copy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Like the earlier <I>Studies</I>, Clifford's new
volume, entitled <I>In a Corner of Asia</I>, focussed on the lives of his
colonial subjects in Malaya. Conrad invokes that point of origin in the
October 1899 letter he sent to acknowledge the book's receipt. There,
he congratulates Clifford on his mastery of ethnographic detail and,
once again, chides him for not writing art.

blank minds on the subject of the race you have, in more than one sense,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the suggestion that Clifford has taken possession of the Malay
"race," "in more than one sense," Conrad gestures toward the colonial
apparatus that enabled Clifford's writing. He hints, further, that
imperialism has smoothed the way for the consumption of Clifford's prose
as well. Clifford's status as an authorized narrator of native life grants
his writing a currency matched only by the universally recognizable
pound sterling, according to Conrad. Despite these advantages, Conrad
questions the ultimate authority of Clifford's text. In the last line
of this passage, he chiasmatically reverses the logic of Clifford's
proprietary claim to the "subject of the race [he has] made [his] own."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to Conrad's reading, Clifford's text presumes that it has all
of the facts under control and, further, that those facts refer to a
world outside language. There is a crucial flaw in this reasoning, Conrad
asserts. Writers who believe that their work refers to the real mistake
the power of the word. They fail to realize that "the <I>whole</I> of the
truth lies in the presentation" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 200). With this linguistic
turn, Conrad reverses the implicit hierarchy he identifies in Clifford's
privileging of subject "matter" over what Conrad ironically calls "mere
expression" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 200). The real subject of writing, he avers,
is writing. "The things 'as they are' exist in words," he observes, and
"words should be handled with care, lest the picture, the image of truth
abiding in facts should become distorted--or blurred" (<I>CL</I>, 2,
200). Without sufficient expertise in writing, truth fades, the subject
blurs, and the author is left owning nothing at all, as his subject
slips from his grasp. With this move, Conrad proposes a proprietary
relationship that depends entirely on the writer's ability.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To ensure that Clifford understands the distinction, Conrad proposes
to revise several lines from <I>In a Corner of Asia</I>. He selects a
passage symptomatic of what he presents as Clifford's undertheorized use
of language: "When the whole horror of his

<B></B>

position forced itself
with an agony of realization upon his frightened mind, Pa' T&ucirc;a for
a space lost his reason" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 201). For Conrad, these lines
exemplify Clifford's trust in the real. They provide an opportunity to
show why such trust is necessarily misplaced. "In this sentence the reader
is borne down by the full expression . . . The word <I>frightened</I>
is fatal . . . [It] is totally inadequate to express the true state of
that man's mind. No word is adequate," Conrad concludes (<I>CL</I>, 2,
201). In order to convey what Pa' T&ucirc;a feels, a more sophisticated,
and more roundabout, technique must be used. First, Conrad counsels,
excise the word "frightened." Second, refuse to interpret for the reader:
"The imagination of the reader should be left free to arouse his feeling"
(2: 201). The slippage of the word "his" in this sentence--Does "his
feeling" refer to Pa' T&ucirc;a or to the reader?--reinforces Conrad's
argument. The language appropriate to the task at hand should be evocative
without strictly delimiting Pa' T&ucirc;a's fright. Conrad expects his
reader to detect fear without being handed the word "frightened." Reading
depends crucially on one's ability to interpret what a text leaves open
or unsaid.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here, then, are the results of Conrad's revision: "When the whole truth of
his position forced itself upon his mind, Pa' T&ucirc;a for a space lost
his reason" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 201). "This is truth," Conrad writes. "And look
how finely it goes on with a perfectly legitimate effect," he continues:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When the whole truth of the horror of his position forced itself
upon his mind, Pa' T&ucirc;a for a space lost his reason. He screamed
aloud, and the hollow of the rocks took up his cries; the bats awoke in
thousands and joined the band that rustled and squeaked above the man
etc. etc. (<I>CL</I>, 2, 201)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By streamlining Clifford's prose, Conrad appears to have succeeded in
making the text more productive. With the rustles and squeaks of those
thousands of bats, Pa' T&ucirc;a's fright bursts from the page. This
exercise in revision provides an object lesson in the efficacy of
what Edward Said calls Conrad's "minimal but hauntingly reverberating
phrases."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 It is as well a prime example of Conrad's own
unmistakable literary style. The newly improved version resonates with the
sort of "oppressive mysteriousness" and inexactitude that so famously
annoyed F. R.  Leavis, and which makes Conrad's writing so easily
identifiable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 By revising Clifford's lines, therefore,
Conrad took possession of them. By servicing Clifford's text, he made
that text his own and imprinted it with his own reproducible style.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When he unveils the contingent hold a writer has on his writing, Conrad
reverses a century-old effort to legitimate aesthetic work by describing
it in absolute terms. As Mark Rose shows, eighteenth century narratives
of authorship frequently employed the vocabulary of landed capital in
an attempt to elevate the value of literary labor. Rose directs us to
the example of Joseph Addison, who said of one author, "his Brain,
which was his Estate, had as regular and different Produce as other
Men's land."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Litigants in nineteenth century debates over
copyright revisited this aristocratic mode. One, William Dougal Christie,
even imagined "a class of men holding hereditary

<B></B>

estates, not in
broad lands, but in books."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Victorian authors drew on this
language to give their profession an "aura of gentility" as well as the
moral authority to challenge the Taylorizing tendencies of commercial
publishers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Persistent antagonism between these two
parties notwithstanding, authors and publishers both participated in the
innovations that transformed novel production in the Victorian era. When
the author and publisher Charles Dickens helped make serialization
popular in the 1830s, he gave the novel even greater visibility than
it had previously enjoyed and created a whole new set of conditions
for novel writing. As Mary Poovey shows, part-issue publication red
the author as just "one instance of [the] labor" required to put out a
book.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Publishers attempted to force novelists to write on
schedule, to compose their words in evenly distributed portions, and
to plot their narratives so that each chapter's conclusion would also
function as an advertisement for the next installment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

Dickens was the master of this form of writing. He also participated
in that other central trend of Victorian literary production, the
feminization of the novel. By acting as a spokesperson for the doctrine
of separate spheres, Dickens underscored the novel's association with
the stereotypically feminine terms of domesticity, sentiment, and
feeling.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Somewhat ironically, then, Dickens's version of
the novel forged a link between mass marketability and feminization, a
link reinforced, as Andreas Huyssen observes, by the practitioners and
critics of modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As feminist critics ranging from Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar
to Rita Felski and Anita Levy have shown, modernism was "motivated
to a considerable extent by the will to observe and to know the
female."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Modernists did not follow in the footsteps of the
Victorians, however. They rewrote the feminine subject by primitivizing,
aestheticizing, psychologizing, and otherwise subjecting her to an
array of newly professionalized discourses. They detached the categories
of sentiment and feeling from the feminine and made them the property
of the professional.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 For an example of this reclassifying
process we need look no farther than Conrad's letter to Clifford, where
Conrad makes the acts of arousing a reader's "feeling" and discerning
"the true state" of a person's mind the appropriate labor of professional
literary practice (<I>CL</I>, 2, 201).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to usurping what had been the domain of popular writers,
Conrad takes over the space of the domestic itself. Like Dickens before
him, Conrad portrays himself as a guardian of the home. In contrast with
Dickens, Conrad proves less than successful at this task. The conclusion
of his letter to Clifford depicts Conrad struggling to produce writing
that will allow him to secure his family's well-being. The market obliges
him by purchasing his work, but it is clearly the market, and not the
author, who sets the terms for this exchange.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As he subjects himself to the market's terms, Conrad also gives us the
clear indication that, of all the aspects of his work, rewriting is
what takes the most time and energy. To make this point, to establish
the centrality of rewriting to his self-definition as an author, Conrad
paradoxically must run the risk of failing as a domestic provider. Through
its narrative of market dominance, his letter suggests that the Victorian
duties of authorship--securing the values of the home over the values of
the market, making generally available the deep-seated truths of human
subjectivity--are far more difficult than the Victorians let on.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his letter to Clifford, Conrad addresses the author of imperial
adventure as well as the Victorian narrator of domestic romance. His
anguished scene of writing sublates both of these versions of
authorship. He dismisses the author of parlor fiction by appropriating
the space of the home and by taking over the job of portraying the inner
reaches of subjectivity. As for the adventure author, he can be glimpsed
"between the lines" of Clifford's prose, "like the progress of a traveller
in the jungle that may be traced by the sound of the <I>parang</I>
chopping the swaying creepers, while the man himself is glimpsed, now and
then, between the trees."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Conrad displaces this author by
identifying the desk, rather than the jungle, as the appropriate setting
for literary struggle. He does not simply displace this author, however,
but instead appropriates the trappings of Clifford's adventure model
and applies them to his own situation. He builds struggle and physical
risk into the professional mode of authorial production. As we shall see,
Conrad's writing is every bit as perilous as Clifford's labor amidst "the
great flood" and the "menacing rocks" of the Malay peninsula.

If the author's job in Conrad's letters is to render a distinctive
literary service, the reader's responsibility is to recognize the
value of that service. Readers are investors in the letters, and the
smart ones know to buy into an undervalued author while his price
is still low. In the decade of the 1890s, Conrad certainly fit this
bill. Neither he nor his publisher was satisfied with the sales of his
early Malay novels. While his <I>The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'</I> did
somewhat better than those, Conrad's limited marketability still stood
out at a moment when the bookstores were flush with best-sellers. The
market for fiction was booming in England at the close of the nineteenth
century. Every year, more novels found publishers and more new novelists
emerged on the scene. As one commentator observed, "Most moderately
well-educated people nowadays are actual or potential authors. They
have dabbled in literature for purposes of pleasure or profit, they
have published a book, or they have written magazine or newspaper
articles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 This was the moment when the term "best-seller"
began to take on its contemporary meaning. The <I>Book Monthly</I> was
one of several

<B></B>

periodicals that tracked novel sales in Britain at
the turn of the century, but the journal's editor, James Milne, seemed
far from comfortable with this method of evaluating fiction. He took
care to assure his readers that the <I>Book Monthly</I>'s lists were
"prepared by a high authority," and that they were therefore sanctioned
by more than public opinion alone.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conrad's letters also pondered the relationship between market value and
literary taste. In a 1913 exchange with the publisher Blackwood's, for
instance, Conrad sought to fix the relationship between aesthetic worth
and the price of a novel. Blackwood's suggested that "the inclusion of
Lord Jim in our 1/- Editions might be a successful undertaking," and might
bring both publisher and author the profits that had eluded them when the
novel was first published in 1900.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Conrad responded promptly
to this proposition. In his answer, he noted that he too was concerned
that the novel was increasingly difficult to find. He disagreed, however,
that a new cheap edition would help Blackwood's target an appropriate
readership for the text. "I have been hearing for some time now that the
booksellers tell people <I>Lord Jim</I> is out of print," he observed,
"[but] I would much prefer a new edition at 6/- leaving the Democracy
of the bookstalls to cut its teeth on something softer" <I>(LWB</I>
193). Price, for Conrad, indicates quality. By elevating the cost of
his books, he apparently hoped to signal their aesthetic value and
snag art-conscious consumers. More than a promotional tool, price helps
to identify a readership. By thinking taste and cost together, Conrad
imagines the market less as one mass entity and more as an amalgamation
of niches. The market for him is not a mysterious, amorphous thing guided
by an invisible hand, then, but a knowable, and therefore manipulable
organization of demographics, each with its own specific tastes. In this
conception of the market, aesthetics and economics are not enemies. They
are complementary diagnostic matrices for analyzing and predicting the
behavior of these demographics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is a market theory uniquely suited for a literary field in which
book readers were also book buyers, which had not always been the
case, we should remember. During the nineteenth-century hegemony of the
triple-decker and the lending library, readers rented. In the 1890s,
however, the libraries decided that the triple-decker had outlived
its usefulness, and they pressed publishers to begin printing novels
exclusively in single-volume editions. With this move, the libraries
sealed their own fate as well as that of three-volume publication. For,
as technological innovation and marketing strategies made printing
and distributing one-volume fictions more and more cost-effective for
publishers, they began to bypass the libraries and sell to consumers
through retail outlets instead.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conrad presented a fuller version of his market theory in a letter he sent
to Blackwood's in May of 1902, just after he arrived home from a meeting
with William Blackwood, the head of the family business. At this meeting,
Conrad had asked Blackwood to grant him a loan. Blackwood turned him
down and made it clear in the process that publishing Conrad had so far
proven "a loss to [his] firm" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 421).
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Conrad
responded by suggesting to Blackwood that he had missed the point. It
mattered

<B></B>

less, he said, how many books Blackwood sold than who
he was selling them to. In his letter, Conrad produces the names of
several influential--or soon to be influential--literary res who,
he says, buy his fiction, res like W. H. Henley, the publisher of
the <I>New Review</I>, George Bernard Shaw, and H. G. Wells. He tells
Blackwood that his incipient readership is hardly limited to such
sophisticated readers alone. It also includes the likes of "Yrg&ouml;
Hirn of the Finland University," "Maurice Greiffenhagen a painter
. . . the skipper of a Persian Gulf steamer who wrote to the papers of
my 'Typhoon' . . . [and] a charming old lady in Winchester" (<I>CL</I>,
2, 416). This is an eclectic bunch to be sure, but what they all had in
common was a certain willingness to invest in Conrad's work. More than
this, they have all understood and recognized the revisionary service
his work provided. They were able to see, for example, that in "Heart
of Darkness" Conrad made "of that story something quite on another
plane than an anecdote of a man who went mad in the Centre of Africa"
(<I>CL</I>, 2, 417). They knew that his texts were different and that
they were undervalued in the current market. Cultivating such a loyal
readership takes patience, Conrad tells Blackwood. It takes time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Time was a particularly sensitive subject between Conrad and Blackwood. In
the correspondence that led up to their meeting, the author and publisher
had engaged in a dispute about how long it was taking Conrad to finish his
novels. William Blackwood was concerned that Conrad wrote so erratically
and slowly that it was impossible to put him on any kind of publishing
calendar. William's nephew George, a junior editor at the firm, reiterated
this point and expressed his own concern about the narrative pacing
of Conrad's fiction. George complained in particular about a story
entitled, appropriately enough, "The End of the Tether," which his uncle
planned to run serially and then publish with two other fictions under
the title <I>Youth</I>. When, on May 20, Conrad submitted the first
installment of "Tether," George was the assigned reader. After paging
through the manuscript, he alerted Conrad that, "as far as [his reading]
goes at present"--some fourteen-thousand words--"one can hardly say one
has got into the story yet" at all.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 If this were true, if
fourteen-thousand words represented only the beginning of the narrative,
then all of the publisher's production schedules were in danger. George
was right to be worried. Conrad had a bad habit of starting such stories
as "Jim: A Sketch" that turned out to be books. In this case, <I>Lord
Jim</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his letter to William, Conrad grudgingly concedes George's point,
saying that it was "in measure correct but, on a large view, beside the
point" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 417). His narrative pacing and writing time did
not detract but added to the value of his manuscript. "I am long in my
development," he admits to William. "What of that?"

Conrad scores "three hits" in this elaborate self-defense, as Frederick
Karl and Laurence Davies point out in their editorial notes to the letters
(<I>CL</I>, 2, 418). The Blackwood's company published all but one of
George Eliot's novels, William Blackwood's father was a great friend of
Thackeray's, and the heroic re of Sir Walter Scott loomed large over
the literary and intellectual culture of Edinburgh, where Blackwood's
publishing house was based. In addition to good aim, Conrad also evinces
a gift at subtle displacement in this passage. He responds to a question
about his production with an answer concerning the issue of his texts'
consumption. He blames the literary market for his unimpressive sales. The
novel-reading public has changed since the era of Scott and Eliot and
Thackeray, Conrad contends. It has become more hurried, more demanding,
one might even say more savvy in pursuing its needs.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Victorian literary field Conrad describes could not be more different
from the modern one in which he worked. It is a peaceful, homogeneous
place and almost primitive in the closeness it maintained between
producers and consumers. Eliot and Scott are perfectly in tune with their
audience. Or, more precisely, their audience has not yet transformed
into the exacting market that dominates at the turn of the century. By
thus flattening the Victorian field, Conrad makes market competition
into a modernist phenomenon. Because Blackwood relies on a pre-modern
conception of the market, Conrad suggests, the publisher mistakenly
treats the novels he sells as if they were Victorian texts. Modern
texts are different. "I am <I>modern</I>," he announces, implying that
work like his neither fits into a ready-made category, nor will find a
readership right away. Victorian novel-production is the wrong analogy
for his kind of work, then. As a more fitting comparison, he explains,

 All producers there

need to put themselves in a position to lure investors who understand
that the risk involved in supporting an unpopular artist can lead to
tremendous rewards. By borrowing this model of patron and artist, Conrad
redefines the publishing business. Publishers should act, he suggests, as
investment brokers. "[A] writer may be taken up as an investment," Conrad
wrote to Alfred Knopf in 1913, and should be treated accordingly. "An
investment must be attended to, it must be nursed--if one believes in
it."

In marked contrast to the notion of a fragmented and niched market,
nineteenth century commentators tended to think of their reading public
in broad-based national terms. Ian Duncan traces this conception to Sir
Walter Scott: "The Waverly novels had done much to define that re
of a unified public imagination--a society brought together in the act
of reading the same book--as they charted an expanding . . . literary
market."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 This national audience generated a novelist who
was, oddly enough, rarely portrayed writing. The early scene of literary
production was often occluded, while the act of writing itself took on a
supernatural, gothic air. A telling example of this mystification occurs
in Lockhardt's <I>Life of Scott</I>, when the novelist at work appears
to a stunned observer as a free-floating, unattached hand.

 As they enter the realm of commodities and

remains in the background, fragmented--disembodied as Lockhardt portrays
him--his connection to the text ambiguous at best. How different is this
process of alienation from Conrad's portrayal of the tight bond between
author and writing? Conrad's author is radically embodied, a fact which
announces his participation in an economy that focuses on the writing
rather than the book, on the service rather than the commodity.

By depicting suffering as an expression of artistry, Conrad imbues that
suffering with value. He makes of it a badge that the author displays

writers as professionals in search of investors. Suffering tells potential
patrons that an artist is willing to sacrifice for art, that he or she is

patient investor. Presented this way, suffering becomes cultural capital
and begins to behave in the manner that capital has been theorized by

<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Cultural capital may seem <I>merely</I> cultural,
Bourdieu allows, but it exerts economic effects. It is "denied capital,"
capital that has no overt economic value but nevertheless behaves in
economic ways.

 Cultural capital can be invested, it can
be traded, and, most importantly, it can accumulate--"the exhibition of
symbolic capital . . . is one of the mechanisms which make capital go to
capital."

 We have an opportunity to witness the operation
of this mechanism in the letters where Conrad uses his suffering, and
particularly that associated with his gout, to fend off the disembodying
tendencies of commodification.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the letters of the 1890s, which depict Conrad in the early stages
of his writing, gout supplements the market value of his work. In these
letters, we frequently see the author requesting and receiving advances
on incomplete work. Soon after selling Blackwood the short story,
"Youth," for example, Conrad thanks Blackwood for a &#163;5 check "on
account of the story (yet unfinished) entitled <I>Jim: A Sketch</I>"
(<I>CL</I>, 2, 67). As he begins writing "Heart of Darkness," some six
months later on, Conrad solicits Blackwood for more advance funding. He
asks for and receives &#163;40 (<I>CL</I>, 2, 145), then &#163;60 more
(<I>CL</I>, 2, 163), which, he writes "will probably overpay it as I do
not think it will run to 40000 words" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 164). The letters
are full of these sorts of calculations, as Conrad attempts to maintain
a balance of "words v. sovereigns" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 237).
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>

Despite all his effort, Conrad rarely ends up in the black.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a December 1909 letter to his agent, J. B. Pinker, Conrad tries to
rectify this situation by factoring in the hardship involved in his
labor. He attempts, in other words, to give his suffering a monetary
value. In 1907 Pinker and Conrad had taken steps to standardize
the author's finances. They had agreed that Pinker would pay Conrad
&#163;600 each year, in return for which he would write eighty-thousand
words.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
Conrad was unable to keep to this schedule. Although
he wrote more words in total than were expected of him, not enough
were towards novels, the only type of writing Pinker was interested
in. Conrad discovered, further, that &#163;600 was not enough money
to satisfy his needs. He required extra cash to pay his medical bills,
among other expenses. So, in late 1909, he attempted to renegotiate the
contract. He wrote to Pinker,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[I]n the last 23H months I've written 187,000 words (of  which 130,000 in
round numbers of Razumov [<I>Under Western Eyes</I>]). In the course of
these 23H months as two <I>honourable</I> professional men can testify,
from July last year to August of this I've had five severe attacks of
gout . . . Thats twelve months: but as I often worked when far from
fit--yes with temp at over 100&#186;--when most men would be utterly
unable to do anything--yes and creative work too--let us deduct only 8
months; which would leave 16 months of effective health and works out
at the average of 11630 w. per month. (<I>CL</I>, 4, 302)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conrad makes the case that he should be paid above and beyond what he has
already received from Pinker for his work over the last two years. This is
the only reason why

<B></B>

he introduces his illness, he tells Pinker. "I
am not a confounded hypoc[h]ondriac in search of sympathy. I didn't
write of my health in a conventional way . . . I alluded to it because
it has a direct bearing on the situation" (<I>CL</I>, 4, 303). His
reasoning runs as follows: he has produced far more, first of all,
than the eighty-thousand words a year Pinker had agreed to. If one
factors in the time he was sick, Conrad shows Pinker, he has written
at a rate that, had he been healthy, would have allowed him to produce
even more. 11,630 words per month, over twenty-four months, works out to
upwards of 279,000 words. Given this, Conrad implies, Pinker should not be
denying him advances. He should, if anything, offer him a raise. If we use
the numbers Conrad provides as our guide, Pinker should be paying twice
again the amount he had already disbursed for the two years in question.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conrad failed in this attempt to persuade Pinker to pay him for the time
he was down with gout, and, given the circumstances, this is hardly
surprising. Pinker had been waiting for <I>Under Western Eyes</I> for
close to two years by the time Conrad wrote him the letter I have cited
above. He was also frustrated by the fact that, with the end of the novel
in sight, Conrad had put the book aside to start a completely different
project, the short story "The Secret Sharer." As this displacement
suggests, Conrad could write, though not the book he had promised to
deliver. Like his attacks of gout, the act of redirecting his attention to
"The Secret Sharer" allows Conrad to delay the completion, and subsequent
publication of his novel. It is interesting to note, in light of this
observation, that Conrad's gout tends to worsen as he is finishing books,
as his work is about to leave his hands and enter the commodity market. He
comments on bodily distress at the very moment when alienation, or to
use the term made available by the hand of Walter Scott, disembodiment,
is about to take hold.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The development economist Jagdish Bhagwati argues that a "disembodiment
effect," like that Lockhardt documents, is a usual part of what happens
when professional services "splinter," as he puts it, into the commodity
market.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[T]he services, initially embodied in the person providing them (for
example, Placido Domingo singing at the Metropolitan), and requiring
the physical presence of the provider of the services at the time of
use, are disembodied as a result of technical change and encapsulated
into what we call goods (such as the invention which brings Placido
Domingo via records--that is, goods--into our homes) . . . [This]
goods-from-services splintering process, reflecting the disembodiment
effect, generally leaves behind a residue  of service activities which
are technically unprogressive and generally labour intensive.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because they find themselves on the labor-intensive side of the bargain,
Bhagwati shows, many successful service providers become victims of their
own good fortune. If their services are valuable enough to commodify
and distribute to a wide audience, their share of the profits often
goes down. Domingo gets rich from his CD sales, of course, but one
suspects that his record company profits substantially more from the
venture than he does. The discrepancy between the profits of service
professionals

<B></B>

and commodity producers may be even wider in a case
like Conrad's, where the total amount of revenue involved is so much
smaller. The letters reveal that Conrad has, relatively speaking, little
trouble getting critical recognition for his writing, which helps him
find publishers for his work. The problem is that book publication seems
a difficult place to turn that recognition, that cultural capital, into
economic capital, or monetary profit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to address this problem, Conrad attempts to articulate a method
for readers to use in consuming his work as a service, an alternate way
for them to invest in the author and his work. To this end, he gives
the readers of his letters access to his scene of writing and shows them
the disembodiment effect as it occurs. He lets them experience the toll
that turning his writing into commodities takes on his body. By thus
reembodying his work, Conrad directs the attention of his readers to the
mode of literary production itself. He defines a channel through which
the cultural capital represented by their recognition of his work will
flow. He hopes that economic capital will also follow. Nowhere does this
theoretical answer to the disembodiment effect appear more clearly than
in the letters surrounding the writing of his novel <I>Nostromo</I>. In
the author's note to that text, Conrad describes the book as "the most
anxiously mediated of [his] longer novels."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 His letters give
a rather less understated account of <I>Nostromo</I>'s completion. They
depict the final days of writing in all their gory detail, and give
us a wonderfully evocative account of the moment when Conrad's writing
splinters from its life as a service into its incarnation as a commodity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are two versions of the events leading up to <I>Nostromo</I>'s
completion. One appears in a series of short letters to the agent
Pinker. These letters reproduce the familiar fits and starts of Conrad's
work method. The first in the series, dated the 24th of August, includes
a promise from Conrad that he will finish <I>Nostromo</I> in two days
time. He asks for a &#163;2 check in advance, because, he tells Pinker, "I
haven't the price of railway fare in the house" (<I>CL</I>, 3, 156). Two
days pass and Conrad writes again to say that he is not yet done. He
has had a sore tooth, he claims, which "made him unfit to work," but he
guarantees that copy will be in the mail the next morning, a Saturday
(<I>CL</I>, 3, 156-57). Saturday comes and goes, as does Sunday,
and the next letter Conrad sends is dated the 31st, which would be a
Wednesday. In their editorial notes, Karl and Davies produce evidence
to suggest that in fact the day was Tuesday, early, around four o'clock
in the morning. Conrad explains, "I could not resist the temptation
of a Sunday intervening and keep the MS to work at it a little more"
(<I>CL</I>, 3, 157). "I may just as well thank you for this work being
finished," he remarks rather pitifully, "for thanks are due to you
undeniably. And if I don't say more it isn't that I grudge you the words
but because I am tired--done up" (<I>CL</I>, 3, 158). These letters surely
make Conrad into a victim of the book-production process. In finishing
his novel, he expends the scant resources in his possession, his words
and his health towards the dismal prospect of commodification. To make
matters worse, when the proofs of <I>Nostromo</I> arrive, Conrad discovers
that his publisher has treated his words in a decidedly slipshod manner:
"I am disgusted with the slovenliness,

<B></B>

meanness of the book's get
up," Conrad complains to Pinker, "the horrid misprints, the crooked
lines, the dropped punctuation marks. By Jove a fourth of the page
slants!" (<I>CL</I>, 3, 171-72). Commodification is a losing
proposition all around.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The other version of these same events appears in a letter Conrad sent
to the novelist John Galsworthy. If the letters to Pinker provide an
origin story for <I>Nostromo</I> the commodity, this letter represents a
competing narrative in which <I>Nostromo</I> survives as a service. The
letter to Galsworthy opens with Conrad's declaration that the novel is
"finished! Finished on the 30th in Hope's house in Stanford in Essex,
where I had to take off my brain that seemed to turn to water" (<I>CL</I>,
3, 159). With this, Conrad records the moment when splintering occurs
and the disembodiment effect sets in. The paragraphs that follow build
on this image of Conrad literally losing his head. They portray his body
coming loose at the seams.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
His brain is the first part to go. A decaying tooth is next. "On the
27th had to wire for dentist (couldn't leave the work) who came at 2 and
dragged at the infernal thing which seemed rooted in my very soul. The
horror came away at last, leaving however one root in the gum. Then he
grubbed for <I>that</I> till I le[a]pt out of the chair" (<I>CL</I>,
3, 158). Conrad uses "horror," one of his more identifiable words and
one half of what is easily his most famous line, to a darkly comedic
effect. He invokes all the rhetorical force of the narrative often hailed
as his masterpiece, "Heart of Darkness," to describe a sore tooth. It is
as if Conrad were letting Galsworthy in on a joke. The stakes are high
in the events he is describing--there is nothing so important in the
letters as finishing a book--but Conrad wants to make sure Galsworthy
knows that he, and not the commodity market, is in control.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conrad continues to play with the gravity of his situation in the lines
that follow, as he depicts himself settling down to write at his desk:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
At 11.30 something happened--what it is I don't know. I  was writing, and
raised my eyes to look at the clock. The next thing I know I was sitting
(not lying) sitting on the concrete outside the door. When I crawled in
I found it was nearly one. I managed to get upstairs and said to Jessie:
We must be off to-morrow. (<I>CL</I>, 3, 158)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The disembodiment effect is in its advanced stages. After Conrad loses
consciousness, his body takes on a life of its own. It begins, much
in the fashion of Scott's hand, to carry on all by itself. At the last
moment, however, Conrad resists. He takes back his magically reanimated
corpse and, upon regaining control, charges out of the house with his
wife in tow.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A car arrives for them at ten o'clock on the morning after Conrad's
out-of-body experience. Their destination, we learn, is the home of
Conrad's friend G. F. W. Hope. Along the way, the tenuous quality of
Conrad's control over his body gets the attention of his driver--"I
sat by the man's side like a corpse . . . [H]e said to me You look
ill sir; shall I stop?" At this point, the letter produces its most
telling evocation of splintering. Just as Conrad threatens to collapse
altogether, a stranger appears at

<B></B>

the side of the road. Conrad's
car strikes him and, suddenly, Conrad springs back to life.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In Chatham, street crowded, packed. Going dead slow knocked down
a man--old chap, apparently a bricklayer. Crowd around cursing and
howling. Helped him to my front seat and I standing on the step got him
to the hospital in 10 minutes. No harm. Only shaken. Saw him all comfy
in bed for the rest of the day. (<I>CL</I>, 3, 159)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is as if Conrad hands off the effects of disembodiment to this startled
old man. One moment near death, the next Conrad is hoisting himself up
on the running board as his car careens through a hostile mob. After
pausing at the hospital, the car speeds on and, in the evening, arrives
at the house of Conrad's friend. By then, Conrad is well on his way to
beating back Bhagwati's disembodiment effect and to gaining control over
his self-representation in the literary market. He eats food and, for
the first time in over a week, "<I>tasted it too</I>" (<I>CL</I>, 3,
159). He sleeps, goes to work, and finishes the novel. He sleeps again
and then writes the letter to Galsworthy. "I had not the <I>heart</I>
to write to you that same night," Conrad informs him (<I>CL</I>, 3, 159;
emphasis added), suggesting the effects of splintering still linger and
he has yet to regain control over his entire body. "Wasn't sure I would
survive," he continues. "But I have survived extremely well . . . I am
quite recovered and ready for work again" (<I>CL</I>, 3, 159). One last
act remains, however, before Conrad is willing to declare the adventure
a success. He awaits Galsworthy's recognition. "There is wanting to the
finish of this undertaking the sanction of your presence and voice," he
writes in conclusion. "Drop me a line. Come down if you can!" (<I>CL</I>,
3, 159).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the letters that follow, Conrad rehearses the story of his
disembodiment and subsequent reembodiment for the other members of
his growing circle. He shares the tale with H. G.  Wells, Edward
Garnett, Ford Madox Ford, R. B. Cunningham Graham, and others,
invoking for each of them his "half-delirious state," his "two blank
hours . . . on the concrete," and his horrible tooth--"It broke!" he
exclaims to Ford (<I>CL</I>, 3, 162-69). All respond to his pleas
for recognition--"I receive magnificent letters," Conrad tells Pinker
(<I>CL</I>, 3, 178). Their acknowledgement of his struggle brings to
completion the process of reembodiment begun in the letter. Cunningham
Graham's response in particular brings the pink back to Conrad's cheeks,
as it were: "Your letter was indeed worth having and I blush deeply as I
re-read it," Conrad tells him (<I>CL</I>, 3, 175). Conrad's renewed health
signifies the recognition his work has received, which itself represents
an accumulation of cultural capital that compensates for the capital
loss represented by the decidedly mixed reviews <I>Nostromo</I> received
in the popular press and for its sluggish sales as well.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>

Arnold Bennett, in a belated acknowledgement, dismisses the importance
of such forums. "[P]eople are so blind, and so infernally obstinate
in complaining because a book is not something that an author never
intended it to be. Only other creative artists can understand a creative
artist." After sharing this sentiment, Bennett reinforces Conrad's

<B></B>

reembodiment: "if one could but convey to you the <I>passionate</I>
comprehension which some of us have of your work, I think the effect on
your health would be good."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the years pass and the narrative of Conrad's letters progresses,
the number of his correspondents grows, as does the number of readers
qualified to assist in his reembodying project. Soon after Conrad's
death, Gerard Jean-Aubrey published a two-volume biography that included
hundreds of his letters. Collections from select correspondents, longtime
friends like Edward Garnett and Richard Curle, soon followed. These made
Conrad's scene of writing generally available and increased exponentially
the number of readers whose recognition would lend cultural capital to his
writing. Though the author himself had died, this recognition continued to
enliven his work. His institutionalization in Karl's biography and in the
major critical analyses of Guerard, Sherry, and Moser certified Conrad's
method of accounting for suffering. Later criticism preserved Conrad's
depiction of his mode of production, as one passage from Said's <I>The
World, the Text, and the Critic</I> makes clear: "Loneliness, darkness,
the necessity of writing, imprisonment: these are the pressures upon the
writer as he writes, and there is scarcely any I have read who seems so
profligate in his complaining."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 Not so profligate as all
that, I have shown, for with each complaint Conrad gave another reader
the opportunity to invest in his work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We can deduce that when Conrad backs away from his declaration that he is
"extremely well" and returns again to a refrain of illness and depression,
he does so in order to reproduce the means of his literary production. In
Conrad's understanding of writing as a professional service, there can be
no reembodiment without a prior disembodiment. This insight represents
Conrad's major contribution to literary economics. With it, he alters
the normative relationship between writing and commodification and makes
intelligible his own particular mode of production. The debilitating,
humiliating, and ultimately disembodying process of commodification
necessarily comes first, he theorizes. Before he can perform the service
of rewriting, or literary supplementation, there has to be a commodified,
worn-out narrative for him to rewrite. Before his work can receive
recognition from correspondents and critics, it must first be subjected to
the rigors, the horrors even, of market-driven production. The commodity
market has to kill the author before his consumers can resurrect him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Herein lies the adventure of Conrad's professionalized writing
practice. Conrad presents his writing as a voyage into the nether regions
of pulp fiction. His salvage operations are journeys that imperil
his reputation as a serious artist. Each time he tries to transform
a text, he runs the risk of going native, of giving in to the lures
of mass culture. Each time he rewrites a story, he gambles that he
will be able to manage his object, that it will not ultimately manage
him. Conrad describes this hazardous gambit in his Author's Note to
<I>Nostromo</I>. "[M]y sojourn on the continent of Latin America," he
recounts, "lasted for two years . . . [which included] many intervals
of renewed hesitation, lest I should lose myself in the ever-enlarging
vistas opening before me as I progressed deeper in my knowledge of the
country."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Conrad

<B></B>

wrote this note more than a decade
after <I>Nostromo</I>'s initial publication in a style that echoes
the cover copy on the dust jacket of the novel's first edition. That
cover proclaimed <I>Nostromo</I> "a moving tale of high adventure--of
revolution, romance, hidden treasure, and a hero of the most vivid
personality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 The Author's Note reproducing this rhetoric
thus implies that the real hero of the tale is none other than the
author himself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Far from undermining this mythic narrative of authorship, Conrad's
letters provided their readers with ample evidence of the physical and
psychic costs that were part and parcel of the adventure of literary
production. Conrad's gout, along with his other ailments, proved that
writing was a very real struggle, even if the author did not truly
travel to Latin America to complete his novel, even if the author did
not even leave his house. Though his letters complemented the more
public account of his literary labor, Conrad was emphatic that these
two descriptions be kept distinct. He regularly denied requests from
literary detectives interested in publicizing the details of his working
life. "The Author's method of work should remain an intimate thing," he
wrote to one reviewer in 1903. "I would just as soon think of laying
bare coram populo my method of home life . . . as my method of work"
(<I>CL</I>, 3, 12). By enforcing this injunction, Conrad guaranteed that
both versions of his authorship would remain in play. He also helped
to ensure that the version articulated by the letters would remain the
property of his most privileged readers: the scholars and critics deeply
invested in his work, his mode of authorship, and his modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Through these means, the professional author represented by Conrad's
letters keeps one foot planted in mass culture and the other resting in
high art. The letters thus place Conrad astride the great divide. By
managing his literary persona, moreover, they manage the terms for
understanding his literature. The letters show us that in order for the
difference of the modernist novel to emerge, Conrad's distinctive service
of novel-writing had to become recognizable. Conrad's letters establish
the specificity of that labor as they describe an author who, through his
struggle to transform popular narratives, enacted the modernist rupture
every time he set pen to paper. By bringing Conrad's mode of production
to the attention of his correspondents, the letters provided a way for his
readers to sanctify his efforts and assist in the creation of a market for
his services. The letters thus show that breaking with the literary world
of the Victorians in large part depended on the willingness of specialized
readers to give credit to suffering. More even than his literary style,
Conrad's gout provides us with special insight into the transformation
of cultural production that marks the onset of English modernism.

reference to a culture of experts has become commonplace in modernist

as one more contributor to modernist suffering. Rarely have modernists

Despite, or perhaps because, Conrad so roundly chastised him for
his unartistic writing, Clifford became a loyal supporter of Conrad's
work. He helped to dramatically change Conrad's publishing fortunes
by persuading the editor of the <I>New York Herald</I> to serialize
<I>Chance</I> in 1909. The novel turned out to be Conrad's first popular
success. Although Clifford appears to have granted Conrad the authority
to rule on all aesthetic matters, he reserved the right to critique
Conrad for inaccuracies in his ethnographic knowledge. In September 1898,
Clifford published an unsigned review on the topic in the <I>Singapore
Free Press</I>. He followed it up on his visit to Clifford's home in
1899. Conrad reports that Clifford told him "that as a matter of fact
I didn't know anything about the Malays" (<I>A Personal Record</I>,

Retrospectively, it seems a good thing for Conrad that Blackwood
turned him down, since, as part of the convoluted deal he presented to

Investment was not simply a metaphor. Karl documents the
development of a profitable trade in Conrad manuscripts and literary
ephemera that began with John Quinn's 1911 purchase of the manuscript
drafts of <I>Outcast of the Islands</I> and several other early pieces
(<I>Conrad</I>, 702). Lawrence Rainey shows that a logic of investment

Every culture has its founding myths, and a culture like our own, built
upon the worship of technics and science, is no exception to the rule.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 If many of its inaugural texts and artifacts proudly proclaim their
 resistance to the blandishments of mythology in the name of a brave
 new post-mythological world, others (perhaps with greater honesty and
 lucidity) identify this very stance as modernity's founding myth. For
 them, the dream of overcoming all prior mythologies constitutes a
 revolutionary myth. It promises access to a technicist Olympus through
 not only an overcoming of history, but also the advent of a heroic
 new humankind emancipated from the shackles of temporality. Such a
 text is the 1909 "Foundation and Manifesto of 
 
  
 
 Futurism": a document
 which, for all its bombast and bathos, rightly deserves the key place
 that it was long ago assigned in accounts of the birth of cultural
 modernism. The manifesto opens with a clash between objects that is
 also an intergenerational clash. It pits copper mosque lamps perforated with stars against their
own "electric hearts": light bulbs whose brilliance they constrain; light
bulbs ting to break out. The copper mosque lamps stand in for a larger
inventory of objects--plates, cabinets, oriental carpets--inherited by the
manifesto's author, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, from his father. Objects
that bear witness to the poet's upbringing in Alexandria, Egypt, but
that, in so doing, crystallize everything that the manifesto subsequently
identifies with the term pass&eacute;ism: ancestral indolence; the
celebration of dead or moribund things; world-weariness; a taste for the
precious, the arcane, and the exotic; repugnance for the present. This
past-centered, contemplative paternal world, responsible for the decor of
the poet's apartment on Milan's Via Senato, is about to be left behind
by the manifesto's second paragraph. The catalyst for its abandonment
is the flow of traffic. A passing trolley and a roaring automobile drive
Marinetti and his young friends out into the streets, where, bathing in
the stark, artificial glare of the new public sphere, they can proclaim
the overcoming of "mythology" thanks to the appearance of two new modes
of transportation: automobiles ("we are on the verge of experiencing
the birth of the Centaur") and airplanes ("soon we will see the first
Angels fly!").
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mythology is overcome inasmuch as, in Marinetti's view and in that of
his era, technology actualizes what was once only a poetic dream or a
theological fiction. It gives rise to "living" machines that are also
machines for living: machines that, because endowed with powers of agency,
intuition, and moral autonomy, are capable of serving as prosthetic
enhancements of human bodies and psyches. Two body/ machine complexes
are mentioned in the passages just cited: the driver/automobile complex
red by the Centaur and the pilot/airplane complex red by the
Angel. The first structures the central episode of the 1909 manifesto:
the automotive flight into the outskirts of the city culminating with
a crash cast as the actual scene of Futurism's birth.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 It is this drive and accident, and the transformative impact ascribed to
 it that constitute my springboard for the following reflections. Before
 the accident, Marinetti appears bound to a shadowy fin-de-si&egrave;cle
 world of mosque lamps and oriental carpets; after his rebirth in the
 "good factory muck [with its] impasto of metallic shavings, useless
 sweats, and celestial shards," he emerges as the new metallic man with
 a pulsing light-bulb heart: the prophet of a gospel addressed to all
 the living men on the earth whose points include "singing the love of
 danger," "exalting aggressive movement, feverish insomnia, the sprint,
 the mortal leap, the slap and the punch," the glorification of war
 as the "hygiene of the world," and the demolition of institutions of
 memory such as museums, libraries, and academies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The new humanity forged through this initiation rite is literally
 and ratively in the global driver's seat: "the ideal lance-like
 projection of the steering wheel that he grasps in his hands," states
 point five, "crosses the Earth, in the course of its own speeding orbit."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two questions stand at the core of the present inquiry: first, why the
choice of a speeding automobile as the vehicle for this metamorphosis
which I take as the emblem of the transformation of premodern into modern
man; and second, why the



emphasis upon traumatic birth (or why must a crash resolve the initial
clash)? The answers that I provide are necessarily speculative but place
Futurism's founding myth at the culminating point of an anthropology of
speed and thrill that evolved over the course of two prior centuries:
an "anthropology" inasmuch as it envisages accelerated motion not as a
neutral physical event that leaves the traveler and the context traveled
through unchanged. On the contrary, the transportation revolution of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries precipitated fundamental perceptual
and psychic changes in human subjects and in the fantasies that governed
their modes of interconnection with landscapes traversed and viewed:
changes that suggest a tight linkage between the history of transportation
technologies and that of optical devices, from phantasmagoria to moving
pictures, such that the story of moving vehicles is, from the start, the
story of moving cameras; changes that so blur the distinction between
the categories of realism and the hallucinatory or the fantastic that
they demand a rethinking of the commonplace notion that modernism marks
a revolt against naturalism.

The following essay represents little more than a test drive of a
book-length argument that, in its full unfolding, will include full
treatments of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's accident in the <I>R&ecirc;veries
du promeneur solitaire</I>; of John Mytton, sporting gentleman and
wanton seeker of accidents whether riding horses or driving gigs and
phaetons, and of the film magicians Georges Meli&egrave;s, R. W. Paul,
and Mack Sennett, codifiers of crashes as a generative comic device. Here
the itinerary has been reduced to a series of shortcuts running from
Delisle de Sales's 1771 <I>Lettre de Brutus sur les chars anciens et
modernes</I>; to Thomas De Quincey, whose hallucinatory experience of
landscape atop a mail-coach prered his later opium-induced imaginings;
to caricaturists such as George Cruikshank; to the Andy Warhol of the
early 1960s whose silk-screened <I>Car Crashes</I> coincide with his
first icons of Elizabeth Taylor; and to, finally, Vaughn, the hero of
J. G. Ballard's novel <I>Crash</I>  whose life of auto crashes
culminates in "his only true accident": the automotive masterpiece for
which he has been rehearsing his entire life--a crash landing atop the
same movie actress (whose failure qualifies it all the more as his only
<I>true</I> accident).
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Five complementary hypotheses inform this drive: first, that a
 fundamental bifurcation occurs by the beginning of the nineteenth century
 between <I>passenger</I>-centered and <I>driver</I>-centered modes of
 transportation or, to state the matter otherwise, between modes of mass
 transit and individual transportation, whether in the experiences and
 fantasies to which they give rise or in the sorts of discourses that are
 elaborated in order to regulate and represent them; second, that once
 technology devised a sufficient buffer between the surface traveled, the
 force of propulsion, and the individual traveler, it became possible
 to envisage speed as a kind of drug, an intensifier, an <I>excitant
 moderne</I>; third, that the human subject of speed--typically 
 <B></B> 
 the
 driver--whom I will refer to later as the <I>kinematic subject</I>,
 once reshaped by repeated experiences of this stimulant, finds himself
 caught in an addiction loop, threatened, on the one hand, by monotony,
 and, on the other, by the need for ever



new stimuli in order to maintain the same level of intensity; fourth,
that the crash becomes a necessary feature of this loop structure, at once
vouching for its legitimacy (by crystallizing the very intensity for which
it stands), serving as a regenerative device (by initiating a new cycle of
hyperstimulation), and marking an absolute limit (death); and fifth, that
every accident requires a viewer, or better, a <I>voyeur</I> to relay its
stimulus out into the world. The accident, in short, will emerge as the
locus of a form of trauma that, contrary to prevailing traumatocentric
accounts of modernity, engenders neither psychic blockage nor new
sure-fire forms of regimentation or alienation. Rather, in the works I
am here examining, trauma thrills. The thrills in question may be cheap
or expensive, private or public, humble or exalted, but, whatever their
nature, they represent, I will argue, a distinctively modern redaction
of the sublime. In the eighteenth century the sublime transported spirits
enclosed in motionless bodies; in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
it spirits away bodies that are themselves transported. In both cases
it plays a key role in engendering modern forms of individualism and in
secularizing the supernatural and relocating it in the everyday. If the
driver was a god or angel in pre-modern times, the gods or angels of the
modern era will be found holding the reins or sitting behind the wheel, so
identifying individuality with the possession of and mastery over wheels.

Accelerated motion emerged early on as one of modernity's heroic themes,
but it was hardly an invention of the modern era. Hence the recurring
emphasis in this essay on the prehistory of the modern anthropology
of speed and thrill. Such a rear view mirror gaze is absent from most
cultural histories of modern travel and transportation: histories that,
troping the claims made by their objects of study, reduce speed's history
to that of motorization and mechanization.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Omitted in the process is all but passing reference either to antiquity
 or to the coaching and horsemanship subcultures of the pre- or early
 motorized era. The latter sub-culture's rise to prominence during the
 second half of the eighteenth century took place in a context where
 there was acute sensitivity to questions of historical precedence. It
 unleashed a veritable <I>querelle des anciens et des modernes</I>,
 hinging upon comparisons between ancient and modern carriage designs,
 driving styles, racing practices, engineering techniques, and roadways;
 a <I>querelle</I> definitively resolved in favor of the moderns only
 in the early decades of the nineteenth century. Already a defining
 feature of the early history of industrialization, granted a place of
 honor in Diderot and D'Alembert's <I>Encyclopedia</I>, the coaching
 revolution is the rupture event in this essay's narrative. I argue that
 it, not the development of railways or motorcars, first set the terms
 for the entanglement of modern notions of subjecthood with experiences
 of accelerated motion. But the break in question is an incomplete one,
 haunted by the premodern and ancient past to such a degree that, to
 this day, totemic or mythological names like Aurora, Viper, Valkyrie,
 Jaguar, Fury, Electra, and Cobra 
 
 <B></B> 
 
 still vie with technicist acronyms
 like 635csi and 900ss for primacy as names of motor vehicles.



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In reestablishing the inaugural role performed by the pre-motorization
phase of the cultural history of speed, I also call attention to
ancient precedents that were regularly recalled in the course of
their modern overcoming. I infer that the enduring nature of these
processes of cultural-historical imitation and translation, points
not only to the struggle to confer legitimacy upon unfamiliar (and
therefore threatening and thrilling) new phenomena, but also to some
fundamental continuities of an anthropological sort. A few features of
rapid motion's association with pleasure, power, and joyous fear, that
is, appear to qualify as transhistorical and transcultural facts. Since
time immemorial children have felt the fascination of fast-moving
objects; spun themselves dizzy and silly; achieved rapture by means
of rocking, swinging, sliding, and running; simulated crashes and
smash-ups. Such childhood intoxications may be vascular, muscular,
perceptual or erotic in nature. Some appear to have greater purchase
upon the masculine psyche, though most are common features as well of
girlhood development. But, whatever their nature or gender contours, they
readily translate into a wide array of adult pleasures and pursuits,
from literal inebriation to athletic competition to military drills to
genital couplings to mystical transports. The convergence contributes to
an <I>erotico-transcendental</I> characterization of speed that seems to
be nearly universal. Velocity is attributed to sovereign and supernatural
agents (like monarchs, fairies, and angels, who can both move rapidly and
immediately transform their words into actions in the physical world),
to forces of nature (like thunderbolts and winds), and to the movements
of the heavens. When and if mortals partake of it, velocity's effect
is <I>rapturous</I> either in the calamitous sense illustrated by the
myth of Phaeton, son of the Sun god and the Western tradition's first
reckless teenage driver--or in the metamorphic sense illustrated by the
story of Erichthonius, the mythical inventor of the chariot as prosthetic
extension of self, deified as a constellation according to legend. And
the vehicle by means of which rapture is accomplished becomes at once the
image of a transred self, an object of desire in its own right, and
the crystallization of desire's logic of excess. Every car is a vehicle
of and for desire: an observation that applies every bit as much to the
erotically ornamented, owner-driven cabriolets of eighteenth-century
Paris as it does to J. G. Ballard's cars that crash to come.

This morning, a bit before noon, F. T. Marinetti was heading down Via
Domodossola in his car. The vehicle's owner was at the wheel accompanied
by a 23 year-old mechanic, Ettore Angelini. Although the details of the
incident remain sketchy, it appears that an evasive maneuver was required
by the sudden appearance of a bicyclist, and resulted in the vehicle being
flipped into a ditch. Marinetti and mechanic were immediately rescued by
two race car drivers from the Isotta and Fraschini factory, Trucco and
Giovanzani, each in his car. Marinetti was transported to his apartment
by the former and seems to have received little more than a scare. The
mechanic was taken by Giovanzani to the Institute on Via Paolo Sarpi,
where he was treated for minor wounds.

Even before its literary reworking, the scene has all the trappings of
a modern allegory of the sort that abound in the writings of Simmel
or Benjamin. The poet proceeds down the boulevard of the industrial
metropolis like a mechanically enhanced <I>fl&acirc;neur</I>, observing
everything and nothing. Distinguished amidst the flow of pedestrians
and vehicles by the costly coach which surrounds him as if it were his
modern coat of armor, he is literally and ratively in the driver's
seat. Swiftly and unexpectedly another modern subject, of lesser rank,
a cyclist, crosses his path. Shocked, he attempts an evasive action that
is fated to fail because the rapidity of the apparition exceeds the pace
of ratiocination. The result is a collision in which the poet's pose of
singularity and sovereignty is unmasked as a tawdry illusion. Man and
machine are ripped asunder; the thrill of speed gives way to terror and
paralysis; the cyclist pedals on indifferently; the urban crowd bears
witness to the unmasking; a newspaper places the event in circulation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Shock was not a distinctive phenomenon of the nineteenth century, tied to
the rise of motorized conveyances, contrary to what is usually assumed
by modern cultural 

<B></B>

historians. Closely affiliated with classical and
early modern psychologies of rapture and ecstasy, its codification as
a secular experience was already fully underway during the preceding
century (often within the framework of theorizations of the sublime).
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>



What motorization did bring, however, was greater scale and a greater
diffusion, and shock's consequent embrace as a major theme of the emerging
sciences of psychophysiology and psychology. From its earliest appearance
in studies of newly defined ailments such as "railway spine," where
it was envisaged as a physical tearing of bodily fibers, through its
reformulation in psychoanalysis as a violent rending of the psyche's
stimulus shield, shock was universally characterized as a pathogen. So,
the driver of our motorcar might be expected to present a range of
symptoms of disease: either immediately "impaired or perverted motion,
impaired or perverted sensation, impaired or perverted emotional,
intellectual, or moral intelligence"
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 or delayed manifestations of hysteria that will subside only with
 time. In the words of John Eric Erichsen, the pioneering author of a
 1882 study <I>On the Concussion of the Spine, Nervous Shock and Other
 Obscure Injuries of the Nervous System</I>: "It will be found that as
 the patient recovers from the immediate and primary depression of the
 shock, he, or more frequently she, becomes greatly agitated, nervous,
 or truly hysterical, often manifesting great excitement, and being
 soothed and pacified with difficulty."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 To this account Freud would add a rative understanding of
 the wounding process that differentiates more clearly (though
 problematically) between the shocking event and its traumatic long-term
 consequences. Because of the overwhelming nature of the stimulus
 involved, the crash ought to precipitate the sort of psychic blockage
 associated with the terrors of trench warfare: a neurotic fixation upon
 the event and a constant, even obsessive rehearsal of its details, that
 hinders all further psychic development.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Similarly, if the driver were Walter Benjamin's dandy or Georg Simmel's
 metropolitan man, his response might well be expected to consist in some
 sort of reaction-formation to the lingering sense of horror and its
 paralyzing effect: the adoption, for instance, of an intensified pose
 of aloofness and indifference to protect the psychic stimulus shield
 against future injury, combined with a propensity to pre-emptively
 shock others in order not to be shocked back.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the 1909 manifesto the pattern is otherwise. Marinetti returns to the
crash site only once and, while he borrows from the physical/psychological
profiles just retraced, he systematically inverts their meaning, recasting
trauma as ecstasy, accident as adventure, death drive as joy ride. Here,
as in Futurism's subsequent history, shocks, or, as they were often
referred to in the scientific literature, <I>thrills</I>--registered
epidermally and/or as psychic disturbances, are actively sought out:
sought out on the highways; in the trenches; in galleries, theaters, and
stadiums; in the streets. Irrespective of where they are found, shocks
re as engines of bliss: as orgasm, rapturous play, release from
the constraints of analytical reason, regression to states of infantile
narcissism or pre-Oedipal boundarylessness. Rather than paralyzing or
blocking, rather than needing to be parried by a defensively formed
subject, they sunder bonds to the past and, in their place, forge new
links: links between 

<B></B> 

men, machines, and their environment; links that
extend the individual's physical and mental reach. In the specific case
of Futurism's founding myth, the crash and the scare that it engenders
wed flesh to metal, thereby giving birth--or so the manifesto



claims--to a metallized and multiplied humanity, immune to the threats
posed by degeneration, fatigue, mortality, and an overburdened historical
consciousness. The event marks a fresh start to be followed by a
potentially infinite series of fresh starts. Like the crash-site photos
in Ballard's novel that shape every new conjunction of chrome, plastic,
fluid, and flesh into a "small museum of excitement and possibility,"
it stops the action only to unleash renewed surges of drives and desires.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 There can be no real gap thus between the ecstatic instant in which,
 feeling "his heart deliciously pierced by the [vehicle's] red-hot iron
 of joy," Marinetti is simultaneously metallized and ejected, and the
 continuation of the Centaur's voyage towards ever new thrills: "They
 thought my beautiful shark was dead," concludes the manifesto, before
 proclaiming its eleven-point platform, "but a mere caress was enough
 to revive it, and see it now resuscitated, speeding away anew on its
 powerful fins!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Shark and driver were merely playing dead; theirs was a <I>petite</I>
 <I>mort</I>. Quickly revived, welcomed into the eternally youthful
 fraternity of race car drivers with wheels, they rush off to crush new
 barriers and to crash new worlds. Accidents can happen along the road to
 Damascus or the Via Domodossola. And once they do, they tend to become
 turning points, taking on an air of irreversibility or necessity.

The above fable of death and rebirth might seem superfluous, given that
the manifesto is about to proclaim the racing car as the paragon of
modern beauty-in-motion, superior to the static beauty of the Victory of
Samothrace. But the history of transportation systems suggests, on the
contrary, that it describes one of modern individualism's key rites of
passage. From the mid-eighteenth century onward there had developed
two interconnected though separate cultures of transportation:
one that is best designated as <I>thrill-based</I>; the other as
<I>commodity-based</I>. The first is, characteristically, the province
of drivers (and of passengers who are "driver-identified"). Akin to
"cruising," it envisages the purpose of the journey as the journey
itself, independent of the practical imperatives of getting from here to
there. It views the space to be traversed as <I>space to be consumed</I>
(whether as outer spectacle or inner <I>dur&eacute;e</I>) by a human
subject who is conceived of as the author and administrator of his or
her speed. The second, the near exclusive concern of passenger-centered
studies like Wolfgang Schivelbusch's justly celebrated <I>The Railway
Journey</I>, envisages the journey instead in instrumental terms: as
movement within a network of departure and destination points between
which extends only vacant, useless <I>space-space to be collapsed</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Though both models require the sort of accelerated motion made available
 by technologies that detach traveler from vehicle and vehicle from
 context, the first strives to convert this detachment into <I>new modes
 of reattachment</I>, while the second 
 
 <B></B> 
 
 does the opposite: it reinforces
 the process of detachment by isolating and enclosing human passengers
 as if they were packages.



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The dichotomy is perhaps too sharply drawn, given that the thrills to
which I allude may correctly be viewed as a subjective correlative
of commodification and commodification as thrill's objective
correlative. Any reduction of the one to the other, however, runs
the risk of underestimating the disruptive potential of thrill and
neglecting the genetic role it performs vis &agrave; vis modern forms of
individualism. So let the distinction stand as a heuristic device. During
the tens of centuries that human beings rode horses, velocity remained
a cultural theme of mostly secondary significance. Either cosmic (as
in the whirling of the celestial spheres) or comic (as an inversion
of the <I>gravitas</I> expected of authority res), it was either
otherworldly--the attribute of angels, demons or gods--or, if thisworldly,
identified with the lower social orders: with messengers, couriers,
entertainers, and thieves. Which isn't to imply that accelerated motion
was unappreciated in pre-modern times. The contrary, of course, is
true. Armies were praised and feared for the speed of their war chariots;
athletes admired for their fleet-footedness; and professional charioteers
vied for glory in Roman hippodromes much like contemporary race car
drivers. Topics of this sort abound in ancient art and literature, from
Pindar's fleet-footed warrior-athletes to Virgil's Erichthonius who
"first dared to couple four steeds to the car, and to stand victorious
over the flying wheels."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 No more indicative example of this corpus could be found than the myth
 of Phaeton. Taunted about his uncertain origins, the son of the sun god
 seeks reassurance from Helios himself, who promises to grant his son's
 every wish. As proof of his divine ascendancy, Phaeton requests what
 has now become the absolute proof of passage into adulthood throughout
 the industrialized world: the keys to dad's car--in this case, the
 reins to the solar chariot. Phaeton's inability to maintain control
 of the vehicle's powerful horses, allegorized over many centuries as
 the passions, leads to a thrill ride and cosmic calamity among whose
 latter-day counterparts one may count the automotive deaths of teen-idols
 like James Dean.

Early modern carts, carriages, and coaches did little to alter the
situation described above inasmuch as through the beginning of the
eighteenth century, their nature was either practical--the transportation
of cargo or passengers over modest distances--or processional--the
display of aristocratic power and prestige. It was, of course, not
impossible to employ them for purposes of accelerated travel and coaches'
upsurge in popularity first within and then outside courtly circles
by the turn of the seventeenth century induced panic in the likes of
the waterman-poet John Taylor whose pamphlet <I>The World Runnes on

 (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_2.html"> 2</A>). But whatever the merits of these infernal conveyances with
 respect to Taylor's beloved ferry boats, coaches provided a far slower
 and more awkward means of locomotion than riding on horseback. The
 same goes for the diligences employed by Royal Messageries throughout
 Baroque and Enlightenment Europe. As late as 1790 these elephantine
 ancestors of modern buses and trains were designed to carry several dozen
 passengers riding high above the road in capacious cabins, suspended
 upon leather straps attached to axle-mounted metal perches or whip
 springs. Unreliable, vulnerable to highway robbers, dangerous despite
 their slowness, weighing up to five tons, sites of unexpected amorous
 and not-so-amorous encounters, they were famous for tipping over as
 well as for rocking their passengers into collective states of nausea.

So speed meant horses. But the mere experience of riding on horseback was
not enough to establish a modern culture of velocity. Speed's rise as a
cultural thematic, its move into an everyday realm of perceptibility, its
adoption as sacrament of modern individualism, became possible only with
the development of mechanical buffers between rider, horse, and roadway:
buffers that enable new fantasies of attachment, first, between rider
and engine, and, then, according to a more complex logic, 

<B></B> 

between rider,
engine, vehicle, and/or landscape. The event is charted in passages like



the following (dating from 1837), which first become frequent around

The man who rides a horse, feels a pleasure when the creature responds
willingly to his purposes; and when he responds unwillingly, he feels a
pride in the exercise of his power to compel him to obedience. Even when
a horse is vicious, there is a pleasurable excitement in riding him. The
rider's nerves are strung, his senses are quickened; eye, hand, and ear
are alike on the alert; the blood rushes through the veins, and every
faculty is aroused.

Horses served as humankind's first kinetic prosthesis. From time
immemorial, warriors and knights had been identified with their
mounts. But the horse belonged to another order of being. It was a
detachable, external marker of the hero's power: an object to be won
and worn like armor, a diadem or a sword. By the end of the eighteenth
century, the terms of the fantasy have altered. Man and animal now belong
to precisely the same order of being. The <I>homme de cheval</I> and the
<I>cheval d'homme</I> have both become expressions of a single life force
that has organized all creatures as living machines (. <A HREF="6.1schnapp_3.html">3</A>, <A HREF="6.1schnapp_4.html">4</A>). In the
words of Jean-Claude Izouard Delisle de Sales, 

<B></B> 

the eighteenth century's
most passionate critic of the new culture of speed: "At first



glance, the horse seems everything but a dangerous beast: the bands
that encircle his body, the irons attached to him, the bit that has
been devised so as to render his movements more exact, and the spurs
with which he is prodded to move more rapidly: all this bespeaks of a
highly organized automaton who moves only according to the will of the
intelligent being that governs him."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 But a second glance confirms and contradicts the first. Just as woman and
 man are doubles and polar opposites, so it is with horse and rider. Their
 interaction breeds not only a battle for mastery, but also arousal,
 electricity, erotic friction: forces that are readily transferable
 to other sorts of machinery. Who is the true force of propulsion in
 the inset passage cited above, horse or rider? The answer is clearly
 "both." An early ancestor of the Futurist Centaur and contemporary
 sport motorcyclist, this neurologically tense, aroused human subject, in
 conflict with but confused with a neurologically tense, aroused mount
 whose nature he shares is the product of a revolution that began in
 the mid-eighteenth century with the development and popularization
 of lightweight two-wheel cabriolets and four-wheel phaetons, the
 predecessors of modern sports cars.

furnish a new mode of recreation and self-creation. Be they horseless
or horse-pulled, their purpose remains the same: not so much purposive
perambulation, as <I>kinetic self-display</I>. Wheels re as the locus
of a new subjectivity and a new social identity. They mirror the driver's
standing: his literal "hobby horse." But, in so doing, they reshape
society along the lines suggested by Mercier and Delisle de Sales. New
class distinctions arise: between drivers and pedestrians; between
owner-drivers and driver-chauffeurs; between seekers of thrills and
seekers of passage; between owners of coup&eacute;s, phaetons, enclosed
carriages, carts, and hackney cabs. Other distinctions blur as lords,
clothiers, clerks, and dancers merge into the undifferentiated form of
mass spectacle and collective rush known as <I>traffic</I>. The traffic
jam was, from the beginning, the liturgical ritual of modern times by
means of which a new kinematic humanity, a humanity with wheels, becomes
one in its multiplicity.

The spread of this "epidemic" of mobile self-display, thanks to which
individuality became identified with administration of one's own speed,
terrified rural populations and transformed cities like Paris and London
into nightmarish killing fields in the eyes of many observers. Mercier
states that "he has earned the right to criticize the barbaric luxury
that are today's coaches, having been knocked to the pavement on three
different occasions and nearly run over alive."

 His views are echoed a half century later in an official report by the
 central offices of the canton of Paris ("[most men and women driving

 fatal accidents") and in graphic works such as George Cruikshank's <I>The
 Comforts of a Cabriolet or the Advantages of Driving Hoodwinked</I>, in

 Such behaviors are seen as being in keeping with the infernal character

Whether or not the effects of this revolution were as nightmarish as

 res for England over the subsequent seventy-five year period continue
 this trend, with 18,000 carriages registered in 1775 and 106,000 in 1840.

 With this multiplication came efforts to widen and straighten out
 streets, regulate traffic, differentiate sidewalks from roadways,
 standardize wheel sizes, devise forms of insurance coverage, and
 legislate liability in the case of accidents. Efforts that had the
 effect also of encouraging a further acceleration of motion. But from
 the standpoint of speed, the key threshold was crossed only at the
 turn of the nineteenth century with the development of two isolating
 technologies: first, Eliot's 1805 invention of the elliptical spring,
 which permitted carriages to be hung low on springs and lightened by
 eliminating the need for perches; and second, MacAdam's scientific
 approach to roadbuilding, according to which "a road ought to be
 considered" less as a building requiring a massive stone foundation,
 than "as a [lightweight] artificial flooring forming a strong, smooth,
 solid surface, at once capable of carrying great weight, and over which
 carriages may pass without meeting any impediment."

The history of "the elastic substances interposed between the wheels and
the passengers or load, in order to intercept the concussion caused by
the wheels revolving on an uneven surface" is little studied, relegated
to periodicals read only by those nostalgic for coaching days and
coaching ways.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 But its impact upon both driver/passenger perceptions was second
 only to that of modern paving technologies. As already indicated,
 the earliest modern carriages relied upon rigid perches anchored to
 the four corners of a vehicle's lower chassis in order to protect the
 seating area against the jarring effect of roadway ruts. The coach's
 body was hung from these perches on longitudinal leather straps that
 were supplemented with "check" straps so as to limit lateral rocking as
 well as forward or backward loading. The result was a swaying movement
 punctuated by violent jolts. "Is there a man left alive," asks a later
 proponent of steel suspension systems, "who has ridden on the footboard
 of an aristocratic town coach or chariot without springs, and [not]
 had the calves of his legs shaken down over his ankles, or the lower
 part of the muscles thickened till the legs resembled bed-posts?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 This sort of pummeling was bad enough, but along with bruises came the
 <I>terra firma</I> equivalent of seasickness. In the words of Walter
 Scott: "the motion is as a ship rocking or beating against a heavy sea,
 straining all her timbers as she drives over the contending waves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Only during the final decades of the eighteenth century did improvements
in steel fabrication techniques make possible a new generation of
suspension-system designs which included laminated cantilever springs
(with a rigid mount at one end and a live mount at the other) and single
or double sweep semi-elliptic "grasshopper springs." The revolution
entered its mature phase in 1805 when Eliot obtained a patent for joining
two semi-elliptics together in a single elliptical spring. Eliot's
invention inspired a wide range of modified elliptic systems like the
four-spring platform adopted on mail coaches, all of which absorbed
jolts and enhanced traction to a hitherto unimaginable degree. Just like
the truck and bus suspensions that are their descendants, these systems
reduced kinematic drag and increased maneuverability and stability, while
providing a smoothed out ride. Detaching driver and passenger from the
brute physicality of the roadway, they pursued the elusive dream of a
buffered reattachment. Their ideal was and still is the achievement of
<I>road feel</I>.

Better known and better studied is the history of road building.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Ancient Roman accomplishments were legendary in this domain. So to
 a greater degree than in the case of carriage designs, there arose a
 technological <I>querelle des anciens et des modernes</I> whose outcome
 soon proved favorable to the moderns. Roman practice was characterized
 by massive constructions made up of as many as five strata, resulting
 in a costly, but robust sort of self-supporting lateral wall that held
 up well under the slow traffic for which it was designed. The growth
 of cities and expanded trade patterns fueled a revival of enthusiasm
 for Roman roadways during the seventeenth century, but their image of
 "incomparable grandeur and power" began to wane as new, scientific
 approaches promised more economical solutions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Solutions that would eventually overturn the logic of prior road building
 for they no longer envisaged

<B></B>

roadways as self-supporting artificial constructions akin to buildings
or walls, but rather as smooth and impermeable membranes directly
connected to and thinly applied over a natural support with the aim of
shielding this natural foundation against water seepage and the effects
of accelerated traffic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The perceptual impact of the shift cannot be overstated. From the
fortress-like emblems of human resistance to an always encroaching and
hostile natural landscape that roadways once seemed, they evolved instead
into imaginary prolongations of the natural/national landscapes to which
they granted access. For all their artifice and technical refinement,
in other words, roadways now attained an increasing "intimacy" with
their natural support and surroundings in the collective imaginary:
so much so that <I>road feel</I> became intertwined with contemporary
conceptions of a <I>feeling for landscape</I>. And this intertwined road
feel and feeling for landscape, in turn, became interwoven with traveler's
national feelings. It gave rise, that is, to a new nationalist mythology
that envisaged roadway networks--be they English turnpikes, German
<I>Autobahnen</I>, Italian <I>autostrade</I>, or American freeways--as
the arterial system of the nation's body and driving along them as a
form of communion. By the turn of the century, the eighteenth-century
literature of the sublime and the picturesque thus becomes ever more
literally a road literature, with the romance of the road itself
increasingly framing the experience of landscape.

The principal father of the modern roadway was John Loudon
McAdam. Celebrated as the "Colossus of Roads" or as "McAdam the Magician"
by cartoonists and journalists alike, McAdam had no engineering background
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_8.html"> 8</A>). But from 1804, when he became general surveyor for the
 Bristol Corporation, through the years of his reports to parliament
 (1810-1823) to the time of his death , he became Europe's
 leading advocate of a simple but radical notion: that roadways required
 no foundation at all.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Rather, a properly drained, prepared, and protected

<B></B>

subsoil could support just about any load. The challenge, as McAdam saw
it, was to insure drainage and stress-reduction by devising a strong
and stiff roadway surface capable of acting as a coherent mass. This he
accomplished by placing a first layer of broken stone atop a slightly
cambered natural formation which was raised above the water table. A thin
top coating of extremely fine angular broken stone was laid down over
this base, so that the grinding action of passing wheels might rapidly
compress it into the so-called "road metal" or water-bound cement that
soon became known as <I>macadam</I>. So it was that the levels of carriage
comfort, control, and speed provided by new suspension systems found
their ideal complement in a paving technology whose basic principles
have remained unaltered to the present day. (The sole decisive change
between the era of McAdam the Magician and Norman Bel Geddes's <I>magic
motorways</I> being the use of bituminous tar instead of water as a
binding agent, so as to remedy the dust problems created by fast-moving
rubber tires.) "Macadamisation in modern times," wrote William Bridges
Adams in his 1837 <I>English Pleasure Carriages</I>, "has contrived to
make streets and roads as level as bowling greens . . . "
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 A contemporary added: "Even at the present wonder-working period, few
 greater improvements have been made in any of the useful arts, than
 in those applied to the system of traveling by land. Projectors and
 projects have multiplied with our years; and the fairy-petted princes
 of the Arabian Nights' Entertainments were scarcely transported from
 place to place with more facility or despatch, than Englishmen are at
 the present moment. From Liverpool to Manchester, thirty-six miles, in
 an hour and a half!--surely Dedalus is come amongst us again. . . . "
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Indeed, it was rolling smoothly out along the vast new network of alleys
 that the human subject of speed, the kinematic subject, would establish
 his empire. Thanks to Eliot and McAdam, the gods could come alive once
 again as contemporary Englishmen.

The absorption and removal of physical impediments, the enhancement
of traction, the creation of roadway and railway networks as regular
bodies sectioning irregular natural landscapes, all established not only
the preconditions for accelerated travel, but also for the simultaneous
emergence of a thrill-based culture of velocity and its commodity-based
complement. By 1820, the two had come together in a single contrivance:
the high-speed mail-coach or stage coach whose legacy was gradually taken
over by trains during the ensuing decades. By 1900, with the invention
of automobiles, they will have split off, with cars (motorcycles and
airplanes) becoming engines of thrill and trains (buses and tramways)
the conveyors of commodities. But let the mail-coach serve as an emblem
of these two cultures in their inaugural moment inasmuch as it offers
two concurrent yet distinct experiences of velocity: one <I>from the

<I>from the inside</I>, where, like the passenger of the old diligences

Mail-coaches were frightfully fast by nineteenth-century standards,
having reduced the crossing of the European continent from a matter
of months to a matter of days and, in the process, become high-speed
conduits for the diffusion of news.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 John Palmer, the deviser of Britain's famously efficient national
 system, referred to his as "mail machines" and took it upon himself to
 standardize their design, to impose regular and rapid switches in horse
 trains, and to monitor their adherence to highly demanding schedules
 by equipping each vehicle with tamper-proof clocks
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_9.html"> 9</A>). One result was the professionalization of the once lowly
 coachman. Long regarded as an unreliable, lazy, and unkempt tippler,
 he was now transred into the much admired and emulated practitioner
 of a new high-speed <I>art</I>: driving "four in hand."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 The maximum speeds sustained by Palmer's <I>artists</I> may seem
 unexceptional today, but it is worth underscoring the point that
 "the ten-mile-an-hour flyer of the 1830s carried people who had seen
 incredible accelerations in their lifetimes--a trebling and quadrupling

<B></B>

of average speeds--and had never got over it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 One such person was William Hazlitt, who declared that "some persons
 think that the sublimest object in nature is a ship launched on the bosom
 of the ocean; but give me, for my private satisfaction, the mail-coaches
 that pour down Picadilly of an evening, tear up the pavement and devour
 the way before them to Land's End."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
  Low-slung and built atop so-called "patent boxes," English mail-coaches
  were so lightweight that they could accommodate only seven paying
  passengers--four "insiders" and up to three "outsiders"--which is
  to say that their superior speed and reliability translated into
  elevated ticket prices. This said, traditional class distinctions were
  maintained. As had been the case with diligences, seats on the inside
  were costly and reserved for what one observer called "a porcelain
  variety of the human race," while external seats were inexpensive,
  dangerous, and reserved for mere "delf-ware."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 All of which goes to show that Victor Hugo's allegorization of diligences
 may be extended to mail coaches:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

Like Society [l'&Eacute;tat], a diligence has three compartments. The
aristocracy occupies the coup&eacute;; the bourgeoisie occupies the
interior; the popular classes occupy the rotunda in the back. But outside
on the imp&eacute;riale, atop everyone else, ride dreamers, artists,
and men belonging to no social class (les gens d&eacute;class&eacute;s).

The driver's perch, "bench" or "box" had long been referred to in French
as the <I>banquette b&acirc;ch&eacute;e de l'imp&eacute;riale</I>. Its
transformation into a site of privilege of a socially transgressive,
even revolutionary sort may be directly traced back to its use
by eighteenth-century travelers as a platform for experiencing the
picturesque and the sublime. So it is hardly surprising that, under a
regime of accelerated motion, the <I>imp&eacute;riale</I> became the
outdoor laboratory within which these aesthetic categories were reworked
in the service of new kinematic forms of subjectivity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Well before the advent of trains and automobiles, mail-coach passengers,
especially occupants of the <I>imp&eacute;riale</I>, identified the
experience of speed with dream-like states: flight, intoxication, rapture,
horror, hallucination. "It's a horrible thing to spend a night on a
mail-coach," reports Victor Hugo in his travel journal <I>Le Rhin</I>,
"one isn't in a vehicle, so much as a tornado. The mail-coach seems to
have gone into a frenzy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 For others like Sainte-Beuve, drunken-driving or drunken-riding are
 the mail-coach norm: "first, there is the drunkenness of feeling
 oneself indolently moved and projected by a rapid impulse towards an
 encounter with destiny; then, there's the naive pride of being gazed
 at and envied, across entire villages, in front of homes, by those who
 have been left behind."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 The link between rapid motion, individuation, and an expanded sense of
 selfhood matching expanded horizons is picked up by the young Balzac:
 " . . . if only you knew how strongly I aspire to seize hold of nature
 by means of a long high-speed race across Europe, how strongly my soul
 thirsts for that which is vast, infinite, for nature seized as a whole
 and not in its details, nature judged according to its grand framings,
 be they wet with rain or rich with sun, in the course of traversing
 spaces and seeing countries rather than villages."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
  Precisely the

<B></B>

same language carries over into reports of early or first-time railway
travel. For Thomas Carlyle, the train grants access to the fantastic:
"The whirl through the confused darkness, on those steam wings, was
one of the strangest things that I have ever experienced--hissing and
dashing on, one knew not whither . . . Out of one vehicle into another,
snorting and roaring we flew: the likest thing to a Faust's flight on
the Devil's mantle."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 The actress Fanny Kemble, likewise, imagines the train as a tame dragon
 who flies "panting along his iron pathway": "You cannot conceive what
 that sensation of cutting the air was . . . When I closed my eyes
 this sensation of flying was quite delightful, and strange beyond
 description."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Jeanne, the heroine of Maupassant's <I>Une Vie</I>, seeing "the
 countryside, trees, farms, villages speed by," recognizes in that
 hallucinatory flight, the catalyst of an inner transformation: "
 . . . terrified by the speed, rapt by a new life, [she is] transported
 into a world that is no longer hers, no longer that of her tranquil
 youth and monotonous existence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Whether riding on mail-coaches, hobby horses or trains, or even
when engaging in the contemporary fad of fast-paced hiking known as
"pedestrianism," these and other contemporary witnesses were in agreement
that speed was more than just the mark of modern times. Speed was the
distinctive drug of modernity, a stimulant and intensifier akin to those
analyzed by Balzac in his <I>Trait&eacute; des Excitants modernes</I>
: tea, sugar, eau de vie, tobacco, and, especially, coffee (with
whose accelerative effect on thought-processes and addictive properties
Balzac was well acquainted).
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
  Unlike the somber diligence and train passengers portrayed by artists
  such as Honor&eacute; Daumier and Adolph Menzel, these voyagers--all
  of whom, whether outside or not, ultimately imagine themselves as
  <I>outside voyagers</I>--report feeling neither cut off from one another
  nor from the landscape. On the contrary, they assert their closeness
  to the engine that drives them, the vehicle in which they travel,
  and the landscape which they traverse: a closeness that they dream
  of literalizing by taking the reins and sitting in the driver's seat
  like the amateur coachmen of the early nineteenth century enamored of
  driving "four in hand" just like the <I>artists</I> whom they venerated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Precious testimony to this effect comes from Thomas De Quincey's <I>The
 English Mail-Coach</I>; an essay in which the author of <I>Confessions

 and the subject takes possession of the entire visual field, is triggered
 by an optical effect that recurs in nearly every early description
 of accelerated motion and underlies the design of thrill rides in
 nineteenth-century amusement parks as well as their cinematic shows:
 namely, <I>a reversal of perspective such that it now appears as if it
 is the landscape that is in motion and not the traveler; or, rather,
 that the landscape is in motion for the traveler</I>. The effect is a
 familiar one in reports of mail-coach travel. One author describes the
 astonishment of a time-traveler from the early eighteenth century who
 awakens one hundred years later only to find that there is no longer
 such as thing as a stagecoach stop: "[before he can utter the word
 "breakfast"] the waiter, the inn, and indeed [the town of] Hounslow
 itself (<I>terraeque urbesque recedunt</I>), disappeared in the
 twinkling of an eye. Never did such a succession of doors, windows,

a new kind of viewer: a seer who has sprouted wheels, <I>a kinematic

half-sleep and half-wakefulness intoxicates the mountains; only his eye

The vital experience of the glad animal sensibilities made doubts
impossible on the question of our speed; we heard our speed, we saw it,
we felt it as a thrilling; and this speed was not the product of blind
insensate agencies, that had no sympathy to give, but was incarnated
in the fiery eyeballs of the noblest amongst brutes, in his dilated
nostril, spasmodic muscles, and thunder-beating hoofs. The sensibility
of the horse, uttering itself in the maniac light of his eye, might be
the last vibration of such a movement; the glory of Salamanca might be
the first. But the intervening links that connected them, that spread
the earthquake of battle into the eyeballs of the horse, were the heart
of man and its electrical thrillings--kindling in the rapture of the
fiery strife, and then propagating its own tumults by contagious shouts
and gestures to the heart of his servant the horse.

From Longinus through Kant, the sublime was the aesthetic category of

 Later, in the <I>Critique of Aesthetic Judgment</I> he added that
 its representation in nature sets the mind in motion and that "this

<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 Whether in Burke or in Kant, the abyss is laid open by rapid trigger
 mechanisms: convulsive motions, perceptions of danger or pain, violent
 shocks. But the stimulus must remain at a safe remove: "when danger
 or pain press too nearly" writes Burke, "they are incapable of giving
 any delight, and are simply terrible; but at certain distances, and
 with certain modifications, they may be, and they are delightful, as

 Already in the eighteenth century, there was uncertainty about where
 to draw the line between safety and peril, aesthetic play and physical
 terror, distance and proximity, planning and surprise. The line begins
 to vanish altogether once the viewer's platform is placed in rapid
 motion, as on De Quincey's mail-coach. The result is a sublimity that
 no longer leads beyond the passions to an awareness of human superiority
 over nature, as the later Kant would require. Rather, the new sublime of
 speed finds its fulfillment in spectacular accidents--fires, revolutions,
 hallucinatory landscapes, crashes, news events, panics--unruly events
 that, no matter how remote, remain so menacingly close that they can
 be measured on a scale of intensity but not delight. Aesthetic play has
 been recast as dangerous play and the prevalence of adjective over noun
 or noun over adjective declared unresolvable in the course of charting
 modernity's "punitive expedition into [humankind's] own nervous system."

Reified or not, the human masses conveyed by the locomotive are encouraged

engineer: "There's nothing frightening about speed when the traveler
who benefits from it remains unaware of his velocity. With well-built

The promise/threat of accident, of course, does not vanish as a
result. But whereas its overt presence structures the entire logic of a
thrill-based culture of transportation, here it is repressed. Reliability
and regularity become the norms of accelerated motion and any interruption
of them assumes the form of a cataclysmic return. "Cataclysmic" on the
psychic front, because of the overwhelming and unexpected nature of the
stimulus; "cataclysmic" on the social front, because of the event's scale
and spectacle value. The technical literature that developed around these
catastrophes mixes paeans to safety with a sensationalist rhetoric of
accident. It marks its distance from the culture of thrill by engineering
systems of crash avoidance, charting traffic flows, and trumpeting an
end to all accidents. It marks its proximity by trafficking in the most
lurid details of "the dark martyrology . . . of famous catastrophes that

The borderline separating pathogenic wound from regenerative thrill
also proves permeable in studies of the malady known as "railway spine"

only of degree in the traumas provoked by falls, work accidents, and
crashes, the analytical framework that they adopt is the now familiar
vibratory one: "Perhaps the one circumstance which more than any other
gives a peculiar character to a railway accident is the thrill or jar,
the <I>ebranlement</I> that is transmitted through everything subjected
to it. It is this vibratory shock (which by some is compared to an

train crashes and boiler explosions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></SUP>
 Yet a less intentionality-driven reading attends far better to the
 specificity of the caricaturist's art: a rapid mass medium conjoining
 the real and the fantastic, trafficking in laughs, surprises, and
 up-to-the-minute commentary, framed by the latest news--a medium always
 already implicated, like its cinematic successor, in a rhetoric of
 collision. It is hardly gore or horror, for instance, that prevail in
 Hugh Hughes's <I>The Pleasures of the Rail-Road</I>  (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_0.html"> 10</A>),
 Robert Seymour's <I>Going it by Steam </I> (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_1.html"> 11</A>), or in any
 number of anonymous cartoons published in <I>Punch</I> (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_2.html"> 12</A>), but
 rather an outburst of technical flourish, glee, and inventiveness. All
 are works--and many more by the likes of Daumier, Cham, and Cruikshank
 could be cited--in which crash victims seem to have become every bit
 as much circus acrobats or vaudeville entertainers as sufferers from
 physical or psychic injuries. Leaving behind the confines of their
 conveyance, their bodies fracture and multiply, sail through the
 air, merge into fields of wood, copper, iron, smoke, and steam as if,
 having entered a new realm of bliss, they find themselves free from the
 constraints of biology, space or time; unperturbed by history, memory,
 and class identity; released from the iron-clad laws of industrial
 development. The explosion itself res as the uncorking of a bottle
 of champagne, an aerial choreography, or the sudden transformation of
 a once-static boiler into a sprinting and unhinged metallic man. All
 of which hints that beneath the thin veil of tragedy and trauma, there
 lurks a vision of the crash as a distinctively modern form of spectacle
 and subject formation. A form of spectacle and subject formation of the
 sort more fully codified in early trick films such as Cecil Hepworth's
 <I>How it Feels to be Run Over</I> , whose illusory collision
 between auto and audience links seeing cars to seeing stars; and
 <I>Explosion of a Motorcar</I>  which culminates in a shower of
 arms, legs, heads, and auto parts. In these instances, as throughout the
 early cinema, fleshly and metallic bodies are subject to dismemberments,
 shocks, and explosions whose effects are gleefully displayed and quickly
 overcome. They crash on screen and crash the screen as if to impress
 the viability of a volatile new mode of being upon the audience.

Pleasure trains found a non-utilitarian counterpart in the switchback
railways that hurtled human cargoes down mountainsides like those
of Pennsylvania's Mount Pisgah starting in 1872, which is to say in
the first experiments with what soon thereafter came to be known as
"roller coasters."

 Initially referred to as "scenic railways," the latter's history
 can be traced back to seventeenth-century Russian ice-slides and
 eighteenth-century <I>Folies du Jour</I> found in places like
 Paris's Parc Monceau. It enters its mature phase in the last third
 of the nineteenth century, when designers like Thompson transformed
 the rides into high-speed kinematic machines combining tunnels and
 curves with rapid shifts between outside environments (usually sublime
 mountainscapes) and inside environments in the form of scrolling panels,
 panoramas, and tableaux depicting grottoes, ancient Egyptian landscapes,
 Biblical episodes, and disaster scenes with moving parts
<SUP><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></SUP>

 A steam tractor/ organ complex, first at the carousel's periphery, then

 a half century (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_4.html"> 14</A>). It stood still while driving the rotation of a
 platform alternately supporting horses, trains, cars or bicycles whose
 smooth or undulatory motion was exaggerated by a counter-rotating hub
 bearing representations of landscapes and beveled mirrors. Sometimes
 encased within buildings studded with gas or electric lights, these
 life-sized kaleidoscopes left their traces in the design of a wide
 array of later vertigo rides going by names like "The Mystic Screw,"
 "The Scenic Spiral Wheel," and "The Cyclone Bowl." Stripping away all
 the optical and theatrical trickery, these limited their workings to
 what may be viewed as the core operation of all amusement park rides,
 however different they may appear: the transformation of passengers into
 modern whirling dervishes who, once passed through a sort of spatialized
 centrifuge, could be expected to wander about as if drugged, trembling
 with fear and giddy with excitement.

Not surprisingly, the threat/promise of accident plays a determining role
within the fold of turn-of-the-century magic kingdoms. Its presence was
highlighted at the boundary line between the world of play and the world
of work: on the painted flats, for instance, employed by Luna Parks to
draw in audiences with promises of "An Automobile Dash for Death Down
a Mountain at One Thousand Miles an Hour" or "A Journey from This World
to the Next" in the form of "The Great Train

<B></B>

Wreck" (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_5.html"> 15</A>). Within the park walls, it was regularly evoked on the
outer panels that crowned the first carousels, as well as on the facades
of Bioscopes and Electric Theaters inviting spectators to experience
illusory collisions between representation and reality such as those
staged in Hepworth's and Edison's films.

 cyclones, spirals, and screws (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_6.html"> 16</A>). And every crossing of the

is the nature of the stimulus being sought? (See . <A HREF="6.1schnapp_7.html">17</A>, <A HREF="6.1schnapp_8.html">18</A>). Does it
simply provide an opiate-like escape from workaday tedium? Is it simply

 thrill. Which means that accident must follow accident. De Quincey moves

The return of the specter of repetition brings my argument full circle,
for you will recall that it was the locomotive's dulling regularity
that accounted for De Quincey's dismissal of steam power as a "culinary
process," rejected in favor of the mail-coach's electrical/animal
surge. By the end of the century, the terms have altered but the

<B></B>

stakes remain the same. The contrast is no longer between the circuits
formed by insensate machines and sensate beings, but instead between
two distinct but interlocking regimes of repetition, both of which
couple bodies with machines and both of which presuppose accelerated
motion as their norm. One, grounded in Enlightenment ideals, thinks of
men and machines as <I>machines &agrave; reprise</I> [as duplication
machines] and, like Goldberg's mild-mannered passengers decrying roadway
irregularities on their way to an amusement park, it identifies modernity
with the return of sameness: standardization, reliability, predictability,
the leveling of differences. The other, anti-Enlightenment in spirit,
thinks of men and machines as <I>machines &agrave; surpris</I>e [as
surprise machines] and, like Goldberg's thrill riders always eager for
another "go around," identifies modernity instead with non-recursive modes
of repetition: with novelty, danger, unpredictability, the multiplication
of differences. A number of key features from the opening scene of the
founding manifesto of Futurism fall more clearly into place within this
setting. Its talk of death "pulling up alongside me at every curve"; its
insistence that the motorcar is an individualized "panting beast with a
torrid heart" whose steering wheel hangs over the driver "like the blade
of a guillotine"; its hallucinogenic characterization of speed; and,
most of all, its portrayal of the crash as the moment of the movement's
birth: all of these features, like the accident in which they culminate,
cannot be dismissed as atavistic carryovers from the pre-industrial
era (. <A HREF="6.1schnapp_0.html">20</A>, <A HREF="6.1schnapp_1.html">21</A>). Rather, they aim to exorcise a specific threat:
namely, that the triumph of modern technics will extend the rule of
Enlightenment reason over all aspects of everyday life at the expense of
the individual--<I>both the human and the mechanical individual</I>. This
is why Futurism's counter-proposal, its "religion-morality of speed," is
built around unstable techno-primitive hybrids like the modern Centaur:
a detachable creature, neither railbound nor lawbound, composed of enemy
twins--a human subject, called upon to metallize himself and to impose
his distinctive vital impulses or <I>scatti</I> upon the always menacing
machine, and an automotive/equine double, endowed with powers of agency
and moral autonomy, within whose metallic chest thunders a <I>motore a
scatto</I> no less explosive and unpredictable than the driver's racing
heart. A direct heir to the cabriolets of the eighteenth century and
real-world counterpart to amusement park thrill rides, the automobile
is thus invoked as Futurism's birth vehicle not on the basis of its
functionality, but because its design was unstandardized, its performance
unreliable, and its movements governed by whim alone. Much faster than
the earliest generation of airplanes, the equal of all but the fastest
trains, it was a literal horseless carriage: a custom-built frame yoked

thrillings were every bit as palpable and unruly as the animal engine
driving De Quincey's mail coach.

Speed is the medium that ensures that the conjunction between human
and mechanical individuals will engender not relaxation and tedium,
but bigger living: quickened senses, aroused faculties, expanded powers
of vision; acts of heroism, improvisation, and innovation; spectacular
crashes and catastrophes; eruptions of

<B></B>

laughter and glee. For this effect to be achieved, however, velocity must
avoid becoming routinized. Only a constant increase in the stimulus it
provides can avert the danger that danger itself will be driven out of
the perceptual field. There is no escaping the resulting addiction loop
or its aporias. Constant stimulus increases end up engendering resistance
and/or the very tedium they were meant to ward off. This leaves the crash
alone as a way out of the loop. But just as speed can become routine, so
too the crash can become normalized. Even Vaughn, Ballard's prophet of
a coming Autogeddon, is forced to admit that "one car crash looks just
like another."
<SUP><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></SUP>
 The threat can held at bay by varying every crash's details, like Mack
 Sennett's <I>Lizzies </I>

<I>of the Field</I>  with its protean pile ups or Meli&egrave;s's
<I>The Impossible Voyage</I>  whose seriatim accidents couple cars
to pedestrians to trains to zeppelins to spaceships to buildings within
the framework of a joyous rampage wherein everything is destroyed yet
no one is hurt. But fated eventually to become just another "normal
accident," the crash's stimulatory effect must necessarily attenuate
unless it leads, in turn, to a "true" and definitive accident: one that
brings the cycle to a close through the driver's death. The only way
to save the normal accident, that is, is to transform every accident
into a dress rehearsal for a death collision, a premiere that is also
a final performance.

 central problematic of thrill and repetition in a more comprehensive and
 original manner. In the "Death in America" series, the ideal of doing
 <I>like a machine</I> translates into a non-recursive but repetitive
 system that sets off lurid images of intertwined cars and drivers
 against flat fields of orange, yellow, green, red, and white in such
 a way that they echo one another both internally and externally, but
 never without visual irregularities or accidents. The individual frames,
 exploring as they do a kind of no-man's land between photojournalistic
 sensationalism and the icy look of police crash-site photos, traffic
 freely in voyeuristic thrills. But the latter reach the viewer by
 means of a detour. The appeal of the subject matter is distanced
 by enhancing the silk-screened photo's black and white graininess,
 only to be reintroduced in the form of colored planes whose jarring
 ornamentalism creates a sense that the thrills have been flattened out
 and rendered cool.

Pop art's romance with the car crash came about within a postwar context
in which the speeding motorcar had been naturalized much like the speeding
train at the time of Futurism's birth. This naturalization was effected
by similar means: through an array of technologies designed to isolate
driver and passenger from the roadway, and the roadway, in turn, from
the world, including softened suspensions; passenger compartments
transformed into sealed cocoons equipped with autonomous sound and
climate systems; rationalized superhighway networks. Cornerstone of
the utopic, peril-free suburban universe regularly evoked in Warhol's
photographs, the automobile retains a sublime and dangerous flip side
that affiliates it with De Quincey's mail coach and Marinetti's killer
shark. Still a prosthetic enhancement for modern "dreamers,

<B></B>

artists, and men belonging to no social class" and an accelerator of
auto-erotic tremors, the car is for Warhol a mechanical individual
akin to the theme park ride. Itself a star, it is also a star-vehicle
and star-maker. But never more so than when it collides with or for an
audience. In each and every accident car and riders are cast, in Ballard's
words, as "the principal actors at the climax of some grim drama in an
unrehearsed theater of technology, involving crushed machines, the dead
men destroyed in their collision, and hundreds of drivers waiting beside
the stage with their headlamps blazing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></SUP>
 Is it any surprise, then, that Warhol could also produce celebratory
 icons of everything from carriages to cars?
<SUP><a NAME="REF102" HREF="#FOOT102">102</a></SUP>
 Hardly (. <A HREF="6.1schnapp_2.html">22</A>, <A HREF="6.1schnapp_3.html">23</A>). But

<B></B>

even when implementing the Futurist slogan that "a racing car . . . is
more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace" one senses that the
unrehearsed theater of technology is now being viewed, as it were,
from the far side of the culture of thrill. The primary location of
the artist's ego and eye has shifted from the fiery thrillings of the
<I>imp&egrave;riale</I> to the icy fire of a more distant site, a site
occupied by an omnipresent mechanical voyeur. The machine in question
and the machine that Warhol most wishes to become is not the car, but
rather the camera. The latter's automatism, its speed of image capture,
the potentially unlimited reproducibility and manipulability of its
output, render the camera the orchestrator of sequences of real and/or
imaginary pile ups so vast and repetitious that they could easily fill
any and every "museum of excitement and possibility." Which is to say
that, for Warhol, the camera as engine of thrill leads inexorably to
the camera as engine of monotony. Machines, he avers, are about "liking
things" and liking things means being machine-like "because you do the
same thing every time. You do it over and over again."
<SUP><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></SUP>
 So the story of <I>Crash</I> ends neither with a bang nor with a whimper,
 but with an outcome that the founding manifesto of futurism could never
 have envisaged, not to mention embraced: the emergence of tedium itself
 as the greatest thrill of all.

Thanks to a nearly acritical embrace of Benjamin's writings, American
cultural studies have all too readily conferred upon Baudelaire's
epoch an inaugural role vis &agrave; vis modernity that could just as
easily be extended back to the prior century. For all his greatness,
Baudelaire was, after all, often little more than a recycler of
commonplaces, and his hallucinatory Paris is none other than that of
Louis S&eacute;bastian Mercier's <I>Tableau de Paris</I>  made up
of "tableaux &eacute;loquents qui <I>frappent</I> l'oeil dans tous les
coins des carrefours, et quelle galerie d'images, pleine de contrastes
<I>frappants</I> pour qui sait voir et entendre!" ("eloquent tableaux
that <I>strike</I> the eye at the corners of every crossroads, and what
a gallery of images, replete with <I>striking</I> contrasts for he who
knows how to look and listen!"). Cited from <I>Tableau de Paris</I>,
ed. Michel Delon, <I>Paris le jour, Paris la nuit</I> (Paris: Robert
Laffont, 1990), 31, italics mine. The catalogue of pre-nineteenth
century representations of shock is a large one, but would include
the violent collision described in Rousseau's second promenade ("Je ne
sentis ni le coup ni la chute, ni rien de ce qui s'ensuivit jusqu'au
moment o&ugrave; je revins &agrave; moi" ["I felt neither blow nor fall
nor anything that occurred after until I came to"]) responsible for
his rebirth ("Je naissais dans cet instant &agrave; la vie . . . " ["I
was born to life in that instant . . . "), on which subject see <I>Les
R&ecirc;veries du promeneur solitaire</I> (Paris: Garnier-Flammarion,

<I>Lettre de Brutus, sur les chars anciens et modernes</I> (London, 1771)
(hereafter abbreviated <I>LBCAM</I>), as, for instance, in his claim
that cabriolets are dangerous to drivers and pedestrians alike because
"at the very same instant a citizen hears the noise and recieves the
blow that mutilates him: a mother loses her child before becoming aware

I take seriously the notion that conversion stories like Saul's
transformation into Paul (recounted in Acts 9, 22, and 26) on the road
to Damascus or Augustine's turn towards the holy book in bk. 8, ch. 12 of
his <I>Confessions</I> may be viewed as "accidents" typologically linked
to modern vehicular-accident myths. In both cases, the irruption of the
divine is a traumatizing/thrilling event that, by definition, effects a
violent and unexpected rending of ordinary human consciousness. Paul is
blinded and falls to the ground; Augustine's countenance is immediately
altered as he hears the supernatural summons to "take up and read,"
which, once obeyed by means of the random opening of the Bible, yields
a sudden and instantaneous feeling of inner luminescence. What from the
human perspective appears an aleatory event, is revealed in retrospect
as the realization of a divine plan or "turning point" which, from
the moment of the "accident" onward promises regular doses of the
supernatural (i.e. rapturous thrills). The typological link between
these two categories of "accidents" seems to me confirmed by the constant
recurrence of martyrdom themes in the modern literature of accident from
the coaching era to the present, particularly with reference to celebrity
"martyrs of speed" like James Dean and Ayrton Senna.

of Time and Space in the Nineteenth Century</I> (Berg: Leamington Spa,
1986). The book first appeared as <I>Geschichte der Eisenbahnreise</I>,
(Munich: Carl Hanser Verlag, 1977). While I am much endebted to
Schivelbusch's study, mine departs from his in two key respects: a)
I argue that most of the effects that Schivelbusch ascribes to the
development of railway systems were already fully manifest under the
regime of carriage transportation: the rationalization of roadways, the
standardization and quantification of time and space, the acceleration
of life, etc. In my view, trains mostly democratized and intensified the
impact of these already codified developments. b) Schivelbusch's principal
concern is with what I have referred to as the "commodification" side
of the divide, while I am concerned instead with the formation of new
models of individuality in relation to transportation technologies. He
therefore emphasizes a mass conveyance, the train; while I emphasize
smaller-scale conveyances such as coaches, cabriolets, and automobiles. It
goes without saying, however, that trains could (and often did) serve
as engines of thrill, just as carriages or automobiles could (and often
did) provide experiences of trauma and alienation akin to those endured
by many train travelers.

coach's immorality on the "inside" correspond later concerns about its
external immorality, like those expressed by Rousseau's Saint Preux:

oneself, a practice increasingly enjoyed by affluent women as well as men
during the second half of the eighteenth century, compounded the scandal,
for it blurred the boundary between the sexes as well as that between the
leisure and the working classes. Female drivers were frequently accused
of having transformed themselves into "public women" (i.e. whores).

v&eacute;locif&egrave;re and c&eacute;l&eacute;rif&egrave;re referred
originally to a new category of relatively fast stage-coaches, but were
then transferred to the draisienne. The label <I>Laufmaschine</I>,

Driving "four in hand" involved holding the reins to all four horses
directly from the driver's box (without recourse to a postilion riding
one of the lead horses), a dangerous and exacting task that made coachmen
the envy of many aristocrats: "The men who drove the crack mails were
famous, and revered as a pop singer is today. The young bloods copied
their favorites as much as they could by learning the jargon of the
road and wearing appropriate clothes, the many-caped greatcoat and the
low-crowned hat. One young gentleman had his teeth filed so that he
could whistle through them in the approved fashion; many braved the
worst weather conditions in order to be in the honored place by the
driver." Jean Holdsworth, <I>Mango. The Life and Times of Squire John

now that he is fully exposed to the elements. Finally, he ends up on
the Quicksilver mail coach which a waiter had promised him was not "very
fast," but rather "it just keeps time, and that's all" . Under the
new regime of accelerated motion, however, "just keeping time" requires
the most harrowing speeds of all.

"There is nothing historical about this book except the state of mind,"
Stein tells us in the epilogue to her novel, <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>,
a book about life in wartime France, written during the years
1940-1943.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Stein's bellicose, quintessentially modernist
declaration is worth our attention, as is the curious allegorical fiction
to which it is appended, since her last novel and its epilogue place us
precisely at a tangled interchange where concerns about identity, history,
ethics, and politics converge in our century. Her assertion captures the
simultaneous contraction and expansion of the modern subject: so tiny
that its domain can be no bigger, of no more moment than a "state of
mind"; so gigantic that it can push a world's war into the shadows as it
commands an entire book about its "state." If we are conceiving the mind
in its condition of maximum extension, we do not interpret the pivotal,
ambiguous "except" as dismissive. Since nothing else is, who could imagine
a book more thoroughly or appropriately saturated by history, or history
more aptly situated in its properly subjective location? States on a map
matter less than a mind's moods, its modes of being. But if, in looking
from a different angle, we observe the mind in its contracted state,
all that remains on the pages of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> are faint echoes
of events occurring elsewhere--events that might matter but that cannot
be told--"aethereal rumours."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I aim in this essay to trace the outlines of this variable place Stein
names a "state of mind" and to ascertain whether we might measure its
position in time, in history. Stein and her texts present us with
peculiar and important difficulties when we attempt to make these
measurements, and the reasons for

<B></B>

those difficulties derive
from her understanding of the self's relation to time. Like any number
of modernists, she concerns herself centrally with the faculty of memory
and the discipline of reading the world historically. She is obsessed by
temporality. But today, when socio-historical contextualization of a work
of art has come to seem an essential component of any discussion of that
work, when "the time of and the time in the composition" is of enormous,
even unprecedented consequence, Stein proves doggedly resistant to our
customary gambits for such temporal framing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 She forces
us to scrutinize the assumptions underwriting our historiographic
practices. On the one hand, those practices are profoundly skeptical
ones, as evidenced by the proliferation of studies that treat memory
as the unavoidable, notoriously distorted and distorting lens through
which we recall the past. On the other hand, our unsettling attention
to memory is counterbalanced by a fascination with historical material,
with actual things retrieved, with photographs and documents bearing
witness to another time, with endless, telling details brought to
light, with archives that promise wholesale recovery of the past. The
general effect of this bifurcated historiographical practice often
seems to be a confidence that, by both acknowledging the role of the
recollecting subject in our accounts of the past and embracing the
voluminous inventories that we have recovered from prior eras, we are
closer than ever before to unprecedentedly accurate, psychologically
nuanced positioning of texts, authors, and events in time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein will not allow that confidence to persist unshaken, or the goal
of recovery to stand unquestioned. I focus this essay on two of her
texts--<I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> and "Phenomena of Nature"--both of which
explore disjunctions among writing, interiority, events, and recalling and
recounting the passing of time. <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> poses questions about
how we account for character and how we live in time, how we construe
history. "Phenomena of Nature," together with the manuscript witnesses
associated with that essay, provides us with a venue for considering the
relations between time's passing and the act of writing itself. How are
we to remember Stein's work? How should we recall it for readers at this
century's end? How does she teach us to remember her? What obstacles
does she deliberately place in the paths of our remembrances, and why
does she desire that our attempts at recollection should prove difficult?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Over the past two decades, Stein's work, has been, taken from an
earlier location in literary-historical narratives that sketched
quiet salons where she and her charmed circle of artist friends
experimented with form and style, and repositioned in new locations
that give her much more prominence and prestige in today's academy:
the consequential thoroughfares of modern politics, Western history,
social reform, and sexual liberation. We must now attend closely to
"the racial-ethnic-religious-national politics of both [Stein's] work
and her life," Marianne DeKoven exhorts us, celebrating current critical
practices that have enabled us "to see Stein's experimental writing as
at once located in time, life, history, materiality," and lauding recent
critics who have vastly expanded "the limits of the possibilities for
representing that locatedness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 And yet, though Stein's
former situation in the salon was cramped and

<B></B>

her work devalued,
she does not make her relocation entirely happily. Throughout her life
she fervently embraced the local, but she resisted with equal fervor
being "located" in most of the senses intended by DeKoven. While she
dismantles and reinvents much of her Western linguistic inheritance
and can therefore be construed, in aesthetic terms at least, as a
revolutionary, no modernist more uncompromisingly asserts independence
from and indifference to each of the politicized venues in which she
currently finds herself. Stein energetically and ingeniously displaces
both politics and history from a great deal of her work. As an ironic
consequence, she stands at odds with her current audience at precisely the
time when that audience is larger and more enthusiastic than it has been
at any time since the mid-1930s. Perhaps we need to attend more fully
to Stein's resistance to the kind of sociohistorical positioning that
has become almost automatic in today's academy, and to consider how it
might teach us to perform the task of assigning her a position in "place,
time, life, history, materiality." I do so not by way of objecting to the
intent that motivates the historical-materialist turn in English studies,
but to argue that if we are to make this turn responsibly, honoring the
shapes of the texts we are framing, we must make every effort to assess
the meanings that our categories of understanding--"history," "politics,"
even "time" itself--might have held for the subjects of our scrutiny.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Wanda Van Dusen's "Portrait of a National Fetish: Gertrude Stein's
'Introduction to the Speeches of Mar&eacute;chal P&eacute;tain'
," provides an extended, recent instance of this impulse toward
materialist positioning. Immediately, in the parenthesis included in the
essay's title--""--Van Dusen promises to place us in a precise
historical location: the moment, 19 January 1942, when Stein sent to
Bennett Cerf, editor at Random House, her laudatory preface to the
translated speeches of Philippe Henri P&eacute;tain, leader of France's
pro-German Vichy government (1940-1944). Though students of Stein
have known about the existence of this preface since Richard Bridgman
provided a cogent description of it in <I>Gertrude Stein in Pieces</I>
, Van Dusen gives us, in addition to her own ambitious and extensive
analysis, the full text of Stein's preface itself, now published for the
first time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 For Van Dusen, Stein's preface "rekindles the
debate over the depth of conviction behind Stein's 'anti-patriarchal'
experimental writing between 1906 and 1932 in light of evidence of her
political conservatism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Van Dusen builds her appraisal of
Stein's politics around a number of simplistic assertions: between 1906
and 1932 Stein campaigned against "the patriarchy," but she stopped
campaigning as her work grew more accessible; aesthetic experiment
is "anti-patriarchal"; political beliefs and aesthetic practices
correspond. Van Dusen is dismayed by Stein's preface not simply because it
praises P&eacute;tain but because Stein fails to declare her own identity
with sufficient openness, nor does she discuss "the gender, class, sexual,
and racial composition of the 'new France,' and she thereby allows "the
invisible face of a diverse population [to be] obscured by the unifying
state mask of the Mar&eacute;chal."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Stein is deceptive
in her deliberate "evacuating [of her] gender, her lesbianism, and
Jewishness--those cultural processes abjected by public discourse. Without
these markers, the unified self

<B></B>

presented by Stein can be safely
subsumed in the dominant category of 'we' in France."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 And
when Stein approaches political discussion from her hiding place behind
the dishonest pronoun "we," Van Dusen finds the shape of that discussion
deplorable and familiar: "Stein's text reinscribes the mythical thinking
of the Vichy political ideology, an archaism characteristic of fascism
and Nazism and symptomatic of culture's anxiety in the face of socially
disruptive modernization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But it is the very familiarity of Stein's failings to Van Dusen--and
the utter familiarity of the terms in which Van Dusen finds fault with
Stein--that betray Van Dusen's by no means uncommon abridgment of time's
passing. Inquiry into a different time and place and another's body of
writing must register that difference and that distance if it is to be
even remotely true to the nature of the faculty--memory--that allows
us to experience time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 That registering must occur not
only in historical research, but also in the details of diction, and
in the development and application of categories of understanding. The
political ruler Van Dusen applies to Stein is calibrated for 1996:
"politics" is a practice that begins and ends with a forthright
assertion of one's identity and involves a careful measuring of one's
socioeconomic, racial, and sexual positions vis-&agrave;-vis the
dominant sociopolitical order. The Stein Van Dusen dreams of finding
when she looks in the direction of 1942 is someone she knows too well
and too easily: an aesthetically radical Jewish lesbian who builds her
equally radical political practice upon open declarations of her various
identities--someone whose thinking about individuals and culture contains
at its center the categories by which we are accustomed to measuring
diversity: gender, class, race, sexual orientation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 When
Stein turns in her portrait of P&eacute;tain to myth and prophecy, she
falls by ready association into an archaism identical with the archaism
characteristic of fascist ideology. When she invokes the "old prediction
that when the enemy had gotten to Lyons the country that is France would
be saved by an old man on a white horse and P&eacute;tain had always
ridden a white horse," she mystifies political power in precisely the way
that Hitler and Mussolini and Stalin did.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Here is a Stein
whose identity should promise us a certain kind of laudable left-wing
politics and whose failures to achieve that position we are consequently
to recognize and lament. Van Dusen's tendency to assimilate prior time to
our own is reflected not only in the general categories of understanding
around which she builds her essay, but also in her prose, which is by no
means unusually filled with jargon, but which is nevertheless redolent
of the late 1990s--a rhetorical failure of memory that makes it difficult
to glimpse a subject located in another time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the most basic but nevertheless crucial level, Van Dusen, energetically
describing Stein's Introduction as "performing a redemptive fetishistic
ritual that denies the existence of racism in the so-called free zone
administered by P&eacute;tain," fails to pay sufficient attention to
what <I>can</I> be known of French history.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 She is more
interested in the theoretical construct of "the fetish" than in what
it might have been like to live in occupied France in the first two
years of the war. Even before we turn to P&eacute;tain and Stein, we
should understand that being a Jew in occupied France,

<B></B>

rather
than encouraging a public declaration of solidarity with marginalized
populations or recriminations against France's puppet government, would
have been more likely to encourage Stein in her longstanding preference
for avoiding risky, public, political stands.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 And Philippe
Burrin's ambitious, extensive history of <I>France Under the Germans:
Collaboration and Compromise</I> (New York: New Press, 1993) makes it
clear that Stein's admiration for P&eacute;tain, even as late as the
winter of 1941, was more ordinary, more widespread, more emotionally
comprehensible than Van Dusen's piece would have us believe. In the
early 1940s, particularly after the British had preemptively shelled
the French fleet at Mers el Kebir in Algeria in the summer of 1940,
resistance, to the majority of the French, looked suicidal and promised
little but further destruction.

At this juncture , the French were grateful to [P&eacute;tain] for
having brought the ting to an end, for lending the defeated country
his prestige and for offering them words of compassion. P&eacute;tain

the four cardinal points for them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even after most of France had turned fully against the Vichy government,
in the autumn of 1942 (Stein mailed her preface to Cerf, we should
recall, in January of 1942), "P&eacute;tain's aura was . . . not totally
dissipated. As a public re, he continued to be respected to the
bitter end by part of the population, which felt compassion for him
and regarded him as a symbol of their suffering country."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

Stein concludes her introduction with applause for P&eacute;tain that
is culpably myopic but not anomalous, not simply a modernist invention
or part of a disingenuous posturing to save her from deportation:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And so we in France having seen France governed . . . having seen every
time that all being lost actually everything was being held together,
I must say little by little the most critical and the most violent of
us have come gradually to do what the Mar&eacute;chal asks all French
people to do, to have faith in him and in the fact that France will
live.

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These words reveal less about modernism or about the fetish than they do
about a widespread set of attitudes in France in 1941. Stein assimilates
and repeats ideas current at the time--ideas that fit comfortably with
the conservative social politics that she had long been embracing prior
to the war. Chief among the ironies arising from Van Dusen's essay
is the fact that Stein's politics--and even this word, "politics," is
importantly misleading, as we shall see--are, if anything, more openly,
idiosyncratically, and radically disturbing than anything Van Dusen
describes, and they are disturbing in ways profoundly different from
the all-too-familiar ones that Van Dusen articulates.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not only has Van Dusen forgotten important aspects of French history; she
discusses Stein's politics without listening sufficiently to what Stein
has to say on the subject, thereby losing a vitally important perspective
in her eagerness to fit Stein

<B></B>

into a contemporary constellation
of ideas about fascism and modernism. Unlike the revelation of de Man's
wartime writings, the publication of this "Preface" to P&eacute;tain's
speeches will not surprise readers even cursorily familiar with Stein's
opinions during the 1930s and 1940s. To the extent that Stein cared to
express political convictions, by the mid-1930s she had clearly sided
with French conservatives against those communists and constitutionalists
who favored more risky, socially disruptive reforms. Bridgman quotes
a letter, written in 1936, in which Stein notes that many of her
French friends belong to the "Croix de feu"--a nationalistic and
anti-parliamentary organization originally founded by veterans of the
First World War.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Among her associates before and during
the war are the British painter Francis Rose--an admirer of the Nazis
and particular friend of Ernst Roehm, leader of Hitler's storm troopers
(S. A.)--and Bernard F&auml;y, wartime director of the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale and associate of P&eacute;tain.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 There is every
reason to believe that the influence of both men, particularly that
of F&auml;y, helped preserve Stein's and Toklas's property and their
physical safety throughout the war.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Further, though her allegiances could and often did place her among
those whose commitments were narrowly and explicitly right-wing, Stein
was by temperament and conviction "conservative" in the word's broadest
sense: she was opposed to change. More particularly, she opposed the
outer-directedness, the expenditure of energy that sociopolitical
labor demands. In her more accessible writing of the 1930s and 1940s,
she repeatedly proclaims that artistic and cultural innovation is best
nurtured by a stable, essentially unchanging social matrix. She explains
her living in France largely by the ease with which her outsider's
status allows her to remain disconnected from French history and
politics. "France was friendly and it let you alone, and so there it was
and there you were," she muses in "An American and France," insisting
that the country and the individual happily occupy quite distinct
locations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 The First World War and the increasingly heated
political debates of the late twenties and the thirties unfortunately
brought these two "there"s closer together, "and so painting has become
Spanish," but the chief glory of French government in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries was its willingness to stay scarcely
visible, like an imperturbable old retainer, in the background of its
citizens' private lives: "It is not what France gave you but what it
did not take away from you that was important."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 "They said
in their revolution Egalit&eacute; Fraternit&eacute; Libert&eacute;,"
Stein recalls in <I>Paris France</I>, as the Germans roll across French
countryside and through French towns, "but these qualities should be left
to war and politics, they are not human."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 She notes ruefully
that "every century has had that dream every revolutionary has that dream,
to destroy the family," but she and her adopted countrymen know better:
"although adolescence and intellectualism demand that he believes in a
world not based upon a family unit, in his heart every Frenchman knows
that that is all there is to it, a family and himself a father of a
family."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 There are potentially powerful ironies operating in
this defense of the family (though the more one reads Stein's public and
private writings, including her letters, the less these words reverberate
with irony), but its conservative bent is consistently reinforced in
Stein's writing. It is

<B></B>

worth registering, after we have taken note
of Stein's right-wing alliances and her allegiance to conservative modes
of thought, that her "politics" are also fundamentally antipathetic to
fascist ideology. She rejects without qualification the collective, the
State as an entity worthy of attention. When a country makes claims of
any sort on its citizens, and when those citizens respond by devoting
themselves to politics in any of its antic guises, whatever springs from
within, from the detached place where creation occurs, will suffer:

Stein's late work, her "politics," and her sense of history can only
be understood if we approach those subjects by way of her extensive
and complex considerations of the faculty of memory and the practice
of forgetting. I take "memory" to designate the symbolic acts by which
we constitute ourselves and position ourselves in time--a definition
proposed by Michael Lambek, an anthropologist and theorist of memory who
usefully reminds us that memory as a practice is in large part socially
mediated and, therefore, a fundamentally moral act. "Rather than treat
memory as a discrete thing, stored and retrieved," Lambek argues,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
or as the biologically innate process of storage and retrieval waiting
to be discovered by the experiments of the psychologist, . . . we
[should] understand it as a culturally mediated expression of the
temporal dimension of experience, in particular of social commitments and
identifications. Remembering comprises contextually situated assertions
of continuity on the part of subjects and claims about the significance
of past experience. Such tacit assertions and claims, based as much on
cumulative wisdom and moral vision as on individual interest, form a
kind of moral practice.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Insofar as the "new" Stein has frequently been discussed in terms that
evoke ethics: insofar as we are searching for a "political" or a socially
engaged Stein, her extensive musings about memory take a new weight,
matter more than they did when she was merely a baffling experimental
writer, a gnomic philosopher. At stake in their interpretation is not
only our assessment of Stein's engagements with P&eacute;tain, but
also our understanding of how we are to discuss politics and modernism
without simply slotting individual modernists into an already familiar
historical narrative.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Approaching a study of the past through theories of memory, instead of
convincing us that the past is more intimately and easily available,
more present, emphasizes distances and removals. The complex,
stitched-together tapestries that we make of remembered time are filled
more with holes than cloth. We compose narratives of time past, but
"the smoother the story, the more evident that it is the product of
secondary

<B></B>

reworking." These narratives themselves bear witness to
forgetting, to time not merely past but lost: "It is precisely because
I <I>cannot</I> remember in direct, unmediated fashion the experience
of my childhood," Lambek writes,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
that is, can no longer experience as a child, and because cannot remember
directly the events that lead from the infant to the man, that I rely
upon a narrative construction to realize this continuity. Individual
memory, like the narration of the collective we call history, is never
literal reproduction, but an artifice to render the continuity in change
realistic.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein, one of our century's most skeptical and thorough students
of memory, repeatedly poses a laconic question in her later work
that suggests the abyss separating past from present, the failure of
recollection to establish continuity: "What is the use of being a little
boy if you are going to grow up to be a man?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 We habitually
fill the present with stories of our childhoods, but those stories
themselves, paradoxically in direct proportion to their completeness
and coherence, testify to how far gone is the child as subject rather
than narrative object.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's conundrum about the radical disjunction between the little boy
and the man encapsulates for her a set of questions about the unavoidable
experiential chasm separating what she variously names "entity" from
"identity"; "the human mind" from "human nature"; "being" from "becoming"
or from "history." The man's past lies at an ontological remove from
his present: "the boy and the man have nothing to do with each other,"
Stein declares in "What Are Master-Pieces?" "except in relation to memory
and identity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 "Identity" is another name for the way we
represent ourselves to ourselves and others (and the ways they choose to
represent us as well). The word comprises the changing sum of portraits
in the gallery named "Gertrude Stein," and when we talk about "human
nature" we use the faculty of memory to generalize from the collection of
rations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 The conscious self necessarily inhabits nothing
more than a brief span of present time. That self remains fundamentally
isolated from other consciousness and is only capable of recalling what
it refers to as "the past" by means of the always-in-progress stories
it tells itself. We inhabit the narrowest of rooms, though we often
hypothesize mansions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In an interview with Robert Haas and William Sutton in 1946, Stein
recalls that in the 1930s, particularly following the publication of
<I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</I>, she "became more and more
interested in the subject of narration."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 "Subject" here
can designate both the topic of how one tells a story as well as the
"self" composed by narrative means. And yet Stein's convictions that
"if it is inside then there is not there is no time and there is no
identity" (<I>GH</I>,182), and that "genius . . . is the existing
without any internal recognition of time"
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 commits her to
a kind of writing that forecloses the possibilities both of "subject"
and "narration" as we usually mean these words. She aspires to solve
"the problem of time in telling a story of anybody" by writing without
recourse to that internal timekeeper, the faculty of memory, and by
dissolving the subject so that we read without trying to plot that
subject's

<B></B>

evolution or its end, without trying to string events
together like fish on a line.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 And she would do this using
a medium that unfolds naturally, inevitably in time. Writing for the
newspapers epitomizes work performed under the temporal constraints
that she resists. Journalists "have to consider not the time in which to
write but the time in which the newspaper is coming out. Three senses of
time to struggle with, the time the event took place, the time they are
writing, and the time it has to come out. Their sense of time cannot be
but false."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Stein works in her fundamentally non-referential vein, leaving
clocks and calendars behind proves relatively easy. "So many words to
use," she muses in <I>The Geographical History of America</I>, and then
rebels against the instrumentality of the verb: "Oh do not say that
words have a use" (<I>GH</I>, 190). But when she turns her attention to
matters of historical record or to contemporary events--to politics and
history, to character sketches of public res--she finds her escape
more complicated. In <I>Everybody's Autobiography</I>, she describes
<I>The Geographical History of America</I>  as a meditation on
the relations between matters of identity and the world's business: "And
so I began to be more and more absorbed in the question of the feeling
of past and present and future inside in one and naturally that led me
later on the subject of history and newspapers to meditate more . . . on
the subject of history and newspapers and politics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 From
the mid-1930s to the end of her life, Stein writes about the atemporal
"now" of the human mind and the myriad time-inflected snares in which
that mind usually remains caught. The most intimate and fundamental of
these snares we call "identity"; the largest and most grand is named
"history." 1946, the year of her death, finds her still considering:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the essence of narration is this problem of time . . . [Y]ou have to
denude yourself of time so that writing time does not exist. If time
exists, your writing is ephemeral. You can have a historical time,
but for you the time does not exist, and if you are writing about the
present, the time element must cease to exist . . . [In <I>Wars I Have
Seen</I>,] I described something momentous happening under my eyes and
I was able to do it without a great sense of time. There should not be a
sense of time, but an existence suspended in time. That is really where
I am at the present moment. I am still largely meditating about this
sense of time.

"The human mind never does anything," but the world stays busy, and it
is around these different but necessarily related axes of stillness and
motion that <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, Stein's last novel, revolves (<I>CH</I>,
133). By the time Stein composes this novel, she has developed fully her
distinction between human mind and human nature; she has presented her
case against memory and has described and practiced writing that does not
rely on memory. She has been centrally occupied for almost a decade with
"the problem of narration." Now, beginning in 1940 and continuing for the
next two years, as France falls to the Germans, as the geopolitical map of
the world changes from week to week, Stein writes a text that considers
how life might be conducted by Steinian subjects: in part irrevocably
and fundamentally disjunct

<B></B>

from any past or future, balanced on the
narrow, shifting sill of the present moment, but also unavoidably tangled
in each day's unfolding events and utterly obsessed by time past and to
come. The novel concerns itself with "the state of mind" of subjects who
seem unable to assemble themselves internally and who consequently cannot
find convincing rationales for judgments or actions in a world that makes
endless demands for both. Stein does tie herself loosely but decidedly
to time when, in her epilogue to <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, she describes her
effort to present us with "the way anybody could feel these years"--"these
years" being 1940-1943. But we should keep in mind her wry dictum
concerning the misapprehensions necessarily attending the interpretive
activity named "history": "Now history has really no relation to the human
mind at all, because history is the state of confusion between anybody
doing anything and anything happening" (<I>GH</I>, 133).

If one believes that our convictions of agency are the merest fantasies
of power and that the stories we tell about time's passing are founded
on those fantasies, how can one even begin to postulate an ethics? The
world makes us take sides, if only because we chance to be born in one
place and time rather than another, but what can it mean, how can it
matter that we choose to resist or to collaborate, that we side with
P&eacute;tain or Churchill and the Crown, Mussolini or Stalin or Hitler?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Those five great names never find a place on the pages of
<I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>. The novel--the term is convenient, though
inadequate, insofar as it implies plotted narrative--is a muddy and
incomplete allegory, with a hodgepodge of characters milling around
two men: Angel Harper and Joseph Lane. These two public res, Stein
herself tells us, stand for Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

They are "in the century," part of the century's public story, in a way
that Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds are not.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds,
anxious observers of history in progress, are lodged deep within daily
circumstances and cannot be seen from any distance. Stein manages her
novel's characters and its plot using the deliberately creaky apparatus
of prophecy and allegory. Wobbling around the unfocused consciousness of
Mrs. Reynolds, the chapters progress according to Angel Harper's rise
to power as a dictator, his advancing age, and his certain death. This
rise and fall have been foretold in prophesies by the Saints Odile
and Godfrey, whose predictions Stein sets out at length in the opening
pages of her book. From early in the novel, Mrs. Reynolds holds Angel
Harper's death hopefully in sight; on the last page she turns to her
sleepy husband and reminds him that she has not been wrong to believe
in Saint Odile, "because Saint Odile had not been mistaken. Angel Harper
was not fifty-five alive" (<I>MR</I>, 330).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the core of this novel lies the irony that, in the absence of a
firmly internalized sense of time and the stabilizing effects provided
by a belief in memory, an obsession with temporal coordinates dominates
the whole. In a surreal narrative facsimile of daily living without
the faculty of memory, <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> poses the problems Stein
has been considering from primarily philosophical perspectives for more
than a decade prior to its composition. In <I>The Geographical History
of America</I> Stein can write "[t]he relation of human nature to the
human mind makes everybody indifferent to remembering and forgetting to
age and living to knowing that every one can

<B></B>

die so that there may
be room for all who are here now" (<I>GH</I>, 59). In <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>
she places her characters in this indifferent world and she locates
that world, at least to some degree, in time, thereby revealing how vexed
and unsettling are the relations between human mind and human nature,
between the subject to itself and the subject in time. On virtually
every page of this book, with a reiterative logic that makes sense only
if one posits a storyteller plagued by a continuous state of amnesia,
we listen to the narrative tell over a few notches on the stick that
allows it to keep some record of its uncertain temporal place: Angel
Harper's age, Mrs. Reynolds's age, the age of the century, the year as
specified in prophecy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's preoccupations with narrative and memory, with the disjunctions
between the subject's temporally unmoored existence and the object's
embeddedness in time, give this odd book a shape that is often comically
unsophisticated. Having told us that Mrs. Reynolds "was not really
Mrs. Reynolds until she was twenty-three," the book labors to build a
story and to draw a bead on its main character, using the progress toward
twenty-three as temporary telos: "She was nineteen then and then she
was twenty. She was not yet twenty-one" (<I>MR</I>, 17). Mrs. Reynolds
stands only once for a moment before our eyes, early in the novel, held
up for the scrutiny we are accustomed to give res in fiction:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

"Pretty," "small," "tall," "heavy," not dark, not blonde--the first
sentence provides us with almost nothing we can carry away, nothing
to recall. Its measured phrases balance each other like statements on
either side of an equals sign in algebra, canceling each other out. But
then she perhaps pursues invisibility deliberately, given the danger of
the times. The sudden shift from outside to inside, from her beret and
her stature to what she knows, might prompt us to attribute motive and
psychological depth to her lack of distinguishing features. The book,
however, offers no sustained exploration of interiority that might warrant
this reading. All its characters are propelled forward by the ticking
of a clock, the pure passing of time, rather than by any recognizably
internal drives.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the absence of character development to keep us oriented in our
reading, the narrative of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> searches constantly
for interpretive shorthand, for ways to anchor perception, keys to
the whirling world. Suppose hair and habits of grooming counted for
something? "If blonde people brush their hair, and make it curl they
are called Gabriel. If dark people brush their hair and it does not
curl, they are called Angel Harper" (<I>MR</I>, 60). Like any number
of similarly crazy forays into logic in this novel, this conditional
assertion can be read as a grim parody of Nazi proclamations about race,
but what is most disturbing about this paragraph is that its confident
illogic is ubiquitous in this book. Mrs. Reynolds, or any of the other
res passing

<B></B>

through these pages, is just as likely to propose
this kind of equation as is Angel Harper or the narrative itself. Rather
than being a moment of merely political satire, this passage speaks to a
pervasive, ontological problem, a bewilderment so profound that politics,
history, ethics, narrative--all that humans build--seems equally flimsy,
equally founded on illusory connections, equally beside the point.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The preeminent ground for studying the odd contours of Steinian history
is the character of Angel Harper himself. Given our knowledge of his
referent in real life--and his connection to Adolph Hitler was noted by
the novel's earliest reviewers--his name presents us with immediate
difficulties. Sounding like a cross between a re from Hardy
and, with the unconcealed pun in his last name, from Bunyan, "Angel
Harper" constitutes one of Stein's most audacious experiments with the
possibility of disconnecting words and things, language and history. To
change "Adolph" to "Angel" is not simply to make a semantic equation
but, as we experience a dissonance in the rechristening, to expose our
presuppositions about how names should fit the world. That is, Stein
presents "Adolph" and "Angel," without commentary, as different, though
similar, collections of letters. Our desire for a semantic order that
corresponds to an ethical one causes us to read the substitution as a
grotesque and deliberate mismatching, an affront to our deepest sense
of order. But then, nothing adds up with Angel Harper. Stein introduces
him in the second chapter of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, and he is from the
outset a character who cannot find a place for himself. In a parody of
portents, Stein obliquely suggests that his birth was accompanied by
signs but then quickly dismisses the relevance of her own suggestion:
"The hoot-owl was hooting terrifically up the valley. Nobody knew just
when or how Angel Harper was born. Not that it made any difference. It
did not" (<I>MR</I>, 38). Whether it is the public's ignorance of the
facts surrounding Angel Harper's birth or the owl's hooting that is
the referent of the "it" in these last two sentences doesn't matter,
since neither explains who this re is or why he developed as he
did. When Stein focuses more intimately on the antagonist who comes to
haunt Mrs. Reynolds, there seems to be nothing inside:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
So he began, being born did not interest him and being dead could not
happen to him and being married was never a possibility for him and
being older as yet was not happening to him and being younger had never
happened to him, so what was the matter. (<I>MR</I>, 38)

Perched precariously in the present on what William James calls the
"saddle-back of time," alone and disconnected, Angel Harper amounts almost
to nothing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Scarcely anything is of consequence; there is
hardly a subject available for description. Stein means "matter" in both
these senses, offering an economical summary of her dwindling character
as subject and object: "Sometimes nothing was the matter." And then,
gathering up what little she can carry away from this early assessment,
she takes stock of all we know: "His name was Angel Harper and sometimes
nothing was the matter" (<I>MR</I>, 38-9).

Even to himself, with a memory that functions only intermittently and
that does not respond to his bidding, Angel Harper is a cipher. Following
a paragraph in which we learn that Mrs. Reynolds's brother was often
unable to "remember what most people whom he knew looked like"--Angel
Harper's failures of memory are by no means anomalous in this book--we
watch Angel Harper try to pull himself together:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

But Angel Harper was completely like that, he would begin trying to
remember his walk, or his nose or his mouth or his hair or his clothes

In Martin Amis's <I>Time's Arrow</I> (London: Jonathan Cape, 1991), the
narrative "I" tells the story of the novel's central character, a Nazi
doctor, backwards, from death to birth. Entirely lacking the faculty of
memory, since time runs backward, effect precedes cause, and there is
no past to recall in the present, the "I" is cut off from the identity
of this person whose body and mind he inhabits. The narrator watches,
trapped, bemused, amoral, as the thing with a name, an identity to use
Stein's terms, moves confusingly through the world. <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>
is Stein's earlier version of the puzzle Amis makes, though it lacks the
morally redemptive satirical thrust of <I>Time's Arrow</I>. It is a book
filled with res (human minds) whose identities (human natures) are
attached loosely to them like sets of ill-fitting garments, res who
possess a consciousness, an "I," but little more. When Angel Harper even
considers telling his life story, he finds that "[h]e could not think in
that way, he could not remember, he only remembered what he left." His
past has not completely vanished; it lies in abandoned pieces behind him,
"left" rather than narratively gathered up and brought with him into now:
"Little by little he tried to remember what he had but he never could,
he could only remember what he left" (<I>MR</I>, 85).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The true horror of Stein's Angel Harper is that, because he lacks the
ability to forge a narrative from events, he is utterly amoral. His
actions are unmotivated, and his thoughts are disconnected from those
actions. As Laurence Kirmayer succinctly puts it, "[t]he moral function
of memory is to compel us to confront what we--and all around us--wish to
leave behind."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The canvas of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> is dotted
with brief recollected vignettes from Angel Harper's childhood, but Angel
Harper's past has for him no gravity, nor does he live in the present as
though his actions will become part of a burden he must carry. Instead
of providing us with explanatory frames for understanding, glimpses of
psychosis or sociopathology in embryo, his memories stand isolated from
the paragraphs around them and from the recollecting subject himself. The
trigger for each memory is invariably nothing more than time: "When he
was forty-three," a typical episode begins, "he remembered that when he
was thirteen he would sit by a drain and whisper in it to some one on
the other side of it" (<I>MR</I>, 109). The memories are often vaguely
disturbing, but nothing analytically or emotionally productive arises
from these disturbances:

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

[W]hen he was forty-four he remembered that when he had been fourteen, he
played a game and each one, not he but each one around him had a knife,
and each one came up to him and whispered something to him and he did not

that it had been happening when he was fourteen. (<I>MR</I>, 118-19)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Enough said," the next paragraph begins, and the adolescents with their
knives and their whispers fade from view. Angel Harper suffers from angst
but not remorse, from unfocused anxiety but not guilt. Even recollections
that, with a small degree of psychologically coherent treatment, might
serve as keys to character are either simply abandoned or are turned by
the narrative into occasions for wordplay:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[W]hen he was fifty-three he remembered that when he was fifteen he asked
them to make a very small enclosure of stone and in that in a chair he
sat alone and sometimes  he let another boy sit in there with him and
near him he let a little girl make a little park with flowers and when
he was fifty-three he remembered all that. (<I>MR</I>, 276)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Echoing Stein's conundrum about the man's inability to recall the
little boy who preceded him, the narrative following this memory
expresses surprise that the fifty-three-year-old Angel Harper even
found this piece of his childhood floating into his field of vision:
"He might not have remembered all that, because when he was fifty-three
there was not much to remember at, because he often felt very different
from any day to any day" (<I>MR</I>, 276). The paragraph then takes a
conspicuous turn away from analysis and toward poetry, with rhythm and
rhyme seeming to determine sense. The word "Jew" (it is impossible to
imagine three letters that carry a stronger ethical and political charge
in the early 1940s) occurs mostly because it is a word that rhymes with
so many other words. Here is more medium than message, on an occasion
when a moral order would demand a message:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
What shall I do he said if I am or if I am not a Jew, what shall I do he
said, he was fifty-three and he was not lonesome and he was not subdued,
he was very rude, not rude to himself because although he was afraid he
went away to go ahead and he never never went to bed. So one at a time
there was no time. (<I>MR</I>, 277)

There is, as Stein said of <I>Wars I Have Seen</I>, "something momentous
happening" somewhere behind the words of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, but, with
every character and the narrative voice all being "existences suspended in
time," we cannot make supportable leaps from those words to the world. In
a masterful paragraph of suggestive but untranslatable comparisons,
Mrs. Reynolds attempts to locate Angel Harper on an occupational
spectrum, to put him convincingly next to any other person. "Nobody
asked her," the passage wryly begins--why should the opinion of a
Mrs. Reynolds matter?--"but what did she think of him." In the absence
of an interlocutor, the occasion for speech must be rhetorical:

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

She thought that he was not as useful as a plumber and more dangerous, she

thought that he was not as regular as a gardener but more destructive,
she thought that he was more solemn than a baker but more fiery, and
she thought he was not as bloody as a butcher but more deceitful, and
then she burst out into hysterical laughter and Mr. Reynolds said what
is it, and she said it is Angel Harper and he is fifty just fifty going
on being fifty, and if, and she gave a deep sigh if he only never came
to be fifty-one. (<I>MR</I>, 188)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mrs. Reynolds, rarely caught in "the state of confusion between anybody
doing anything and anything happening," typically concludes her musings
on Angel Harper's dangerous progress with a prayer that his time run
out--that he not be allowed to "go on being" whatever age he happens
to be. Another way to put this is to say that Mrs. Reynolds shares
her creator's skepticism, her passivity concerning cause and effect
and action. For her, the present lies contiguous to but not obviously
connected to the past and future.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Stein too, she would prefer to be disconnected from the
responsibility that memory entails: "Mrs. Reynolds said she wished
that she was a cow and then she would only know now, and not about the
clock going back" (<I>MR</I>, 221). If one is lost in the beguiling
pages of <I>The Geographical History of America</I> or in "What are
Master-Pieces?" living entirely in the "now" of the human mind may seem
liberating. The attempt looks somewhat different--and Stein knows that it
looks different--on the pages of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, where we discover
a state of mind that is historical in spite of itself. In 1936 Stein
could protest that "[t]he newspapers tell about events but what have
events to do with anything nothing" (<I>GH</I>, 95). Now it is the early
1940s and, in a fine moment of sardonic comedy that has as its target
both Mrs. Reynolds and Gertrude Stein, we hear Mrs. Reynolds talking to
her husband: "Mr. Miner says, said Mrs. Reynolds to Mr. Reynolds that
there is a great difference between there was an army and there is an
army" (<I>MR</I>, 248). The problem Stein sets for herself (and for the
anxious heroine of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>) is how to register the fact of
this terrible difference without succumbing entirely to the newspapers,
to the clock ticking regularly inside as well as outside her head, to
the obligations and the false sense of agency that memory entails. How
to avoid the easy, unpleasant, and unproductive slide into materialism
that leads straight to the dullest forms of narrative but yields nothing
of aesthetic or philosophical value?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Bearing comparison with the H.D. of "Trilogy" or the Yeats of <I>A
Vision</I>, Stein in <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> discovers that prophecy--in
particular, the prophetic voices of Saint Odile and Saint Godfrey--allows
time into the world she creates without requiring that she also import
memory, or human agency, or a developed political or ethical system. Stein
herself avidly read and recounted to her friends during the war the work
of a "Leonardo Blake," an English astrologer whose two books, <I>Hitler's
Last Year of Power</I>  and <I>The Last Year of the War</I> 
provide much of the structure and rationale for <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>. Both
books, filled with the horoscopes of leaders and nations, are saturated
with dates and magisterial pronouncements that bear particular resonance
for anyone who has been reading Stein. "Men only think they

<B></B>

are
the makers of history," Blake insists, but "[a]ctually there is being
staged in Europe to-day the greatest puppet-show in the history of
man."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 "For the prophet," Blake writes, "there is neither
past, present, nor future. To him all Time is an eternal present. Thus,
what is to come is as evident to him as what has past."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

Writing from the perspective of Yeats's Chinamen in "Lapis Lazuli,"
sounding a bit like the impersonal poet in Eliot's "Tradition and the
Individual Talent," Blake says: "I have written this book not because
I am an adversary of the Nazi regime (for the true astrologer is far
removed from any kind of party politics and prejudices)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>

"The astrologer who genuinely desires to help those around him," Blake
continues, "must first liberate himself from his own ego . . . In
interpreting the cosmic law, it is not a subjective perception that
matters, but an objective perception of the whole secret fabric of
creation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The promise that Blake holds for Stein is order and answers--repose in
a deeply conservative system that does not even require the knowledge,
much less the assent or participation of the actors caught up in
their strictly assigned parts. There is a folder among Stein's papers
at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript library at Yale University
filled with typed and handwritten prophesies, copied at different
times and from different sources. Two of those prophesies, those of
Saints Odile and Godfrey, make their way almost verbatim into the text
of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 It is fitting that Stein, in a
willing abdication of her role as author, had only to act as a conduit
for the wisdom of the stars, copying these maps of the future into her
book. In order to clarify how fully prophecy is memory's antagonist, we
might briefly consider Henri Bergson's central argument in his <I>Matter
and Memory</I> (1896, trans. 1911). Memory for Bergson is the faculty
that is "placed at the confluence of mind and matter." It binds ideas
to the real; it attaches consciousness to the world with our body at
that world's center:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Do we turn to memory? We note that its primary function is to evoke all
those past perceptions which are analogous to the present perception,
to recall to us what preceded and followed them, and so to suggest to us
that decision which is the most useful. But this is not all. By allowing
us to grasp in a single intuition multiple moments of duration, it frees
us from the movement of the flow of things, that is to say, from the
rhythm of necessity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One cannot imagine a more profound nightmare for Mrs. Reynolds than
this freedom from the comforting rhythm of what must be. "Dear me,"
she sighs late in Stein's chronicle of her days, "it is so tiresome
not to know what is going to be happening" (<I>MR</I>, 246). Bergson's
memory suspends us above time's flow only long enough for us to make a
choice and then plunge willingly in again; Blake and the Saints offer
Mrs. Reynolds and her creator another way out.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But what makes <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> a compelling and complex portrait
of "the way anybody could feel" during the war are the difficulties
Mrs. Reynolds has in taking consolation from her saints. Predictions
should palliate anxiety: "Mrs. Reynolds said

<B></B>

she felt very
complicated this morning and so she would calm herself by reading
the predictions of Saint Odile" (<I>MR</I>, 277). But every
calm, uncomplicated morning in this book is thrown off kilter by
subsequent doubts. It is not easy to rest outside of time: "Dear me said
Mrs. Reynolds if I knew how to be patient and I know how to be impatient I
would know that everything is imminent" (<I>MR</I>, 325). Over and over,
with increasing frequency as the book progresses and Angel Harper lives
year after costly year, the narrator must assure us that Mrs. Reynolds's
faith has not waned. "[S]he had not weakened, she was still choosing Saint
Odile" (<I>MR</I>, 291), we learn at one of the points in the novel where
Stein reveals the current date (it is 1942). It is hardly surprising
that in this grim year Mrs. Reynolds confesses on the following page:
"I weakened a little bit" (<I>MR</I>, 292). Like Stein, she finds it
necessary to write Saint Odile's words over, since "when she made a copy
of it she believed it all again" (<I>MR</I>, 233).
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 More than
a decade earlier, in 1926, Stein had told the audiences at Cambridge and
Oxford that "beginning again and again" was of central importance to
her work.

 In this late and guardedly historical fiction,
repetition derives from the pervasive sense that nothing provides a
purchase on the world. Mrs. Reynolds, having renounced the internal
chronology provided by memory, has to begin every day again, trying to
conjure some sense into time's passing and find some tranquility in her
powerlessness. Late in the novel, long after we have heard the full text
of Saint Odile's prophecy repeated several times, Mrs. Reynolds comes
excitedly home to her patient, skeptical, agreeable husband:

and now I am only waiting for the ting in the streets of the city
of cities, to believe that Saint Odile is right and of course Saint
Odile is right and it is all the same, and said Mrs. Reynolds even if
it does not make any difference to me and in a way it does not make any
difference to me but I have not a restless feeling but an underground
happy feeling that it is all the same . . . and you are all the same

better yes no or no yes. (<I>MR</I>, 294)

Stein makes narrative either something impossible to discover--in her
opaque prose-poetry--or, as here, she saturates it with comedy--the often
dark comedy of disjunctions arising from any structure that makes the
absurd claim: "first X then Y." Instead we have X, then X again, with
the corollary that we cannot keep track of the Xs, since each fades so
quickly from our memory after its iteration. Each statement is wholly
new, entirely and perpetually modern, though in its very novelty, its
singularity, it destroys even the possibility that we might assign it a
temporal position. Stein is most modern in her idiosyncratic, longstanding
preoccupation with memory, forgetting, and the structures created by
the endless interplay between recollection and amnesia. "Thinking,"
she admits, "is something that does so nearly need to be memory," but
she nevertheless continues to attempt to dissever the mind from its

<B></B>

milieus.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Positioning her historically requires that
we honor fully her resistance to being "placed" historically at all,
and we can only honor that resistance by taking it seriously enough to
observe Stein's own writing of that resistance deeply into the details
of her narratives.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In her "Epilogue" to <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, immediately preceding her
final sentence tying history to a "state of mind," Stein describes how
"the shadow of two men" (Hitler and Stalin) "gets bigger and then blows
away and there is no other" (<I>MR</I>, 331). No legacy, then, of the
War--nothing to remember, no stories really worth telling. If we care
to, we can read the newspapers. Of course she knows that most of us
will not or cannot let the past simply blow away. She knows, too, since
she herself is not consistently able to turn the world and its activity
into shadows or puppet shows, that we will continue to worry, as will
she, over politics and the shape of our futures. But she believes her
most important labor to be elsewhere--on a project so different from our
current preoccupations in the academy that it proves difficult even to
discern or credit. Stein aspires to live in what Eliot described, in the
greatest modern poetic treatment of memory and the possibilities of living
within and outside of time, as "the unimaginable / Zero summer"--where,
in her own phrase, "everything is imminent" and nothing is happening.

The critical practice that promises to situate a text most firmly,
most literally in time is textual scholarship. Think of <I>Ulysses</I>
or, their every word plotted on a retrospectively assembled <I>The
Waste Land</I> calendar of composition. Jerome McGann concludes <I>The
Textual Condition</I> proclaiming that all events "[localize] human
temporalities." "To the interpreter," he writes, "texts often appear
as the images of time; to the maker of texts, however, they are the
very events of time and history itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
The finished text
constitutes, in its procession of letters across the page, a memorial to
time's passing in the life of its author. Drafts of that text offer an
even more obvious witness to temporality. As the textual critic makes
an ordered gathering of earlier versions, he or she fully exposes the
diachronic nature of writing. McGann reminds us that "[v]ariation . . . is
the invariant rule of the textual condition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Like markings
on the face of a clock, variants provide us with a way to calibrate the
author's labor and to tie her changing words to time. But Stein proves
every bit as difficult to fix on any textual clock as she is resistant
to location in occupied France. When we turn to her drafts, prompted by
a desire to glimpse the author at work, what we find disrupts one of the
founding premises of textual scholarship: that texts evolve over time. On
this most fundamental level--the level of writing itself--Stein forces
us to consider the philosophical and procedural difficulties attending
all epistemologies that privilege temporal, historical categories of
understanding.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> provided us with a textual locus for examining
Stein's complex positioning of a subject in historical time. To focus
my discussion of her equally complex and closely related compositional
practice, I turn to a long essay she sometimes called "Phenomena of
Nature," sometimes "Natural Phenomena." She composed the essay in
1925-1926; it was first published posthumously in the <I>Yale
Gertrude Stein</I>

<B></B>

. I choose this essay in large part because
we are fortunate to have, among Stein's papers at the Beinecke library,
textual witnesses from each of her three characteristic compositional
stages. These stages have been described with admirable clarity by Ulla
Dydo, a pioneer in the study of Stein's manuscripts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 For
"Phenomena of Nature," an essay that has received very little attention
in print, we have eight surviving <I>carnets</I>--the small copybooks
in which Stein composed the earliest drafts of her work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>

We have a complete set of twenty-five <I>cahiers</I>--larger notebooks
that contain a manuscript transcription of the essay. And we have the
full typescript, used to set the text for publication in 1955. Though
Stein wrote this piece twenty years before writing <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>,
and though she, her writing, and the world changed enormously in the
intervening years, the means by which she builds "Phenomena of Nature" are
directly and revealingly comparable to the way she tells her anti-temporal
historical narrative of the Second World War.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's career has been more or less usefully divided into phases by a
number of her critics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 In her autobiographical writings,
Stein herself energetically promoted this practice of partitioning. And
these divisions can come to seem like uncrossable borders to Stein's
critics: what has her work of the mid-1920s to do with a novel composed
in the early 1940s? But "Phenomena of Nature" and <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>
belong together in a discussion of Stein, memory, and critical locations
of her in "place, time, life, history, materiality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 A
writer's habits of work reveal fundamental assumptions about the world
and the place of the writer and her writing in that world. In Stein's
case, the way she writes, the way she moves through successive versions
of a text, constitutes the methodological foundation of her assault
against the reign of memory, the tyrannies of time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By way of illustrating the challenge Stein presents to textual
scholarship, I quote three sentences from the first portion of
"Phenomena of Nature" for which we have draft evidence. Here are
the sentences as they first appear in pencil on a page from the
<I>carnet</I>: "They hate sitting, sitting where, sitting there and
being allowed to sit anywhere. In what way is this their seat and
seated. Believing in chance" (92:1716). Here are those sentences
in their final, printed version: "They hate sitting, sitting where,
sitting there and being allowed to sit anywhere. In what way is this
their seat and seated. Believing in chance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 We can find
twenty-eight draft passages for "Phenomena of Nature" scattered among
the eight <I>carnets</I>. We can count on one hand the instances of
deletions at this earliest compositional stage. There are virtually no
instances of interpolations. Even the tiniest details of punctuation
and capitalization are, for the most part, set from the start. Except
for what seem to be occasional slips of the pen, the text as it appears
in the <I>cahiers</I> is identical to the published version. It is
difficult to convey fully how odd these notebooks first appear to one
accustomed to making discoveries in drafts. The term "draft" itself,
though useful as a term to distinguish Stein's first, handwritten copy
of a text from a later, printed version, is misleading insofar as it
implies a preliminary sketch or rough version.

 Stein's essay startles because its drafts cast
almost no shadows, because we discover, when we fix our attention
on what preceded the present text, sameness rather than difference:
Narcissus staring in the silvered pool; Echo following in the track of
every prior utterance. There are, it is true, slight variations at each
of the essay's stages of composition. <I>Carnets</I>, <I>cahiers</I>,

bibliographic codes.

 And the <I>carnets</I> are filled with
a complex assembly of other writings to which I will return. But I dwell
first on the extraordinary unnaturalness of "Natural Phenomena" in its
earliest form. The sentences in their first and final versions, ending
as they began, complete a circle that obscures from our view evidence
of the author's earliest intentions and of changes to those intentions;
of problems encountered and overcome or left unresolved in the course
of composition; of expressive alterations in the design of details or
of the whole. They leave us with a starkly simple text that speaks of
presence rather than growth. "Phenomena of Nature" is, in an important
sense, an essay without a past.

Dydo has pointed out that Stein herself claimed "she did not believe in
revision, for if writing involved the perception of the here and now,

that Stein called <I>meditation</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Dydo's defensive
pronouncement demonstrates, among other things, how much traditional
scholarship relies on drafts to document an author's worth. Evidence
of extensive labor helps guarantee the value we ascribe to the final
text. The criticisms brought against Stein during her lifetime and
after her death--we need only think of Wyndham Lewis, sneering at the
"sodden lustreless heaping up of sheer meaningless material"--could be
so much more easily dispensed with if there were some equivalent to
the forty-nine notebooks marshaled behind the published <I>Finnegans
Wake</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 But it is perhaps necessary to add, before I turn
to a detailed description of the textual witnesses for "Phenomena of
Nature," that I do not intend to propose evaluative judgments of Stein's
work based on her compositional practices. Her improvisatory method does
raise important questions about how audiences determine aesthetic value
and how we might interpret writing that reaches publication without
evidence of revision. But my primary concern here is to examine and
explain the epistemological convictions that underwrite Stein's way of
making "Phenomena of Nature." It should also be understood that Stein does
not write all of her work in the same fashion. She generally composes her
more accessible, more openly referential writing in a manner familiar
to textual scholars. She works from notes through changing drafts to a
final version. "Natural Phenomena" provides us with an unusually rich
illustration

<B></B>

of an alternative path to completion--a path Stein
tends to follow as she creates her less referential texts.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Phenomena of Nature" is a little over twenty thousand words in length. It
is reasonable to suppose that Stein drafted the entire composition
in <I>carnets</I> before she and Alice Toklas copied the material to
<I>cahiers</I>. The eight relevant <I>carnets</I> contain a total of
twenty-eight sections from the essay--some as short as forty words,
most falling somewhere between two and four hundred words. Interspersed
with these pieces of "Phenomena of Nature" are love notes and drawings
to Alice; miscellaneous lists--lists of names, of the day's necessary
groceries, of titles; various addresses; agendas for the day or the week;
reading notes; sums; drafts of letters; and pieces of other compositions
that Stein was concurrently writing: "Business in Baltimore," "A Novel
of Thank You," "A Third."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 Alice often responds to Stein's
notes; she also occasionally uses the <I>carnets</I> for her own lists
and daily jottings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The writing in the <I>carnets</I> is usually inverted about halfway
through each notebook: the reader must turn the notebook over at the
midpoint and begin afresh from the other end. Sometimes there will be
a page in the middle of a <I>carnet</I> where the two halves of the
book meet and the inverted writing lies interlineated, like Leopold and
Molly Bloom in bed. While Stein does not break sections of "Phenomena
of Nature" at these points of inversion, she may continue composing the
same text after turning the <I>carnet</I> over and beginning to work her
way toward the middle of the notebook from the other cover.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>

The sequence of sections within each <I>carnet</I> rarely follows the
sequence in the final "Phenomena of Nature," and the material from a given
<I>carnet</I>, if that <I>carnet</I> contains more than one portion of the
essay, can be distributed over anywhere from two to eight pages of the
final text.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 This is an essay assembled at the level of the
<I>cahiers</I>, built like a mosaic out of the tesserae that are the short
bits of prose selected from the <I>carnets</I>. We have at most a third of
the <I>carnet</I> witnesses for this text. As Stein pieced "Phenomena of
Nature" together, she would have been choosing passages from a large stack
of little notebooks, each of which already constituted an extraordinarily
heterogeneous collection of writings. I cannot imagine the essay coming
from fewer than twenty <I>carnets</I>; there could conceivably have
been twice that number. Joyce's large envelopes stuffed with disparate
material for chapters of <I>Ulysses</I> come to mind, as do Woolf's 1930s
scrapbooks that lie behind <I>The Years</I> and <I>Three Guineas</I>, but
these famously scattered archives ultimately yield wholes, even though
those final texts are in part designed to let readers see that the book
they read was built from snippets. Stein's mosaic does not produce a
picture of anything, nor does it reveal a pattern. We must read as she
wrote, moving from one small unit to the next, never trying to back up
far enough that we can forget the compositional medium and dwell instead
on any resemblance to something we might vaguely denominate "life."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a fine and utterly characteristic moment of straight-faced, provocative
comedy from <I>The Geographical History of America</I>, Stein wryly
expresses her lack of interest in totalities:

Stein's discovery of a method for disassembling books as she reads will
come as "regrettable" news to all the readers and writers who prefer that
language remain subordinate, in the service of narrative. It becomes
clear, when working segment by segment through the <I>carnets</I>
(particularly if one is transcribing every word), that Stein composes
in these little books partly to frustrate any impulses she might have
toward forcing her words to amount to something grand.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With a <I>carnet</I> open before her, she could never even see more than
twenty or thirty words at one time. Switching from one work-in-progress
to another, and frequently shifting registers entirely (sandwiching,
say, a menu for tomorrow's dinner or a love note with an accompanying
page of sketches between part of "Phenomena of Nature" and "Business
in Baltimore"), she would find it virtually impossible to establish a
narrative line. Stein demarcates sections of her works with short title
headings--"P. of N ." or "N .P ."; "B. in B ."; "Novel"; "A Third"--that
already signal a breakdown of wholes into parts. We find no regular order
and no set length of the sections. Stein occasionally superimposes one
section title on another, changing her direction the way an improvising
musician may suddenly change key or tempo. Sometimes the superimposition
occurs in an obviously different pencil: she may have returned to an
already drafted section and reassigned its location; she might have left
a heading for herself that she later decided not to use; she might simply
have changed her mind as she was picking up another pencil. She had a
definite but shifting sense, as she was writing, of what she wanted to be
composing, and the <I>carnets</I> allow her to honor the vagaries of her
desire, their rules of assembly insisting all the while that the desire
remain vagrant.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Though there are instances where the ending
of one section has obviously triggered a word or phrase in the next, there
are not overarching themes or even substantial and sustained verbal echoes
binding sections together.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 <I>Carnets</I> have the unity
granted them by the physical fact that each is a separate book, but they
are not collections of fragments shored or bound together--not a <I>Waste
Land</I> or <I>Wake</I>, not <I>Cantos</I>, certainly not <I>Quartets</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Or perhaps, if we were so inclined and if Stein did not warn us so
vehemently against the activity, we could make these little notebooks
cohere as fully as do any of those differently disheveled monuments. When
we see words in a book, we move naturally and expediently to connect
them with one another and to have them point to something. The fact of
that pointing itself then bespeaks unity of purpose and design. The
problem of referentiality--and for Stein it is a problem precisely
because

<B></B>

readers remain incorrigibly interested in words' capacity
to evoke images of "whole things"--haunts the interpretive history of
Stein's opaque writings and is staged as both problem and blessing with
extraordinary vividness throughout the <I>carnets</I>. Once we have read
the <I>carnets</I> for "Phenomena of Nature," particularly when we have
discovered the notes between Gertrude and Alice, it is difficult to read
the published essay only as Stein wants us to, concentrating on words
"one at a time," without any "remembering or forgetting." The unrevised
manuscript origins of "Phenomena of Nature" present us with a powerful
witness to Stein's attempt at banishing memory from the process of
composition, her refusal of what McGann calls "the textual condition." But
we find these portions of "Natural Phenomena" adjacent to very different
kinds of writing. At the farthest extreme from the polished surfaces of
"Phenomena of Nature" are Stein's notes to Alice, which exhibit language
in its most deeply and privately referential aspect. Stein's meditative
writing for publication is the product of the human mind; love letters
are, of all kinds of writing, the genre belonging most fully to human
nature, predicated as they are on memory and voice, designed expressly
to evoke the absent beloved. Filled with both kinds of writing, the
<I>carnets</I> simultaneously celebrate and eschew reference.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I do not turn to Stein's private writing so that I may crack the code
of "Natural Phenomena." I am not interested in cross-referential
interpretations that will uncover love letters in Stein's public
works. The particular importance of the <I>carnets</I> as I read them
is that they reveal Stein moving among various linguistic registers,
considering different ways of deploying words, and they thereby
constitute a crucial, underutilized locus for observing her shifting
as a writer between human mind and human nature. In addition to reading
her pronouncements concerning the differences between these two states
of being, we can observe her negotiating their different demands on the
pages of these little books.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The notes to and from Alice do not remain neatly cordoned off from the
other writings in the <I>carnets</I>, though one might suppose they do
from Dydo's description of them in "Reading the Hand Writing":

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Often (Stein) began work in a <I>carnet</I> by pencilling little
love notes, jingles, intimate addresses, and sometimes drawings to
Toklas. These notes are written in a tiny, thin, "secret" hand to offset
them from actual compositions. None are literary.
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What is in fact most provocative about this intimate writing to Alice
is that it spills over into adjacent sections. It is by no means always
written in a "secret hand"; there are no dependably consistent, convenient
graphic signals that warn us when we have moved from literature to
love, from "actual composition" to something more private. The notes
do regularly occur as invocations at the beginning of a <I>carnet</I>
(or at both beginnings, since the inverted writing in the <I>carnets</I>
can be said to give each notebook two beginnings), but they can turn up
anywhere between the covers. When we have read a handful of these notes,
becoming steeped in their characteristic turns of phrase and attuned to
their typical vocabulary, we cannot read the public

<B></B>

"Phenomena of
Nature" or the private letters to Alice without hearing echoes between
theoretically distinct kinds of writing. Human mind and human nature,
it turns out, share a good deal of the same vocabulary. Even if one
reads word by word, determined to look neither forward nor backward for
wholes, language is a vexing medium for the human mind to use. Paint or
sound seem inherently more promising. Words are like burrs: they stick
so readily to the fabric of the world, to our lives, our recollected
pasts, our vividly experienced presents, our imagined futures. Stein
treats her medium in the <I>carnet</I>s as an improvising musician treats
notes--building without erasure or backtracking (except as repetition
with change constitutes a form of serial revision in which the earlier
version also remains present on the completed page). But insofar as her
reader holds the <I>carnets</I> in his or her memory, parts of "Phenomena
of Nature" can carry complex attractive charges, recalling adjacent and
differently directed writing from the <I>carnets</I>. I said earlier
that the drafts for "Phenomena of Nature" cast no shadows. That was
not entirely true. Those drafts are surrounded by shadows--writing that
remembers, writing that recalls and anticipates items, places, people,
ideas, the body, the presence of the beloved. To read the <I>carnets</I>
is to watch Stein (and to imagine Alice) crossing the vaguely demarcated
boundary between referential writing and the writing without precedent
or elsewheres that is "Natural Phenomena."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Consider two pages from one of the <I>carnets</I>. Stein has been
composing "N.P.": "She does not like a flower to droop its head and so
instead she pours a little water in its bed. And she noticed it and told
me and I was pleased to hear about it although just then although just
then" (1734; <I>NP</I>, 194). The next page begins with a parenthetical
aside to Alice (and perhaps, as a reminder, to Gertrude as well)--"(this
is separate)"--followed by a brief, typical "note to tell my wifie
that I can quote and that I wrote and that she will have come out a
cow now now how, sweetly" . The parenthesis claiming separation
is necessary only because the passage from "Phenomena of Nature," in
its preciousness, its intimate focus on nurturing, on conversation, on
giving and pleasure, slips easily into the genre of the love letter
as Stein's practice in the <I>carnets</I> has defined it. But these
qualities of intimacy that I have ascribed to the passage from "Phenomena
of Nature" must always remain purely potential and must depend on what
any reader chooses to remember from the drafts, and who we imagine the
audience of these words to be. The words will never simply and purely
possess their possibly intimate inflections on the pages of "Phenomena
of Nature," if only because Stein worked diligently and explicitly, in
theory and practice, to unsettle interpretive arrivals and resolutions,
especially resolutions that produce a body, a personality, an identity
as the endpoint of reading.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is mistaken to propose, as Dydo does, that "a full study of the Stein
autograph notebooks can make works accessible that have been considered
hermetic or incomprehensible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 Nor, I think, should we
use the drafts to discover, at a particular moment in a published text,
that "[p]lainly Gertrude Stein and Alice Toklas are quarreling," or to
find that "'Natural Phenomena' . . . ends with a tiny dialogue that is

<B></B>

undoubtedly an exchange between Stein and Toklas: 'I choose you. I
choose you too.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 When she uses the <I>carnets</I> as a key,
Dydo confounds different orders of writing. These words might once have
formed part of an exchange between people, and the <I>carnets</I>--hybrids
of journal and draft--encourage reading across genres. But when Stein
folds "I choose you" into "Natural Phenomena," the possibility that she
spoke these words to Alice gets us almost nowhere in the interpretive
thicket of Stein's text.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Or nowhere legitimate: manuscripts for radically challenging texts
invariably tempt us with the lure that we will uncover intelligible
guides to the whole at an earlier compositional stage. And yet we should
recall A. Walton Litz's admonition in the preface to his book on Joyce's
writing of <I>Ulysses</I> and <I>Finnegans Wake</I>. In 1961, having
already spent considerable time in the Joyce archives, Litz confesses:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

I have long since relinquished the comforting belief that access to an
author's workshop provides insights of greater authority than those
produced by other kinds of criticism. The irreducible gap between
the creator and his work faces one at every turn. Indeed it now seems
to me that the controlling design--the "re in the  carpet"--lies
always in plain view, not in the dark corners explored by the genetic
or biographical critic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This warning fits Stein's case just as perfectly as it does Joyce's. Like
Joyce in his late work, Stein concentrates on linguistic surfaces in
a great deal of her writing, and finding sources for verbal details,
while it may prove satisfying and may even offer spurious comfort in
the face of mystery, will never compel the words before us to arrange
themselves in a referential order. The <I>carnets</I> hold a vast array
of samplings from all the kinds of language we use to bind our lives
together, and Stein picks from among those languages as she practices
her art. But the <I>carnets</I>, when placed beside her finished work,
do not give us plain quarrels in that work, or transcribed conversations,
or circumstances formerly concealed, or readings that are, at last, true
and wholly accurate to a world lying somewhere off the page. One can,
of course, weave snippets from the public work back into an account of
Stein's daily, private life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
 Her words and phrases are
available for this more lucid use. One of the chief lessons of the
<I>carnets</I>, however, lies in the proximity of different kinds of
writing and in our desire, when confronted with these various writings, to
seek out references and make narratives, even after Stein has told us that
she has little interest in narrative lines or in words pointing to things.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We can find evidence of this desire at work in Alice Toklas herself, as
she read and transcribed from the <I>carnets</I> in the days following
Stein's nocturnal labor. Clearly Alice expected both manuscript texts and
notes from her lover. Part of the intrigue for her as a reader of these
notebooks would have been the uncertain aura of many passages--love letter
or word-by-word writing? Both? As she turned pages she would suddenly
find words for herself. "You write a note to me," Alice plaintively
demands at one point. "I do I have," Stein responds , and it is
possible to see in Stein's terse rejoinder a comment about the way she
can be writing in part to Alice

<B></B>

even if the heading on a page reads
"P. of N." or "B. in B." I often found myself uncertain, as I transcribed
<I>carnets</I>, about what kind of writing I was reading and to whom it
was addressed. Here is an exemplary passage, chosen almost at random: "And
when she likes it when they do do it it is when they do do it that she
likes it. It is when she likes and she has the way of having heard that
she was satisfied with what had been heard earnestly" . Two pages
before these sentences, Stein has written "A Third" as a heading, but
the words on this page might also find a private and particular reader.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Stein, though, as for Nietzsche before her, to be a modern
who can write or read master-pieces, one must cultivate the "power
of forgetting, or, in more learned phrase, the capacity of feeling
'unhistorically.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 She would have us suppress our editorial
training, our inclination to unsnarl manuscript tangles, draw diagrams,
place texts carefully in historical time. She would teach us not
to concern ourselves with finding love letters buried in her public
writings, not to chase after the scent of reference in the hopes of
catching real people, tangible places, actual things hiding in their
lairs. The <I>carnets</I> for "Phenomena of Nature" provide us with a
text framed by temporalities but also outside of time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Throughout the <I>carnets</I> and in Stein's more public texts, we find
a talismanic sentence whose changing meanings speak to how Stein's ideal,
empty writing and perfectly forgetful audience might come gradually into
being: "When this you see remember me." The injunction--so old, so often
repeated that it cannot be said to have an author--belongs especially to
the folk-art tradition of the sampler. It was stitched into countless
borders, usually by children and adolescent girls, and often made one
line of a brief verse concerning mortality. A characteristic example,
dated 1739, tells the reader,

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many such verses also had the sampler-maker's name appended. But what
do names and dates mean when tied to such conventional and endlessly
reiterated writing? As the sampler leaves immediate kin for wider and
more temporally distant worlds, "when this you see remember me" turns
from a prayer for remembrance into a memorial to forgetting, a monument
to the absences of author and recipient. The phrase becomes an emblem
for words' tendency to lose their private resonances for more public,
general meanings. Language does tend to evoke the world, but it proves a
porous receptacle for intimacies. Given a little time, even the poignant
injunction to "remember me" can become an assembly of letters on a piece
of cloth--simply language.

If we read Stein's "Introduction to the Speeches of Mar&eacute;chal
P&eacute;tain" in the context of the contemporaneous <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>,
with an understanding of Stein's deep, interconnected skepticisms
concerning the operations of memory, historical narratives,

<B></B>

explanations of political and military events, and stories built
around the development of character, we discover something much more
complicated and peculiar than another instance of "modernism's complicity
with conservative--even fascist--impulses."
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 Van Dusen's
familiar indictment, her ready association of modernism and fascism,
recurs often today, as critics attempt to assess the politics of texts
written between the Wars. She falls into the common error of historical
"foreshadowing," as it is astutely described by Michael Andr&eacute;
Bernstein in his essay "Foregone Conclusions: Narrating the Fate of
Austro-German Jewry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Foreshadowed history collapses the vast
array of possibilities, the range of plausible alternative directions
that might follow from any particular moment in time, and gives us
instead a history inflected in its every detail by our own privileged
knowledge of what did in fact happen after that particular moment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The event "that actually happened . . . exists from then on with
all the weight afforded by the singularity of what we might call its
event-ness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>
 The ethics of this teleologically driven
historiography are frighteningly simple: "the shared knowledge of the
outcome of a series of events by narrator and listener is used to judge
the participants in those events as though they too should have known
what was to come."
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the most fundamental level, Stein's "Introduction" forces us to
confront the enormous difficulties of thinking about modernism in the
shadow of the Shoah. "The more devastating the event," Bernstein points
out, "the greater the compensatory pressure to comprehend it according
to the strictest teleological model as the climax of a grim trajectory
whose inevitable outcome it must be."
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 But, he continues, in
a sentence that fits well with Stein's overturning of narrative logics,
"no historical event, no paradigm of struggle, resistance, and loss,
can transform the death of countless human beings into a tragedy, if
only because real events never happen as part of an already narrated
form."
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
 Understanding any of modernism's texts in political
terms paradoxically requires both that we practice a laborious remembering
of the contexts and motivations, the other writings and events that
surrounded those texts, but also that we simultaneously cultivate a form
of forgetting, a suspension of our certain knowledge of what did, in fact,
transpire in the unknowable future of which that text would become a part.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's lessons in forgetting, rather than being equivalent to the
Nazi's institutionalized and obsessively narrativized acts of erasure and
forgetting that enabled the extermination of millions of people, present
us instead with a model for overturning the complaisant simplicities
of histories that forget "that events now far in the past were once in
the future."

The "Introduction" is hardly a simple paean to P&eacute;tain. He rises
in Stein's third paragraph as an inert, symbolic re--a statue, an
emblem of the collective imagination of the French in wartime. He has
no more substance than any of the res milling about on the stage of
<I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Built piece by piece in a collage of clich&eacute;s, this leader satisfies
a public need and, in so doing, the actual old man vanishes just as
certainly as George Washington did in his becoming the Father of our
Country: P&eacute;tain "became not P&eacute;tain not Mar&eacute;chal
P&eacute;tain but the Mar&eacute;chal" ("MP," 94). Temporal continuity
and causality are no more pertinent to this story than they were to
Angel Harper's or Joseph Lane's: "In the last war . . . was when we first
knew about P&eacute;tain, and Verdun did not fall. Then for a long time
there was nothing about him" ("MP," 94). When he reappears in this next
War, he comes essentially without attachments: "the French people they
realised that being as old as he was and not having a family, he had no
future, he only had the future of France" ("MP," 94). As we read Stein's
bizarre anatomy of this man who has lost his name, we understand that it
is precisely because he has been made from a person into a leader that he
has so little substance, is so old, so often silent, so stripped of past
and future. Angel Harper did a great deal that could not be explained. The
Mar&eacute;chal also defies explanation, though he does virtually nothing:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

And then gradually the Mar&eacute;chal either did what any one and every
one thought he ought to do or he did not, and whether he did or whether
he did not and really nobody really knew there was one thing that was

himself, in short his character did not need any defence. ("MP," 95)

The quiet comedy latent in the word "character" surfaces as we realize
that the word refers not to the richly delineated essence of a man named
Philippe Henri P&eacute;tain but to the one-dimensional cutout that is
the Mar&eacute;chal. He is a character indeed, and in this "Introduction"
he flimsily assumes his place beside the other wartime res summoned
in <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The res around whom the emotional energies of Stein's prose
coalescse in this "Introduction" are the uncertain "we" who wait, as
Mrs. Reynolds waits, wondering what might happen next and how they
might respond. "Always there were rumors and more rumors," Stein writes
wearily; "we used to stand on the country-roads and discuss" the contest
between the Germans and the Mar&eacute;chal ("MP," 95). "We all talked
and talked," she reports to us, and it becomes clear by the end of this
"Introduction" that these "we" measure time in this war by the spinning
of stories and the gradual shifting of opinions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Time saturates this "Introduction" as it does <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, and
for many of the same reasons. In the absence of any empowering sense
of "somebody doing anything and anything happening," the disoriented
people standing on the country roads can only trade stories back and
forth--stories whose very telling bears witness to the unavoidable,
overwhelming fact of waiting in ignorance as time passes. Stein sketches

<B></B>

the genesis of one such story about the Mar&eacute;chal, being
careful to present the narrative so that we understand that we are not to
inquire into whether it actually happened: "Gradually they began to tell
that when he was asked who was going to win the English or the Germans,
he did not answer and when he was pressed he touched his breast and
answered Moi I" ("MP," 95). But what does the first-person pronoun mean
when attached to the Mar&eacute;chal in this shadowy narrative (who asked
this question? when? where?)? Earlier in her brief "Introduction," Stein
has already slipped the French subject from its moorings in identity:
"As a Frenchman explained it to me it is not only that they do not think
alike with their neighbors but they do not think alike within themselves"
("MP," 94).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We have discovered these scattered selves everywhere in
<I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>. Memory may be able to hoodwink us into the
comforting belief after the fact that we have held one opinion (or an
orderly progression of opinions) through our trials, but Stein knows
better, and she has tried to teach her readers so.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Prophecy, that other hermeneutic for tidying up the passage of
time, is likewise qualified in this "Introduction," as it was in
<I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>. The Mar&eacute;chal seems to fulfill "the old
prediction" of France's savior being "an old man on a white horse." But
Stein's utterance of the prophecy begins with the defensive phrase "to
be sure" and concludes with another assurance that rings as much of the
need to buttress credibility as it does of certainty: "as a matter of fact
he did make the armistice in front of Lyon" ("MP," 94). If it was making
an armistice with the occupying army that the "old prediction" intended
as salvation, this prophecy is fraught with the deepest ironies in its
coming to fruition. Like any number of moments in <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>,
this sentence bears poignant witness to its author's desire for an
orderly scheme, a story to tell as "week by week things were getting
more and more terrible" ("MP," 94). The miracle of the Mar&eacute;chal's
presence is that, simply by being a focal point around which the "we"
might circulate, passing the time in talk, he collects pieces desultorily
into an unstable whole: "And so we in France . . . having seen every
time that all being lost actually everything was being held together"
("MP," 95). The passive voice speaks perfectly to how little agency is
required of the Mar&eacute;chal. It is fitting that the occasion for this
"Introduction" should be a collection of speeches. Stein demonstrates in
her paragraph comparing George Washington and P&eacute;tain how quickly
rhetoric collects round a public re and how the "I" behind that
re vanishes in a windy fanfare of clich&eacute;.
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is, further, a specific reason that Stein has for wanting to present
these translated speeches to the American people, and it strikes me as
ironic that Stein's own, explicit historical positioning of her essay
receives no notice from Van Dusen, whose attention is drawn instead to
various positions she wishes Stein had taken. "I am well aware that until
just now," Stein begins the second paragraph of her "Introduction," "it
would have been quite impossible to interest my fellow countrymen in these
words which tell so convincing and moving a story" ("MP," 91). Her next
sentence repeats the locating phrase, "just now." And the third sentence
in this

<B></B>

sequence of temporal coordinates lets us know precisely
that the occasion for Stein's writing this "Introduction"--perhaps its
very day of drafting--is 7 December 1941: "Since the civil war until
to-day, when the action of Japan has made us realize the misery the
grief and the terror of war . . . we did not understand defeat enough to
sympathise with the French people" ("MP," 93). Pearl Harbor has made it
possible for Americans to comprehend the need for a Mar&eacute;chal or
a Washington. The "convincing" and "moving" story this "Introduction"
promises is not so much the speeches themselves; it is the story Stein
tells of a people's need for speeches, though the giver of those speeches
is scarcely visible as anything other than a projection of a wounded
and confused populace. This longing for speeches is a dangerous though
utterly understandable need, and much of what Stein writes over the
course of her long life shows us how and why we should look askance
at anyone who claims that the truth will set us free. Stein's writings
on the Second World War remain disturbing not primarily because of the
political stances one might extract from her supple and elusive prose,
but because they demonstrate the vast distances between the mind in its
unsteady motions and the public, political positions individuals take in
times of calamity. We conduct ourselves, in wartime, under assumed names,
bearing allegiances to abstractions and res on horseback, forcing
the human mind into daily, dishonest compromises. Retribution for these
compromises will come in the as-yet-unwritten histories that gradually
pare lives down until each fits neatly into the contours of a narrative.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the first part of this essay, I discussed the challenges Stein
presents to contemporary scholarship, bent as it is on locating texts in
history and on reading for signs of the author's identity, her sexual
and sociopolitical orientations, her psychological predispositions. In
crucial respects, Stein is philosophically and, as we have just seen,
methodologically at odds with an academy and a larger intellectual culture
that currently desire her recuperation as one of the most important
authors of our century. She is being remembered, in a wide variety of
venues, as someone whose life and work is of enormous consequence. But
the terms of that remembrance are powerfully inflected by hermeneutics
that privilege historicity, by interpretive approaches that work from the
author's psyche (and, particularly in the case of Stein, her sexuality)
to the text. These critical valuations, crucially different from those
Stein herself promoted and practiced, make it difficult for us to discern
accurately or fully the nature of Stein's work. If we are to "locate"
Stein in history, we should keep uppermost in our minds her adamant and
repeated assertions concerning the emptiness of historical categories
of understanding. If we are to assess her manuscripts--and I think it
important that we do so--we should not simply read them for clues or
details from the life. Stein would have those few <I>carnets</I> that
were neither lost nor destroyed travel a route from Alice's hands toward
forgetting. The trajectory would only be forlorn, the attending losses
lamentable to those still snared by human nature's longing for narratives
of intimacy, for stories built around recollection. If we learn to read
with our minds, as moderns who have overcome the tyrannical claims of
memory, everything in the <I>carnets</I> will look more or less the
same, as a landscape appears from

<B></B>

an airplane.
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>
 There
will be no stories then to tell, in this steady-state verbal system,
since we will know how to distribute our attention equally among all
words. What is made will look like what is found. The products of human
labor will be indistinguishable from natural phenomena. Differences
at the level of drafts, if we can even discover them, will scarcely be
worth notice or commentary, just as historical facts will matter less
than states of mind. Textual study, like the writing of history and the
telling of news or the recounting of biographies, will take its properly
subordinate place among other sensual musics. Time will still shape the
songs of dying generations, but it will concern us chiefly, however, as
it measures nothing more--but nothing less--than the regular occurrence
of syllables and silences.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this quiet place, however, we will always search for signs of the
author and her stories, even after we have been urged to do otherwise. The
penultimate paragraph of "Natural Phenomena" exposes the question that
motivates our search:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
What does it mean when all of it has been put there and does not show
that it has been put there has been put there has been put there too
does not any of it show that it has been put there and it has been put
there too has been put there too. ("NP," 233)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To offer any reading of this sentence is to ascribe a particular intent
to communicate to its author and thereby to do a kind of violence to its
deliberate open-endedness, since the question it frames is precisely what
kinds of meaning we can justifiably attach to something if its existence
offers little evidence of agency, no testimony of creative intent, no
sign of having been "put" at all. Can we read it if it is a phenomenon
of nature rather than a product of humankind? Do natural phenomena have
meaning at all, or does that meaning follow only after we have painted
the phenomena in colors provided by the imagination? Interpretation is
the name for the activity by means of which we assure ourselves that
"all of it has been put there." It is the name for our fond hope that
we can leave marks on the world that others will take the trouble
to decipher; that love letters will find recipients and encourage
answers; that at least some of the phenomena we encounter derive from
human consciousnesses rather than the blindly powerful forces that
make hurricanes and earthquakes, tidal waves and the <I>aurora</I>
<I>borealis</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></SUP>
 To interpret is to declare ourselves more
or less at home.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Among the modernists of her generation, Stein is the most ruthless
in her examination of the assumptions that underwrite the related
acts of interpretation and positioning oneself in time. She is the
most skeptical in her scrutiny of the subject's place in the world,
the least inclined to foreclose questions, the most avid to query the
suppositions that allow us to read and write. She builds up the last
paragraph of "Natural Phenomena" as though she can count on nothing,
can take nothing for granted: "After a little while it has been by that
time by that time when by that time and when by that time and when by
that time and choice. I choose you. I choose you too" ("NP," 233). We
know of time's passing partly by the accrual of phrases. The paragraph
contains its own clock for measuring: "by that time" gradually adds
up.

<B></B>

When "that time" has arrived--and we have been prepared by
the opening phrase of the first sentence to know that the moment we await
will come "after a little while"--we discover the noun ("choice") that
names the exercise of will that sets human actions apart from natural
phenomena. And following the nomination of this crucial human enterprise
come two brief sentences built around that noun: "I choose you. I choose
you too." We have already heard Dydo's confident assurance that these
sentences are "undoubtedly an exchange between Stein and Toklas." But
the end of "Natural Phenomena" will not be fit tidily into a domestic
scene. These sentences generate more questions than answers. Is this a
reassuring fragment of a conversation, a sign that we have come happily
home to a place of mutual choosing after struggling through a long and
challenging piece of writing? Or does the "I" designate the same person in
both sentences, which might give to this ending an unsettling, open-ended
twist. These two sentences could be the beginning of a list of choices
by a single, polygamous "I" rather than a tiny story about reciprocated
desire. The corollary question is whether the object of each sentence
stands for the same person (or whether it represents a person at all). We
might also wonder whether the "you" knows it has been chosen. When we
come upon these sentences in the virtual vacuum of this paragraph, we
should spend a good deal of our interpretive energy considering our own
strategies for making narratives from pronouns and verbs.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein gives us very little to take with us, little to remember as we work
through the enormous accumulation of her writing. Drafts don't necessarily
evolve. Characters don't add up to wholes by a novel's end. Events only
sometimes seem to cause or to follow one another. History, insofar as
we can discern it as an object of inquiry, happens somewhere else,
to subjects other than ourselves. Narrative is a trickle that runs
intermittently through Stein's prose; rarely does it make a stream. We
are forced to carry what we know with us as we proceed and to recognize
how small the bundle is that holds our knowledge: "after a little while
it has been by that time." In Stein's parsimonious imagining of the
subject, there is almost nothing about states of mind that can count
itself historical.

I am thinking of the general trend toward materially inflected
historicism, as well as the widespread interest in the subject of
memory--personal and cultural--that obtains in a number of fields in
the humanities and social sciences today. For examples of the kinds of
texts I reference, see Pierre Nora, "Between Memory and History" from
his monumental project aimed at recording French history and its social
spaces of recollection, <I>Les Lieux de M&eacute;moire</I>. His translated
essay explaining the project can be found in <I>Representations</I>,
"Special Issue: Memory and Counter Memory," 26 : 7-25. The

the kind of contemporary historiography to which I refer. See also
Simon Schama, <I>Landscape and Memory</I> (New York: Alfred A. Knopf,
1995) for another instance of a contemporary effort at recovery that
is simultaneously deeply aware of (and eloquent about) its limitations
as well as extraordinarily ambitious in the extent of its retellings of
the past.

of Stein's politics (insofar as she entertained explicit, articulated
political views), though it is by no means flattering, strikes me as
closer to the mark than much of the later, vastly inflated estimations of
Stein as a politically engaged writer: "She lacked a global imagination,
and it was this provinciality that laid her vulnerable to charges of
callousness and stupidity . . . She remained invincibly local, so that
her emotion was reserved for those whose immediate existence possessed
reality for her" . For another, more recent, informed biographical

Bridgman writes that "In 'Natural Phenomena' she took up the argument
of 'Composition As Explanation' again, reiterating that 'everybody always
is the same.' The only difference consists not in their appearance,
but in the world they see--'what they look at not what they look like"'

From the eight <I>carnets</I> and the twenty-eight sections contained

sequentially in the final text. These six instances involve a total
of thirteen sections. Five are cases where Stein uses two sections
contiguously; the sixth consists of a string of three sections. For an
example of the scattered distribution of <I>carnet</I> sections, see page
191 of the published "Phenomena of Nature": the contiguous paragraphs
beginning "What is the difference" and "Only only very nearly" and "He
knew how to look at a lake" follow each other in <I>carnet</I> 1721,
though the first is separated from the second two paragraphs in that

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
You should be reading this with something in your hands besides a
journal. And something, really, besides a pencil or pen. Something like
an empty glass, a rubber band, a paper clip that you can rub between
your fingers, that you can twist and bend back and forth. For the idea
is to wonder whether--while concerning ourselves with one or another
crisis of the subject--we haven't also been in the midst of an effort to
think about the object, if not indeed to liberate material objects. The
comic version of this effort would resemble a scene from the <I>Mork and
Mindy</I> show: when asked what could have happened to all the sponges
in the kitchen, the alien (Robin Williams) proudly announces, "I took
them to the river and set them free."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A somewhat more serious version can be found in the work of Jean
Baudrillard, who denounces the way that the object, because it is
considered "only the alienated, accursed part of the subject," has
been rendered unintelligible, "shamed, obscene, passive." Undoing the
privilege of the subject is not for him a matter of attending to the
subject's fraught, fragile, and divisive constitution. It is a matter
of imagining how the "destiny of the subject passes into the object,"
of naming the object "sovereign," of celebrating the crystal's revenge,
indeed "crystal revenge."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 And yet, of course, the luminous transparency of the crystalline object,
 its auratic singularity, can only impoverish other objects, material
 objects, or material understood as itself an object--not shimmering,
 exquisite crystal, let us say, but glass that is nothing but glass. Is
 it not the very splendor of the object that allows objects to disappear
 so readily
 
 


 in Baudrillard's subsequent work, evaporating into one or
 another version of the hyperreal?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No less than the tradition he writes against, Baudrillard seems to suffer
from what Theodor Adorno called the familiar "allergies to entity," a
chief symptom of which is the failure to recognize that there can be no
"primeval history of the object," only a history "dealing with specific
objects." The passage into materialism, as Adorno came to describe it,
requires acknowledging "things" outside the subject/object trajectory,
which means thinking sensation in its distinction from cognition. For
the "dignity of physicality" is indissoluble in, and not exhausted by,
the subject/object relation, epistemologically or phenomenologically
understood.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Still, if "things" are indeed not exhausted by that relation, it is
 only in the subject/object nexus where they occur, or where they can be
 <I>narrated</I> as the <I>effect</I> (not the ground) of an interaction
 at once physical and psychological, at once intimate and alienating. To
 the degree that the "thing" registers the undignified mutability of
 objects, and thus the excess of the object (a capacity to be other
 than it is), the "thing" names a mutual mediation (and a slide between
 objective and subjective predication) that appears as the vivacity of
 the object's difference from itself. What happens, should we drop the
 crystal, should it shatter, and should we glance at the bits of glass
 that, though they are nothing but glass, captivate our attention? What
 happens when we deauraticize <I>the</I> object (that is identifiable
 only within a fundamentally static structure) and begin again with the
 vertiginous banality of things--with some sense of the curious thingness
 of those objects we incessantly if unconsciously touch, the objects we
 see without ever looking? What if we looked?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact, "things" seem to have achieved a new discursive visibility. From
the disciplines of anthropology and history, as from the interdiscipline
of "material culture studies," important anthologies summon us to
attend to things: <I>The Social Life of Things</I> , <I>Material
Cultures: Why Some Things Matter</I> , <I>History from Things</I>
, <I>The Sex of Things</I> . These volumes assume the task of
denaturalizing consumer practices, of tracing (both within and between
cultures) the <I>work</I> of exchange and consumption: the way economic
value is created in specific social formations, the way cultural values
become objectified in specific material forms, the way that people shape,
code, and recode the material object world, the way they make things
meaningful and valuable. Just as such analysis exposes the politics that
underwrite our most daily acts of exchange, as Arjun Appadurai would have
it, so too, in Victoria de Grazia's words, this type of analysis "responds
to the imperative to know about material needs, wants, and desires."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But is it <I>things</I> that these volumes constitute as the object of
their address? For the degree to which the essays trace generalizable
circuits of exchange and consumption is the degree to which they can
address <I>no thing at all,</I> but only objects, if you will allow me
to pursue my axiomatic distinction. The sort of objectification that
takes place during those operations that produce use value, sign value,
cultural capital will never produce a thing. Producing a thing--effecting
thingness--depends, instead, on a fetishistic overvaluation or
misappropriation, on an irregular if not

<B></B>


 unreasonable reobjectification
of the object that dislodges it from the circuits through which it is
what it typically is. Thingness is precipitated as a kind of misuse
value. By <I>misuse value</I> I mean to name the aspects of an
object--sensuous, aesthetic, semiotic--that become legible, audible,
palpable when the object is experienced in whatever time it takes (in
whatever time it is) for an object to become another.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This distinction brings a kind of instability into focus wherein the
thing becomes manifest between multiple objectifications. Within the
shimmering splinters of glass, glass can become something else. Or,
to offer another narrative example (of what can be exemplified only
syntactically, only in time): in the process of using a knife as a
screwdriver, of dislocating it from one routinized objectification and
deploying it otherwise, we have the chance (if just a chance) to sense
its presence (its thinness . . . its sharpness and flatness . . . the
peculiarity of its scalloped handle, slightly loose . . . its knifeness
and what exceeds that knifeness) as though for the first time. For the
first time, perhaps, we thus also sense the norms by which we customarily
deploy both knife and screwdriver. My concern, then, is not to unveil
the meaning of things in their proper thingness, nor to describe the
fate of pure objects abstracted from their use, and neither is it to
privilege the thing (<I>das Ding</I>) over things (<I>die Sachen</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 For the life of things made manifest in the time of misuse is, should we
 look, a secret in plain sight--not a life behind or beneath the object
 but a life that is its fluctuating shape and substance and surface, a
 life that the subject must catalyze but cannot contain.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My title, "the secret life of things," no doubt brings to mind a line
from William Wordsworth or Percy Shelley, or one of E. T. A. Hoffmann's
uncanny tales, or one of several surrealist images--if not Tristan Tzara's
"the knives are on their feet," then perhaps Louis Aragon's "bunch of keys
[humming] to themselves jingling a song of the good old days."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Though such animation is not my concern in the following pages, I will
 in fact be preoccupied by the 1920s, the decade when things emerge
 as the object of profound theoretical engagement in the work of Georg
 Luk&aacute;cs, Heidegger, and Walter Benjamin, and which is the decade
 after objects and things are newly engaged by (or <I>as</I>) the work
 of art for Pound, Marcel Duchamp, Williams, Gertrude Stein.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The record of Virginia Woolf's engagement with the relation between
objects and things appears in a very short story she titled "Solid
Objects." It is in fact a story not about solidity, but about the fluidity
of objects, about how they decompose and recompose themselves as the
object of a new fascination. It is about the materials that make up the
material object world, about the transvaluation of those materials into
less and more than their familiar properties. It is about dislocating
material--nothing but glass--from an instrumentalist teleology and into
an aesthetic scene, though not one authorized by the dictates of Pierre
Bourdieu's Distinction or Baudrillard's System of Objects, but content
instead with intensely private, inconspicuous display.
<B></B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf began to write the story in November 1918, at the close of World War
I, and she published it in <I>Athenaeum</I> in 1920. The story concerns
a man named John
who, discovering a smooth lump of glass on the beach, brings it home and
places it on the mantle, using it as a paperweight. The discovery incites
him to seek out other objects that remind "him of the lump of glass,"
anything "so long it [is] an object of some kind, more or less round
. . . anything--china, glass, amber, rock, marble," the paradigmatic shape
and size in fact bringing the specificity of the material into question.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 At first studying the objects displayed in the windows of curiosity
 shops, he becomes increasingly obsessed and finally roams London with "a
 bag and a long stick," ransacking "all deposits of earth," searching "all
 alleys and spaces between walls," in his search for discarded objects
 that might become for him "specimens" (<I>HH,</I> 85). As he discovers
 other remnants--pieces of broken china, a bit of iron--his collecting
 impulse becomes, from his friends' perspective, pathological. Before
 long he abandons the life he has led as a politician on "the brink of a
 brilliant career," a man standing for Parliament (<I>HH,</I> 82). Indeed,
 in most respects he abandons his life, "devot[ing] himself more and
 more resolutely to the search," suffering "fatigue and derision," but
 still "consumed by [the] ambition" to add to his little collection
 (<I>HH,</I> 85).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The story has hardly fascinated Woolf's readers, who have been far more
captivated by the life of the subject, the fate of individuality, and
the vicissitudes of consciousness in her fiction. A small, critical
consensus, however, reads "Solid Objects" as a cautionary tale warning
against aesthetic absorption at the expense of the practical, the ethical,
the political.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Woolf, let us say, managed not to succumb to what Clive Bell disparaged
 as his contemporaries' "metaphysical-moral doctrines concerning the
 cowiness of cows and the thing in itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 But her own boredom with politics-as-usual, what she called her "natural
 disposition to think Parliament ridiculous," would suggest that the
 moral of the story might not be read so unequivocally.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 She herself stopped accompanying her husband Leonard on his political
 campaigns in 1919. At the end of the war, she wrote of the war that
 "the whole thing [was] too remote and meaningless to come home to one
 either in action or in ceasing to act" (<I>D,</I> 215). She also was
 eager to eschew conversation about the "bitter, impatient, powerful"
 lower classes (<I>D,</I> 220). Such comments suggest that one might say
 of the story what Bell said of art more generally, that "no one could
 be much worse placed than the political moralist for seeing whatever
 there may be to be seen in what is, at once, strange and subtle."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What is strange and subtle in Woolf's story, however, is the way it
bears witness, however unconsciously, to the political economy of Great
Britain during and immediately after World War I. In other words, I want
to point out how John's encounter with these material fragments--a piece
of glass, of broken china, and of iron--is not just embedded within
a trajectory of English aesthetics (John Ruskin to Roger Fry) or a
genealogy of modernism (say T. E. Hulme's "poetics of sensual immediacy
and fragmentary vision"), but also embedded between the domestic crisis
of wartime 
<B></B>
scarcity in London and the postwar industrial crisis provoked
by the British commitment to free trade.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Though the fragments may thus be thought of as souvenirs of
the unreal city, their very collection erases that context from the
narrative as such.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 But elsewhere, Woolf makes it clear how the war impinged on the material
 practice of art. She writes to Vanessa Bell about the problem of securing
 her paint, "the difficulty about paints is that they're made with oil,
 'Now you may not know [a merchant has explained to Woolf] that every
 gun when it's first cast has to be dipped in a bath of oil.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 She records in her diary the physical threat to art posed by the raids
 on London, "The Academy is storing its precious pictures, only 18 in
 number, in some Tube. They are told to expect immense bombs at the
 end of the month, which will dig 20 feet deep, &amp; then explode"
 (<I>D,</I> 138). Yet "Solid Objects," without ever invoking the war,
 provides instead an account of the aesthetic--or an account of what
 we might call the relation between aesthetics and politics, between
 art and the economy--that is a history of the senses fundamentally
 altered by the facts of wartime scarcity and postwar depression. One
 might argue that the story's displacement of the psychological with
 the <I>materiological</I> is Woolf's uncharacteristic exploration
 of the antihumanist modernism advanced by Hulme. But her capacity to
 narrate a new subject/object dynamic seems catalyzed instead by the
 transgression of economic habits, both domestic and international--in
 a word, by the western world's misuse of material for martial ends, by
 the transposition of material into <I>mat&eacute;riel.</I>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As literary criticism wrestles itself out of the homogenizing habits of
new historicism and the heterogenizing habits of cultural studies, one
version of a new materialism asks how material culture impresses itself
on the literary imagination. Another asks how literature itself works to
imagine materiality; how it renders a life of things that is tangential to
our narratives of modern production, distribution, and consumption; how
it can contribute to a materialist phenomenology that does not bracket
history, but asks both <I>how,</I> in history (how, in one cultural
formation), human subjects and material objects constitute one another,
and <I>what</I> remains outside the regularities of that constitution
that can disrupt the cultural memory of modernity and modernism. If
Simmel was right to argue, circa 1900, that the increased access to
things that characterizes modernity results in the loss of the thingness
of things, then we should recognize how various aesthetic practices work
to compensate for that loss. Indeed, it would be perfectly reasonable to
account for the recent academic attention to objects (not to say things)
as a reaction against the declaration of--if not some compensatory
response to the fact of--the further disappearance of the object within
an increasingly mediated (indeed digitally mediated) universe.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's story might thus be read as moralizing against such materialist
fascinations, if it does not rather, as I'll suggest, investigate a
different kind of fascination, indeed a kind of fetishism that seems like
an alternative mode of inhabiting modern culture. By consecrating the
valueless material object, such fetishism confounds political economy's
account of value, alienates itself from any enlightenment horror of waste,
and settles happily into an unhuman (not antihumanist) history. "Solid
<B></B>
Objects" manages to revise the question of the object and the question
of things while clarifying the risk of that revision, which is always
a risk to what Woolf's story
narrates as the aesthetic subject. "One day," the narrator explains,
"starting from his rooms in the Temple to catch a train in order to
address his constituents, his eyes rested upon a remarkable object
lying half-hidden in one of those borders of grass which edge the bases
of vast legal buildings. . . . [He] drew the piece of [broken] china
within reach of his hands. As he seized hold of it he exclaimed in
triumph," missing his train (<I>HH,</I> 82-3). Such exhilaration,
staged in relation to the emblems of modernity (the train, the legal
buildings, parliamentary democracy, the commuter temporality) is
irreducible to consumer desire or the structure of cathexis described
by psychoanalysis; it instead testifies to the enigmatic excess that
characterizes the physical world, especially its bits and pieces, the
discarded remains of modern objects. Insofar as the aestheticization
of this refuse leaves John in a condition of social sclerosis, however,
"aesthetic autonomy" manifests itself here not as the object's distance
from consumer culture but as the utter isolation of the individual (the
aesthetic subject). Some other reading of the story might indeed argue
that John's obsession with inorganic objects is in fact inseparable from
what Freud described, in his own postwar text, as the drive toward the
inorganic that is the drive toward death.

Let me turn now to a clarifying disjuncture in William James's
psychology--clarifying because it temporalizes, <I>narrating</I>
the interaction between the somatic and the cognitive--to offer some
handle on the object/thing distinction. Working within and against
the associationist tradition, James points out, in his chapter on the
perception of space, how the coalescence of our sensations in and as a
thing depends on habit. This means that we grant to objects that we merely
see their full physicality because we are accustomed to doing so. Real
form, what Edmund Husserl would come to call the inauthentic image as
opposed to the authentic image we actually see, is <I>habitually</I>
conjured up. In his somewhat prescient understanding of mind as matter
(with which he works to refine the Humean position), James argues that
habitual objects "plough deep grooves in the nervous system," so that
there is a path of least resistance through which, for instance, our
sensations of grayness and thinness and length become the apperception
of a knife.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his chapter on the "perception of things," however, he tells the story
of what happens when our habits are broken, when for instance we look at
a landscape with our head upside down or when we turn a painting bottom
upward: "the colors grow richer and more varied, we don't understand the
meaning of the painting, but, to compensate for the loss, we feel more
freshly the value of the mere tints and shadings" (<I>P,</I> 727). James
understands perception and "naked sensation" as different cerebral
conditions that cannot take place at the same time, since sensations in
themselves do not add up (<I>P,</I> 727). One might say, rather, that we
need to understand two 
<B></B>
distinct, dynamic, intertwined materializations:
one where we seem to begin with sensations, which precipitate perception;
and one where the proximate sensuous
engagement lies between one and another perceptual horizon. The viewer's
perceptual "failure" (as in the case of nonrative painting)
prompts a different kind of attention; but, in the routine of daily
life, perception perpetually forecloses sensuous experience in order
to render the material world phenomenal, which means rendering it
inhabitable. What I want to underscore is how in James the difference
between the apperceptive constitution of the thing, in what I would call
its <I>objecthood,</I> and the experience of the thing, in what I would
call its <I>thinghood,</I> emerges in the moment (and no doubt only as
a moment) of reobjectification that is a kind of misuse--turning the
picture bottom up, standing on one's head. The point may be less that
"sensation is one thing and perception another," and more that the
experience of sensation depends on disorientation, both habit and its
disruption (<I>P,</I> 727).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the case of Woolf's story, the point is not that the familiar object
has been defamiliarized into unreconstituted fragments (which is to
say discrete, fragmented sensations), but rather that literal fragments
become objects without any of the coherence or familiarity we associate
with objects. Peripatetic though he is, John resembles less modernity's
fl&acirc;neur than the bricoleur, "speak[ing] not only <I>with</I> things
. . . but also through the medium of things," reordering debris the way
a kaleidoscope, to borrow L&eacute;vi-Strauss's re, transforms bits
of glass into a "new type of entity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
But if John perceives new structural patterns, along the way he manages
to experience texture and shape in such a way that materials themselves,
unchannelled through the habitual object, become the objects of his
fantasy. Familiar materials--glass, china, iron--are debanalized,
appearing all but magical: "it was impossible to say whether it had been
bottle, tumbler, or window-pane; it was nothing but glass; it was almost
a precious stone" (<I>HH,</I> 80). Not objects, but materials--"nothing
but glass"--have been released from any readiness-to-hand. Free from their
incorporation into the familiar object world, they seem to assume lives of
their own as John grants them a kind of agency. The piece of broken china
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
looked like a creature from another world--freakish and fantastic as
a harlequin. It seemed to be pirouetting through space, winking like
a fitful star. The contrast between the china so vivid and alert, and
the glass so mute and contemplative, fascinated him, and wondering and
amazed he asked himself how the two came to exist in the same world,
let alone to stand upon the same narrow strip of marble in the same
room. The question remained unanswered. [<I>HH,</I> 83]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By not answering the question, both John and the narratorial voice grant
the materials their sovereignty, but they do so not, as Baudrillard
would have it, from a state of abjection, but in a state of wonder.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's story might thus be located within a continuum of modernist
attention to materials, from, say, Otto Wagner's 1895 vision of a
future architecture dominated by "the prominent use of materials in
a pure state," to F. T. Marinetti's futurist cult of metals and Ernst
J&uuml;nger's "poems of steel," to Donald Judd's 1965 description of the
<B></B>
"aggressive" specificity of materials and the "objectivity" that inheres
in the "obdurate identity of a material."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 In closer proximity to Woolf, her friend Roger Fry, in
the manner of Ruskin, repeatedly argued on behalf of the aesthetic
importance of compositional substance, singling out the fate of china. He
objected to Wedgwood (by now the preferred cornerstone in accounts
of eighteenth-century consumer society) because it set "a standard of
mechanical perfection which to this day prevents the trade from accepting
any work in which the natural beauties of the material are not carefully
obliterated by mechanical means."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Whereas Fry's answer to the problem was replacing mechanical production
 with craftsmanship, "Solid Objects" answers the problem of mechanical
 perfection by introducing the imperfection wrought by accident--by
 engaging the shard. At times, Woolf clearly shares Fry's fundamental
 aesthetic judgment. In <I>Orlando,</I> the men of genius Orlando
 accompanies in the eighteenth century (Joseph Addison, Alexander Pope,
 Jonathan Swift) collect "little bits of coloured glass," demonstrating
 a kind of restrained appreciation for material that stands in contrast
 to the monumental accumulation of Victorian clutter--"crystal palaces,
 bassinettes, military helmets, memorial wreaths . . . telescopes, extinct
 monsters, globes, maps, elephants, and mathematical instruments"--a
 rubbish heap of Victorian history, a pile of "heterogeneous, ill-sorted
 objects" perceived by Orlando as a "garish erection."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 "Solid Objects," however, suggests that the residues of such clutter,
 the object decomposed into little bits, as it were, can still compel
 us in their rudimentary substantiality, conveying both the natural and
 unnatural beauties of material.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Writing in <I>Athenaeum</I> the year before Woolf's story appeared there,
Fry laments the fate of materials within the Victorian object. Describing
the inappropriate use of material to fashion all the Victorian
<I>objets</I> that "gratify fatuous curiosity," and appeal to "social
emotions" rather than "aesthetic feelings," he concludes that "the use
of material at this period seems to be the least discriminating, and the
sense of quality feebler, than at any previous period of world history."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The familiar Bloomsbury dismissal of Victoriana here achieves a
 materialist specificity inherited from the likes of William Morris,
 but Fry stops short of wondering what might in fact be learned about
 "social emotions" from the ill-suited use of materials. His role as
 artist and art critic no doubt prevented his taking an interest in the
 kind of disjuncture between material and form that captivated Benjamin
 as a legible sign of utopian longing. With a logic learned from <I>The
 Eighteenth Brumaire,</I> Benjamin imagines that the decorative use
 of iron, rather than its structural deployment, marks the way novelty
 first emerges in and depends on residual form, which is the way social
 dissatisfaction with the present expresses itself in a citational
 longing for the future, a longing that cites a past that is anterior
 to the recent past: "These tendencies direct the visual imagination,
 which has been activated by the new, back to the primeval past."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Whereas Ruskin believed the "constant use of cast-iron ornaments"
 marked the "degradation of our national feeling," Benjamin read it
 retrospectively as marking an otherwise unexpressed desire to abandon
 a degraded present.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
<B></B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If for Benjamin the point of considering such disjuncture is to imagine
how a collective unconscious "thinks" forward by thinking back to a
classless society, for Woolf
the point is more the way attention to the substance of iron, for
instance, can provide access to a "primeval history" that is no longer
anthropocentric. The story begins to answer the question of how we could
bring materials into history as something other than the history of their
use, in industry or art. When John, perpetually scouring the crannies of
London in his quest to add to his collection, finds a piece of iron under
a furze bush in Barnes Common, his sense of time becomes cosmological:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It was almost identical with the glass in shape, massy and globular, but
so cold and heavy, so black and metallic, that it was evidently alien to
the earth and had its origin in one of the dead stars or was itself the
cinder of the moon. It weighed his pocket down; it weighed the mantelpiece
down; it radiated cold. And yet the meteorite stood upon the same ledge
with the lump of glass and the star-shaped china. [<I>HH,</I> 84-5]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The passage is mobilized by a dialectic of proximity and distance,
familiarity and alterity, that is at once spatial and temporal. The
utterly ordinary, which is also otherworldly, can be pocketed and
domestically displayed without ever being domesticated. Woolf records
not only what it would feel like to desire material per se as a personal
possession, but also how such a possession might change the scale of
one's historical imagination, how the cosmological might insinuate
itself into the daily. To name the scrap of modern iron a "meteorite"
is to dislodge it from the homogeneous structure of time, and to say
not that the distant past lingers within the present, but to insist
that this past is present as a kind of surface with which we can make
intimate contact, as though touching one history in and as another.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 If the story's temporality seems somewhat abstract or confused--"Day
 after day passed. He was no longer young" (<I>HH,</I> 85)--this is
 because John's archeology of the modern, his engagement with material as
 an end (not a means), has dislodged him from the temporal dictates of
 modern life. The <I>vie priv&eacute;e</I> of things becomes something
 other than the history of the object's production and exchange, and
 something other than its representation in, or transformation into,
 the work of art.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With James's help, we can redescribe the modernity that Simmel
renders--where the ability to dominate things is coupled with the
inability to establish contact with things--as the intensification
of a basic perceptual process, or as a perceptual process that
has become a social logic. In the 1920s this sociopsychological,
sociosensual problematic achieved its full theorization. On the one
hand, Luk&aacute;cs asserts that reification "conceals above all the
immediate--qualitative and material--character of things as things." On
the other, Heidegger, without ever specifying Luk&aacute;cs, complains
that such arguments always fail to describe for us what "we are to
understand <I>positively</I> when we think of unreified <I>Being.</I>"
And Benjamin, in a much-quoted passage
<B></B>
 from <I>One Way Street</I>
(providing a non-Heideggerian response to such a complaint) describes
how children's engagement with the material world reveals the
capacity to transform things, bits of cultural detritus, into new
things--a kind of recycling that never replicates the world as it is,
but rather reminds us, in the mode of spontaneous collage, that things
might be other than they are.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Any object," Woolf writes, "mixes itself so profoundly with the
stuff of thought that it loses its actual form and recomposes itself a
little differently in an ideal shape which haunts the brain" (<I>HH,</I>
82). This activity of recomposition, which moves John's encounter from the
sensuous and material to the phenomenal and the psychological, returns
to the material by granting him a different mode of engagement with the
city. That is, just as John mediates the transformation of the lump of
glass into a "precious gem," so too the glass transforms his relation to
urban space. It provokes him to walk through London with "his eyes upon
the ground," especially attracted to the alleys where "such objects often
occurred"--"thrown away, of no use to anybody, shapeless, discarded"
(<I>HH,</I> 82). To say that objects <I>occur</I> is to suggest that
objects have a temporality; they don't happen to be there so much as
they happen. And the way that they happen distorts John's pedestrian
quest to match the shape of the smooth lump of glass; instead, he seems
propelled only by a new responsiveness to form as such. The broken
piece of china "as nearly resembl[es] a starfish as anything--shaped,
or broken accidentally, into five irregular but unmistakable points"
(<I>HH,</I> 83). His new optical, tactile consciousness does not permit
him to leave a curious object behind; he misses a meeting in order
to secure the shard. John may exhibit the typical passions of the new
collector, but one can't quite say just what it is that he collects. And
he makes no effort to express himself in his exhibition; rather, the
lives of these things--the glass contemplative, the china vivid, fitful,
surreal--overwhelm his life.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his essay on surrealism, Benjamin confidently proclaims that the poet
too perceives the immense force, the revolutionary energy, that resides
within discarded artifacts, those "enslaved and enslaving objects." But
in the more telegraphic "Traumkitsch," where he imagines a history of
dreams, the unconscious seems severely limited; the dreams of today, he
writes, are a "short cut to the banal," in our dreams "there is a gray
layer of dust on things," and in dreams we touch objects "precisely where
they are most worn," where they are "eroded by habit." The dreamwork
fails to recapacitate us as children, who never (according to habit)
"take hold of a glass but [instead] reach right in."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 It is a kind of misapprehension, an untoward reobjectification, a kind
 of misuse that clears the dust away.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was with the "impulse of a child," Woolf writes, that John slipped
the lump of glass inside his pocket "promising it a life of warmth
and security" (<I>HH,</I> 81). When on the beach, and having left off
a political argument with his friend Charles ("Politics be damned!"),
John distracts himself by "burrow[ing] his fingers down, down into the
sand," his eyes becoming "clear transparent surface[s] . . . expressing
nothing but wonder, which the eyes of young children display" (<I>HH,</I>
80). Such rhetorical recourse to the child, rative or literal, also
helps Roger Fry in his essay on "The Artist's Vision" to taxonomize the
"economy" of the senses, as he called it, 
<B></B>
and above all to differentiate
between looking and mere seeing. Though it is children who genuinely
"look at things with some passion," the adult retains "something of
this unbiological, disinterested vision," the testimony to which he
finds in those collections of objects (like John's) that are otherwise
unremarkable but "which have some marked peculiarity of appearance that
catches his eye."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 This essay, also published in <I>Athenaeum</I> in 1919, provides the
 simplest theorization of what Woolf is up to in her story. It is as
 though Fry has translated James's psychological point (which originally
 stumbled onto the aesthetic, onto questions of landscape and painting)
 and transformed it into a point about the aesthetic and nonaesthetic
 subject. "We were given our eyes to see things, not to look at them,"
 a fact that he takes to be a biological necessity since the "very
 considerable ignorance of visual appearances" becomes a practical matter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 When Woolf writes about "The Cinema," which, according to the
 surrealists, disclosed in the photogenic object the fact that things
 have lives of their own, she describes its ability to provide audiences
 with a new field of sensation. She reiterates Fry's point, but she also
 nationalizes it, describing "the English unaesthetic eye" as "a simple
 mechanism which takes care that the body does not fall down coal-holes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the unhabituated child perpetually appears in contrast as the
engaged aesthetic subject (although Benjamin calls attention not to a
disinterested appreciation of the material world, but to an interested,
spontaneous reconration of that world), this is not a reinstallation
of the Wordsworthian subject, for whom nature and not the detritus of
culture exists as the fully engaging aesthetic object. Still, Woolf's
story, because the child appears only as a vehicle for describing John's
reactions, poses a complex of inescapable questions. Is John's response
childlike in the profundity of its willingness to see and to feel the
material world anew or is his behavior a lamentable, childish retreat? Is
this an inspired act of transgression or simply a regression? Is this
a regrettable withdrawal from politics or the recognition that politics
need to begin elsewhere, with some experience of the profound otherness
of the everyday?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The story's ambiguity has everything to do with the proximity or
specularity of, on the one hand, the life of things, and, on the other,
commodity culture as usual. For John is in what would be recognizable as
the throes of consumer desire--"the determination to possess objects that
even surpassed these tormented the young man"--were it to have appeared in
Emile Zola's <I>Au bonheur des dames</I> or Theodore Dreiser's <I>Sister
Carrie</I> (<I>HH,</I> 85). His desire anticipates a later moment in
the history of bourgeois consumerism where consumption and collection
seem increasingly conflated. Any newly purchased object, not just the
Hummel rine but also the bottle cap and the Beanie Baby, can be
declared by the manufacturer to be <I>collectible.</I> If, writing of
the early nineteenth-century interior, Benjamin could imagine that the
collector's responsibility was "the Sisyphean task of obliterating the
commodity-like characters of things," and of freeing things from "the
drudgery of being useful," in the late twentieth century the preservation
from this drudgery has been the means of increasing consumer desire.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So too, of course, the secret life of things--whether it is the
fitfulness of a piece of broken china, or knives standing on their
feet, or sponges swimming free at last on the river--might be declared
a literalization of our alienation as Simmel described it, where, "by
their independent, impersonal mobility," objects "complete the final
stage of their separation from people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 And yet, it is precisely by giving into--thinking or working
 through--reification and alienation, and by identifying a profounder
 separation (not of objects but of things), that Adorno came to
 re-identify ethical possibility: "If a man looks upon thingness
 as a radical evil . . . he tends to be hostile to otherness, to
 the alien thing that has lent its name to alienation, and not in
 vain" (<I>ND,</I> 191). For Simmel, the problem of modernity can be
 characterized by the fact that "objects and people have become separated
 from one another," that objects can no longer be "assimilated by the
 individual" (<I>PM,</I> 460). For Adorno, the problem has become the
 very will-to-assimilation. He designates the happiness of philosophy,
 over and against the "imperialism of annexing the alien," as residing "in
 the fact that the alien, in the proximity it is granted, remains what is
 distant and different" (<I>ND,</I> 191). Were we to grant "Solid Objects"
 a place between Simmel's sociology and Adorno's philosophy, we would read
 it as a narrative of things accumulated but not arranged, intimate but
 unassimilated, "extimate" in their simultaneous proximity and distance,
 accreted as vivacious fragments that belong to no whole. The ethics
 of the story thus reside in Woolf's depiction of an experience--of
 experience--that activates for the fragment a life of its own.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
* * *

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though "Solid Objects" narratively and, thus, ambivalently engages topics
conceptualized elsewhere, Woolf's diary during these years hardly records
any consistent concern for material objects. We read other diarists,
after all, to hear about things. She writes about reading and thinking
and talking and writing. Just as, in <I>Orlando,</I> the young nobleman's
"disease of reading" can temporarily turn all his riches--"carpets,
sofas, trappings, china, plate, cruets, chafing dishes and other movables
often of beaten gold"--into mist, so too in Woolf's own daily record, her
reading and writing tend to obscure any encounter with the physical world
(<I>O,</I> 75, 74). If she writes about objects, she tends to write about
them as signs, in the effort to determine how possessions characterize
those who possess them: "art lamps and iridescent plates," for instance,
seem to demonstrate the gentility of one "farmer husband" (<I>D,</I> 248).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In her stories, however, material objects seem a condition of
narratability. "Moments of Being" records the thoughts of a woman
in search of a lost pin, the finding of which puts a stop to the
story. "The New Dress" records the way social anxiety is most keenly
mediated by material possessions. The point of "The Lady in the Looking
Glass" is that possessions that apparently reveal a life in fact keep
it concealed from view. An extraordinary dangling modifier in the story
suddenly shifts the burden from the unnamed narrator to the possessions
themselves, as though they 
<B></B>
spent their time contemplating the woman who
possesses them: "Under the stress of thinking about Isabella, her room
became more shadowy and symbolic; the corners seemed darker, the legs
of chairs and tables more spindly and hieroglyphic."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 It is as though the object world, by concerning itself with human
 subjects, becomes both more and less legible, clearly significant but
 indecipherable.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though the novels never think through artifacts so exclusively, they
continue to foreground the way objects mediate human relations, including
the self's relation to itself. Orlando's past returns to her in the
twentieth century through her former possessions, housed in a museum. In
<I>Night and Day,</I> when Mrs. Hilbery exclaims "Dear things! Dear
chairs and tables! How like old friends they are," the dearness resides
in the family history that the objects express, in the objects' august
legibility, a result of the fact that "We live in things," as Mrs. Swithin
explains to the man who "fingers sensations," in <I>Between the Acts.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Those novels construct a universe where, as Benjamin would have it,
 interiors are legible in traces left by their occupants, and where
 collected objects contain for the collector elaborate narratives of
 their collection. In Woolf's version of the argument, within our houses,
 within our rooms, we are "surrounded by objects which perpetually express
 the oddity of our own temperaments and enforce the memories of our own
 experience." Thus a whole morning spent in Italy, the iron table and the
 breeze and the vines and the pillars, "rise up in a cloud from the china
 bowl on the mantelpiece," a bowl purchased during an Italian holiday.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the fragments collected in "Solid Objects"--which, the more one
reads Woolf, seems itself to be an unrepresentative fragment--have only a
fantasized and fantastic provenance: perhaps the lump of glass is a gem
"worn by a dark Princess," or perhaps it is from an Elizabethan treasure
chest (<I>HH,</I> 80-1). The fragments express the oddity of someone
else's temperament: John imagines that the shape of the china shard
depends on the "conjunction [of] a very high house, and a woman of such
reckless impulse and passionate prejudice that she flings her jar or pot
straight from the window without thought of who is below" (<I>HH,</I>
84). As compellingly as this scene may describe a woman's frustration
with the objects that materialize her domestic confinement, the scene
results from John's mere conjecture. In other words, the difference that
"Solid Objects" insists on is a difference that comes from dislodging
objects from a history of their proximity to subjects, from liberating
artifacts out of their status as determinate signs, from rendering a
life of things that is irreducible to the history of human subjects.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet the pathos of <I>Jacob's Room,</I> among other novels, depends
precisely on that reduction, on the symbolic and metonymic power of
objects. The novel displays the evanescence of the protagonist's life
as a relation to the material object world. Woolf's poetics of space is
in fact a poetics of the object. We first read about the boy climbing
on rock, "one of those tremendously solid brown, or rather black,
rocks which emerge from the sand like something primitive," and then
about him lost at the beach and "sobbing, but absent-mindedly" running
"farther and farther" to discover
<B></B>
 just what it is that he has glimpsed
"among the black sticks and straw."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Despite his family's insistence, he refuses to give up the sheep's
 skull, whitened by water and
wind; he sleeps with it at the foot of the bed. The boy's attachment to
the natural object that most readily suggests permanence, rock, becomes
instead an attachment to bone, the quintessential memento mori that
expresses the proximity between the animate and inanimate.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A child's fascination with the natural world--children collecting
beetles and butterflies in chapter two--devolves into more mundane
arrangements, such as Jacob's room at Cambridge, with its "round table
and two low chairs," with "yellow flags in a jar on the mantelpiece"
(<I>JR,</I> 38). The novel gradually taxonomizes the adult fascination
with objects. Consumer desire keeps Fanny captivated by "Evelina's shop
off Shaftsbury Avenue" where "the parts of a woman were shown separate,"
skirts and boas and hats and shoes displayed without the logic of the
ensemble (<I>JR,</I> 121). Indian philosophy prompts Jinny Carslake
to cherish "a little jeweler's box containing ordinary pebbles picked
off the road. But if you look at them steadily, she says, multiplicity
becomes unity" (<I>JR,</I> 131). A recognizably Romantic sensibility
compels Jacob himself to cherish the Acropolis. In the midst of these
competing modes of cathexis, the narrator offers a fully thematizing,
ambiguating account of the relation between things of the world (actions)
and things in the world (mere things) as Jacob begins to think seriously
about his future, about going into Parliament, perhaps, about the question
of the British Empire, the question of Home Rule in Ireland: "For he had
grown to be a man, and was about to be immersed in things--as indeed
the chambermaid, emptying his basin upstairs, fingering keys, studs,
pencils, and bottles of tabloids strewn on the dressing-table, was aware"
(<I>JR,</I> 139). Once immersed in mere things, Jacob is about to immerse
himself in things, as his new possessions testify. He is cut off from
aspiring to the political life and the sense of political economy that
John willfully abandons in "Solid Objects." The concluding tableau of
the novel, then, evolves less from the idea of absence (Jacob's death in
the war), and more from a lingering presence, all the unburied remains,
those possessions no longer possessed. A room lived in and permanently
left is not haunted, but uncanny: "One fibre in the wicker arm-chair
creaks, though no one sits there" (<I>JR,</I> 176). The overwhelming
question for those left is what to do with the objects that linger;
holding out a pair of Jacob's old shoes, his mother asks "What am I to
do with these?" (<I>JR,</I> 176). If, as Baudrillard would maintain, the
subject's destiny passes into the object, what is the object's destiny
beyond the life of the subject? What sort of obsolescence is this?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The affective power of the novel's close demonstrates the metonymic
potency of material objects, which is inseparable from their potency to
convey the realism of the novelistic universe, not just in the work of
Charles Dickens or Honor&eacute; de Balzac, say, but also in experimental
fiction. Woolf came to believe that the birth of the novel as we know
it, <I>Robinson Crusoe,</I> must be thought through the re of the
"large earthenware pot" that she posits as an emblem of Daniel Defoe's
authority, which is fiction's authority to overwhelm the reader with the
wholeness of an imagined world, and to
<B></B>
 interrupt romantic fantasy with
novelistic fact. "By believing fixedly in the solidity of the pot and
its earthiness, he has subdued every other element to his design; he has
roped the universe into a harmony."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 In the power of the earthenware pot as Woolf imagines it, which
 is Defoe's capacity to novelize the universe, there is something of
 Stevens's jar on a hill in Tennessee, transforming the landscape around
 it, if not something of Heidegger's jug, the thing that things the world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 When solid objects become the explicit object of Woolf's address,
 however, the coherence of the solid object that makes the world cohere
 gives way to the solidity of fragments; there is no earthenware pot,
 but simply "a piece of china of the most remarkable shape . . . shaped,
 or broken accidentally, into five irregular but unmistakable points"
 (<I>HH,</I> 83). Though the emphasis on the accidental shape of the
 china fragment might be said to ally the story with the dadaist and
 surrealist faith in the irrational and the contingent, the point is more
 that reevaluating the material world seems to depend on its re-use and
 on some violence that violates the coherence of the object. Whereas
 John imagines this violence as the act of an angry woman (hurling a
 "jar or a pot" out the window), the violence that the story nowhere
 imagines but everywhere intimates is the violence of war.

As John hunts in "the neighborhood of waste land where the household
refuse is thrown away," and then comes to "haunt the places which are most
prolific of broken china, such as pieces of waste land between railway
lines, sites of demolished houses, and commons in the neighborhood of
London," it is hard not to envision him as a character roaming the city
streets and rat's alley of <I>The Waste Land,</I> the poem the Woolfs
would publish two years later (<I>HH,</I> 82, 83-4; <A HREF="6.2brown_1.html"> 1</A>). But
such a convergence, itself part of a more widespread representation of
postwar London as the unreal city, foregrounds a crucial contrast.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 In place of the dolorous voice of <I>The Waste Land,</I> shoring
 cultural fragments against the spiritual ruin of the cityscape, John
 serendipitously accretes material fragments within which he finds all
 the spirit he needs.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If war-traumatized London makes sense as the (underspecified) setting
for the story, that trauma would seem to be specifically material, not
spiritual. Though Woolf could dismiss the war as "remote and meaningless,"
she also lamented that "one has come to notice the war everywhere,"
meaning that "everything is skimped," that butcher shops are closed,
that cards are required for "most foods," that other shops display
"tins, or cardboard boxes" that are empty (<I>D,</I> 100).
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Given the facts of wartime scarcity, the point is less that her diaries
 seem so evacuated of material objects and more that the world they
 describe has been so evacuated: "If you see a plum, it is invariably a
 decoy plum" (<I>D,</I> 112). Though the accounts of the raids on London,
 the mattresses dragged to the cellar, are the more obvious reminder of
 the presence of the war in her diaries and letters, there is a subtler
 but ubiquitous sense
 
 <B></B>

 of how the things of the world, such as paper and
 paint, have become the materials of war. In this context, then, the
 intermittent material fascinations of her 1918 summer
 diary attain more significance: "I think it was on Friday that I was
 given my green glass jar by the chemist--for nothing! It's a jar I've
 always coveted; since glass is the best of all decorations, holding
 the light &amp; changing it" (<I>D,</I> 170).
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If Woolf's pleasure in this green glass jar resurfaces in John's
pleasure in the green lump of glass found on the beach, it does so
embedded in a culture of scarcity that precipitates a different quality
of cathexis. Glass had become the focus of national concern as glass
manufacturers transformed major plants into munitions factories.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
Moreover, the arrested import of Jena glass from Germany and Austria
and of chemical glass from Bohemia had created a so-called glass-famine
in Britain, especially severe in the production of microscopic and
photographic lenses.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 As the <I>Geographic Journal</I> explained in its 
 <B></B>
review of the reports
 from the Ministry of Munitions, there was hope that "British glass
 sands" would support domestic production needs. But if to the ministry
 it seemed as though
these sands had sufficient silica content and the right grain, in fact
the postwar search for the best sand led British crystal manufacturers
back to Fontainebleau and to Loch Aline, Scotland.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 For the iron in the English sand gave indigenous glass a green hue; it
 was <I>verre de foug&egrave;re.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The image of John "burrowing his fingers down, down, into the sand"
 and discovering there "a large irregular lump" of green glass might
 thus be read as an image less of discovery than of productivity, a
 production of glass out of the domestic glass sands of Britain and a
 recognition of its particular beauty. Still, it is not material as such
 (neither the sand nor the glass), but the whole process of retrieving
 and reanimating the ambiguous remnant that catalyzes John's fascination.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Between 1912 and 1930 Francis Bakley published some six books and dozens
of articles on English glass; in retrospect, this looks like an act of
mourning, composed as it was in the midst of general doubts about the
longevity of the English production. The problem was not simply that
glass manufacturers had been making light bulbs, rods, and tubes for
wartime industry, but also that free trade made cheap imports a perpetual
threat to the financial success of domestic stemware once the war was
over. The Society for Glass Technology was organized in 1916, as was a
Department of Glass Technology at Sheffield, in the specific effort to
sustain the nation's importance in the history of glass manufacture, but
by 1924, seventy percent of the British market was supplied by imports,
factories closed, and glassmakers were left unemployed in the face of
continental competition.

If the wartime and postwar history of glass in Britain can help to
reframe "Solid Objects" as a story about the modern fate of materials,
then the history of iron intensifies the same point. The history of iron
<I>and</I> glass, as instantiated by the Crystal Palace, chronicled the
serial and international prospects of modernity (<A HREF="6.2brown_2.html"> 2</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Still, the story of Great Britain's iron trade was perpetually felt
 as a national tragedy, a narrative of decline from the industrial
 revolution and the thriving Imperial economy. In standard histories,
 the vast iron and coal resources of England were understood as the
 necessary condition of the eighteenth-century Industrial Revolution. As
 Leonard Woolf revised this history, the industrial revolution and empire
 converged as an "intense preoccupation with material things," a demand
 for raw materials, coupled with production technologies, that resulted
 in "the whole world [being] ransacked for mines and metals," and in
 international competition for the control of resources.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The globalization that culminates in war, and in the compression of time
 and space that has been said to constitute modernity, originates with
 what we might call a passion for materials. When Virginia Woolf begins
 to write a story about accumulating materials in the month of the war's
 close, she thus writes an allegory of that war's origin, but an allegory
 with a difference--the difference marked by the bricoleur's confusion
 of ends and means, by an alternative economy where value results from
 a noninstrumental passion for things.

During the war, the need for scrap in the production of bombs led

 The imperial passion for materials had become a warring Europe's
 obsession with

of Germany's aggression by publishing excerpts of a confidential
memorandum, submitted to the Chancellor from leading industrial and
agriculture societies in May 1915, that underscored the importance of the

iron and steel was utterly "inadequate to our needs."

 The problem of this war of attrition, as we have come to call it, was

 <B></B>
 have boiled down to the "essential question," in Sir John

 and after a Ministry of Munitions was organized (with Lloyd George

Iron mines.

In the history of English iron, 1882 marks the record year for exports,
dominated by the sale of railroad iron to colonial markets. By the
close of the century, exacerbated by the McKinley tariff of 1890 and
the British policy of free trade, Great Britain lost those markets
(the U.S. supplying Canada with seventy percent of its iron and steel
requirements) and had its domestic market flooded with "iron dumping"
from Belgium, Germany, and the U.S.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>

All this is to say that if John's "serious ambitions" are met with a
"lack of understanding" that is repeated in the critical consensus about
the story, we might nonetheless begin to understand his behavior as an
alternative mode of experiencing scarcity (<I>HH,</I> 85). In Europe,
more so than in the U.S., the war intensified a Taylorist horror of
waste, not just of time but of substances. This was the war in which
all citizens were summoned to participate as national subjects, "each
one of us"--"you and each one of you."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 In their effort to involve civilians in the military project, governments
 took out ads and relied on posters as the new medium for communicating
 with the masses, for bringing the war into the civilian everyday
 (<A HREF="6.2brown_3.html"> 3</A>). Saving fat for use in explosives, collecting the metal needed
 for scrap in the making of bombs--these activities comprised a new kind
 of materialism, a requisite bricolage, a recognition that the materials
 of everyday objects could have another life (<A HREF="6.2brown_4.html">4</A>). As Aragon came to
 put it, "Aha! that tinkling silver-plating was false / The teaspoons
 are made of lead just like those bullets."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Indeed, if the engagement Woolf narrates in "Solid Objects" can be
understood as registering and aestheticizing, however inversely or
perversely, the newly stipulated attention to materials throughout Europe,
then the story can grant us a different access to familiar accounts of
modernism and the object. Whether one assumes that the readymade was meant
to attack the world of art, to foreground the role of the artist, or to
dislodge common objects from the tyranny of use, Duchamp first promoted
his readymades when the making of any common object--a urinal, a bottle
rack, a snow shovel--was threatened all over Europe by the requirements
of martial manufacturing. The various governmental demands to rethink
the material world, and to revise the notion of waste toward a notion of
recomposition, might lurk behind what Benjamin called the "materialistic,
anthropological inspiration" that provoked the surrealists to discover
some revolutionary potential in discarded
<B></B>
 objects.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 As for anthropological inspiration as such, we can describe the fetishism
 Woolf portrays as an alternative economy, an intensely private and
 privatizing reorientation
of value, that offers a specular image of the alternative economies
that anthropologists made visible in the 1920s. In <I>Argonauts of the
Pacific,</I> based on fieldwork done in New Guinea and North Melanesia
during the war, Bronislaw Malinowski introduces "law and order into what
seemed chaotic and freakish" by describing the function of apparently
meaningless objects in the Kula.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 When Marcel Mauss revises those conclusions to emphasize the
 irrationality of such practices, he deliberately juxtaposes "irrational
 expenditure" to the Western image of homo oeconomicus as "a calculating
 machine" devoted to "frigid utilitarian calculation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 Though Georges Bataille would go on to celebrate various modes
 of <I>d&eacute;pense</I> as such, Mauss's own ethical conclusions,
 argued in explicit relation to the European war, emphasize how a stable
 sociality, a kind of solidarity that depends on competition, can emerge
 out of the respect and reciprocity of "the gift." The intense isolation
 of the individual in "Solid Objects" would be anathema to Mauss. But
 Woolf's image of reappropriating, valorizing, and aestheticizing waste,
 no less than his image of wasting valuable property,
 
 <B></B>


 is underwritten
 by the sense that the economic reason of the West has been exhausted.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Which is to say that the history of objects as we know it (the history of
objects as we know them) will never challenge the Enlightenment's history
of itself. The challenge comes from the history of things, and from the
histories in them.

"Solid Objects" begins with a narratorial consciousness that registers, as
though through binoculars or through a zoom lens, a barely perceptible
detail that slowly comes into focus as two human bodies. Woolf thus
manages to record, in this gradually clarifying perception, something
like the momentary development of sensation into perception:

The only thing that moved upon the vast semicircle of the beach was
one small black dot. As it came nearer to the ribs and spine of the
stranded pilchard boat, it became apparent from a certain tenuity in
its blackness that this spot possessed four legs. . . . [The] mouths,
noses, chins, and check stockings of the two speakers became clearer and
clearer; the smoke of their pipes went up into the air; nothing was so
solid, so living, so hard, red, hirsute and virile as these two bodies
for miles and miles of sea and sandhill. [<I>HH,</I> 79]
<B></B>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These bodies, rendered as body parts and as parts that help designate
the form of the pilchard boat, achieve their solidity in the context of
the seascape. But once they settle
 into their wholeness (once they assume, let us say, the phantasmatic
 image of the coherent human body) the "only thing" that can mark such
 solidity is some other thing. As he burrows into the sand, John's fingers
 finally curl "round something hard--a full drop of solid matter," which
 turns out to be a "green tint," a lump of glass, smoothed by the water
 into a veritable green gem (<I>HH,</I> 80). "It pleased him; it puzzled
 him; it was so hard, so concentrated, so definite an object compared
 with the vague sea and the hazy shore" (<I>HH,</I> 81). The definiteness
 of the solid object seems rather to expose the vagueness of politics
 ("Politics be damned!"), pushing politics into the background, as
 objects sometimes do in Woolf's diary: "I have bought another glass jar
 for 2/-. These things are in the foreground. It is partly due to them
 . . . that I don't write first &amp; foremost of the German offer of
 peace" (<I>D,</I> 199). If we grant "Solid Objects" a (specifically)
 peripheral place in the British literature of World War I, and even
 grant Virginia Woolf's shortest fiction some relation to Leonard Woolf's
 tireless work on behalf of The League of Nations, then this story will
 assume a very different role--to demonstrate how utterly pedestrian
 passions can be understood as a longing for the fragments of the West
 not to be reassembled as they previously had been.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though the solidity of human bodies in the story gives way to the solidity
of glass, solidity as such certainly gives way to a kind of fluidity--"the
green thinned and thickened slightly as it was held against the sky or
against the body" (<I>HH,</I> 81)--just as it gives way to elaborate
fantasy: "Perhaps after all it was really a gem; something worn by a
dark Princess trailing her finger in the water as she sat in the stern
of the boat and listened to the slaves singing as they rowed her across
the Bay" (<I>HH,</I> 80-1). What prevents solidity from becoming the
point, what capacitates the imaginative encounter, is the incoherence of
the fragment. John does not quite succumb to what Simmel described as
the "the present vividly felt charm of the fragment" that distances us
"from things" because "reality is touched not with direct confidence but
with fingertips that are immediately withdrawn" (<I>PM,</I> 474). Rather,
John's tactile engagement gives him license to explore some other unhuman
reality: "John turned it in his hands; he held it to the light; he held
it so that its irregular mass blotted out the body and extended right arm
of his friend" (<I>HH,</I> 81). The fragment appears in "Solid Objects"
as the re of the material metonym whose metonymic function has been
arrested--the unconsummated metonym, as it were. The unconsummated metonym
is the re, or the conceptual image, that Woolf offers us to think
the object/thing dialectic, to think the world anew. John collects broken
parts that are not really parts <I>of</I> anything determinable: "it was
impossible to say whether it had been bottle, tumbler, or window-pane; it
was nothing but glass." His materialism, where parts are related not to
wholes but to other parts, enacts a kind of redemption that refuses the
(Heideggerian) temporality of recuperation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
John's fetishism does not depend on substitution, but merely dynamizes
the excess that characterizes any object, even the paper clip, the rubber
band, the empty 
<B></B>
glass. If the recent work on objects (consumer objects,
museal objects, ethnographic objects) "responds to the imperative to
know about material needs, wants, and
desires," then work on things should assume the task of discovering, in
the history of objects, material desires, or the desire for material,
that will forever be lost in the histories of consumer society or
ethnographies of cultural exchange. At the very close of the story,
John's friend Charles, depressed by the disarray of the room and utterly
confused by his friend, asks "What made you give it up," meaning to ask
just what prevented John from pursuing his political career. When John
answers "I've not given it up," he means that he has not abandoned his
search (<I>HH,</I> 85). He could hardly give it up because his passion
has become irrepressible. In addition, he refuses to feel guilt about his
new pleasure because rather than discovering one solid object or another,
he in fact discovers some other desire. The desire to historicize this
desire can not help limiting its potential to overcome affectively the
specificities of time and of place, its potential to sense multiple
histories materialized in (or by) the discarded remnant, the curious
remainder. The war precipitated a national fixation on materials
that enabled Woolf to imagine some more challenging, exhilarating
material fixations. But we repeat the error she remonstrates against if,
accumulating bits and pieces of this history, we believe that they form
the whole story.

this consensus in a chapter on Woolf that reads the story in order to

Victorian, aestheticist, and modernist attention to material objects. See

Bloomsbury and the movements with which Hulme's ideas are associated,
futurism and vorticism. If in the following pages I seem to imply that
within Woolf's story we can detect some transcendence of that schism,
I hardly mean to suggest that this is anything but inadvertent, and my
use of William James, Georg Simmel, Benjamin, and Adorno is meant to
avoid domesticating Woolf's text too readily.

Virginia Woolf, "The Cinema," in <I>Collected Essays</I> (New York:

the temporality it offers might enable the English to engage a reality
"more real, or real with a different reality from that which we perceive
in daily life," but she goes on to imagine the surreal possibility that
the cinema will offer "abstractions," "visual emotions," some way of
visualizing "thought in its wildness" . In "Solid Objects" John's
tactile engagement with material is coupled with a new sensitivity
to abstract form: "he was often astonished, as he came to go into the
question more deeply, by the immense variety of shapes to be found in
London alone" (<I>HH,</I> 84).

It would be possible to call attention to how Woolf's realist mode, with
its verisimilar rendering of decor, transforms into a modernist mode
where objects no longer have an identifiable relation to humans or to one
another. Such schematic narratives, however, as Bowlby suggests, erase
the very instability that characterizes Woolf's objectifications even as
fictional chronicler. In "Solid Objects," John's relation to the things
he collects seems more like the sort of relation described in Leonard
Woolf's novelistic account of Hambantota life in Ceylon, <I>The Village
in the Jungle</I> , where Silindu's profound intimacy with the
jungle provokes his isolation both from his fellow villagers and from
the British officials.

Writing to Lytton Strachey before his visit to Asheham, Woolf explains
that "you'll have to bring whatever cards for meat, sugar, butter you

cook at Belsize to get you a week's rations of butter, sugar and meat
which you pack in your bag and bring with you" 24 March 1918; 27 March

Woolf's interest in glass extends from the material to the rhetorical. In

which have been made &amp; improved &amp; freed from superfluities by
the polish of innumerable actors &amp; authors &amp; critics" become
"like a lump of glass worn smooth in the sea" (<I>D,</I> 184). And when
Orlando is frustrated by the way familiar metaphors encumber any thought
or expression of love, Woolf uses the metaphor of the thing of glass,
"Every single thing, once he tried to dislodge it from its place in
his mind, he found thus cumbered with other matter like the lump of
glass which, after a year at the bottom of the sea, is grown about with
bones and dragon-flies, and coins and the tresses of drowned women"

Woolf narrativizes such a development in "The Mark on the Wall"; the
ambiguous, abstract mark turns out to be a snail. Insofar as the story
represents an attraction to "the impersonal world which is proof of some
existence other than ours," an attraction satisfied by the "solidity"
and "reality" of materials ("Wood is a pleasant thing to think about"),
"The Mark on the Wall" can be reasonably paired with "Solid Objects"
(<I>HH,</I> 45). But the latter utterly differentiates itself by fixating
on the fragment, the specifically cultural remainder that will never
assume coherence as a familiar object, animate or inanimate.

One of the most startling aspects of the 1936 essay "Bloomsbury" by
British modernist Mary Butts is that the piece was originally rejected
on the grounds that the Group was not widely known in England.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 This perspective seems hardly credible today, particularly since the
 inception of the Group's popularity can be traced to 1920, when the term
 Bloomsbury began to circulate in newspapers and take on a life of its
 own. While Butts makes no reference to Bloomsbury's appearance in mass
 circulation periodicals during this decade, her prescient analysis of
 the Group speaks directly to the concerns of this essay--Bloomsbury's
 complicity in its own commodification through its glitzy appearances
 in British <I>Vogue.</I> Although Butts does not intentionally set
 out to investigate the Group's role as a mass-market phenomenon, her
 language inadvertently exposes Bloomsbury's status as a modernist
 spectacle capable of posing for <I>Vogue</I> and resolutely tied to
 market concerns. The words that Butts utilizes to discuss the Group's
 ideological positions--"synthetic" ("B," 37), "papier-mach&eacute;"
 ("B," 36), "copies" ("B," 37),"<I>essential</I> fake" ("B," 42)--stem
 from her conviction that Bloomsbury scorned a belief in "the absolute"
 and instead embraced a relativist perspective, deifing the simulacrum:
 "things made of one substance pretending to be things made out of
 another" ("B," 36). While Butts here reveals her own conservatism by
 fetishizing the alleged authenticity of the modernist product, her use
 of the language of artifice and her view that the Group was a "pretty
 wide corporation" that vigorously

<B></B>

sought to "impress itself upon the public mind" simultaneously introduce
the idea of reproducibility, a concept that is central to Bloomsbury's
position vis-&agrave;-vis <I>Vogue</I> ("B," 38). The Group authorized
the magazine to circulate its fashionable lifestyle in the commercial
marketplace by allowing its "beliefs and opinions [to] filter down
. . . to the mass of the people" ("B," 41). Although Butts condemned
the Group's modernist assumption that "you could make poetry out of
anything," it is precisely this blurring of the boundary between high
and low that enabled Bloomsbury to wage a successful self-promotional
campaign in <I>Vogue</I> ("B," 41). The magazine capitalized on the view
that "as individuals they have justified their fame" by reproducing and
circulating Bloomsbury's individual style to a mass audience, marketing
the Group's artistic products as commodities for selective consumption
("B," 38).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite the lingering view of the Bloomsbury Group as signifiers of high
culture's "intellectual elite"--an association premised upon an elision
of the marketplace--their splashy appearance in <I>Vogue</I> documents
that Bloomsbury was not isolated from the mass culture of the 1920s. My
observations are based upon archival research at Colindale, the British
Newspaper Library, where I looked at all of the issues of <I>Vogue</I>
between the years 1916 (when the magazine was launched in England) and
1941 (the year that Virginia Woolf died). I found that during the 1920s
the magazine was a fascinating cultural hybrid, juxtaposing articles
on fashion, homemaking, and cosmetics with a huge range of cultural
materials that we would today classify as "high brow." In particular, the
magazine was a veritable homage to the world of Bloomsbury, publishing
book and cultural reviews by, and about, a diverse range of critics and
artists associated with the Group: Virginia and Leonard Woolf, Clive and
Vanessa Bell, Vita Sackville West, Harold Nicolson, Roger Fry, Duncan
Grant, David Garnett, the Sitwells, G. E. Moore, Ottoline Morrell,
E. M. Forster, Desmond Mac Carthy, Raymond Mortimer, and John Maynard
Keynes. Although the magazine also ran articles by and about other
modernists such as James Joyce, D. H. Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield,
and Sylvia Townsend Warner, Bloomsbury was the key vehicle through which
the magazine attempted to disseminate cultural elitism to its affluent
readership. This essay analyzes how Bloomsbury, in particular the male
members of the Group, functioned as champions of English high culture to
<I>Vogue</I>'s elite female audience; it also seeks to demonstrate how
the dual ideologies of nationalism and imperialism intersect with the
magazine's popularization of British high culture and marginalization
of women's claims to modernity. <I>Vogue</I> in the 1920s invoked
imperial rhetoric and the language of avant-garde taste, simultaneously
capitalizing on the expansion of leisure industries in Britain (such
as the cinema, the wireless, organized sport, and escapist reading) in
order to commodify aesthetic value through "the mass popularization of
defiantly elite art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Most of the work that has been published on Bloomsbury as a "mass-market
 phenomenon" has focused on the period since the 1960s; <I>Vogue</I>
 provides evidence that the "Bloomsbury industry" can be traced to the
 years of high modernist production.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Recognizing that the Group was a marketable commodity, <I>Vogue</I>
 exploited Bloomsbury's intellectual, upper-class position by showcasing
 the

influence of their cultural views and the imposition of their taste
upon England's "national life"; as Jennifer Wicke succinctly puts it
"lifestyle is what Bloomsbury was selling."

My focus here will be on the representation of Bloomsbury's appearance, as
"personalities" as well as contributors, to British <I>Vogue</I>'s glossy
pages in order to trace this curious intersection between high and mass
culture that the popularization of modernism and the commercialization
of the Group underscores. This juxtaposition of high and low culture
invites us to explore some of the historical and material conditions
of the emergence of modernism, particularly in terms of its frequently
assumed antagonism to mass culture, allowing us to ask, How do various
social and market forces help to shape our perception of Bloomsbury,
and what roles do gender and Englishness play in this equation? In his
essay "Mass Culture as Woman: Modernism's Other," Andreas Huyssen has
begun to help us answer such a question by charting the male modernist
association of mass culture with the feminine and high culture with the
masculine. Although this paradigm has been extremely useful, it neglects
to take into account the ambivalent position of the woman writer for whom
the lure of mass culture was arguably a more complex, if not strictly
enabling, historical development, emerging simultaneously with greater
economic independence, more educational opportunities, and greater access
to the public sphere for women--to name only the most obvious examples.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 These structural changes in the material conditions of women's lives
 following World War I coincided in the 1920s with the emergence of
 a new female audience for mass-market entertainment such as films,
 best-selling novels, and popular magazines, all of which reflected a
 preoccupation with the modern woman. Margaret Beetham observes that
 the periodical, in particular, was at the center of an industry that
 gave employment to increasing numbers of women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Huyssen's essay, furthermore, does not address modernist women's relation
 to modernity, nor does it consider the position of the male modernist
 who does not repudiate mass cultural materials. Within the last decade,
 several critics have challenged the tenacious myth that modernist
 writers scorned popular appeal, refused to advertise themselves, and
 sought refuge from the commercial sphere.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 This recent proliferation of work demonstrates that, far from being
 opposed to the economy of production and consumption, canonical
 modernists such as Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, Henry James, Joyce and
 Lawrence were thoroughly preoccupied with marketplace concerns.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The evidence that male modernists self-consciously utilized and
 transformed the meaning of popular elements in their work does not prove
 that modernism was coopted by commercialism, but it does illustrate the
 limits of the argument that modernist writers were only contemptuous of
 popular forms. Such examples also clearly problematize the unequivocal
 gendering of mass culture as feminine, suggesting that what is needed
 is not only another way to talk about the canonical status of a male
 writer like Joyce

<B></B>

but also a new means of theorizing the ideological complicities between
modernism and popular or mass culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fredric Jameson's influential formulation of the interrelationship
between modernist high art and mass culture shifts the perspective away
from the conventional opposition in terms that transgress the putative
associations between mass culture and femininity, high culture and the
masculine. Jameson's reconceptualization of the binary system of value
does not address the issue of gender, but his argument that modernism
and mass culture represent "dialectically interdependent phenomena"
has important implications for feminist analyses of modernist cultural
artifacts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 His view that all cultural creation in capitalist society is divided
 against itself, pitting work that is presumed to be timeless, unique,
 and of high aesthetic value against the degraded status of mass produced
 objects, is particularly useful in the interpretation of a text like
 <I>Vogue,</I> which juxtaposes literary reviews of high modernist work
 by authors such as Stein, Eliot, Pound, Joyce, and Woolf with ads for
 commodities such as corsets, chin straps, and antiperspirants. While
 <I>Vogue</I> does not in every case praise the modernist emphasis on
 narrative complexity and obscurity--Mary MacCarthy, in a 1929 review,
 denounces Joyce's <I>Anna Livia Plurabelle</I> as "a little book of
 experimental nonsense"--for the most part the magazine is overwhelmingly
 promodernist throughout the 1920s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Jameson's contention that modernism's most fundamental feature is its
 "hostility to the market" is complicated by the fact that many modernist
 writers and artists, both men and women, willingly participated in the
 selling of high culture to <I>Vogue</I>'s elite female audience.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 In many ways, <I>Vogue</I>'s strategy of "marketing modernity" in the
 1920s resembles that of another Cond&eacute; Nast publication, <I>Vanity
 Fair,</I> which was similarly invested in "popularizing an aesthetic
 based largely on a demonstrated scorn for popular appeal."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Although <I>Vogue</I> is dependent upon the commercialism of the
 marketplace in order to survive, its editorial content repeatedly
 reflects an antagonism towards mass cultural markers such as
 accessibility and universal appeal. We see a prime example of this
 resistance to absorption by the mainstream in an editorial by Aldous
 Huxley, the magazine's cultural critic, called "The Perversion of
 Values," an invective against modern culture. Huxley argues that the
 "acceptable standards" have been perverted by those who "call things
 by the wrong names, labeling 'high' what should rightly be low, and
 'low' what ought to be high." This attack on society's democratizing
 impulses and misguided inversion of values speaks to the magazine's
 tacit objective--to rectify this inverted falsification of standards by
 isolating and elevating what Huxley calls "the old hierarchy," and what
 <I>Vogue</I> envisions as an affirmation of British aristocratic values.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 The magazine achieves this stabilization of "what ought to be high"
 throughout the 1920s by carving out a privileged cultural domain
 for modernist writers, artists, and their aesthetic principles. It
 accomplishes this, however, without publishing any modernist fiction
 itself, because during this time the space devoted to magazine fiction
 was in inverse proportion to the class of readers. Only less tony
 publications printed fiction regularly; <I>Vogue</I> published no
 modernist stories for its upper-class readers, though an occasional
 poem by H. D. or Edith Sitwell did appear.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although <I>Vogue</I> specifically targeted a cultivated upper-class
readership (Cond&eacute; Nast is well-known in magazine marketing history
for being one of the earliest pioneers of niche marketing) it would be
inaccurate to assume that the magazine is therefore not a product of
mass culture. Although <I>Vogue</I> never sold as many copies as some
other mass circulation women's magazines, it consistently led all of
its competitors in advertising revenue throughout the 1920s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Consistent with the unreliability of statistics for British magazines
 during this period, Caroline Seebohm documents the magazine's circulation
 in 1928 as 138,783 (<I>MV,</I> 282), and 141,424 (<I>MV,</I> 79). Either
 way, what is conveyed is that--in contrast to the little magazines
 of the period, which nurtured literary modernism but whose numbers
 ranged only from a couple hundred to a high of several thousand
 subscribers--<I>Vogue</I>'s circulation res and revenues clearly
 situate the periodical as a formidable market force.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 With five international editions by the mid-1920s--American, French,
 British, Spanish, and German--the magazine was actively disseminating
 its most fundamental objective on a global scale: "[to] conspire not
 only to get all [its] readers from the one particular class to which
 the magazine is dedicated, <I>but rigorously to exclude all others.</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 However, as Nast envisioned it, <I>Vogue</I> would appeal not
only to readers who were exceedingly wealthy but also to those who
actively aspired to be members of the upper class.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Linking the new consumerist orientation of readers to the notion of
 imperialist expansion, <I>Vogue</I>'s masthead in the period between
 the wars proclaimed, "VOGUE KNOWS NO FRONTIERS" (<I>MV,</I> 142). By
 cultivating an international market of "women of breeding," <I>Vogue</I>
 sought to disseminate a model of femininity in which appearance and taste
 were central. If, as Melba Cuddy-Keane argues, we define mass culture
 as a broad communicative system that posits a single speaking voice and
 a single audience that seeks to elicit and produce a uniform response,
 it becomes possible to read <I>Vogue</I> as a mass cultural product even
 though the magazine explicitly resisted the tactics of universal appeal.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The magazine, then, helps us to see how modernism was popularly read and
 legitimated, for this convergence of mass culture and modernist cultural
 production allows us to explore what Jameson calls the "conditions of
 possibility," the social and historical circumstances that enabled the
 phenomenon of the "great moderns."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Neither Jameson nor Huyssen, however, addresses the role that nationalism
plays in the construction of high or mass culture, nor do they discuss
how this collaboration intersects with the representation of gender. John
MacKenzie illustrates the degree to which popular cultural elements
such as advertising and the cinema continued to be suffused with the
ideology of imperialism, even though the idea of official propaganda
had to a certain extent been discredited in England after World War I.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> participated in the dissemination of a British world view
 espousing cultural and racial superiority by dividing the globe into
 "civilized" and "uncivilized" regions; several issues, for example,
 feature articles on exotic getaways to colonial outposts. Another crucial
 way that the magazine communicated the idea of national pride was through
 the representation of Woolf as a great writer and the celebration of
 Bloomsbury as upholders of England's cultural endowment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 The magazine's showcasing of

<B></B>

the Bloomsbury Group, I want to suggest, must be read in relation to what
MacKenzie argues is the pervasiveness of imperialism as an ideological
feature, a constituent part of modern British culture. <I>Vogue</I>
is steeped in the discourse of a popularly sanctioned nationalism
whose populism nevertheless undergirds class and national hierarchies
and that shapes the representations of those who participate and are
depicted in the magazine. The periodical, in this sense, can be read as a
representative, ethnographic document illustrating the various ways empire
is a widely-marketed cultural feature, inseparable from its depiction of
gendered and class-specific subjects. In order to clarify the nature of
Bloomsbury's presence in <I>Vogue</I> as an index to its relation to mass
culture, we must consider the Group's investment in nationalist rhetoric
that is inevitably inflected by gender. For Bloomsbury, mass culture
is enmeshed in a colonial imagination capable of equating conceptions
of lower classes and lower races, both of which are linked in complex
ways with femininity. Male Bloomsbury collaborates with <I>Vogue</I>
on a range of related constructions of Englishness, civilization, and
femininity, demonstrating how the Group's articulation of modernity
ultimately fails, as Julie Taddeo has recognized, to incorporate new
ideas about and attitudes toward women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Any discussion of Bloomsbury and mass culture must take into account not
 only the Group's Anglocentrism, but their relation to the structural
 gender asymmetry that informs a publication like <I>Vogue.</I> My
 argument is situated, then, within a cultural paradox: Bloomsbury was a
 modernist elite and officially anti-imperialist, and yet also involved in
 British popular culture and colonialist rhetoric. <I>Vogue</I> documents
 this phenomenon and provides a compelling example of how high culture
 utilizes mass cultural forms to disseminate its values.

This essay seeks to assess the scope of the ideological contradiction
that Bloomsbury's appearance represents. As the magazine asked about
modernity, do "Feminism, Jazz, Prohibition, Cubism, The League of Nations,
Motorcycles, and other enthusiasms" point to cultural disaster or advance?
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 But before looking closely at these different ideological agendas,
 I first want to give a general sense of what kind of a periodical
 <I>Vogue</I> was and to consider to whom the magazine appealed and
 how femininity was represented to assess better what Bloomsbury's
 participation in this particular commodity form suggests about British
 high culture in the 1920s. The impetus behind the specific marketing
 and publicity structures employed by British <I>Vogue</I> during this
 period was the magazine's "Bloomsbury-ish editor," Dorothy Todd, a woman
 of distinctly literary, rather than fashionable, leanings (<I>MV,</I>
 204). From 1922-1926 Todd commissioned several modernist writers and
 artists to contribute to the magazine in an effort to elevate its status
 and expand its scope beyond fashion and beauty. Todd was eventually
 fired from her editorship in 1926 because she failed to make the magazine
 sufficiently profitable to its American owners, but during her

<B></B>

tenure she succeeded in securing an impressive array of contributors,
among them Virginia Woolf, who published five articles in <I>Vogue</I>
between 1924 and 1926, as well as several members of Bloomsbury. Although
the magazine's profits did flag under Todd's "literary regime,"
evidence suggests that another factor contributing to the opposition
to her leadership was homophobia (<I>MV,</I> 125). The morally rigorous
American editor of <I>Vogue,</I> Edna Woolman Chase, strongly disapproved
of "Miss Todd's personal proclivities, which were overtly homosexual"
(<I>MV,</I> 125). While there is no record of Bloomsbury's response
to Todd's lesbianism, we do have ample evidence of Woolf's hostility
toward the editor in her diaries and letters from this period. Woolf's
repeated references to Todd mark her as lower-class despite the fact
that the <I>Vogue</I> establishment regarded her as "too highbrow," and
she often moved in the same social circles as Bloomsbury--a culture that
was congenial to homosexuality (<I>MV,</I> 127).
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 If we consider Todd's lesbianism alongside Bloomsbury's embrace of
 bi-
and homosexuality, what is striking about their collaboration
 on <I>Vogue</I> is their silent collusion in the promotion of a
 heteronormative agenda. Whenever members of the Group are represented,
 their captions carry the words "wife" or "husband of" to ensure readers
 of their heterosexuality. Certainly nothing that evinced a homoerotic
 sensibility (e.g. Duncan Grant's virile male bodies, Lytton Strachey's
 writings) ever made it onto <I>Vogue</I>'s pages, which were silent on
 the issue of Bloomsbury's self-perceived sexual radicalism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the magazine depicts no trace of Bloomsbury's or Todd's
homosexuality, there is evidence to suggest that the Group was more
emotionally invested in her leadership than Woolf's caustic remarks would
allow. Vita Sackville West records Bloomsbury's protest to Todd's firing,
writing to Harold Nicolson, "We sat in the meadow [of the Woolf's house
in Rodmell] and discussed the future of Miss Todd. . . . This affair has
assumed in Bloomsbury the proportions of a political rupture" (<I>MV,</I>
127-8). While on the one hand this crushing response to the demise
of the Bloomsbury dynasty in <I>Vogue</I> may be said to illustrate the
limits of the Group's vision of political rupture, it also demonstrates
their commitment to Todd's high cultural agenda. Bloomsbury colluded with
Todd to attract an avant-garde readership, yet the magazine was still a
market-driven commodity that explicitly catered to an exclusive English
audience. As Cynthia White observes, <I>Vogue</I> "appeal[ed] to those
with extravagant tastes and ample resources"; its pages were flanked by
sumptuous advertisements featuring a glittering array of luxury goods
beyond the reach of all but the most affluent.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Despite the general postwar decline in the dominance of "high society"
 publications and the rise of a group of magazines catering to the middle
 and lower-middle classes, <I>Vogue</I> was completely unaffected by
 this profound shift in the women's press.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Although as an artist Woolf politically opposed the literary class
 system, neither she nor other Bloomsbury writers were frequent
 contributors to these new mass-market women's weeklies, which featured
 pulp fiction, horoscopes, advice and gossip pages, true-to-life stories,
 and fortune-telling columns. In contrast to such staples, <I>Vogue</I>
 offered elements that would appeal to the desires of an upper-class

<B></B>

British "lady," for whom aristocratic leisure and the embellishment of
the heterosexual body were central concerns.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although <I>Vogue</I> at times celebrates the modern woman's greater
possibilities, publishing an anonymous editorial on "Women and Education"
that urges readers to make endowments to women's colleges, the magazine
more often invokes antiquated models of femininity. <I>Vogue</I>
acknowledges "these times of 'equal pay for equal work,'" but it bemoans
the fact that "household science [has] lost its prestige," and longs
for the traditional man who will be "the protector and provider" for
his spouse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 An article on "Modern Womanhood" informs women that if they "wish
 to be adored, they must return to the tricks and manners they have
 abandoned," namely, "the flutters, the vapour . . . a tremulous lip,"
 any device that might restore men's "former prestige" and make them
 "feel more masculine." The magazine celebrates artifice as an essential
 accessory for the modern woman, but it utilizes the rhetoric of progress
 (one caption reads, "A Career for Women: Being Beautiful") to instill
 this idea in its readers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Thus the article "Woman Decides to Support Herself" is not about
 economic freedom, but corsets; the headline "Woman Claims a Masculine
 Prerogative" leads into an article on stylish women and walking sticks,
 not professionalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 An editorial by Huxley on "The Battle of the Sexes" conveys the cultural
 anxiety surrounding the disruption of established attitudes about
 femininity by critiquing the modern woman who, having secured the vote,
 now recklessly seeks to "refute all the old traditions." Huxley denounces
 this "excessive ardour" as a feverish form of "feminine patriotism,"
 claiming that it reflects women's recourse to "their lower selves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> does not unequivocally support a reactionary perspective
 on sex roles--indeed, it publishes Dorothy Richardson's meditation on
 men's disconcertion with the modern woman, "Women and the Future," in
 1924--but it does participate in a broad apprehensiveness regarding
 women's cultural transformation by producing a model of femininity that
 is both restrictive and progressive. In either case, its representation
 of women is ultimately nonthreatening to men. <I>Vogue</I> reflects
 the contradictory meanings of the female body in the 1920s at the
 same time that it popularizes an aristocratic model of femininity
 that assumes an identification between femininity and Englishness. In
 "The Quintessence of the Exquisite" (early July 1921), the magazine
 celebrates Englishwomen as the "justification of our civilization,"
 making explicit the relationship between middle-class femininity and
 national identity. The magazine's representation of Bloomsbury women
 perfectly corresponds to this equation of femininity with civilization, a
 conjunction that is consistent with the magazine's use of nationalist and
 racist rhetoric to construct women as the moral centers of the nation,
 "vital to the very existence of the race."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Several different articles in the 1920s anticipate the concerns of
the Englishwoman who wants to voyage to the colonies, but fears the
barbarism of the non-European world. <I>Vogue</I> participates in the
construction, as well as the displacement, of this fear. An editorial,
"My Cook Was an African," warns readers that servants in tropical Africa
sooner or later take to drink, but the magazine also works to reassure

<B></B>

women of "the essential Negro cheerfulness" of the native population.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 One article in particular, on Jamaica, argues for the prudence of
 the Englishwoman's wariness, "where the veneer of civilization lies
 thickest . . . you may encounter the real Unknown, bottled-up, seething,
 dangerously suppressed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 The magazine cannibalizes native cultures for the English observer,
 inscribing the civilized/primitive dichotomy, but it also works to
 allay the tourist's fears by reassuring her that there are pockets of
 civilization everywhere. An article on travel in India foregrounds
 the excellence of Indian servants, and another on safaris in Kenya
 cheerfully reports that "facilities for hairdressing in Nairobi are
 just as up to date and good as in London."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> reassures travelers that they will never be far from other
 Englishwomen of their social class--in Egypt they can be received by
 the wife of the British High Commissioner, in Kenya by the wife of the
 Commander of the Colony--nor need they be out of the cultural loop: a
 subscription to the Anglo-weekly, <I>The Sphinx,</I> will keep them
 posted of all "civilized" activities in Cairo. By advising readers
 on what to expect ("native boys cannot press pleats") the magazine
 constructs an image of the Englishwoman that asserts her ascendancy
 in a normative hierarchy, equating her with moral superiority, racial
 supremacy, and progressive ideals.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 One editorial in particular, on travel in Java, illustrates the
 insidiousness of the magazine's sacralization of the Englishwoman.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 The author here argues that the "antiquated ideas" of "the brown women
 of Java" would surely "make a few of their white sisters scream with
 horror," namely, "that a woman's chief role in the world is to perpetuate
 the human race." The writer, a woman, recalls photographing a group of
 "four brown and smiling little Eves" who happily display their nakedness
 to the camera. The ideological effect of the essay is to present the
 Javanese women as exotic contrasts to the world of the photographer
 whose technology captures their backward quaintness. The essay ends
 with a reassertion of the British author's moral superiority: "Happy
 unsophisticated country!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 What this and other articles repeatedly demonstrate is the veracity of
 Raymond Mortimer's assertion, uttered within the context of a review
 of Eliza Fay's <I>Original Letters from India (1779-1815),</I>
 that the "indominatable spirit of such Englishwomen has done much to
 make our Empire what it is."

<I>Vogue</I> provides us with an invaluable example of mass culture's role
in producing British high culture at the same time that it illustrates how
the denunciation of low culture is a prerequisite for the establishment
of such claims. For example, given <I>Vogue</I>'s frequent contempt for
best-selling authors, it is arguably significant that when Woolf was
showcased by the magazine in the mid-1920s, she was still an emerging
highbrow writer. Even though <I>Vogue</I> helped to construct Woolf as
a literary icon, it is an important feature of her desirability that
during this time she was not yet the best-selling author whose face
would grace the American cover of <I>Time</I> magazine in 1937. Aldous
Huxley's editorials frequently convey <I>Vogue</I>'s resistance to
popular "prejudice," and its desire to cast itself as an exemplar of
elite opinion. Writing for the magazine in late September 1924, Huxley
attempts to unravel the "mystery of the best-seller" by arguing that
the popular writer harbors "just the right

<B></B>

sort of vulgar mind" and adequate talent to produce books that are devoid
of intellect but overflowing with emotion and the "primary instincts,"
namely, "reproduction, self preservation, and gregariousness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Disdain for the unmediated body is another index of <I>Vogue</I>'s
 high cultural tastes; the magazine is reticent on such bodily female
 matters as menstruation, contraception, pregnancy, and menopause, and
 instead focuses on the female body as a vehicle for inner and outer
 transcendence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Contradictory messages to women are characteristic of the magazine, which
 operates simultaneously on literal and imaginative planes, addressing
 itself both to blue-bloods with a disposable income and to those who
 are only able to reimagine themselves as select members of a genteel
 class. Another article by Huxley, on "The Vulgarity of Modern Life,"
 crystallizes this double movement; here the author argues that "some
 human beings are naturally superior to others," but he qualifies his
 preference for "natural aristocrats" by claiming that their pre-eminence
 is not based upon birth or wealth, but rather on some elusive quality
 he terms "vitality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Huxley's remarks speak to the magazine's interest in cultivating a reader
 base that privileges refinement, whatever its actual income, while
 the language he invokes--"natural hierarchy," "essentially vulgar,"
 "natural commoners"--works to stabilize the dichotomy he seeks to
 deconstruct. Although several of <I>Vogue</I>'s articles convey the
 view that an abstract love of gracious living (not dependent upon
 income) is one form of indulgence, the magazine's preoccupation with
 the upper crust is based upon the necessity of the reader's literal
 consumption. The ads for indulgences such as the Elizabeth Arden salon,
 Parisian cosmetics, Rolls-Royces, and exotic vacations all confirm that
 <I>Vogue</I>'s target audience is people with money.

Huxley's discussion of "natural aristocrats" intertwines British
upper-class values with an idea of high culture, a move that is
recapitulated and amplified in <I>Vogue</I>'s representation of the
Bloomsbury Group. Bloomsbury's contributions to the magazine illustrate
the degree to which the male members of the Group, as transmitters of
high culture, are complicit in the magazine's dissemination of Englishness
and the marginalization of femininity. While there is still considerable
debate regarding the status and social significance of Bloomsbury, Raymond
Williams's contention that the group was at once against the "dominant
ideas and values" of the English upper class and "still willingly, in
all immediate ways, part of it" is evidenced by the group's appearance
in <I>Vogue.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Jennifer Wicke's interpretation of Bloomsbury as an "experiment in
 coterie consumption" is useful here since her analysis speaks both to
 the group's consumption of artistic products as well as "the marketing
 and consumption of their [own] art . . . and lifestyle."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Roger Fry's establishment of the Omega Workshop, an artists'
 collective that produced decorative objects, illustrates this point,
 but Bloomsbury's public display in <I>Vogue</I>--and its advertising of
 Omega products in the magazine's pages--are perhaps the best examples
 of what Wicke suggests

<B></B>

are their calculated self-promotion and exposure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Omega's bold colors and dynamic designs that invoked the style of
 Matisse and Kandinsky were a jarring intrusion upon <I>Vogue</I>'s
 representation of English prettiness and harmony, but despite Fry's
 desire to revolutionize English interiors, the decorations were primarily
 purchased by a select and relatively wealthy group of patrons. Often
 flanked by Omega products, members of Bloomsbury on several different
 occasions allowed their private world to be commercialized: an early
 July, 1923 article on the home of Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville
 West features a photograph of the couple among their sixteenth-century
 English antiques; the November 1924 issue treats readers to a photo
 spread of the interior of "Mrs. Woolf's house in Tavistock square,"
 featuring elaborate designs by Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell. Another
 layout, early March 1925, highlights the "Cambridge Rooms of Maynard
 Keynes," the influential Bloomsbury economist who believed in the
 Arnoldian doctrine of high culture, again spotlighting Grant's and
 Bell's decorative artwork.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> reproduced two of the eight life-size allegorical res
 (symbolic of the Arts and Sciences) that circled Keynes's room at
 King's College, referring to Grant's and Bell's execution as "the most
 successful that has been carried out in England during this century."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 In contrast to the pervasive critical disaffection for English art
 during this period, <I>Vogue</I> consistently upheld the value of what
 Patrick Brantlinger calls Bloomsbury's "aesthetic ethics or ethical
 aestheticism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to these photo spreads, <I>Vogue</I> gave ample space to
Bloomsbury's written work; Vita Sackville West was a regular contributor,
publishing several essays on contemporary writers such as D. H. Lawrence
and Elizabeth Bowen. In an article entitled "What Do Women Want From
Books?" Sackville West concludes that women are "born romantics" who lack
"that peculiarly male instinct for the classical tradition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Although, like other <I>Vogue</I> critics, Sackville West refuses to
 equate women's cultural production as equal to that of male artists,
 maintaining that women's emotive literary work "should be better
 corseted," she still functions as a popularizer of high modernism for
 her lay audience, effectively supplying <I>Vogue</I> consumers with
 the basics in literary criticism, "The story must no longer be like a
 picture in a frame, neat, complete, self-sufficient, entire; it must
 be a broken thing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 At the same time that she is an enthusiastic advocate of literary
 modernism, popularizing the idea that hierarchical cultural boundaries
 must be maintained, she herself visually functions as a signifier of
 aristocratic culture. The late July 1927 issue features a photograph
 of Sackville West's regal profile, celebrating her recent award of the
 Hawthornden Prize for her long poem, "The Land." Elsewhere, within the
 context of an article that showcases media-constructed taste--"Some of
 the Most Interesting Books of the Day" (early October 1923)--the magazine
 reproduces a painting by the late William Strang that captures Sackville
 West's striking stature and celebrates her unique ability to capture "the
 spirit of place" in her fiction. Vita's "place," of course, was Knole and
 Sissinghurst, a fact that <I>Vogue</I> later exploits when it publishes
 her article on "The Edwardians Below Stairs." This examination of the

<B></B>

utility of household servants concludes, "The house held them bound
within a small patriotism . . . the whole system was feudal. . . . But
it brought also its pride, its piety, its fulfilment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 This sense of national entitlement and class privilege recalls
 Clive Bell's remarks in <I>Civilization</I> that some people are
 "willing servants," ready to "make sacrifices for an ideal," and it
 also dovetails with <I>Vogue</I>'s assertion that "luxury is the toy
 of the modern Englishwoman."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 By utilizing Bloomsbury as the face of refinement and good taste, the
 magazine capitalizes on the Arnoldian idea that culture is the best that
 has been thought and said. Toward this end, <I>Vogue</I> published art
 and cultural criticism by Roger Fry, Leonard and Virginia Woolf, and
 Clive Bell (plus critiques of their publications), as well as reviews of
 books by Lytton Strachey, E. M. Forster, and David Garnett. Like Vita
 Sackville West, several of these Bloomsberries also were featured as
 celebrity tastemakers, allowing their photographs to be mass-marketed
 to <I>Vogue</I>'s readership.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Although, like Virginia Woolf, the Bloomsbury Group appeared several
 times in the magazine throughout the 1920s, <I>Vogue</I> illustrates
 the degree to which gender is a determining factor in the construction
 and circulation of one's mass-produced image.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While one might argue that Bloomsbury's contributions to the magazine
reflect a democratic impulse, particularly in view of the male fear
that participating in mass culture is a form of emasculation, this
reading does not take into account the publication's class bias, or how
male contributors such as Fry and Bell typically serve as authorities
on femininity. This gender asymmetry was a factor in the composition
of Bloomsbury from the beginning and is also a reaction against the
pervasive assumption that "the feminine" was a pejorative category in
art criticism during this period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Although much modernist art criticism regarded Fry's Omega products
 as purely decorative and therefore denigrated them as effeminate, in
 <I>Vogue</I> the critic and his objects commanded a level of attention
 that suggested English art was fueled by a masculine ethos.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 The clearest example of the institutionalization of male ascendancy in
 <I>Vogue</I>'s pages is the treatment of women artists, particularly
 Vanessa Bell.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Fry celebrates Bell in the February 1926 issue, placing her "in the
 front rank of British painters of today," but his praise is launched
 by reference to those skeptics who believe that women are "incapable
 of first rate creative work in the visual arts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> singles out Bell and Grant as "the two most brilliant"
 artists of the period, but their work is subjected to differential
 assessments; only the evaluation of Bell is informed by a larger
 gender-biased discourse about the inferiority of women painters.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Fry's essay is a direct attempt to debunk this myth, but the assertion
 of binary conrations of value reappear in articles such as Augustus
 John's "The Woman Artist," where he applauds female painters who produce
 "honestly feminine" work, not surprisingly, because they threaten
 "no encroachment on man's domain."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> singles out Vanessa Bell and Marie Laurencin as the most
 important female artists of the day, undoubtedly because both women's
 work conforms to "feminine" expectations; the magazine reproduces none
 of Bell's abstract work and instead displays paintings that are of
 maternal and domestic subjects. Fry acknowledges Bell's

<B></B>

double marginality, arguing that her success is all the more remarkable,
given the modernist devaluation of English art, because she is "not only
a woman, but an Englishwoman."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Clive Bell echoes this pronouncement, identifying his wife as the only
 woman among the seven most important contemporary English painters
 (Grant and Fry being two others) who are forging an "unmistakably
 British . . . national tradition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What emerges, as one considers the range of Bloomsbury's contributions
to <I>Vogue,</I> in addition to the obvious incestuousness of their
self-promotion, is the concerted, if unconscious, effort to put forth
the view detected by the reviewer of Leonard Woolf's <I>Hunting the
Highbrow:</I> that "the White Hope of England" is the "intellectual
highbrow."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 While Leonard Woolf himself does not utilize this precise phrase, the
 racialized characterization of the highbrow (and the assumption of a male
 subject) speaks to the spirit of his volume and, more generally, captures
 the magazine's representation of the Bloomsbury Group as champions
 and exemplars of "civilized" English thought and living. In <I>Hunting
 the Highbrow,</I> Woolf aligns himself with his wife's antipublicity,
 antibestseller bias, arguing that "the highbrow is genuinely attracted
 by elements in literature . . . which may conveniently be called
 aesthetic, and which are not primarily interesting or attractive to
 the great public."
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Also like Virginia, he utilizes the language of reproduction to
 characterize the excesses of the lower class. In contrast to the
 lowbrow whose senses predominate and who produces book after book
 that is "comprehensible [and] entertaining" to the "majority of their
 fellow-countrymen," Woolf claims that the highbrow is characterized
 by his self-control and literary moderation, "the highbrow is a very
 slow-breeding animal; he is rarely prolific; he is often in favour
 of and practices birth control; and there are not very many of him
 who are actually writing books in any generation. The problems of
 over-population do not, therefore, apply to highbrow literature"
 (<I>HH,</I> 25). Woolf is convinced that if only "men would allow
 intellect and reason rather than passion" to regulate their bodies,
 "sordid ugliness and misery would disappear from society" (<I>HH,</I>
 50). In an interesting juxtaposition, the same <I>Vogue</I> review of
 <I>Hunting the Highbrow</I> contains a discussion of Robert Graves's
 volume, <I>Impenetrability,</I> an impassioned defense of the English
 language and English ways of thought. Yet unlike Woolf, who advocates
 for the surveillance of popular tastes, Graves argues against the
 recently formed "Society for Pure English" on the grounds that it is the
 "literary equivalent of political Fascism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 Graves's claim that "at no period have the cultured classes been able
 to force the habit of tidiness on the nation as whole" (<I>I,</I> 31)
 contrasts with Woolf's proposal, which favors the dissemination of the
 English highbrow's standard of "aesthetic merit" (<I>HH,</I> 29). It thus
 makes sense that an earlier review by Leonard Woolf provides <I>Vogue</I>
 readers the literary equivalent of what he terms "caviare [for] the
 twentieth century": a fresh translation of Plato's <I>Symposium,</I> a
 volume of religious meditations by Francis Bacon, and a new edition of
 James Boswell's letters. Undaunted by the fact that these books are not
 likely to be on the shelves of many <I>Vogue</I> readers, Woolf tracks
 the concept of the "civilized" and urges consumers to partake in the
 "delicious meal" that these volumes offer.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During this interwar period in England, <I>Vogue</I> did indeed seek to
enforce "the habit of tidiness on the nation" through its dissemination,
to borrow Deirdre Lynch's phrase, of "domestic nationality," the view
that the home was a reflection of "little England."
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> readers would recognize this aestheticization of the private
 sphere in terms of the love and acquisition of English <I>things</I>
 such as servants, domestic comfort, luxury objects, manicured gardens,
 and access to national culture and celebrities. Clive Bell's reference
 to the consolidation of a "national tradition" asserts the importance
 of promoting Englishness, an objective consistent with <I>Vogue</I>'s
 mission and particularly evidenced by the magazine's elevation of
 Bloomsbury as a nationally intelligible referent of high culture. One
 anonymous 1922 editorial in particular anticipates Q. D. Leavis's attack
 on mass cultural pursuits in <I>Fiction and the Reading Public</I>
 . The <I>Vogue</I> editorialist bemoans the democratization of
 public opinion, attributing what he calls the "tyranny of the masses"
 to the rise of newspapers, telephones, and the cinema, all of which
 allegedly have contributed to a general mediocrity and "uniformity
 of opinion" that is ruining the nation. In contrast, this reviewer
 asserts, "the English aristocrat [is] the apostle of personal liberty,
 the sworn enemy to popular prejudice" (Early November 1922). <I>Vogue</I>
 invites us to read Bloomsbury, prime upholders of individual liberty and
 antipopular sentiment, as the heirs of this aristocratic tradition. If
 Aldous Huxley could caution against the dangers of a "consciously
 cultivated nationalism" in its pages, the magazine could nonetheless
 capitalize on Bloomsbury's role as promulgators of national culture to
 individual consumers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 In an editorial on "What the English Read," <I>Vogue</I> singles
 out several members of Bloomsbury (namely Forster, Woolf, Garnett,
 Nicolson, and Strachey) as the "minute number of the elite" who exhibit
 "the finest and most exacting taste in the world." Unconcerned about
 its universalizing claims, the magazine declares that their "influences
 have been very marked, not only in England," but around the globe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I>'s perception, as well as construction, of the hegemonic
 influence of the Group explains why, in April 1941, long after
 Dorothy Todd's editorship at <I>Vogue</I> had ended, the magazine ran
 a photograph of Woolf's "bomb-spliced home [with] Duncan Grant's and
 Vanessa Bell's murals on public view"; the accompanying article bemoans
 the wartime destruction of these "national treasures," suggesting that
 with the bombing of the author's private home civilization itself is
 being threatened.

This allusion to "civilization" raises an important issue, particularly
within the context of Raymond Williams's contention that Bloomsbury was
founded on a belief in the sovereignty of the "civilized individual"
and an aversion to "public show" (<I>BF,</I> 165).
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 Williams recognizes Bloomsbury's political engagement and involvement,
 but he argues that the group's "social conscience, in the end, is
 to protect the private consciousness" (<I>BF,</I> 167). A remark by
 Duncan Grant helps us to understand how the group may have reconciled
 its cultivation of private conscience with its compromised

<B></B>

participation in the Englishness of the <I>Vogue</I> agenda. In response
to those who opposed the Group's participation in the magazine, Grant
maintained "if Bloomsbury has real pearls, they can be scattered anywhere
without harm."
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 This statement speaks to the Group's investment in a kind of cultural
 paternalism that inculcates its value of private sensibility on a
 national level through the venue of a lady's magazine. Bloomsbury
 achieved this through its ideological dissociation between the public and
 private sphere. For example, the Group's hostility to both militarism
 and imperialism did not prevent their association with a magazine
 that, in 1924, devoted several pages in two separate issues to the
 propagandistic British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, which reproduced in
 miniature the entire resources of the British empire and was intended
 to foster inter-Imperial trade, open new markets for British products,
 and demonstrate to the people of Britain their almost illimitable
 possibilities overseas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I> ran many photographs of this colossal 220-acre colonial
 spectacle--visited by over 26 million people--displaying the Exhibition's
 palaces of Industry, Architecture, and Engineering, and showcasing the
 pavilions, among others, of Burma, Nigeria, India, and Hong Kong. Several
 ethnographic exhibits of "primitive peoples" provided visitors with
 distractions, such as the recreation of a scene from "native African life
 . . . in the Gold Coast," which appeared "strange to European eyes,"
 or the West African tableaux that featured a reproduction of reclining
 "natives at home" armed with "primitive weapons."
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 Some displays actually housed indigenous peoples; as Brian Street
 observes, the exhibition was understood to have pedagogical value
 for the English visitor, contrasting a modern, civilized self with a
 non-European, primitive Other.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I>'s text reveals that visitors to Wembley could tour the
 "dominions" by sampling "native dishes" in the Exhibition's many
 restaurants: one could lunch in South Africa, take tea in India, and
 dine in New Zealand, Australia, or Canada.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Virginia Woolf visited the Exhibition with Leonard and even published,
though notably <I>not</I> in <I>Vogue,</I> a critical essay that imagined
its fantastic destruction, so it is important to clarify that appearing
in the magazine does not necessarily imply that one condones or endorses
its content.
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 One doubts, for example, that Woolf was consulted in 1927 when the
 magazine quoted from <I>To the Lighthouse</I> in an article on "Cooking
 Within the Empire," using Mrs. Ramsay's French stew, improbably, to
 argue that English cooks should internationalize their kitchens by
 using colonial products.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 Appearing in <I>Vogue</I> may not have constituted a clear endorsement of
 the Empire, but it did put its contributors in a politically precarious
 position, particularly given the Anglocentric nature of Bloomsbury and
 its commitment to creating, in Leonard Woolf's words, a new world based
 upon "rational" and "civilized" relations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Although Leonard himself spent seven years as a district administrator
 in Ceylon (1904-11), he went on to produce three important
 anti-imperialist tracts during the 1920s; when <I>Vogue</I> singled
 him out for its "Hall of Fame" in late January 1924, it did so in part
 because of his "vast knowledge of imperial politics," though no mention
 was made of his stocks and shares in "imperial ventures."
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>
 This kind of contradiction

<B></B>

is thrown into relief by <I>Vogue,</I> which documents the fact that
despite Bloomsbury's general anti-imperialism the Group was ultimately
unfazed by its association with a magazine that consistently represented
the British Empire as the best form of internationalism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Vogue</I>'s profiling of Wembley's exoticism is only the most striking
example of the magazine's imperial content and its representation of
the English encounter with, and appropriation of, the Other. The 1920s
was a decade in which <I>Vogue</I> high society embraced a range of
non-European materials; the Russian ballet was a tremendous influence
in the world of fashion and design; Englishwomen adopted the Oriental
look, wearing Turkish trousers, Egyptian turbans, and Japanese kimonos.
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>
 Everything Black was "the rage," from Josephine Baker--whom the magazine
 celebrated as "a woman possessed, a savage intoxiated with tom-toms"--to
 black and white interiors, Babangi masks, African bangles to the elbows,
 and "all-coloured revues."
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 <I>Vogue</I>'s obsession with ethnographic objects extends to the
 joys of consumer tourism; several articles urge readers to vacation
 among "simple, primitive" African cultures and to visit the "barbaric
 splendors" of the Orient.
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
The lure of trips to colonial posts held particular appeal for the
English, for as <I>Vogue</I> put it in an article on South Africa, the
"prophecies of the early colonists have been more than fulfilled."
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 The travel articles never mention race or indigenous populations, unless
 it is to stress their exoticism or mark their nonhumanness, and instead
 the magazine spotlights England's tremendous "civilizing" achievements
 abroad. One woman offers an account of the difficulty of being the mother
 of a debutante in an outpost of empire, assuring readers that there will
 be British ladies "of social standing" to help "guide their daughters
 through their first season." Elsewhere, a woman on an expedition to
 Kurdistan advises English visitors to avoid the "smelly and dirty"
 Kurdish harems, while another, upon learning that girls are put into the
 harem at age twelve, erupts: "Such is the perversity of the Orient!" As
 Inderpal Grewel has argued, Englishwomen during this period tended to
 respond to the harem as a space of not only confinement but inferiority.
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>
 This perspective is consistently upheld by <I>Vogue</I>'s representation
 of colonial women; the colonies are imaginatively possible as tourist
 attractions only because England had made them habitable. One essay on
 South Africa, in particular, clearly demonstrates this view. The author
 asserts that "no where have the more liberal principles of British
 Imperialism been so strikingly manifested" than South Africa, boasting
 that over 800 million pounds of gold and diamonds have been mined, but
 no mention is made of the exploited indigenous manual labor.
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>
 Throughout <I>Vogue</I>'s pages, the advertisements echo these
 achievements of empire, promoting the power and influence of Britain
 through the fetishization of national commodities: consumers can book
 flights on "Imperial Airways," purchase portable typewriters known as
 "The Imperial Good Companion" (its parts "made entirely in England"),
 and drive an expensive Empire Car. As one jingoistic ad for petroleum
 succinctly puts it, British products are "a guarantee of quality" so
 "Buy British!"

<I>Vogue</I> documents the degree to which the rhetoric of nationalism
and colonialism is a central feature of modern British consciousness,
illustrating the marketability of "national culture" and the country's
investment in "civilizing" and appropriating non-Western cultures. The
magazine's representation of Bloomsbury situates the Group at the center
of this ideological juncture, demonstrating both their fascination
with primitivism and orientalism as art modes, and their contempt
for non-Western opinions and values. A range of examples documents
Bloomsbury's relation to exoticism. <I>Vogue</I> celebrates "the influence
of Negro sculpture" on Duncan Grant's work, showcasing costume designs

 Clive Bell, like Huxley, puts out a "plea for No More Jazz" on the

 In the 1920s Woolf recorded her attendance at "the Niggers' show in

 African objects, permeates the magazine's pages.
<SUP><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></SUP>
 Like other modernists, Fry's praise for the primitive was couched in
 assumptions about the superiority of western culture; his view that

Cumulatively, what Bloomsbury's appearance in <I>Vogue</I> illustrates
is an engagement with "primitive" materials, an intermittent disdain
for non-European peoples, and an investment in marketing culture and
"civilized living" to a certain class of English individuals. Despite
Clive Bell's stated contempt for unabashed consumerism,

<B></B>

the congruence between his tracts on civilization and <I>Vogue</I>'s own
commercial objectives is striking. In <I>Civilization: An Essay,</I>
Bell links consumerism with degradation, seeing the two as deplorable
markers of a lower-class mentality. In contrast to those who embody a
"will to civilization," the average British working class man obsesses
about commodities, a result not of economic need but of his ignoble
character and lack of ambition (<I>C,</I> 262).
<SUP><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></SUP>
 Startling about this assessment is not only Bell's classism but
 also his blindness to his own commodification by <I>Vogue.</I> One
 of the magazine's objectives under Todd's leadership was to keep
 its mass upper-class audience up to date on cultural events; more
 than any other Bloomsberry, Clive Bell serves as the cheerleader and
 translator of avant-garde aesthetics for a popular audience. Revered
 by the magazine as a cultural celebrity--the late October 1924 issue
 celebrates him as "the most remarkable" art critic in Europe--Bell's
 reviews elevate <I>Vogue</I>'s market savvy by packaging and urging
 the consumption of high art: French paintings at the Tate; designs by
 English Post-Impressionists at London Galleries; shows by Picasso,
 Cezanne, Braque, Matisse, and Seurat; and surrealist, futurist, and
 dadaist exhibitions. Throughout the 1920s he functions as a curator of
 and guide to modernist art, representing radical modernity in easily
 consumable bites.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Speaking broadly, both Bell and British <I>Vogue</I> concur that
civilization consists in self-expression, good manners, leisure,
a discriminating taste for beauty, an appreciation of the arts,
and a dislike of vulgarity. Significantly, both assume that strict
social stratification between the classes is needed to secure England's
civilization. The first of Bell's two books on civilization, <I>On British
Freedom,</I> was reviewed by <I>Vogue</I> in the early October 1923 issue,
when the author was praised as "a champion of our decaying liberties."
<SUP><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></SUP>
 Bell's hierarchical theory of civilization stipulates that "no one
 . . . can become highly civilized without a fair measure of material
 security" (<I>C,</I> 209), and the only way to ensure this security is
 through a service class that will maintain "the existence of a leisured
 class" (<I>C,</I> 210).
<SUP><a NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">99</a></SUP>
 According to Bell, civilization is by nature an "artificial" construct
 (<I>C,</I> 173), <I>requiring</I> the existence of a "civilizing elite"
 because "only a leisured class will produce a highly civilized" society
 (<I>C,</I> 217). While I do not mean to suggest that Bell's controversial
 theory of civilization is representative either of Bloomsbury's views
 as a whole or Woolf's in particular, one might argue that his vision
 of an insulated, "highly civilized . . . nucleus" (<I>C,</I> 260) of
 economically privileged individuals who create civility by, literally,
 "forming groups" (<I>C,</I> 171) sounds a lot like Bloomsbury.
<SUP><a NAME="REF100" HREF="#FOOT100">100</a></SUP>
 Bell's theory is popularly disseminated by <I>Vogue</I> both through its
 pervasive assumption that its readers constitute a civilizing elite and
 its message that to be completely civilized one must, as Bell puts it,
 possess a "taste for excellence," "be free from material cares," and
 accumulate "some of the superfluities of life" (<I>C,</I> 208, 209, 211).
<SUP><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></SUP>
 An editorial by Aldous Huxley on "The Dangers of Work" alludes to
 Bell's theory by passionately arguing for the virtues of a leisured
 class. Huxley here proposes that the dignity of labor is considerably
 overrated; he provides a corrective to this model by urging the English
 public to reinstate an "ideal leisured society" that will "cultivate
 the graces of the spirit" and protect culture "from the

<B></B>

effects of popular prejudice." Like Bell, Huxley believes that leisure
enables people to cultivate "good taste and an open mind," and also like
Bell, he naturalizes the hierarchy by stipulating that certain people
have a "hereditary right" to their leisure-class status.
<SUP><a NAME="REF102" HREF="#FOOT102">102</a></SUP>
 It is crucial to recognize that Bell's theory of civilization does not
 define itself in terms of the formation of a nation-state but rather
 through the influence and dissemination of the individual mind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></SUP>
 This focus on "private consciousness" recalls Williams's observation
 that Bloomsbury's ideological commitment was to "the supreme value of
 the civilized <I>individual</I> whose pluralization, as more and more
 civilized individuals, was . . . the only acceptable social direction"
 ("BF," 165). Williams's word here, "pluralization," unintentionally
 alludes to a crucial aspect of the Group's appearance in <I>Vogue</I>:
 the multiplication of a culturally produced image of, to use Bell's
 phrase, "highly civilized men and women" distributed through newsstands
 and into people's homes through mass circulation (<I>C,</I> 172). Like
 Bloomsbury, the magazine understood itself to be a civilizing agent, "a
 living force in all of the civilized corners of the world" (<I>MV,</I>
 142).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Neither Bell nor Williams adequately theorizes the gendered aspect of
Bloomsbury's social vision, leaving unexamined what the central term,
civilization, might mean for women in the Group.
<SUP><a NAME="REF104" HREF="#FOOT104">104</a></SUP>
 Although Woolf was privately critical of Bell's views in her diary,
 her letters to him reveal a very different response, referring to
 <I>Civilization</I> as "brilliant, witty and suggestive . . . full of
 really new and original things" (<I>L,</I> 3:438). Woolf's evaluation of
 Bell's theory is characterized by ambivalence, a response reflected in
 her remark about women's relation to civilization in <I>A Room of One's
 Own,</I> where she refers to women's split-consciousness as occupying
 a position precariously both in and outside of culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF105" HREF="#FOOT105">105</a></SUP>
 As Brian Shaeffer recognizes, the widest rift between Bell and Woolf is
 over the role of women in civilization. Bell writes that he "has heard
 ladies say that the measure of a people's civility is the position it
 accords to women," but his tract is an extended argument against this
 position (<I>C,</I> 24). He sees women as a "means to civility," not
 its objective, an antifeminist premise that Woolf clearly would have
 repudiated (<I>C,</I> 238). Like Bell, and Bloomsbury in general, Woolf
 subscribed to the notion that "civilization is more of an individual
 than a collective phenomenon," but her feminist critique of empire
 ultimately positions women as the only truly "civilized" subjects.
<SUP><a NAME="REF106" HREF="#FOOT106">106</a></SUP>
 In contrast, Bell's view that women execute a purely utilitarian cultural
 function suggests that the only authentically "civilized" subject is
 male, a perspective that corresponds to Huxley's critique of "women
 of leisure" in his <I>Vogue</I> essay, "The Dangers of Work." There,
 Huxley nostalgically bemoans the days when "there were still men of
 leisure" in society, arguing that "man's real place is in the home
 . . . [where he can] exercise his native powers of abstraction." The
 assumption here, of course, is that women have passion only for the
 concrete, the immediate, and the practical, a view that the magazine
 upholds through its refusal to level all differences between the sexes
 and its submission of women's artistic production to masculine standards
 of value. <I>Vogue</I> illustrates the degree to which popular markers
 of femininity inform the commodification

<B></B>

 of the female artist, and it amply demonstrates the complicities
 between Anglo-modernist practice, mass consumption, and the rhetoric
 of Englishness.

Raymond Williams's contention that Bloomsbury represented the development
of "a new style" is a specific reference to the Group's embrace of
frankness, sexual tolerance, and intellectual honesty, in short, classic
Enlightenment values ("BF," 165). But the phrase also describes how
Bloomsbury, as disseminators of English style, left a profound mark on
<I>Vogue</I> throughout the 1920s. The magazine celebrates liberty, the
sworn enemy to popular prejudice, as a referent for English high culture,
revealing that the Group's celebration of the modern, civilized individual
is not separate from the contaminants of capitalism, imperialism, and
privileged consumption. <I>Vogue</I> provides us with a prime cultural
artifact that documents how, despite Bloomsbury's political involvement
and altruistic sympathies with the working class, their real affiliation
was with members of their own class. One detail in particular documents
this vividly. By sheer chance, Woolf's appearance in the May 1926 issue
coincides with the General Strike in England; not coincidental, however,
is that the magazine makes no reference to this ten-day conflict or
to the ruthless government suppression that ended it. Bloomsbury was
certainly not as apolitical as <I>Vogue</I> on the issue of the Strike,
but Woolf's comment regarding the return of "social normality" at its
conclusion captures the Group's understanding of civility: "We're going
to have a strike dinner and drink champagne with Clive, the Frys, and
other spirits" (<I>L,</I> 3:262).
<SUP><a NAME="REF107" HREF="#FOOT107">107</a></SUP>
 Bloomsbury's appearance in <I>Vogue</I> provides a frame for this
 champagne moment, conveying the degree to which the Group's political
 sympathies are always class inflected and inevitably mediated through the
 pleasures of consumption and individual refinement. Bloomsbury may never
 have acknowledged that it marketed "civilized" living, but <I>Vogue</I>
 testifies to this fact, illustrating the Group's complicity in the
 popular transmission of British high culture. As Mary Butts so astutely
 put it over sixty years ago, "Civilization is their business" ("B," 44).

meticulously researched book documents the fact that, unlike in the United
States where circulation res and advertising revenues were readily
available during the early decades of this century, such information was
extremely scarce in the United Kingdom. He does provide some statistical
res for <I>Vogue:</I> the total net paid circulation of the magazine
in 1930 was 133,931 while that of <I>Better Homes and Gardens</I> was
1,390,660; but that year the former took in $3,012,593 from advertisers,
while the latter took almost half a million dollars less, $2,515,353
(153-4). Although the Audit Bureau of Circulation was established
in Britain in 1931, long after it was accepted in North America, only a
few magazines submitted to the independent audit during the 1930s. Reed
points out that only in the 1950s and 1960s are British circulation
res completely reliable. In writing about the years 1921-1940, he
recounts that publishers were very "coy about publishing their advertising
rates, let alone their audited circulations. Readership surveys seem
to have been regarded as arcane and an unnecessary luxury" . This
view is substantiated by Caroline Seebohm, who recounts that in 1920

Nast's view that cross-identification would compel readership was not
only applicable to a certain class. According to Joseph McAleer, although
the large majority of readers of popular women's magazines during this
period came from the lower-middle and working classes, the periodicals
they enjoyed were predominantly "middle-class publications." What this

"Women and Education," <I>Vogue,</I> early February 1921. This editorial
anticipates Woolf's own concern for women's intellectual freedom in <I>A
Room of One's Own</I> and was timed to coincide with an announcement
that the Queen would accept an honorary degree at Oxford. <I>Vogue</I>
writes, "The women's part of the university will never possess the spirit
which alone justifies Oxford's existence, until it has acquired the same
freedom, intellectual as well as social, which characterizes the men's
part." It was only in 1919 that the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act
was passed, admitting women to many professions, such as the bar. The
editorial on education is one of the few that unambiguously praises
women's progress in the 1920s. This decade, after all, gave women
their sexual freedom through the work of Marie Stopes and her birth
control clinics and political freedom through the vote. No article on
Stopes's efforts was ever published, nor did the magazine document how
the vote put five million more women in a position to help elect the
second Labour government, which fought unemployment. For <I>Vogue</I>,
the 1920s was not a particularly political decade, despite historian
Olive Banks's observation that the 1920s was a period of considerable

to a Crown Colony, they are, take it all round, very fairly contented, in
spite of a rebellion or two last century in which a very limited number

This editorial illustrates the centrality of the photographic image
in the construction of a civilized self. The author recalls wandering
through magnificent botanical gardens, and recounts this dialogue:
"Someone said, 'I imagine the garden of Eden was like this,' and
another said, 'Eve will not be very difficult to find. Prepare your
cameras.' He went up to a group of pretty girls, spoke to them in Malay,
and gave them ten cents each. They straight-away slipped out of their
sarongs and four brown and smiling little Eves stood in the sunshine
amid the flowers!" (Princess Achille Murat, "A Fortnight in Java," 3
April 1929) A policeman then intrudes upon the scene, but rather than
interrupt this exploitative moment, the group "gave him fifty cents and
asked him to prevent people from stepping between our cameras and the
garden of Eden, which he complied with." Ellen Strain, "Exotic Bodies,
Distant Landscapes: Touristic Viewing and Popularized Anthropology
in the Nineteenth Century," <I>Wide Angle</I> 18, no. 2 (April 1996):
70-100, discusses photography's touristic implications, arguing
that the western possession of technology helped distinguish the leisured
tourist from the commodified Other.

Bridget Elliott and Jo-Ann Wallace, <I>Women Artists and Writers:
Modernist (im)positionings</I> (New York: Routledge, 1994), 174, n. 15,
discuss this point. For an example of <I>Vogue</I>'s display of Omega
products, see Judith Collins, <I>The Omega Workshops</I> (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1984), plates 90, 95. Collins's book also
contains a press photograph of Vanessa Bell wearing an Omega dress of her
own design (plate 55). Bell anticipated that her designs for the Omega
Workshop would be a "great success," but this dressmaking scheme never
materialized; see <I>Selected Letters of Vanessa Bell,</I> ed. Regina
Marler (New York: Pantheon, 1993), 174. Woolf's shocked response to
her sister's Omega dresses perhaps gives some indication of why the
venture was never a success: "My God! What colours you are responsible
for! Karin's clothes almost wrenched my eyes from the sockets--a skirt
barred with reds and yellows of the vilest kind, and a pea green blouse
on top, with a gaudy handkerchief on her head, supposed to be the very
boldest taste. I shall retire into dove colour and old lavender, with a
lace collar, and lawn wristlets" (<I>Letters 2</I>:111). Despite this
evidence of Bell's interest in the marketplace, like her sister, she
exhibits considerable professional anxiety about public recognition and
retains a belief in the public/private split. Her confession to Duncan
Grant--"It's awful selling pictures <I>in person</I>"--situates her in a
position analogous to Woolf's own, that is, interested in making money
but repulsed by the publicness of that exchange (<I>Letters of Vanessa

that Male Technique Is Entirely Unsuitable to the Poetry of Women,"
<I>Vogue,</I> early March 1925, similarly speaks to this literary interest
in maintaining a sexual boundary, making the claim that only male poets
are able to utilize free verse effectively. Sitwell sees H. D. as an
"exception" to this rule, rather than an occasion to interrogate the
premise of her argument. Similarly, in Herbert Farjeon, "The Mystery
of the Woman Playwright," <I>Vogue,</I> 5 March 1930, the notion that
female authorship is inherently limited remains unquestioned: "Why is
it that women (speaking generally rather than particularly) cannot write
plays? . . . What bluestocking even with a room of her own in Blooomsbury
can claim to have achieved in drama anything approaching the position
of Virginia Woolf?" Throughout <I>Vogue</I>'s pages, Woolf is celebrated

Power," <I>Vogue,</I> early May 1921. This article contrasts male and
female differences through their relation to technology, arguing that
"men have mechanics" while women have only "machinations." Elsewhere,
however, the magazine repeatedly appeals to women's interest in machinery;
<I>Vogue</I> is packed with ads for refrigerators and electrical lights,
as well as articles on airplane travel and automobile ownership. In
general, the magazine eroticizes women's relationship to technology
whenever possible. Thus, for example, an article on the woman driver's
point of view features a secret car compartment that opens to reveal
a powder-puff, mirror, and cigarette case, with the following copy:
"the only thing nowadays that may cause the slightest perplexity to the
woman motorist . . . is the question of lubrication" ("Round and About,"

Among the women featured on the magazine's "Women of Distinction"
page (early October 1924) are H. D., Stein, and Rebecca West, none of
whom, like Woolf elsewhere, returns the camera's gaze. In contrast,
a 1923 photograph of D. H. Lawrence--in a suit and tie, arms folded,
gazing seriously into the viewer's eyes--exemplifies the magazine's
representation of the male artist as a re of authority. This is
consistent with the magazine's photographic representation of the male
members of Bloomsbury. An unsigned essay on new books, published in early
October 1923, features a photograph of Clive Bell, wearing a hat, gloves,
overcoat, and walking stick, staring directly into the camera. Beneath
his image is a photo of David Garnett, similarly suited and also gazing

Duncan Grant. For other examples of <I>Vogue</I>'s representation of
women artists, see "The Women's International Art Club," late April
1920--in which women's presumed "lack" is the premise of the essay--and
"The Feminine in Art," early March 1922, which makes the case that
"typically feminine" paintings are delicate, in good taste, and reflect
a feeling for that which is small, immediate, and domestic. In other
words, "feminine" artistic products conform to <I>Vogue</I>'s dominant
characterization of the female body.

Augustus John, "The Woman Artist," <I>Vogue,</I> 18 April 1928. Given
<I>Vogue</I>'s anxiety about women's professionalism, it makes sense
that the magazine would only select paintings by both Bell and Marie
Laurencin that reflected a "feminine" perspective. It is certainly
true that a large number of Bell's paintings are of mothers, children,
and domestic objects, and Laurencin herself identified her style as
quintessentially feminine. The magazine echoes this sentiment, putting
Laurencin's drawings on its covers in the 1920s and gushing about her
work: "So feminine, so personal is she that we cannot help thinking of
her as the sister of Sappho" (Polly Flinders, "Marie Laurencin: A Graceful
and Melancholy Temperament Reflected in Pictures of Young Girls, Nymphs,
Nosegays, and Wild Animals," <I>Vogue,</I> late January 1925). Despite
this surprising allusion, there is no overt or subtle reference to
homoeroticism in the evaluation of either woman's paintings. Despite
Fry's critique of the double standard, he still attends to "the woman's
point of view" in Bell's work. For a discussion of the work of women
artists and modernism, see Gil Perry, <I>Women Artists and the Parisian

Street does not write explicitly about the British Empire Exhibition
at Wembley, but his discussion of the Japan-British Exhibition of 1910
elucidates the ways in which the exhibition, and the photographic images
and postcards that accompanied it, "[are] to be understood within this
construction of a modern, civilized self in contrast with a primitive
'Other'" (Brian Street, "British Popular Anthropology: Exhibiting
and Photographing the Other," in <I>Anthropology and Photography
1860-1920</I>, ed. Elizabeth Edwards [New Haven: Yale University
Press, 1992], 126). Street argues that these "ethnographic shows were
seen not simply as 'entertainment' but as having educational value:
through them British society learnt about the 'other' peoples of the
earth. Members of 'savage' countries were taken to England and other
European societies in remarkable numbers to be viewed as specimens or
zoo-like exhibits, to satisfy curiosity and to reinforce the confidence
of the public in their own 'progress'" . Geoffrey Hewlett reveals
that several exhibits housed not reproductions but indigenous peoples,
such as the British Guiana and West Indies display that featured "natives
. . . working at various crafts," or the "spectacular" India Pavilion,
in which "Tibetan dancers gave a continuous performance" (Hewlett, <I>A

Wembley extended over fifteen miles of roadways with names chosen by
Rudyard Kipling; the exhibition grounds also featured art galleries, a
small basilica, an amusement park, and even a scenic railway. John Allwood
provides some interesting details about Britain's self-promotion at
Wembley, pointing out that one of the most widely remembered exhibits was
a giant statue in the Canadian Pavilion of the Prince of Wales, President
of the Exhibition, made entirely of butter--a colonial product. He also
reveals that the official symbol for the exhibition, a lion whose design
reflected the current preoccupation with "things Egyptian," was widely
critiqued on the grounds that it was "very un-English and, therefore,
exceedingly disturbing" (Allwood, <I>The Great Exhibitions,</I> 129).

The Woolfs visited the British Empire Exhibition on 29 May 1924; see
<I>The Diary of Virginia Woolf, 1920-1924</I>, ed. Anne Olivier Bell
(London: The Hogarth Press, 1978), 2:305. Woolf's essay, "Thunder at
Wembley," was first published on 28 June 1924. In this piece Woolf pits
nature against the presumed culture of Wembley, imagining its destruction
at the hands of "some malignant power" that arises, undetected, out
of the sky, and ends with a conflagration: "Colonies are perishing
and dispersing in spray of inconceivable beauty and terror. . . . Ash
and violet are the colours of its decay. . . . Humanity is rushing to
destruction, but humanity is accepting its doom. . . . The empire is
perishing; the bands are playing; the Exhibition is in ruins" (Woolf,
"Thunder at Wembley," <I>The Essays of Virginia Woolf,</I> ed. Andrew
McNeillie [London: The Hogarth Press, 1994], 3:413). We can situate
Woolf's essay within the larger context of what John M. MacKenzie
describes as the intellectual elite's hostility toward Wembley: "The
exhibition was derided by intellectuals, who formed the WGTW, Won't Go to
Wembley, Society" (<I>Imperialism and Popular Culture</I>, 8). An example
of this critique in <I>Vogue</I> is an article by Osbert Sitwell, which
denounces the Exhibition on the grounds that it eclipses Britain's role
in the "smothering" of native cultures. However, the proliferation of
visual images of England's imperial strength is so overwhelming that his
comment is ultimately ineffectual. Even Sitwell acknowledges that there
are multiple "pleasures to be found" among the displays, where a variety
of manufactured goods derived from colonial raw materials were for sale
(Osbert Sitwell, "The Empire Exhibition," <I>Vogue,</I> late June 1924).

of men and women performing the Charleston; the text reads, in part:
"In the 18th century we made money out of negroes. In the 20th they make
money out of us. We used to send them missionaries, now we send them
telegrams." The article, "Enter, The New Negro, a Distinctive Type,"

has to be either a Pullman car porter, or over-fond of watermelons, in
order to be a successful type on our stage." In "The Truth About Jazz,"
jazz is revealed to be a "return to Nature," but not "the elegiac Nature

Marianna Torgovnick, <I>Gone Primitive: Savage Intellects, Modern
Lives</I> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990), 85-104,
devotes a chapter to Roger Fry's politics and aesthetics. Torgovnick
argues that reading Fry on the primitive is "like witnessing a tug of
war: on the one side . . . is the innovative Fry, free of contemporary
prejudices; on the other side . . . a Fry who thinks and speaks in the
rhetoric of colonialism" . Despite Fry's limitations, as Torgovnick
points out, he was the premier art theorist in Britain and virtually
the first who was willing to follow the French avant-garde in treating
African objects as art. Christopher Reed, <I>A Roger Fry Reader</I>
(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 232-45, offers a
fresh interpretation of Fry and discusses the critic's relation to
the primitive. Although <I>Vogue</I> neglects Fry's essays on African
art, it does celebrate Carl Einstein's <I>Negerplastik</I> as the
definitive book on "negro sculpture," applauding the text for being the
first to discuss at length the importance of African art even though
"its intrinsic value is still less appreciated in England" than on the
continent. See Einstein's appearance in "The Hall of Fame," <I>Vogue,</I>

direct in his assessment of the problems with civilization here. In his

theory of civilization and its relation to Bloomsbury; he also details
Woolf's ambivalence towards Bell's controversial ideas. Although Woolf was
privately critical of Bell's book, it is interesting to note the parallel
between his reference to fifth-century Athens as "civilization . . . at
its best" (<I>C,</I> 152), and her comments that, "Roger [Fry] is the

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this essay, I wish to reassess the juncture of cinema and modernism,
and I will do so by moving from the example of early Soviet cinema to
a seemingly less likely case, that of the classical Hollywood film. My
inquiry is inspired by two complementary sets of questions: one pertaining
to what cinema studies can contribute to our understanding of modernism
and modernity; the other aimed at whether and how the perspective of
modernist aesthetics may help us to elucidate and reframe the history
and theory of cinema. The juncture of cinema and modernism has been
explored in a number of ways, ranging from research on early cinema's
interrelations with the industrial-technological modernity of the late
nineteenth century, through an emphasis on the international art cinemas
of both interwar and new wave periods, to speculations on the cinema's
implication in the distinction between the modern and the postmodern.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 My focus here will be more squarely on mid-twentieth-century
 modernity, roughly from the 1920s through the 1950s--the modernity
 of mass production, mass consumption, and mass annihilation--and the
 contemporaneity of a particular kind of cinema, mainstream Hollywood,
 with what has variously been labelled "high" or "hegemonic modernism."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Whether or not one agrees with the postmodernist challenge to modernism
and modernity at large, it did open up a space for understanding modernism
as a much wider, more diverse phenomenon, eluding any single-logic
genealogy that

<B></B>

runs, say, from Cubism to Abstract Expressionism, from T. S. Eliot,
Ezra Pound, James Joyce, and Franz Kafka to Samuel Beckett and Alain
Robbe-Grillet, from Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg to Karlheinz Stockhausen. For
more than a decade now scholars have been dislodging that genealogy and
delineating alternative forms of modernism, both in the West and in other
parts of the world, that vary according to their social and geopolitical
locations, often conred along the axis of post/coloniality, and
according to the specific subcultural and indigenous traditions to which
they responded.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 In addition to opening up the modernist canon, these studies assume a
 notion of modernism that is "more than a repertory of artistic styles,"
 more than sets of ideas pursued by groups of artists and intellectuals.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Rather, modernism encompasses a whole range of cultural and artistic
 practices that register, respond to, and reflect upon processes
 of modernization and the experience of modernity, including a
 paradigmatic transformation of the conditions under which art is
 produced, transmitted, and consumed. In other words, just as modernist
 aesthetics are not reducible to the category of style, they tend to blur
 the boundaries of the institution of art in its traditional, eighteenth-
and nineteenth-century incarnation that turns on the ideal of aesthetic
 autonomy and the distinction of "high" vs. "low," of autonomous art
 vs. popular and mass culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Focusing on the nexus between modernism and modernity, then, also implies
a wider notion of the aesthetic, one that situates artistic practices
within a larger history and economy of sensory perception that Walter
Benjamin for one saw as the decisive battleground for the meaning and
fate of modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 While the spread of urban-industrial technology, the large-scale
 disembedding of social (and gender) relations, and the shift to mass
 consumption entailed processes of real destruction and loss, there
 also emerged new modes of organizing vision and sensory perception, a
 new relationship with "things," different forms of mimetic experience
 and expression, of affectivity, temporality, and reflexivity, a
 changing fabric of everyday life, sociability, and leisure. From this
 perspective, I take the study of modernist aesthetics to encompass
 cultural practices that both articulated and mediated the experience
 of modernity, such as the mass-produced and mass-consumed phenomena of
 fashion, design, advertising, architecture and urban environment, of
 photography, radio, and cinema. I am referring to this kind of modernism
 as "vernacular" (and avoiding the ideologically overdetermined term
 "popular") because the term vernacular combines the dimension of the
 quotidian, of everyday usage, with connotations of discourse, idiom,
 and dialect, with circulation, promiscuity, and translatability. In the
 latter sense, finally, this essay will also address the vexed issue of
 Americanism, the question of why and how an aesthetic idiom developed in
 one country could achieve transnational and global currency, and how this
 account might add to and modify our understanding of classical cinema.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I begin with an example that takes us back to one standard paradigm of
twentieth-century modernism: Soviet cinema and the context of Soviet
avant-garde aesthetics. At the 1996 festival of silent film in Pordenone,
the featured program was a selection of early Soviet films made between
1918-1924, that is, before the great era

<B></B>

of montage cinema, before the canonical works of Sergei Eisenstein,
V. I. Pudovkin, Dziga Vertov, and Alexandr Dovzhenko. The question that
guided the viewing of these films was, of course, how Russian cinema
got from the Old to the New within a rather short span of time; how the
sophisticated mise-en-scene cinema of the Czarist era, epitomized by the
work of Yevgenij Bauer, was displaced by Soviet montage aesthetics. Many
of the films shown confirmed what film historians, following Lev Kuleshov,
had vaguely assumed before: that this transformation was mediated, to a
significant degree, by the impact of Hollywood. American films began to
dominate Russian screens as early as 1915 and by 1916 had become the main
foreign import. Films made during the years following 1917, even as they
stage revolutionary plots for "agit" purposes, may display interesting
thematic continuities with Czarist cinema (in particular a strong critique
of patriarchy) and still contain amazing compositions in depth.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Increasingly, however, the mise-en-scene is broken down according to
 classical American principles of continuity editing, spatio-temporal
 coherence, and narrative causality. A famous case in point is Kuleshov's
 1918 directorial debut, <I>Engineer Prait's Project,</I> a film that
 employed Hollywood-style continuity guidelines in a polemical break
 with the slow pace of Russian "quality pictures."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 But the "American accent" in Soviet film--a faster cutting rate, closer
 framing, and the breakdown of diegetic space--was more pervasive
 and can be found as well, in varying degrees of consistency, in
 the work of other directors (Vladimir Gardin, Ceslav Sabinskij, Ivan
 Perestiani). Hyperbolically speaking, one might say that Russian cinema
 became Soviet cinema by going through a process of Americanization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To be sure, Soviet montage aesthetics did not emerge fullblown from the
encounter with Hollywood-style continuity editing; it is unthinkable
without the new avant-garde movements in art and theater, without
Constructivism, Suprematism, Productivism, Futurism--unthinkable without a
politics of radical transformation. Nor was continuity editing perceived
as neutral, as simply the most "efficient" way of telling a story. It
was part and parcel of the complex of "Americanism" (or, as Kuleshov
referred to it, "Americanitis") that catalyzed debates on modernity and
modernist movements in Russia as it did in other countries.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 As elsewhere, the enthusiasm for things American, tempered by a
 critique of capitalism, took on a variety of meanings, forms, and
 functions. Discussing the impact of American on Soviet cinema, Yuri
 Tsivian distinguishes between two kinds of Americanism: one, stylistic
 borrowings of the classical kind described above ("American montage,"
 "American foreground"), and two, a fascination with the "lower genres,"
 with adventure serials, detective thrillers, and slapstick comedies that,
 Tsivian argues, were actually more influential during the transitional
 years. If the former kind of Americanism aspired to formal standards
 of narrative efficiency, coherence, and motivation, the latter was
 concerned with external appearance, the sensual, material surface of
 American films; their use of exterior locations; their focus on action
 and thrills, physical stunts and attractions; their tempo, directness,
 and flatness; their eccentricity and excess of situations over plot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Tsivian analyzes the Americanism of the "lower" genres as an intellectual
fashion or taste. Discerning "something of a slumming mentality" in
Eisenstein's or FEKS' fascination with "serial queen" melodramas, he
situates the preference of Soviet filmmakers for "cinematic pulp fiction"
(Victor Shklovsky) in the context of the leftist avant-garde's attack
on high art, cultural pretensions, and western ideals of naturalism
("BON," 43).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 What interests me in this account is less the intellectual and artistic
 intertext than the connection it suggests, <I>across</I> the distinction,
 between the two faces of American cinema: the classical norm, as an
 emergent form that was to dominate domestic as well as foreign markets
 for decades to come, and the seemingly nonclassical, or less classical,
 undercurrent of genres that thrive on something other than or, at the
 very least, oblique to the classical norm. What also interests me in
 the dynamics of Americanism and Soviet film is the way they urge us to
 reconsider the relationship between classical cinema and modernism, a
 relationship that within cinema studies has habitually been thought of
 as an opposition, as one of fundamentally incompatible registers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The opposition between classicism and modernism has a venerable history
in literature, art, and philosophy, with classicism linked to the model
of tradition and modernism to the rhetoric of a break with precisely
that tradition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 In that general sense, there would be no problem with importing this
 opposition into the field of cinema and film history, with classical
 cinema falling on the side of tradition and alternative film practices
 on the side of modernism. If, however, we consider the cinema as
 part of the historical formation of modernity, as a larger set of
 cultural and aesthetic, technological, economic, social, and political
 transformations, the opposition of classical cinema and modernism,
 the latter understood as a discourse articulating and responding to
 modernity, becomes a more complicated issue.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I am using "classical cinema" here as a technical term that has played
a crucial part in the formation of cinema studies as an academic
discipline. The term came to serve as a foundational concept in the
analysis of the dominant form of narrative cinema, epitomized by Hollywood
during the studio era. In that endeavor, "classical cinema" referred to
roughly the same thing whether you were doing semiotics, psychoanalytic
film theory, neoformalist poetics, or revisionist film history. This is
not to say that it <I>meant</I> the same thing, and just a brief glimpse
at its key moments will illustrate the transvaluations and disjunctures
of the term.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not coincidentally, the reference to Hollywood products as "classical"
has a French pedigree. As early as 1926, Jean Renoir uses the phrase
"cinematic classicism" (in this case referring to Charlie Chaplin and
Ernst Lubitsch).
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 A more specific usage of the term occurs in Robert Brasillach and Maurice
 Bard&egrave;che's <I>Histoire de cin&eacute;ma,</I> in particular
 in the second edition of 1943, revised with a collaborationist bent,
 where the authors refer to the style evolved in American sound film of
 1933-1939 as the "classicism of the 'talkie.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 After the Occupation, critics, notably Andr&eacute; Bazin, began to speak
 of Hollywood filmmaking as "a classical art." By the 1950s, Bazin would
 celebrate John Ford's <I>Stagecoach</I>  as "the ideal example
 of the maturity of a style brought to classic perfection," comparing
 the film to "a wheel,

<B></B>

so perfectly made that it remains in equilibrium on its axis in any
position."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 This classical quality of American film, to quote Bazin's well-known
 statement, is due not to individual talent but to "the genius of the
 system, the richness of its ever-vigorous tradition, and its fertility
 when it comes into contact with new elements."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first major transvaluation of the concept of classical cinema
came with post-1968 film theory, in the all-round critique of ideology
directed against the very system celebrated by Bazin. In this critique,
formulated along Althusserian and Lacanian lines and from marxist and
later feminist positions, classical Hollywood cinema was analyzed as a
mode of representation that masks the process and fact of production,
turns discourse into diegesis, history into story and myth; as an
apparatus that sutures the subject in an illusory coherence and identity;
and as a system of stylistic strategies that weld pleasure and meaning
to reproduce dominant social and sexual hierarchies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 The notion of classical cinema elaborated in the pages of <I>Cahiers du
 Cin&eacute;ma,</I> <I>Cin&eacute;thique,</I> <I>Screen,</I> <I>Camera
 Obscura</I> and elsewhere was less indebted to a neoclassicist ideal,
 as it still was for Bazin and Rohmer, than to the writings of Roland
 Barthes, in particular <I>S/Z</I> , which attached the label
 of a "classic," "readerly," ostensibly transparent text to the
 nineteenth-century realist novel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another turn in the conception of classical cinema entails the rejection
of any evaluative usage of the term, whether celebratory or critical,
in favor of a more descriptive, presumably value-free and scientifically
valid account. This project has found its most comprehensive realization
to date in David Bordwell, Janet Staiger, and Kristin Thompson's
monumental and impressive study, <I>The Classical Hollywood Cinema: Film
Style and Mode of Production to 1960</I> . The authors conceive
of classical cinema as an integral, coherent system, a system that
interrelates a specific mode of production (based on Fordist principles
of industrial organization) and a set of interdependent stylistic norms
that were elaborated by 1917 and remained more or less in place until
about 1960. The underlying notion of classical film style, rooted in
neoformalist poetics and cognitive psychology, overlaps in part with
the account of the classical paradigm in 1970s film theory, particularly
with regard to principles of narrative dominance, linear and unobtrusive
narration centering on the psychology and agency of individual characters,
and continuity editing. But where psychoanalytic-semiotic theorists
pinpoint unconscious mechanisms of identification and the ideological
effects of "realism," Bordwell and Thompson stress thorough motivation
and coherence of causality, space, and time; clarity and redundancy in
guiding the viewer's mental operations; formal patterns of repetition
and variation, rhyming, balance, and symmetry; and overall compositional
unity and closure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 In Bordwell's formulation, "the principles which Hollywood claims as its
 own rely on notions of decorum, proportion, formal harmony, respect for
 tradition, mimesis, self-effacing craftsmanship, and cool control of the
 perceiver's response--canons which critics in any medium usually call
 'classical'" (<I>CHC,</I> 3-4).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such a definition is not just generally "classical" but more specifically
recalls neoclassicist standards, from seventeenth-century neo-Aristotelian
theories of drama to eighteenth-century ideals in music, architecture,
and aesthetic theory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 (I do not

<B></B>

wish to equate eighteenth-century aesthetics at large with
the neoclassicist tradition, nor with an ahistorical reduction to
neoformalist principles; the eighteenth century was at least as much
concerned with affect and effect, with theatricality and sensation,
passion and sentiment, as with the balance of form and function.) As
in literary and aesthetic antecedents that invoke classical antiquity
as a model--recall Stendhal's definition of classicism as a style that
"gives the greatest possible pleasure to an audience's ancestors"
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
--the temporal dynamics of the term classical as applied to the cinema
is retrospective; the emphasis is on tradition and continuity rather
than newness as difference, disruption, and change.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I can see a certain revisionist pleasure in asserting the power and
persistence of classical standards in the face of a popular image
of Hollywood as anything but decorous, harmonious, traditional, and
cool. But how does this help us account for the appeal of films as
diverse as <I>Lonesome,</I> <I>Liberty,</I> <I>Freaks,</I> <I>Gold
Diggers of 1933,</I> <I>Stella Dallas,</I> <I>Fallen Angel,</I> <I>Kiss
Me Deadly,</I> <I>Bigger Than Life,</I> <I>Rock-a-Bye Baby</I> (add your
own examples)? And even if we succeeded in showing these films to be
constructed on classical principles--which I'm sure can be done--what
have we demonstrated? To repeat Rick Altman's question in an essay that
challenges Bordwell, Thompson, and Staiger's model: "How classical was
classical narrative?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Attempts to answer that rhetorical question have focused on what is
 left out, marginalized or repressed, in the totalizing account of
 classical cinema--in particular, the strong substratum of theatrical
 melodrama with its uses of spectacle and coincidence but also genres
 like comedy, horror, and pornography that involve the viewer's body
 and sensory-affective responses in ways that may not exactly conform
 to classical ideals.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Also minimized is the role of genre in general, specifically the
 affective-aesthetic division of labor among genres in structuring
 the consumption of Hollywood films. An even lesser role is granted to
 stars and stardom, which cannot be reduced to the narrative function
 of character and, like genre but even more so, involve the spheres
 of distribution, exhibition practices, and reception. <I>The Classical
 Hollywood Cinema</I> explicitly and, it should be said, with self-imposed
 consistency, brackets the history of reception and film culture--along
 with the cinema's interrelations with American culture at large.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is not my intention to contest the achievement of Bordwell, Staiger,
and Thompson's work; the book does illuminate crucial aspects of how
Hollywood cinema works and goes a long way toward accounting for the
stability and persistence of this particular cultural form. My interest
is rather in two questions that the book does <I>not</I> address, or
addresses only to close off. One question pertains to the historicity of
classical cinema, in particular its contemporaneity with twentieth-century
modernisms and modern culture; the other question is to what extent
and how the concept can be used to account for Hollywood's worldwide
hegemony. To begin with, I am interested in the anachronism involved in
asserting the priority of stylistic principles modelled on seventeenth-
and eighteenth-century neoclassicism. We are dealing with a cultural
formation that was, after all, perceived as the incarnation of <I>the
modern,</I> an aesthetic medium up-to-date with Fordist-Taylorist methods
of industrial

<B></B>

production and mass consumption, with drastic changes in social, sexual,
and gender relations, in the material fabric of everyday life, in the
organization of sensory perception and experience. For contemporaries,
Hollywood at its presumably most classical red as the very symbol
of contemporaneity, the present, modern times: "this our period," as
Gertrude Stein famously put it, "was undoubtedly the period of the cinema
and series production."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 And it held that appeal not only for avant-garde artists and
 intellectuals in the United States and the modernizing capitals of the
 world (Berlin, Paris, Moscow, Shanghai, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Sydney, Bombay)
 but also for emerging mass publics both at home and abroad. Whatever
 the economic and ideological conditions of its hegemony--and I wish by
 no means to discount them--classical Hollywood cinema could be imagined
 as a cultural practice on a par with the experience of modernity, as
 an industrially-produced, mass-based, vernacular modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In cinema studies, the juncture of the classical and the modern has,
for the most part, been written as a bifurcated history. The critique of
classical cinema in 1970s film theory took over a structuralist legacy
of binarisms, such as Barthes's opposition between the "readerly"
and "writerly," which translated into the binary conception of film
practice as either "classical-idealist," that is, ideological, or
"modernist-materialist," that is, self-reflexive and progressive. This
is particularly the case for the theory and practice of "counter cinema"
that David Rodowick has dubbed "political modernism"--from Jean-Luc Godard
and Peter Gidal through Noel Burch, Peter Wollen, Stephen Heath, Laura
Mulvey and others--that owes much to the revival or belated reception
of the 1920s and 1930s leftist avant-garde, notably Bertolt Brecht.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Moreover, the polarization of classical cinema and modernism seemed
 sufficiently warranted by skepticism vis-&agrave;-vis Hollywood's
 self-promotion as "international modern," considering how much the
 celebration of American cinema's contemporaneity, youth, vitality,
 and directness was part of the industry's own mythology deployed to
 legitimate cutthroat business practices and the relentless expansion
 of economic power worldwide.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While Bordwell and Thompson's neoformalist approach is to some extent
indebted to the political-modernist tradition, <I>The Classical Hollywood
Cinema</I> recasts the binarism of classicism and modernism in two ways.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 At the level of industrial organization, the modernity of Hollywood's
 mode of production (Fordism) is subsumed under the goal of maintaining
 the stability of the system as a whole; thus major technological and
 economic changes, such as the transition to sound, are discussed in terms
 of a search for "functional equivalents" by which the institution ensures
 the overall continuity of the paradigm (<I>CHC,</I> 304). In a similar
 vein, any stylistic deviations of the modernist kind <I>within</I>
 classical cinema--whether imports from European avant-garde and art
 films, native films noir, or work of idiosyncratic auteurs like Orson
 Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, and Otto Preminger--are cited as proof of the
 system's amazing appropriative flexibility: "So powerful is the classical
 paradigm that it regulates what may violate it" (<I>CHC,</I> 81).
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To be sure, there is ample precedent outside film history for the
assimilation of the modern to classical or neoclassicist standards;
after all, art historians speak of "classical modernism" (Picasso, de
Chirico, Leger, Picabia) and there were related tendencies in music
(Reger, Stravinsky, Poulenc, de Faya, to name just a few).
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 In modern architecture (LeCorbusier, Gropius, the Bauhaus), we
 can see the wedding of machine aesthetics to a notion of presumably
 natural functions, and in literary modernism, we have self-proclaimed
 neoclassicists such as T. E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, Ernst J&uuml;nger,
 and Jean Cocteau. In the genealogy of film theory, one of the founding
 manifestos of classical cinema is Hugo M&uuml;nsterberg's <I>The
 Psychology of the Photoplay</I> , a treatise in neo-Kantian
 aesthetics applied to the cinema. Its author was actually better known
 for books on psychology and industrial efficiency that became standard
 works for modern advertising and management. Yet, these examples should
 be all the more reason for the historian to step back and consider the
 implications of these junctures that reveal themselves as increasingly
 less disjunctive with the passing of modernity, the disintegration of
 hegemonic or high modernism, and the emergence of alternative modernisms
 from the perspective of postmodernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A key problem seems to lie in the very concept of the "classical"--as
a historical category that implies the transcendence of mere
historicity, as a hegemonic form that claims transcultural appeal and
universality. Already in its seventeenth-
and eighteenth-century usages,
the neoclassicist recourse to tradition, in whatever way it may misread or
invent a prior original, does not take us through history, but instead to
a transhistorical ideal, a timeless sense of beauty, proportion, harmony,
and balance derived from <I>nature.</I> It is no coincidence that the
neoformalist account of classical cinema is linked and elaborated in
Bordwell's work to the project of grounding film studies in the framework
of cognitive psychology.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 <I>The Classical Hollywood Cinema</I> offers an impressive account
 of a particular historical formation of the institution of American
 cinema, tracking its emergence in terms of the evolution of film style
 (Thompson) and mode of production (Staiger). But once "the system" is in
 place (from about 1917 on), its ingenuity and stability are attributed
 to the optimal engagement of <I>mental</I> structures and perceptual
 capacities that are, in Bordwell's words, "biologically hard-wired"
 and have been so for tens of thousands of years.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Classical narration ultimately amounts to a method of optimally guiding
 the viewer's attention and maximizing his or her response by way of
 more intricate plots and emotional tensions. The attempt to account
 for the efficacy of classical stylistic principles with recourse to
 cognitive psychology coincides with the effort to expand the reign of
 classical objectives to types of film practice outside Hollywood that
 had hitherto been perceived as alternative (most recently in Bordwell's
 work on Feuillade and other European traditions of staging-in-depth)
 as well as beyond the historical period demarcated in the book (that
 is, up to 1960).
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
How can we restore historical specificity to the concept of classical
Hollywood cinema? How can we make the anachronistic tension in the
combination of neoclassicist style and Fordist mass culture productive
for an understanding of both classical

<B></B>

Hollywood cinema and mass-mediated modernity? How do we distinguish,
within the category of the classical, between natural norm, canonical
cultural form, and a rhetorical strategy that perhaps enabled the
articulation of something radically new and different under the guise of
a continuity with tradition? Can there be an account of classicality that
does not unwittingly reproduce, at the level of academic discourse, the
universalist norms mobilized not least for purposes of profit, expansion,
and ideological containment? Or wouldn't we do better to abandon the
concept of classical cinema altogether and instead, as Philip Rosen and
others have opted to do, use the more neutral term "mainstream cinema"?
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For one thing, I don't think that the term "mainstream" is necessarily
clearer, let alone neutral or innocent; in addition to the connotation of
a quasi-natural flow, it suggests a homogeneity that locates side streams
and countercurrents on the outside or margins rather than addressing
the ways in which they at once become part of the institution and blur
its boundaries. For another, I would argue that, for the time being,
classical cinema is still a more precise term because it names a regime of
productivity and intelligibility that is both historically and culturally
specific, much as it gets passed off as timeless and natural (and the
efforts to do so are part of its history). In that sense, however, I
take the term to refer less to a system of functionally interrelated
norms and a corresponding set of empirical objects than to a scaffold,
matrix, or web that allows for a wide range of aesthetic effects and
experiences--that is, for cultural conrations that are more complex
and dynamic than the most accurate account of their function within any
single system may convey and that require more open-ended, promiscuous,
and imaginative types of inquiry.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From this perspective, one might argue that it would be more appropriate
to consider classical Hollywood cinema within the framework of "American
national cinema." Such a reframing would allow us, among other things,
to include independent film practices outside and against the pull of
Hollywood, such as "race films," regional, subcultural, and avant-garde
film practices. While this strategy is important, especially for teaching
American cinema, the issue of Hollywood's role in defining and negotiating
American nationality strikes me as more complicated. If we wish to
"provincialize Hollywood," to invoke Dipesh Chakrabarty's injunction
to "provincialize" European accounts of modernity, it is not enough to
consider American cinema on a par with any other national cinema--inasmuch
as that very category in many cases describes defensive formations shaped
in competition with and resistance to Hollywood products.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 In other words, the issue of classicality is bound up with the question
 of what constituted the hegemony of American movies worldwide and what
 assured them the historic impact they had, for better or for worse,
 within a wide range of different local contexts and diverse national
 cinemas.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The question of what constitutes Hollywood's power on a global scale
returns us to the phenomenon of Americanism discussed earlier in
connection with Soviet film. I am concerned with Americanism here less
as a question of exceptionalism, consensus ideology, or crude economic
power, though none of these aspects can be ignored, than as a practice
of cultural circulation and hegemony. Victoria de Grazia

<B></B>

has argued that Americanism still awaits analysis, beyond the polarized
labels of, respectively, cultural imperialism and a worldwide spreading
of the American Dream, as "the historical process by which the American
experience was transformed into a universal model of business society
based on advanced technology and promising formal equality and unlimited
mass consumption."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 However ideological these promises may, or may not, turn out to be,
 de Grazia observes that, unlike earlier imperial practices of colonial
 dumping, American cultural exports "were designed to go as far as the
 market would take them, starting at home." In other words, "cultural
 exports shared the basic features of American mass culture, intending
 by that term not only the cultural artifacts and associated forms,
 but also the civic values and social relations of the first capitalist
 mass society."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Regarding classical cinema, one could take this argument to suggest that
the hegemonic mechanisms by which Hollywood succeeded in amalgamating
a diversity of competing traditions, discourses, and interests on
the <I>domestic</I> level may have accounted for at least some of the
generalized appeal and robustness of Hollywood products <I>abroad</I>
(a success in which the diasporic, relatively cosmopolitan profile of the
Hollywood community no doubt played a part as well). In other words, by
forging a mass market out of an ethnically and culturally heterogeneous
society, if often at the expense of racial others, American classical
cinema had developed an idiom, or idioms, that travelled more easily
than its national-popular rivals. I do not wish to resuscitate the myth
of film as a new "universal language" whose early promoters included
D. W. Griffith and Carl Laemmle, founder of the Universal Film Company,
nor do I mean to gloss over the business practices by which the American
film industry secured the dominance of its products on foreign markets,
in particular through control of distribution and exhibition venues.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 But I do think that, whether we like it or not, American movies of the
 classical period offered something like the first global vernacular. If
 this vernacular had a transnational and translatable resonance, it was
 not just because of its optimal mobilization of biologically hardwired
 structures and universal narrative templates but, more important,
 because it played a key role in mediating competing cultural discourses
 on modernity and modernization, because it articulated, multiplied,
 and globalized a particular historical experience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If classical Hollywood cinema succeeded as an international modernist
idiom on a mass basis, it did so not because of its presumably universal
narrative form but because it meant different things to different people
and publics, both at home and abroad. We must not forget that these
films, along with other mass-cultural exports, were consumed in locally
quite specific, and unequally developed, contexts and conditions of
<I>reception;</I> that they not only had a levelling impact on indigenous
cultures but also challenged prevailing social and sexual arrangements
and advanced new possibilities of social identity and cultural styles;
and that the films were also changed in that process. Many films
were literally changed, both for particular export markets (e.g., the
conversion of American happy endings into tragic endings for Russian
release) and by censorship, marketing, and programming practices in
the countries

<B></B>

in which they were distributed, not to mention practices of dubbing
and subtitling.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 As systematic as the effort to conquer foreign markets undoubtedly
 was, the actual reception of Hollywood films was likely a much more
 haphazard and eclectic process depending on a variety of factors.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 How were the films programmed in the context of local film cultures,
 in particular conventions of exhibition and reception? Which genres
 were preferred in which places (for instance, slapstick in European and
 African countries, musical and historical costume dramas in India), and
 how were American genres dissolved and assimilated into different generic
 traditions, different concepts of genre? And how did American imports
 re within the public horizon of reception that might have included
 both indigenous products and films from other foreign countries? To write
 the international history of classical American cinema, therefore, is a
 matter of tracing not just its mechanisms of standardization and hegemony
 but also the diversity of ways in which this cinema was translated and
 reconred in both local and translocal contexts of reception.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Americanism, notwithstanding Antonio Gramsci (as well as recent critiques
of Gramsci and left Fordism), cannot simply be reduced to a regime of
mechanized production, an ideological veneer for discipline, abstraction,
reification, for new hierarchies and routes of power. Nor can it be
reduced to the machine aesthetics of intellectual and high modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 We cannot understand the appeal of Americanism unless we take seriously
 the promises of mass consumption and the dreams of a mass culture often
 in excess of and in conflict with the regime of production that spawned
 that mass culture (a phenomenon that has been dubbed "Americanization
 from below").
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 In other words, we have to understand the material, sensory conditions
 under which American mass culture, including Hollywood, was received and
 could have functioned as a powerful matrix for modernity's liberatory
 impulses--its moments of abundance, play, and radical possibility, its
 glimpses of collectivity and gender equality (the latter signalled by
 its opponents' excoriation of Americanism as a "new matriarchy").
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The juncture of classical cinema and modernity reminds us, finally, that
the cinema was not only part and symptom of modernity's experience and
perception of crisis and upheaval; it was also, most importantly, the
single most inclusive cultural horizon in which the traumatic effects
of modernity were reflected, rejected or disavowed, transmuted or
negotiated. That the cinema was capable of a reflexive relation with
modernity and modernization was registered by contemporaries early on,
and I read Benjamin's and Siegfried Kracauer's writings of the 1920s
and 1930s as, among other things, an effort to theorize this relation
as a new mode of reflexivity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Neither simply a medium for realistic representation (in the sense
 of marxist notions of reflection or <I>Widerspiegelung</I>), nor
 particularly concerned with formalist self-reflexivity, commercial cinema
 appeared to realize Johann Gottlieb Fichte's troping of reflection as
 "seeing with an added eye" in an almost literal sense, and it did so
 not just on the level of individual, philosophical cognition but on a
 mass scale.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 I am also drawing on more recent sociological debates on "reflexive
 modernization" (Ulrich

<B></B>

Beck, Anthony Giddens, Scott Lash), a concept deployed to distinguish
the risk-conscious phase of current post-
or second modernity
from a presumably more single-minded, orthodox, and simple first
modernity. However, I would argue (although I cannot do so in detail here)
that modernization inevitably provokes the need for reflexivity and that,
if sociologists considered the cinema in aesthetic and sensorial terms
rather than as just another medium of information and communication,
they would find ample evidence in both American and other cinemas of
the interwar period of an at once modernist and vernacular reflexivity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This dimension of reflexivity is key to the claim that the cinema not
only represented a specifically modern type of public sphere, the public
here understood as a "social horizon of experience," but also that this
new mass public could have functioned as a discursive form in which
individual experience could be articulated and find recognition by both
subjects and others, including strangers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Kracauer, in his more utopian moments, understood the cinema as an
 alternative public sphere--alternative to both bourgeois institutions of
 art, education, and culture, and the traditional arenas of politics--an
 imaginative horizon in which, however compromised by its capitalist
 foundations, something like an actual democratization of culture seemed
 to be taking shape, in his words, a "self-representation of the masses
 subject to the process of mechanization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 The cinema suggested this possibility not only because it attracted and
 made visible to itself and society an emerging, heterogeneous mass public
 ignored and despised by dominant culture. The new medium also offered
 an alternative because it engaged the contradictions of modernity
 at the level of the senses, the level at which the impact of modern
 technology on human experience was most palpable and irreversible. In
 other words, the cinema not only traded in the mass production of the
 senses but also provided an aesthetic horizon for the experience of
 industrial mass society.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While Kracauer's observations were based on moviegoing in Weimar
Germany, he attributed this sensory reflexivity more often than not to
American film, in particular slapstick comedy with its well-choreographed
orgies of demolition and clashes between people and things. The logic he
discerned in slapstick films pointed up a disjuncture within Fordist mass
culture, the possibility of an anarchic supplement generated on the same
principles: "One has to hand this to the Americans: with slapstick films
they have created a form that offers a counterweight to their reality. If
in that reality they subject the world to an often unbearable discipline,
the film in turn dismantles this self-imposed order quite forcefully."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 The reflexive potential of slapstick comedy can be, and has been,
 argued on a number of counts, at the levels of plot, performance,
 and mise-en-scene, and depending on the particular inflection of the
 genre. In addition to articulating and playing games with the violence
 of technological regimes, mechanization and clock time, slapstick
 films also specialized in deflating the terror of consumption, of a
 new culture of status and distinction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Likewise, the genre was a vital site for engaging the conflicts and
 pressures of a multiethnic society (think of the many Jewish performers
 who thematized the discrepancies

<B></B>

 between diasporic identity and upward mobility, from Larry Semon through
 Max Davidson and George Sydney). And, not least, slapstick comedy allowed
 for a playful and physical expression of anxieties over changed gender
 roles and new forms of sexuality and intimacy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But what about other genres? And what about popular narrative films
that conform more closely to classical norms? Once we begin looking at
Hollywood films as both a provincial response to modernization and a
vernacular for different, diverse, yet also comparable experiences,
we may find that genres such as the musical, horror, or melodrama
may offer just as much reflexive potential as slapstick comedy, with
appeals specific to those genres and specific resonances in different
contexts of reception. This is to suggest that reflexivity can take
different forms and different affective directions, both in individual
films and directorial oeuvres and in the aesthetic division of labor
among Hollywood genres, and that reflexivity does not always have to
be critical or unequivocal. On the contrary, the reflexive dimension of
these films may consist precisely in the ways in which they allow their
viewers to confront the constitutive ambivalence of modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The reflexive dimension of Hollywood films in relation to modernity may
take cognitive, discursive, and narrativized forms, but it is crucially
anchored in sensory experience and sensational affect, in processes of
mimetic identification that are more often than not partial and excessive
in relation to narrative comprehension. Benjamin, writing about the
elimination of distance in the new perceptual regimes of advertising
and cinema, sees in the giant billboards that present things in new
proportions and colors a backdrop for a "sentimentality . . . restored to
health and liberated in American style," just as in the cinema "people
whom nothing moves or touches any longer learn to cry again."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 The reason slapstick comedy hit home and flourished worldwide was not
 critical reason but the films' propulsion of their viewers' bodies into
 laughter. And adventure serials succeeded because they conveyed a new
 immediacy, energy, and sexual economy, not only in Soviet Russia and
 not only among avant-garde intellectuals. Again and again, writings on
 the American cinema of the interwar period stress the new physicality,
 the exterior surface or "outer skin" of things (Antonin Artaud), the
 material presence of the quotidian, as Louis Aragon put it, "really
 common objects, everything that celebrates life, not some artificial
 convention that excludes corned beef and tins of polish."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 I take such statements to suggest that the reflexive, modernist dimension
 of American cinema does not necessarily require that we demonstrate
 a cognitive, compensatory, or therapeutic function in relation to
 the experience of modernity but that, in a very basic sense, even
 the most ordinary commercial films were involved in producing a new
 sensory culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hollywood did not just circulate images and sounds; it produced and
globalized a new sensorium; it constituted, or tried to constitute, new
subjectivities and subjects. The mass appeal of these films resided as
much in their ability to engage viewers at the narrative-cognitive level
or in their providing models of identification for being modern as it
did in the register of what Benjamin troped as the "optical unconscious."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>

<B></B>

It was not just <I>what</I> these films showed, what they brought into
optical consciousness, as it were, but the way they opened up hitherto
unperceived modes of sensory perception and experience, their ability
to suggest a different organization of the daily world. Whether this
new visuality took the shape of dreams or of nightmares, it marked an
aesthetic mode that was decidedly not classical--at least not if we
literalize that term and reduce it to neoclassicist formal and stylistic
principles. Yet, if we understand the classical in American cinema as a
metaphor of a global sensory vernacular rather than a universal narrative
idiom, then it might be possible to imagine the two Americanisms operating
in the development of Soviet cinema--the modernist fascination with the
"low," sensational, attractionist genres and the classicist ideal of
formal and narrative efficiency--as two vectors of the same phenomenon,
both contributing to the hegemony of Hollywood film. This may well
be a fantasy: the fantasy of a cinema that could help its viewers
negotiate the tension between reification and the aesthetic, strongly
understood, the possibilities, anxieties, and costs of an expanded
sensory and experiential horizon--the fantasy, in other words, of a
mass-mediated public sphere capable of responding to modernity and its
failed promises. Now that postmodern media culture is busy recycling
the ruins of both classical cinema and modernity, we may be in a better
position to see the residues of a dreamworld of mass culture that is no
longer ours--and yet to some extent still is.

Peter B&uuml;rger, following Adorno, asserts that the very category of
"style" is rendered problematic by the advanced commodification of art
in the twentieth century and considers the refusal to develop a coherent
style (as in dada and surrealism) a salient feature of avant-gardist,
as distinct from modernist, aesthetics; see B&uuml;rger, <I>Theory
of the Avant-Garde,</I> trans. Michael Shaw (Minneapolis: University
of Minnesota Press, 1984), esp. ch. 2, "The Historicity of Aesthetic
Categories." The opening up of both modernist and avant-garde canons,
however, shows a great overlap between the two, just as the effort on the
part of particular modernist artists and movements to <I>restore</I> the
institutional status of art may well go along with avant-gardist modes of
behavior and publicity; see my <I>Ezra Pounds fr&uuml;he Poetik zwischen
Aufkl&auml;rung und Avantgarde</I> (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1979). See also

In the second version of his famous essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction" , Benjamin wrote of the "the theory [<I>die

Schriften,</I> ed. Rolf Tiedemann and Hermann Schweppenh&auml;user
[Frankfurt a.M.: Suhrkamp, 1989], 7:381; my translation). He conceived
of the politics of this essay very much as an effort to confront the
aesthetic tradition narrowly understood, in particular the persistence of
aestheticism in contemporary literature and art, with the changes wrought
upon the human sensorium by industrial and military technology. See Susan

verisimilitude and, as such, res as one of four types of narrative
motivation--compositional, realistic, intertextual, artistic (<I>CHC,</I>

diversity of Hollywood genres (think of the musical, for instance),
it does not make the issue of cinematic "realism" go away, whether as
rhetorical claim, ideological fiction, or aesthetic possibility. In

"realism" as American cinema's way of facilitating the "modernization of

This is not to say that the cinema was unique or original in forging a
modern type of publicness. It was part of, and borrowed from, a whole
array of institutions--department stores, world fairs, tourism, amusement
parks, vaudeville, etc.--that involved new regimes of sensory perception
and new forms of sociability. At the same time, the cinema represented,
multiplied, and deterritorialized these new experiential regimes. My
understanding of the public sphere as a general, social "horizon of
experience" is indebted to Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, <I>The

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For most readers, lyric poetry stands on the farthest end of the
literary continuum from politics. On the other hand, feminist and marxist
readers identify all literature as political in the sense that all texts
participate in cultural ideologies and hence in structures of discourse
and power. Else Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's 1914 publication of <I>Hebrew
Ballads</I> (<I>Hebr&auml;ische Balladen</I>) provides an interesting
case for thinking about how both positions function; this volume of
lyric poetry contains no public or social "political" references and
the poet herself claims not to be "political," but its repeated themes
and structure as a volume suggest a radical critique of the assumptions
underlying the political dynamics of Wilhelmine Germany. Because such
a critique is merely suggested and because it is formulated largely
through mythic, religious narrative and love poems, readers who, like
Bauschinger, believe that "Political thought has to be realistic" remain
confirmed in their conviction that the volume's significance is instead
biographical, spiritual, or aesthetic. Like many of her contemporaries,
however, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler

<B></B>

saw no dissonance between the fantastic or utopian and the
political. Expressionist philosopher and essayist Ernst Bloch, in
particular, defends what he calls the "utopian function" inherent in all
great works of art or social visions as being responsible for whatever
humanizing the world has experienced. The intensity of excess or surplus
in utopian creations causes a "mobilization of those contradictions
inherent in the bad existence in order to overcome that existence, in
order to bring it to the point of collapse."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 He argues that the imaginative power of anticipation or consciously
 directed hope is more real than any sociological or bourgeois realism
 and that all great art aspires to such power. While distinctly less
 utopian than Bloch, as well as less grounded in a specific political
 ideology, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler does construct mythical-religious fictions
 that critique early-twentieth-century Wilhelmine culture through their
 celebration of relationships defying its conventions and norms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most poems in <I>Hebrew Ballads</I> portray intimate moments in the
lives of biblical res, but instead of celebrating same-class,
same-nation, heterosexual love or partnership, much of the volume's love
and communication occurs between social unequals and between men. As
a consequence, love appears instructional, not sentimental or weakly
ideal. To use Bloch's terms, these poems display the "unimpaired reason
of a militant optimism," personally, not socially, cast.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Complex responses to dominant gender constructions underlie these
 portraits of intimacy and imply another kind of instruction. All
 the relationships Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler portrays suggest principles and
 practices that stereotypically would have been seen as feminine but that
 in her poetry also partake of a power and expressiveness associated
 with men. Moreover, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler attributes these qualities
 and practices both to women and to the great patriarchs of Jewish and
 Christian tradition--Joseph, David, and even God himself. In an era
 characterized by extreme gender essentialism and misogyny, such portraits
 imply a protest by demonstrating alternative possibilities. Through
 their characterization of rulers and powerful men, these poems also
 implicitly protest the nationalism and militarism characterizing the
 age of Wilhelm II and more generally the ethos of a military-industrial
 state as experienced in Berlin, a city with extensive slums, huge
 factories, and rigid class divisions. Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler modifies the
 anticipatory or hopeful aspects of the volume, however, by placing its
 utopian moments in a mythic past that itself also contains treachery,
 death, and isolation. Consequently, <I>Hebrew Ballads</I> seems to mix
 elements of nostalgia and mourning with the sharper edge of its utopian
 social critique.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Else Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler was a German Jewish poet born in the industrial
town of Elberfeld (Wuppertal) in 1869; she moved to Berlin in 1894;
and her publications span the years 1902-1943. In 1933, she fled
to Switzerland and in 1939 was forced into further exile in Palestine
where she died in 1945. With her publication of <I>Hebrew Ballads</I>
in 1913, followed by an expanded volume in 1914, she was at the height
of her writing powers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Also by 1914, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler was twice-divorced, impoverished, the
 mother of a (for all purposes) fatherless adolescent son, and strongly
 linked with the Berlin bohemian community.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 In 1932, after three decades

<B></B>

of writing poetry, experimental fiction, and dramas, circulating her
paintings and sketches, and playing an influential role in German
Expressionist circles, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler won the Kleist prize for
outstanding literary achievement in Germany. Her work, however, never
received broad public acclaim, and the bestowal of the prize set off
angry criticism. While the political nature of her other publications
was debated, both the poet's supporters and defamers regarded <I>Hebrew
Ballads</I> primarily as a volume of otherworldly spiritual and lyric
expression that distanced its author from modern daily life rather than
constructing her response to it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a 1937 letter from Palestine, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler declared "I am
unpolitical," a statement that would have been believable to many of her
contemporaries. This letter, however, was written under the circumstances
of her wanting desperately to return to Switzerland where she felt less
isolated than in Jerusalem; Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler had an immediate stake
in asserting that her work did not criticize Europe's current political
structures.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Her work would soon be banned by the Nazis, and critics already had
 been debating whether it was political for more than two decades.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Typical of one side of this debate was Ernst Lissauer's 1913
 description: "this poetry lives surrounded by Central Europe's machines
 'like a heavenly stranger,'" or Camill Hoffman's 1919 reference to
 Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler as "the absolute poet, completely unbourgeois,
 untroubled, fairy tale being!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Yet others represented her as significantly political. For example,
 Wieland Herzfelde writes that Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
did not want to create a new mythology; she strove instead far more
against the widespread myth of the Hohenzollern regime: "One becomes
human at the rank of Lieutenant." Her full elevation of the artist to
self-ruler was a manifestation against the spirit of submission, against
the division of society and of the races into super-
and subhumans,
against the worthlessness not only of artists and poets but no less of
the "common people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a different medium, Hannah H&ouml;ch makes a similar claim; by
placing a picture of Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's head directly across from
the wheel of machinery on Wilhelm II's breast in a 1916 photomontage,
H&ouml;ch suggests that the poet stands in opposition to the military
industrialism of the Kaiser's reign. Below her and in the middle of the
montage, K&auml;the Kollwitz's head floats above the headless body of the
famous dancer Nidda Impekoven, suggesting that H&ouml;ch linked these
female artists in opposing Wilhelmine values and life--a battle, as it
were, of art against patriarchal, monarchical militarism. The women's
decapitation suggests the violence of this opposition (and perhaps of
contemporary misogyny), and the title of H&ouml;ch's photomontage, "Cut
with the Kitchen Knife," suggests the disparity in weapons available to
the two genders (and to artists in contrast to the military): kitchen
knives rather than military weaponry.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The question of Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's politics was not merely academic
or internal to the artistic community. The poet was frequently beaten
on account of her bohemian, male-female clothing, her principles, and
her Judaism, a combination that made

<B></B>

her an easy target for the radical right. The <I>Marbacher Magazin</I>
gives evidence of particular beatings in 1923, 1931, 1933, 1934, and
1936, and there is strong evidence that these were not isolated occasions,
even in the 1920s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Closer to the time of <I>Hebrew Ballads,</I> on a trip to Munich
 shortly after the outbreak of World War I, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler wore
 Arabian pants and a turban (as well as a sash in the colors of the
 German flag), knowing that the "mass hysteria" in the city against the
 Turks could make this dangerous. While it seems unlikely that she was
 indicating direct sympathy with Turkey (her ostensible reason would have
 been her personification as "Tino of Baghdad" or "Prince Yussuf"), such
 clothing also marked her chosen identification with a population that
 at the time was even more marginalized than the Jews.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 According to Wieland Herzfelde, she was heckled constantly in Munich
 because of her clothing and arrested four times.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Throughout her life, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler faced ridicule and physical
 punishment for manifesting her principles openly, but despite bruises
 and even broken bones, she did not modify her dress, behavior, or values
 to fit others' norms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not surprisingly, the debate about Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's political
positioning has continued to thrive. During the 1960s, Werner Kraft
claimed Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler "was basically an unpolitical being" while
Paul P&ouml;rtner argued that "She was political in the same way she
wrote: spontaneously and with fantasy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Writing in the 1980s, Bauschinger provides evidence for both sides. She
 claims there is no evidence of the poet's protest against the monarchy
 or of her political leanings, but also argues that Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
 <I>Der Malik</I> (1919 [The king]) and her poems to friends who died
 in military service did indirectly protest against World War I. She
 also notes that the poet published regularly in <I>Die Aktion,</I>
 a leftist journal critical of the monarchy and the war. Bauschinger
 distinguishes, however, between the poet's revolutionary ideas and acts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Critics who note Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's lack of political involvement argue
on the basis of her writing's content, while those who maintain that her
work was political argue on the basis of her general principles and life
or her prose works. No discussion has focused on Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
critique of the dominant ideologies of her era within her poetry or
considered any aspect of social critique central to <I>Hebrew Ballads.</I>
Generally, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's poetry has been read as exceptional,
different in intent as well as form from that of her contemporaries whose
critiques were more pointed or were explicitly theorized in essays. As
stated previously, however, I find that in particular the 1914 <I>Hebrew
Ballads</I> constructs an implied social structure pointedly alternative
to that of Wilhelmine Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the opening poem of this volume, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler asserts her
dissatisfaction with the degeneracy and passionlessness of bourgeois
culture through the irregular rhyming, aural echoing, and highly
compressed syntax of a lament "sung" by a poet fleeing her connection
with an unidentified "decaying" people who are referred to in the poem's
title as "My People" (<I>Mein Volk</I>):

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is a poem of both community and alienation; the speaker sings "songs
of God" (<I>Gotteslieder</I>) that stem from and echo the crumbling rock
of "My People" even as she rushes from it and its stream of "blood." At
the end of the poem, it is ambiguous whether the decaying rock cries out
the words "my folk" or whether the rock and the people are analogous
and what they cry remains unspoken. This syntactic ambiguity restates
the poet's ambivalent positioning, since she, like the rock, literally
cries "<I>Mein Volk</I>" (the poem itself) even while the rock serves
primarily as a metaphor for the people the poet flees. Especially in a
period of intense nationalism, the poem suggests the poet's ambivalence
about belonging to that archetypal German body, "<I>das Volk,</I>" at the
same time that it may redefine her "<I>Volk</I>" as Jewish. <I>Hebrew
Ballads</I> begins, then, with a speaker singing songs that are her
own but that echo those of a people to whom she both does and does
not belong. The other poems of the volume can be read as representing
these echoes of the tradition she honors and flees, whether it is
Hebrew as indicated by the volume's title or German as suggested by the
language. Despite this echoing, the volume's later poems also construct
an alternative ancestral past, apparently undecayed, to which the poet
can give full allegiance--in this case, a pacifist, creative, loving,
erotic, and German Judaism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Nonetheless, the first poem's images of decay suggest loss and
 encroaching death rather than the beginning of anything.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Hebrew Ballads</I> ends with a poem similarly lamenting loss, although
this poem is paradoxically called "In the Beginning" (<I>Im Anfang</I>),
which recalls a playfulness that suggests a more vital past, and hence
perhaps a more hopeful future than "My People." In a move that could be
read as a sign either of the degeneracy of the present or of hope for a
progression toward the future different from that of the scriptural past,
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler also contrasts the speaker of her poem to Genesis,
which its title echoes. In her "In the Beginning," no omnipotent,
omniscient God speaks but rather a roguish poet who is coeval with
the creator:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This poem is constructed around reversals, primarily the speaker's
locking Satan in heaven and God in hell. And in this childhood of the
world, God enjoys such games. Together, Satan and God shake their finger,
repeat a nonsense sound, and laugh at "mortal sin," but with that word
the tone of the poem changes. The past tense becomes conditional and
playfulness becomes nostalgia for that earlier, protected, rhyming
("<I>gottgeboren</I>"- "<I>gottgeborgen</I>") time of manifest being.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Above all, the speaker seems to look back to a period without strict rules
and authoritarian control where radical reversal is possible. While God
is a father who controls punishing winds and thunder, he is also mutable
and at least temporarily vulnerable: he has an age, can be locked up, and
laughs with both his rascal and the devil. This is no God of punishment,
anger, and jealous control. The reversal of God with Satan, moreover,
is repeated structurally at other levels; the adult female poet (herself
a mother, perhaps in parallel to God the young father) speaks as a male
youth (a <I>Schlingel</I>), and the mythically male sun and female moon
are reversed and familiarized respectively as mama and grandpa, completing
a family in which there is no traditional patriarch.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Clearly not bourgeois, the speaker is hatless, uninhibited, indecorous,
 without fear of reprisal. He is a rogue but was with God "in the
 beginning" and has the freedom to tease God and the planets like a
 favorite son.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both "My People" and "In the Beginning," with their isolated speakers
and historical perspectives of loss or nostalgia, remind readers of
the "decaying" social fabric or "cliff" of the present world and these
speakers's isolation in it, thereby framing the rest of the volume's
representations of the past with this starkly inadequate present. In
some ways the loss expressed in these poems remains the dominant note
of the volume. Both poems are also typical of Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
verse in their compression to the point of occasional ungrammaticality
or grammatical coinage.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 This effect
of extreme density suggests the shorthand of internal monologue or
speech to a

<B></B>

 familiar audience. In both poems, the compressed sharpness
of the paratactic progressions from one image or aspect of metaphor to
the next, combined with the extravagance of the metaphors themselves,
prevent potentially sentimental images from falling into banality. These
are poems of rich aural resonance, shifting rhythms, and the expressive
density of multiple syntactic deletions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 With none of the looseness or narrative clarity of a traditional
 "ballad," these poems present cryptic pieces of a story, but not the
 story Jewish or Christian readers might expect, given the titles of
 the poems and of the volume. Similarly, the well-known speakers and
 subjects of many other poems in the volume--Abraham, Joseph, Ruth,
 David, Eve--present a moment or aspect of their stories generally quite
 different from the emphasis of the scriptural tales through which they
 are known.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While never in the foreground of <I>Hebrew Ballads,</I> gender issues are
central to its unexpected formulations, and it is in the realm of gender
that Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler herself fits least into the prescribed categories
of her time. As suggested by her first-person "<I>Schlingel</I>" in
"In the Beginning," Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler is as likely to speak in a
masculine as in a feminine guise and celebrates aspects of what in her
time was considered "feminine" behavior through both male and female
speakers. Gender, for her, was a flexible category while in Wilhelmine
Germany, generally, gender norms were rigidly essentialized. To
take an extreme but influential example, in <I>Sex and Character</I>
(<I>Geschlecht und Charakter</I>), Otto Weininger writes that woman's
entire meaning and purpose (<I>Bedeutung</I> and <I>Zweck</I>) lie in
sexuality, specifically in coupling (<I>in der Kuppelei</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Whereas men are characterized primarily by spirit/mind (<I>Geist</I>),
 women have no free will, no soul, no ego, in fact no consciousness
 at all ("M[an] lives consciously, w[oman] lives unconsciously"
 [<I>M[ann] lebt bewu&szlig;t, W[eib] lebt unbewu&szlig;t</I>])
 (<I>GC,</I> 144). "Genius," Weininger writes, "presents itself as a
 type of higher masculinity, and therefore women cannot be geniuses"
 (<I>GC,</I> 142); moreoever, because the historical sense is linked
 to consciousness and genius, women also do not have the property of
 historical perspective. One sees the broad concern with this topic and
 the significance of Weininger's work in a five-part 1918 essay by Ford
 Madox Ford, "Women and Men," one part of which discusses Weininger's
 claims. Ford finds Weininger's work largely "nonsensical," but he
 states that as early as 1906 it was talked about as a "new gospel" in
 "men's clubs" of England, France, Germany, and the U.S.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ford was critical of this "gospel," but many were not. For example,
Herwarth Walden, one of the most influential editors and supporters
of experimental arts in Berlin and Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's husband from
1903 to 1913, published misogynistic material in <I>The Storm</I>
(<I>Der Sturm</I>), including pieces written by Weininger and by
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's friends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Foremost among these was Karl Kraus, the Austrian satirist, whom
 Bauschinger notes was among the most trusted of Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
 friends and whose enthusiastic support of Weininger was key to
 Weininger's popularity among the avant-garde.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler dedicated both the 1913 and 1914
editions of <I>Hebrew Ballads</I> to Kraus and called his journal <I>The
Torch</I> (<I>Die Fackel</I>) "a

<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Yet Kraus also wrote that "the female has as much mind as a mirror
 has body," and Barbara Wright considers Kraus's <I>Die Fackel</I> one
 of the most virulent journals publishing against women's emancipation
 during the 1910s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
According to Wright, especially from 1911 to 1914, Expressionists
wrote enthusiastically about women's "nature"; these essays, she finds,
reveal a "clear perception of the need for reform in numerous areas of
contact between the sexes" but the majority "stand in open or implicit
disagreement with the goals of the women's movement" ("NM," 587).
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 In the Expressionist community, which included her (ex)husband and
 friends, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler would have been surrounded by men who
 believed in women's spiritual, mental, and moral inferiority, no matter
 how highly they praised her sketches, painting, and literary production.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The prevailing essentialized attitudes toward gender were reflected in
the legal and social circumstances of women's lives. For example, women
in Germany were prohibited from higher public education for much longer
than in England or the United States: the first girls' <I>Gymnasium,</I>
a high school granting a pre-university degree (<I>Abitur</I>), was not
founded until 1893, and women were not admitted into degree programs at
German universities until 1908.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Similarly, until 1908, women were legally barred from all forms of public
 political activity. Women's daily circulation in the public realm was
 also circumscribed; a much disputed law gave police the right to arrest
 and jail any woman alone on the streets after dark and to examine her
 to determine whether she carried communicable diseases.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler, who spent much of each day and nearly every evening
 in cafes or at gatherings or performances, openly flouted the bourgeois
 conventions underlying such legislation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is no coincidence that such attitudes coincided with a high point
of activity in German women's movements. Yet, while bourgeois and
working class women's leagues had successfully promoted various legal
and educational reforms, even radical leagues tended to maintain the
concept of essential difference, in contrast with similar groups in the
United States and England at the time. The Jewish Women's League, while
more liberal in some respects than Protestant and Catholic leagues,
was also decidedly bourgeois and focused on activities women might
perform to strengthen the Jewish community that were appropriate to
their gender role.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Consequently and paradoxically, while their positions were dramatically
 opposed on particular issues having to do with women's rights and
 sexuality, most women's
leagues, popular culture, and the Expressionist community were in broad
agreement

<B></B>

 about the fact of essential gender differences. No major female
artist wrote essays in support of full psychological and spiritual, as
well as the more frequently debated sexual and civil, equality for women
to counter the din of misogynistic voices.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given her determined rejection of a bourgeois life and values and
her open flexibility about gender boundaries in several aspects
of her behavior and in her artistic self-understanding, it is not
surprising that Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler manifested little sympathy for
either Christian or Jewish women's leagues or general bonding with
women as a community. Rather than joining other women in struggling
for education, social reform, and legal rights, she constructed her own
rules for behavior. In the predominantly masculine bohemian spheres, she
appeared as the regal, foreign, adolescent, either androgynous or male
"Prince Yussuf of Thebes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Between 1910 and 1917, this role dominated Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
 fiction and letters, and although Yussuf does not appear in <I>Hebrew
 Ballads,</I> the poet wrote to Jethro Bithell that she was both its
 David and its Joseph.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 At the same time, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler wrote poems celebrating the
 work of female friends, for example the sculptor Milly Steger and
 the painter Marianne von Werefkin, and in many letters she describes
 herself as interchangeably male and female or admires such flexibility
 in others--for example a maid "who used to be a boy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The increasing nationalism and militarism of the early 1910s was as
pervasive as gender essentialism in determining the social and political
fabric of the time and certainly emphasized that the public realm was
male. Moreover, most liberal German women's groups supported both the
nationalistic prewar enthusiasm for military expansion and the war
itself. The League of Jewish Women participated in such support as did
the Jewish middle and upper classes generally. Before the outbreak of
the war, much of the artistic avant-garde was similarly militaristic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Ernst Bloch, for example, saw war as desirable since it would lead
 to an apocalyptic redemption of German and Jewish society through
 the destruction of the bourgeois mentality; to his mind, chaos and
 fragmentation (whether aesthetic or actual) prompted the viewer to
 "imagine and desire a new utopian future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 In a general study of Expressionist visions of apocalypse, Klaus Vondung
 sees several Expressionists writing before 1914 about their "aesthetic
 desire for power and destruction"; for example, in "Feeling Cramped"
 ("<I>Beengung,</I>" 1910) Johannes R. Becher states that "we . . . laze
 around on high desk chairs / And crumble anxiously into flour dust in
 waiting rooms . . . and wish thereby for a great world war."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 In 1914, Thomas Mann writes, "How the artist, the soldier in the artist,
 would have praised God for the collapse of the peaceful world, with
 which he was so fed up, so utterly fed up. War! We found it cleansing,
 freeing, and a monstrous hope. Of this the poets spoke, only of this."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 This enthusiasm also took pragmatic form; among others, Oskar Kokoschka,
 Rudolf Leonhard, Franz Marc, and Ernst Toller volunteered for military
 service once the war began. Although not isolated in her pacifism while
 writing <I>Hebrew Ballads,</I> Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler
was clearly at odds with the prevailing attitudes among fellow artists
and in German and Jewish popular culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Once the brutality of the war made itself evident, few Expressionists
continued to support the war. Interestingly, however, both their prewar
militaristic visions and their later opposition assumed a community
of like-minded, implicitly or explicitly male comrades and frequently
used military language. One sees such brotherhood in the quotations
above. Since relatively small numbers of women attended universities
in Germany in 1911, the "we" lazing around on desk chairs in Becher's
poem would most likely be male, just as Mann's "soldier in the artist"
was. Using much the same language, in 1917, Alfred Henschke writes to
"the silver sons" of God, "legionnaires of the holy army" who must bring
"a new humanity" and peace.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Whether for peace or war, brotherhoods would both carry out and benefit
 from this sense of purpose and spiritual cleansing in the name of God
 or some other spirit or power higher than their own. In 1917, Ernst
 Wilhelm Lotz coined the term "brother poetry" (<I>Bruderverse</I>) for
 intense poems of masculine comradeship.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Hermann Korte describes the "verse of the 'brother-poetry'" as
 "celebrat[ing] the men's club of sworn cameraderie in the light of
 visions of human and world redemption" ("MH," 28).
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 In contrast, he sees Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's dedication poems and
 poems of male love as opposing "the bloody seriousness of the
 '<I>Bruderverse</I>'" ("MH," 28).
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Eschewing the proclamation style reminiscent of the "all too masculine
 ritual of shoulder slapping," the "ex-cathedra tone," and "grandstanding
 rhetoric," Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's speakers are playful, tender, and
 intimate. Her portraits "strive to be poems, not monuments" ("MH," 29).
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not surprisingly given the widespread Jewish acculturation in Germany,
Jewish writing of the period outside the Expressionist community also
tended towards apocalyptic and monumental brotherhood. Particularly
through Zionism, as promoted by Theodor Herzl and Max Nordau, one saw
the rise of a distinctively masculine re of a "New Jew," created in
part as a counterimage to the anti-Semitic equation of Jewishness with
femininity (<I>GA,</I> 142). According to Hyman, the Zionists promoted
"male solidarity as an essential precondition for nation building"
(<I>GA,</I> 143).
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 While Zionism represented an extreme form of such beliefs, many Jewish
 men constructed similar notions of gender division "through a more
 oblique version of sexual politics" (<I>GA,</I> 150). It is relevant
 to remember in this context that Otto Weininger was Jewish and that his
 notion of the Jew as "feminine" and the "feminine," or woman, as inferior
 stemmed from related cultural beliefs of essentialism and natural
 hierarchy. <I>Bruderverse</I> and Zionist brotherhood were outgrowths
 of and responses to linked ideologies of race, gender, and nationhood.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the first two decades of the twentieth century were relatively
open to Jewish assimilation, the depression of the 1890s, along with the
extremely rapid modernization and industrialization of the 1870s and
1880s, had occasioned a wave of anti-Semitism in the 1890s, which was
most strongly felt in Berlin and certainly reminded the Jewish community
of its marginal status in Germany. In 1893, Adolf Stoecker's anti-Semitic
political party, centered in Berlin but stemming from Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
 native Westfalia and active during her youth, won several
seats in the legislature.

 As Jakob Hessing writes and as one sees in Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's play
 <I>Arthur</I>
 
<B></B>


 <I>Aronymous</I> and essay "Anti-Semitism," local anti-Semitic
 enthusiasm was a part of her childhood. According to Hessing, it was
 in part for this reason that Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler was more sensitive to
 anti-Semitism and Jewish marginality than many other Jews. At the same
 time, she identified too closely with German culture to be satisfied
 with the boundaries of traditional Judaism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Ironically, then, this greater sensitivity to her Jewishness was one
 of the factors distancing the poet from assimilated Jews as well as
 from the Christian-German community.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Situated among these multiple and overlapping communities tolerating or
supporting doctrines of female intellectual and spiritual inferiority,
essentialized gender difference, powerful male bonding, militarism,
nationalism, and anti-Semitism, Else Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler wrote and
published <I>Hebrew Ballads.</I> With this context in mind, its patterns
of unhierarchical relationships are striking. Immediately following
"My People" in the volume, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler turns to the theme of
human relationships to God depicting three types of blessed being, each
constructing an aspect of her mythologized past. First, in "Abraham und
Isaac," the patriarch "practice[s] talking with God" ("<I>&uuml;bte
sich mit Gott zu reden"</I>) and enjoys regular visits from angels
(<I>WB,</I> 157). When these angels are disturbed by the "bleating of
the tortured rams / With which Isaac played at sacrifice behind the
licorice trees," God admonishes Abraham, who in response readies an
altar and carries Isaac there (<I>WB,</I> 157). At this point the poem
breaks off with a dash, providing only the final cadenced line: "But
God loved his servant" ("-- / <I>Der aber liebte seinen Knecht</I>")
(<I>WB,</I> 158). The presumed ensuing conversation between God and
Abraham at the altar, each "practiced" in communication, is left to
the imagination. Although the hierarchy is preserved (Abraham remains a
"servant"), the poem stresses the love between God and Abraham rather
than that between Abraham and his thoughtless or cruel son.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Unlike Abraham, Jacob--in the poem called "Jacob"--is presented wholly
mythically. He is the wild "buffalo of his herd," who "ran to the ancient
forest on the rivers / Stilled there the blood of his monkey bites" and
then, "Through the tired ache in his bones / Sank low before the heavens,
feverish / And his ox-face created the smile" (<I>WB,</I> 158).
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Here the power of both the torment and Jacob's response to it is
 suggested by the significance of his creation--a smile, an expressive
 sign that distinguishes humans from other animals. Jacob gives birth,
 as it were, to the human through his creation of an expression only
 humans can make. "Esther," like "Jacob," describes its protagonist
 in ways only peripherally related to scripture. Unlike the wild and
 primitive Jacob, however, Esther is a social creature, manifesting a
 beauty so intense that wheat and spiritual celebration borrow their
 scent from her presence: "slender like a date palm / Her lips provide
 the scent of the wheat stalks / And the holidays that occur in Judah"
 (<I>WB,</I> 158-9).
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 In the poem, Esther's stereotypically feminine distinction is to be
 desired and wondered at, a distinction that gives no sense of her
 courage in requesting that the king take back his order to kill the Jews,
although it does suggest her beauty's power. While Jacob creates the
smile, Esther's approach prompts a smile from the king--as the poet
explains it, "Because God 

<B></B>

watches over Esther everywhere" (<I>WB,</I>
158). These three poems model relationships with God involving various
forms of communication and various levels of independence: as a dutiful
patriarch open to verbal negotiation, as a wild man able to communicate
originally and expressively even in feverish exhaustion, and a woman
embodying a harmony with the natural and spiritual worlds so pervasive
that it lends them her fragrance, perhaps both a cause and result of
her success in saving the Jewish people from slaughter. God honors all
three, suggesting that there is no single model, or gender, of chosenness.

These poems are uncharacteristic of <I>Hebrew Ballads,</I> however, since
none presents erotic or passionate love. Moreover, all are written in
the past tense, as though they present a historical backdrop for the
immediacy of more intense relationships. More typical is "Pharaoh und
Joseph," where, in the present tense, Joseph proudly relates that Pharaoh
has sent his women away and "rests [his king's head] on my shoulder /
That smells of grain" (<I>WB,</I> 159). Although "His eyes go and come,"
"His heart lies in my blood" and

The lack of concluding question marks contributes to the final lines'
heaviness, suggesting that there is nothing Jonathan can do without
David's heart and songs, and indeed in the biblical story he will soon
die. This death in battle clearly does not result from his loss of David's
songs, but one might conclude that Jonathan's choice to be loyal to
his father Saul (who seeks David's death) rather than to his companion
(in Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's poem, his lover) suggests the consequences
of inadequate commitment to the values of loving, friendship, and
creativity: while kissing, one should not also depart for battle. The
poem may challenge its readers to ponder how many Jonathans will soon
be asked to take leave of their Davids.

"Ruth" is a poem of anticipated love. Ruth speaks of herself as

(<I>WB,</I> 160). The focus on Boaz's, not her own, fulfillment and,

curiously secondary even while she speaks. Yet Ruth presents herself
as desiring and constructing a situation that will make her a symbol of
courage and love. Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler also emphasizes Ruth's importance
by including two poems about her and Boaz in this edition of <I>Hebrew
Ballads;</I> no other couple receives more than one poem. In "Boaz,"

<I>Hebrew Ballads</I> does not depict women loving women, but the poem
"Eve" contains several elements of socially coded gender reversal. In
explicit contrast to Weininger's <I>Weib,</I> Eve is more conscious and
more historically minded than Adam; she is the "thousand-stemmed memory"
which "lie[s] heavily on your [Adam's] life" (<I>WB,</I> 162). While
referring to exile, Eve's words convey no apology or regret; she
describes herself as having a soul of "sprouting love" and "expelled
desire" and cherishes Adam's beauty and confusion: "your lips are of rosy
silk-softness / As were the blossoms of Eden's trees"; "you tremble in
anticipation / Don't know why your dreams groan // you have bowed your
head low over me."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 In "Eden's Voice" (<I>Die Stimme Edens</I>), Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler even
 presents Eve as having "wrested the day" from God and created herself
 and her "Gotteseele" from her own womb (<I>WB,</I> 126). This portrait
 of Eve is entirely sympathetic, which is consonant with Jewish, not
 Christian, tradition. She reasons, keeps the complex historical record
 ("thousand-stemmed memory"), and has a "sprouting" soul. While Adam
 is beautiful, soft, afraid, and unknowing, she is erotically desirous,
 unafraid of the future, and a poet.

Like Esther's blessedness, this speaker's passion transforms her into
a part of the mythic Jewish landscape. To see the fading sunset is to
know Sulamith, to reflect on those erotic "holinesses" she learned, just
as to smell fresh wheat is to know Esther's fragrance. Each experience
is fleeting but will come again. As Eve represents memory and desire so
powerful they have been exiled, or Ruth the courage to choose exile at
a moment of loss, Sulamith represents the power of erotic passion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In an era when writers like Otto Weininger and Karl Kraus were denying
even the consciousness of women, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's portrayal of
women as speakers and lovers honored by God and men at least claims an
equality of spirit and will for them, even if the manifestations of that
will remain largely within the realm of stereotypical spheres. Reading
the poems with an unidentifed speaker as if this speaker were the poet
herself (as in "My People" or the poems addressing God), the volume
provides greater evidence of complex female desire, intelligence, and
spirituality. Men and more traditionally depicted women (Esther, Ruth)
come early in the volume while "Eve" and "Sulamith" appear later in
poems addressing or depicting Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's (not the Jewish
tradition's) ideal God who is vital, playful, actively creative, and
approachable. Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler makes these women less radical in
their life choices and independence than she herself was but also places
them in a world where there is at least a temporary resonance between
desire, expression, and the physical world. The fact that neither Eve
nor Sulamith addresses her lover by name also creates a strong continuum
between these poems of self-aware women celebrating human love and those
where an ungendered speaker intimately addresses God: "God, I love you,"
("<I>Gott, ich liebe dich</I>") the poet cries in "Zebaoth" (<I>WB,</I>
162) or "I'd like to eavesdrop near your heart" ("<I>Ich m&ouml;chte nah
an deinem Herzen lauschen</I>") in "To God" (<I>An Gott</I>) (<I>WB,</I>
160). Such speakers defy Wilhelmine gender categories of "woman" as the
merely sexual body and "man" as the creative, god-like spirit, just as
poems like "Pharaoh and Joseph" or "Jonathan and David" defy stereotypes
of masculinity by having men manifest and voice dependency and tender
longing and by linking their bodies (as well as women's) with the earth's
food, scent, and beauty.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even more strikingly, given their historical context, many poems involve
the union of foreigners or people of different social classes: Joseph
the Jewish slave lives in
exile in Pharoah's Egypt; David the young shepherd's son was ordered
to live in the palace of Jonathan's father, King Saul; Ruth begs as a
stranger in Boaz's field, as Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler emphasizes by calling her
"the foreign reaper" at the end of "Boaz"; Sulamith learned "holiness
es" from the angel Gabriel; and God is a different order

<B></B>

 of being from
humans even when at His most communicative. Other poems, "Jacob und Esau"
and "Moses und Joshua," present men of equivalent status but different
life choices and opportunities. Related to this communication or love
between those representing difference is a broader pattern of norm
breaking or reversal of expectations: God's mercy to Abraham; Pharoah's
love of Joseph instead of the "sweet scented" women; Boaz's love of the
foreign beggar; the king's smiling at Esther rather than punishing her
for her request; the transformation of Sulamith's sorrow into beauty
that fills the horizon; and the rascal's reversal of God's and Satan's
realms. Here social power expresses itself through love or affection,
generosity, and acceptance, bypassing the hierarchical boundaries it
would conventionally protect.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moreover, social power is secondary to the power of expression in these
poems. Their speakers are the social underlings, the foreigners, the
exiles (Joseph, David, Ruth, the poet in relation to God), and their
words--not the status of their lovers--construct what is of value in the
relationship and the poem. The social hierarchy is not overturned, but
the openness of communication and the egalitarianism of love suggest
that it is of limited importance. Similarly, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler does
not overturn the hierarchy of gender norms, yet the strengths of her
female speakers and her own flexibility in adopting the male gender at
least unsettle them. Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's women, like her men, live as
individuals of spirit and feeling.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's volume does not construct a democratic
world. Indeed, as her fantasies of kingship and the "crowning" of friends
in an imagined "Thebes" suggest in her novel <I>The King</I>, the poet
does not oppose the idea of monarchy or social inequality as such. Her
implied protest then is not against Wilhelm II as Kaiser but against
any ruler who (like Wilhelm) practices and promotes uses of power
inconsistent with those she praises in her poems. For example, while
in her volume a God, father, or king may command individual behavior
even to the point of potential sacrifice, he takes no delight in power
for its own sake and practices no wanton aggression. The volume's only
act of destruction (as opposed to the apparently natural decay of the
"rock-bone" of "My People") occurs in "Abel" and stands isolated in the
volume as the poet's protest against all acts of human brutality. The
speaker seems not only to ask Cain "Why did you kill your brother?" but
also to ask how any "you" might choose to destroy life when the rewards
for cherishing it are so rich. Every murder, the poet implies, injures
the world; Abel's "blood deeply stains the heavens" (<I>WB,</I> 164). For
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler, killing brings sorrow, not heroism, material gain,
or apocalyptic possibilities of new and greater life. Hence, while
not explicitly protesting against militarism, <I>Hebrew Ballads</I>
distinguishes itself sharply from the work of Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
contemporaries in lamenting any loyalty that leads to war and refusing
to see war as enabling a later utopia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Love is the most powerful concern unifying the poems of <I>Hebrew
Ballads</I> and unifying the individuals within poems, whether
between two men, a man and a woman, or an individual and God. This
love is spectacularly free of aggression, jealousy, or possessiveness,
which are among the most frequent themes of biblical and other love
narratives. Instead, it is erotic, tender, at times sorrowful, and
associated with the beauty

<B></B>

 and fecundity of nature. It does not
aggrandize the loving self and does not serve any other purpose or
master. Such bonding, especially in those poems where men love men,
stands in marked contrast to Expressionist <I>Bruderliebe</I> through its
manifestation of affectionate and erotic desire rather than exclusion and
superiority. These lovers do not monumentalize each other (and hence,
indirectly, themselves or the poet) but focus on intimacy. Moreover,
in two cases, these couples link Jew and Gentile, and the heroic
re of every poem, whether the socially powerful one or not, is
always Jewish in an age when Jewishness was broadly seen as weak or
"feminine." Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's heroes play, love, speak with God, and
"sing" poetry. They "practice speaking with" another, that is, engage
in dialogue, not commands, judgment, or manifesto making.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the idea of actual people only writing poetry and loving in
a troubled world--like that of 1914--would be frightening, the fact
that these res are or consort with rulers suggests that they have
constructed states--national and emotional--that make such behavior
appropriate as well as desirable. Hence they presuppose temporary
utopian moments or states. Within such moments, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler
does not portray the psychological complexity of adult love but models
an ideal of tenderness between people of different nations and unequal
power where the ostensibly less powerful is more honored (David, Joseph,
Ruth, and perhaps Eve).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Through such depictions of love, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler also proposes
radically egalitarian communication among unequals in place of the
prevailing hindrances to communication constructed by nationalism,
anti-Semitism, and misogyny. If there is even one exiled Joseph to shelter
the heart of the native Pharaoh in his "blood," both Egypt (or Germany)
and the Jews may survive, she suggests. One Esther can save the Jewish
people from extermination through her courage in speaking with the king
and because of his--and God's--love for her. And every Boaz can save an
alien Ruth from hunger and loneliness, and every Ruth can bring a Boaz
to spiritual and physical delight. The titles alone of several poems,

 Legalistic judgment bows to affection and mercy in "Abraham und
 Isaac," and in "Jacob und Esau" the latter chooses to abandon his
 birthright rather than being tricked out of it, leaving both brothers
 satisfied. Even in "Abel," where the speaker condemns Cain's murder,
 the tone of the poem is sorrowful bafflement rather than blame or a
 stance suggesting moral superiority. Similarly, rather than a Nietzschian
 despair over a God that is dead, this volume's several poems addressing
 God suggest that divine presence is at worst temporarily withdrawn.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the dominant notes of the volume are erotic longing or
sorrowful loss, play is also an important element of the communication
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler represents in relationships and constructs through
word coinages, rhyme, and metaphor. The poet's participation in the
widespread association of play with youth again may reflect a hopefulness
about the future. Play that torments others (even sheep) is punishable,
while the play of friendship, love, or personal idiosyncratic wildness
marks the players'

<B></B>
 blessedness or creativity. As others have noted,
celebration of play marks several early twentieth-century works.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Most famously, Nietzsche writes in <I>Beyond Good and Evil</I>
 that perhaps we shall discover our inventiveness in "nonsense"
 (<I>Bl&ouml;dsinn</I>), that realm in which "we, too, can still be
 original, say, as parodists of world history and God's buffoons--perhaps
 even if nothing else modern has a future, precisely our <I>laughter</I>
 may yet have a future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 But whereas Nietzsche encourages a minimal hope--we may achieve
 the originality of parody--Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler moves towards greater
 affirmation with her non-parodic rewriting of the Jewish and Christian
 biblical past and her concluding "rascal" (<I>Schlingel</I>) rather
 than Nietszche's "buffoon" (<I>Hanswurst</I>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Hebrew Ballads</I> challenges cultural norms through repeated modeling
of other, better life choices. In Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's poems, unlike
in Wilhelmine Germany, personal love is valued above duty to a state
or political affiliation; women are honored equally with men, and love
as powerfully; poetry and creativity are valued above institutional or
inherited power and destructiveness; and teasing playfulness, including
the ability to laugh at oneself and at others, takes a higher place than
philosophy or intellectual understanding. A people and nation that play,
love, and cherish poetry do not define themselves through territorial
expansion, persecution of "alien" others, or divisive reason. Mikhail
Bakhtin puts theoretically what Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's poems imply:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The serious aspects of class culture are official and authoritarian; they
are combined with violence, prohibitions, limitations and always contain
an element of fear and of intimidation. . . . Laughter, on the contrary,
overcomes fear, for it knows no inhibitions, no limitations. Its idiom
is never used by violence and authority.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given the volume's emphasis on love and play, readers in
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's time would have understood its values as
"feminine." The crucial distinction, however, is that precisely these
values in Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's poetry link the human being with God
and hence constitute human soul (<I>Geist</I>), the highest of the
qualities assumed by her culture to be "masculine" and the single quality
associated most fully with genius and the divine. In this sense, <I>Hebrew
Ballads</I> instructs its readers in values more becoming to a people
claiming divine preference or right, whether that <I>Volk</I> is Jewish
or German, than those of militaristic and masculinist Wilhelmine Germany.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By titling her volume <I>Hebrew Ballads,</I> Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler veils
the poems' contemporary significance. As "ballads" the poems suggest the
romance of an earlier, simpler time. As "Hebrew" ballads, they suggest
both a specificity in relation to traditional
 Judaism that the volume does not deliver and a distance from Christian
 culture that is equally misleading. The speakers and protagonists of
 these poems belong to the most familiar cultural stories for Jewish and
 Christian readers, even though the actual moments portrayed are mostly
 apocryphal. In this sense "Hebrew" functions not to orientalize or
 defamiliarize the tradition but to foreground a common inheritance. The
 form and manner of the poems are misleading as well. More love lyrics
 than ballads
 
<B></B>

 in genre, the poems appear to retreat into the private
 realm even while celebrating a homo-
and heterosexual, male and female
 tenderness and eroticism that were hotly debated along lines of gender,
 morality, and psychology at the time. The fantastic images and (according
 to one's perspective) either inaccurate or revisionary representation of
 biblical res--Jacob as a buffalo, Pharaoh and Joseph as lovers, a
 speaker who swings on clouds and can trick God without punishment--may
 suggest that the volume is pure fantasy with no relation to a world
 careening wildly toward war and revolution. Yet as Peter-Klaus Schuster
 comments in his essay on Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's exchange of drawings
 with Franz Marc, "the pursuit of the miraculous is a gesture of
 defiance, and it is the only way to prevail over reality" (<I>DS,</I>
 49). Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's work is not miraculous, but fantasy is key
 to her inventiveness. <I>Hebrew Ballads</I> does not take an already
 defined side in the political battles of its day, but its patterns of
 alternative modeling are clear. The National Socialists, then, may have
 been more accurate readers than many of Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's friends
 in recognizing that her work was indeed "hostile" to prevailing German
 assumptions, in 1914 as well as in the 1930s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's fantasy in this volume and in her prose is
undeniably utopian, but, for her, no vision of utopia, whether past or
future, can be sustained. In the mythic past of her wild Jews, Cain kills
Abel, Jonathan chooses to follow his father into battle, and Moses dies
in what appears to be heart-wrenching prayer. Moreover, the despair of
"My People" is answered only through representations of this mythic
past, leaving the volume's opening scene of decay and flight intact in
the present. The volume's conclusion can also be read more as a question
than as a response to the questions of the first poem. In the world's
beginning, human mischievousness or disobedience was part of a cosmic
joke that caused laughter. In contrast, now that God has aged and humans
no longer enjoy the status of favored "rascals," the poem may raise the
question of what will happen when humans again get it wrong, for example,
when they again imagine Satan in heaven and God in hell.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The most utopian moment of <I>Hebrew Ballads</I> comes in the poem
"Reconciliation" (<I>Vers&ouml;hnung</I>), where the speaker prophesies
at the poem's beginning and end that "A great star will fall in my
lap"--perhaps the star of Judaism itself (<I>WB,</I> 166). This hint
of maternity, however, is contradicted by the poem's representation of
humans as scared, tired children, and the play in the poem's title, which
echoes "<I>Vers&ouml;hnungstag</I>" or Yom Kippur. Perhaps with this
poem Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler wants to suggest that even though suffering,
or having greatly sinned, the Jewish people will again attain a grace
in which "God overflows."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 The poem may also refer to the destructive divisions of prewar Germany
 and the consequent need for "reconciliation"
 or "atonement." This is the strongest utopian moment of the volume, but
 the fact that it is followed by "Moses und Joshua"--a poem ending with
 Moses' death before entering Canaan, "As his tired lion's soul cried out
 to God"--suggests the apocalyptic nature of its prophecy (the speaker
 claims "When we embrace, we do not die") (<I>WB,</I> 167). The "great
 star" may fall only when all Jews return from their wandering to this
 promised land. The future's promise in this sense seems less hopeful
 
<B></B>


 than the idea that the thought of "reconciliation" (or the practice of
 Yom Kippur) can bring humans to overcome their fears and "embrace." In
 her fiction, where Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler is most explicit in constructing
 a fantasy world, utopia also most explicitly cannot be sustained. For
 example, in <I>The King,</I> Prince Jussuf commits suicide at the end,
 unable to face his own loneliness, losses, and mistakes. While there
 is no such final despair in <I>Hebrew Ballads</I>, the poet embeds
 her poems of utopia among others powerfully lamenting isolation and
 loss. The volume's expression of hope and despair suggests how qualified
 her faith is that the world she can imagine might be realized.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The political focus of <I>Hebrew Ballads</I> is a zeitgeist, not a
specific event or person. Hence perhaps the volume is difficult to
place politically. Eavan Boland writes of "the confusion of the public
and the political" in Irish poetry and defines the political poem as
"a continuing action which revises, in some decisive way, the perceived
relation of power between an inner and outer world."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 What Else Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler writes is simultaneously a public
 (religious) history and a fantasy. Without addressing public issues of
 the social or national sphere, her work revises the perceived relations
 of power in the world it constructs as an alternative to that in which
 the poet lives.

Because Yussuf never grows to manhood and Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler marks
herself as "feminine" through jewelry even when dressed as Yussuf,
as well as celebrating female sexuality in her writing, "androgynous"
seems a more accurate category than "male" for the poet. This idea is

distance from what he calls the prevailing "comrades of mankind" strain of
Expressionism ("MH," 116). Retrospectively, one might also note the irony

Notions of brotherhood may also be related to the active public support

male homosexuals, as did Rudolf Leonhard (both were Jewish Expressionist

claiming that "'acquired homosexuality' . . . is the right of ethically
and aesthetically superior men" (quoted in "NM," 590). During the teens

gay men that Paris did for lesbians.

In <I>The Big Sea,</I> Langston Hughes describes the authorship dispute
that ended his collaboration with Zora Neale Hurston by insisting that
theirs "was not really a literary quarrel."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 He discredits Hurston's claim to sole authorship of <I>Mule Bone</I>
 and denies any artistic basis for their quarrel by indicating that
 Hurston was motivated by irrational jealousy of another woman:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
She said, yes, she had sent the play to <I>her</I> agent [under her

the play her play--even if I had put it together, and she didn't want
me to have any part in it. Girls are funny creatures! [<I>BS,</I> 332]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although Hughes's story is misleading and self-serving, when read on a
rative level it does highlight Hurston's artistic motives for ending
the collaborative relationship by recapitulating the literary strategy
that caused the dispute. In the spring of 1930, when Hurston and Hughes
began planning a dramatic comedy based on Hurston's short story "The Bone
of Contention," Hughes structured the play around a romantic triangle,
thereby displacing and altering the artistic and political themes at
the center of Hurston's story. Unwilling to accept this disruption of
her artistic vision, Hurston ultimately stopped working with Hughes,
wrote a new version of the play, claimed sole authorship of the drama,
and stopped production of the collaboratively written version.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although Hurston succeeded in preventing production or publication of
Hughes's preferred version during her lifetime, his romantic triangles
have dominated the reception of the play and critical accounts of the
collaboration. In 1991, <I>Mule Bone</I> was produced at Lincoln Center
and published in a full-length version for the first time, through the
advocacy of George Houston Bass and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. The cover
of this edition promises "the complete story of the <I>Mule Bone</I>
controversy," and, toward that end, includes Hughes's account from
<I>The Big Sea,</I> Robert Hemenway's and Arnold Rampersad's accounts
from their biographies of Hurston and Hughes, respectively, and numerous
letters written while the play's authorship was being disputed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Both biographers focus primarily on problems of "patronage and
 personality," including the triangle of Hurston, Hughes, and Louise
 Thompson, the "girl" whom Hughes says Hurston "didn't like" (<I>ZNH,</I>
 136). Despite assurances that Hughes's relationships with Thompson and
 Hurston were both platonic, Rampersad concludes that Hurston "acted
 like a lover spurned" when she ended the collaboration (<I>LH,</I> 136).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his introduction to the Harper edition, Gates indicates that he
finds Rampersad's reconstruction of the conflict most accurate, but
characterizes the conflict as "a complex and bizarre incident that
will forever remain impossible to understand completely, beclouded in
inexplicable motivation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Gates makes no reference to Ruthe T. Sheffey's 1987 article about
 <I>Mule Bone,</I> the only critical analysis that examines the play's
 texts for evidence of artistic disagreement and, consequently, the
 only one that identifies Hughes's insertion of a romantic triangle
 as the cause of the Hurston-Hughes split. Sheffey demonstrates that
 Hughes's romantic triangle displaced Hurston's focus on religious and
 political power, compromising the original folk themes incorporated into
 "The Bone of Contention" and "negat[ing] any movement in the direction
 of female wholeness," a transformation that "must have justifiably
 enraged Hurston."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I build on Sheffey's argument by considering how Hughes's insistence on
romantic triangles affected representations of artistry and authorship
in the play, as well as Hurston's efforts to redefine existing notions
of authorship through collaboration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Through a feminist analysis of the genetic history of <I>Mule Bone,</I>
 including two previously unexamined drafts at the Library of Congress,
 I will reconstruct Hurston and Hughes's writing process, reevaluate
 Hurston's versions of <I>Mule Bone,</I> and reposition Hurston's and
 Hughes's problems of "patronage and personality" in relationship to
 ideological disputes about definitions and representations of authorship,
 artistry, and authority.

Constructing Collaborative Authority
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On 12 April 1928, Hurston wrote Hughes from Florida, initiating the
<I>Mule Bone</I> collaboration by proposing that he join her in creating a
"new," "<I>real</I> Negro art theatre."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Hurston was planning to bring her own versions of southern black folk
 performances

<B></B>

to New York, but in doing so, she faced three major, interrelated
obstacles: her patron Charlotte Osgood Mason's ownership of her folk
materials; the mainstream demand for stereotypical, minstrel-like
representations of blacks; and the need to find a form that would bridge
the gap between performance conventions of the New York art theatre and
those of the southern black rural community.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 All of these obstacles posed significant problems of authorship
 and authority for a woman of the rural South seeking to develop a
 reputation as an African American author. As Hemenway has noted, in the
 late 1920s, Hurston was searching for an intellectual approach and new
 literary genres that would integrate the folk artistry of Eatonville,
 the anthropology of Barnard College, and the aesthetic revolution of
 Harlem. To her Harlem Renaissance contemporaries, however, Hurston's
 anthropological work and performances of Eatonville folklore at Harlem
 parties tarnished her reputation as an aspiring literary author. Men
 such as Hughes, Wallace Thurman, Bruce Nugent, and Arna Bontemps read
 Hurston's intellectual struggle to integrate seemingly disparate elements
 as a lack of artistic commitment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston hoped that collaborating with Hughes would help her to overcome
all of these obstacles. As a fellow "godchild" living near Mason in New
York, Hughes was particularly well situated to advise Hurston on how to
handle Mason (<I>LH,</I> 183). In the summer of 1928 Hurston suggested
that Hughes help her persuade Mason when possible and evade her if
necessary: "Could you broach the magazine article to [Godmother]? I
couldnt very easily. . . . Shall we work on [our show] at once? I am
willing if you are. I know that G[odmother] would never consent for me
to do so, so you will have to take it all in your name."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Hurston apparently thought that Mason would be more likely to approve a
 magazine article than a theatrical endeavor and was willing to circumvent
 Godmother's control of these folk materials by putting them in Hughes's
 name. Her priority here was not authorship credit but the creation of a
 new African American drama, a goal she believed would be best achieved
 through collaboration.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hughes seemed an ideal artistic collaborator. Unlike most other Harlem
Renaissance writers, he had a genuine interest in southern folklore. In
1927, after an accidental meeting, the two took an extended automobile
trip from Mobile to Manhattan, discussing plans for an opera and sharing
their knowledge and ideas about folklore along the way. Hurston had a
deeper background in southern folklore, possessing not only the southern
upbringing that Hughes lacked but also the knowledge gained from the
anthropological field work she had just completed. Nonetheless, Hughes
had spent some time in the (mostly urban) South collecting conjure lore
and folk expressions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The letters Hurston sent Hughes upon her return to southern fieldwork in
1928 and 1929 indicate that she found Hughes a sympathetic and useful
sounding board, a helpful collaborator from afar: "I am collecting the
expressions, similes, etc as you suggested but that is another instance
of our thoughts clicking."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Hughes provided both useful advice and positive reinforcement for
 Hurston's ideas. Not infrequently,

<B></B>

Hurston's thanks are extravagant: "Without flattery, Langston, you are
the brains of this argosy. All the ideas have come out of your head."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 As long as Hurston was in the field, receiving Hughes's suggestions
 from a distance, using them as she liked, and in undisputed control
 of her working process and textual products, she could afford to be
 extravagant in her praise and generous with offers of authorship credit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most important in their long-distance relationship was the technique
Hurston devised for loosening the tongues of her informants using Hughes's
poetry. At each new location, Hurston organized storytelling sessions,
which she began by reading from Hughes's <I>Fine Clothes to the Jew.</I>
Hurston reported excitedly that "they are making it so much a part of
themselves they go to improvising on it. . . . One man was giving the
words out-lining them out as the preacher does a hymn and the others
would take it up and sing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 The ease and enthusiasm with which these folk artists assimilated
 Hughes's poetry into their own performances implied a compatibility of
 Hughes's and Hurston's aesthetics that struck Hurston forcefully. Yet,
 this free-flowing exchange between Hurston and her folk sources again
 places Hughes at a disadvantage imposed by distance. His fixed textual
 contributions are manipulated by Hurston and her informants through
 performance and improvisation. This experience, combined with Hurston
 and Hughes's car trip together, led Hurston to believe that Hughes
 was particularly well-suited not only to write the type of drama she
 envisioned but also to participate in the type of collaborative process
 she was seeking.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston and Hughes finally had the opportunity to work together on
their play in the spring of 1930. Both were living in Westfield,
New Jersey, roughly an hour from Manhattan, because Mason believed
they would get more writing done away from the distractions of New
York City. The most vivid picture of the early writing process in
Hemenway's and Rampersad's accounts is of Hurston "reducing [Hughes
and their stenographer-typist, Thompson] to helpless laughter as she
acted out all the parts" (<I>ZNH,</I> 137-8). The powerful image
of Hurston acting out all the "male and female roles in a variety of
voices" suggests that Hurston's performances played a central role in the
writing process and the shaping of Hurston's and Hughes's identities as
(co)authors. (<I>LH,</I> 184)
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In thinking about Hurston's and Hughes's conceptualization of a
collaborative authorial identity, we can imagine the effects of
Hurston's performances in a variety of ways. Initially, having just
returned from fieldwork where she and her informants improvised on each
others' contributions, Hurston would have viewed these performances as an
excellent way to bridge the gap between group vernacular folk performances
and solitary writing--and among her identities as "anthropologist,"
"raconteur," and "author." She may have expected Hughes to perform
as well, participating in a creative process like vernacular folk
performance, with its permeable boundary between artists and audience who
swap roles frequently so that all are potentially artists themselves. But
Hughes's apparent failure to produce performances comparable to Hurston's
suggests that Hurston's oral creative practices established an

<B></B>

uneven relationship between them. The nature of this inequality was
probably variously interpreted by the different participants. In Hurston's
mind, Hughes may have appeared to act primarily as an audience member
opposite her own role as artist. She may have viewed these performances
as an opportunity to test and hone her material in front of an ideal
audience member--an oral invention and editing process through which she
revised her work-in-progress. Hurston no doubt acquired an even stronger
sense of ownership over her research materials as she performed all of
the parts before Hughes and Thompson. In these performances, Hurston not
only dominated the stage but also literally embodied the developing text.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hughes, meanwhile, would have viewed these performances from a
different vantage point. Perhaps he mentally classified Hurston as the
"folk" during her performances, equating her with the characters she
performed. This elision was made more likely by Hurston's status as an
Eatonville native and Hughes's familiarity with Hurston's presentation
of Eatonville folklore at Harlem parties even before she had made any
formal anthropological expeditions. In this conration, Hughes
becomes author-anthropologist, encouraged by Hurston's extravagant
praise and offers of authorship credit in her letters from the field,
interpreting and structuring what he viewed as Hurston's "naive" or
"primitive" performances of material that was unrefined, unstructured,
unwritten, and, as yet, unauthored.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We need not imagine that Hurston and Hughes each consistently held to a
single vision of their roles as collaborators throughout their writing
process. I consider it much more likely that they each imagined their
roles and working relationship in different ways at different times. What
we do know is that, when the two collaborators argued over authorship
credit in 1931, each privileged the definition of "authorship" and
"the writing process" in his or her respective self-interest. Hurston
claimed sole authorship using the vocabulary of performance, "It
was my story from beginning to end. It is my <I>dialogue;</I> my
<I>situations.</I>" In response, Hughes documented his coauthorship with
texts and the vocabulary of the writer, telling Spingarn that the plot
that he and Hurston initially agreed upon was "largely worked out and
<I>constructed</I> by myself, and the whole action <I>outlined</I> in
my own <I>handwriting.</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 A knowledge of their different backgrounds suggests that their different
 vocabularies represent not only rhetoric for the promotion of their
 individual interests after the working relationship dissolved but
 also the different conceptions of artistic creation that they valued
 most throughout the writing process. Hurston was more committed to
 and at home with a vernacular model of artistic creation than Hughes
 was; Hughes associated the writerly acts of selection, outlining, and
 (hand)writing with authorship.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even before the collapse of the collaborative relationship, Hurston's
and Hughes's differing approaches to artistic creation would have had a
strong influence on their decision-making process. Hurston's reliance
on vernacular techniques may have been a handicap when she faced a
conflict in a collaborative writing situation. Although, as her other
works demonstrate, "telling lies" can be used to express conflict between
individuals and to reveal power relations, these vernacular approaches

<B></B>

are based on turn-taking that allows an audience to hear multiple and
competing tales about a single character or theme.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 There is no need to settle on a single version of a story, as there is in
 the linear dramatic plots that dominate Broadway, or on a final written
 version of a script that will displace other possible versions. Hurston's
 experiences in Eatonville and Polk County apparently did not prepare her
 to win an argument with Hughes about the structuring of a drama. As a
 consequence, Hughes's romance plot structures most of the manuscripts
 and typescripts of <I>Mule Bone,</I> as well as the published edition
 available today.

We do not have access to Hurston's oral performances during the writing
process, but we do have her initial approach to fictionalizing the
folktale on which <I>Mule Bone</I> is based. "The Bone of Contention," a
short story she wrote before collaborating with Hughes, is an excellent
starting point for a play designed to mediate between the southern black
vernacular tradition and the black Broadway musical of the 1920s, a
goal both Hurston and Hughes shared. Its plot and themes demonstrate
the complexity and power of black folk culture through interwoven
representations of folklore and politics in an all-black Florida town.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The catalyst for town conflict is a t over a wild turkey, which is
 won when one hunter, Jim, hits the other, Dave, over the head with the
 hock bone of Brazzle's yellow mule. This personal, physical t is soon
 incorporated into the ongoing religious conflict between Eatonville's
 Methodists and Baptists as well as the more recent political conflict
 between the two men who would be mayor--the incumbent, Joe Clark and
 the new Methodist minister, Reverend Simms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These political conflicts are used as material for an exploration
of the process of artistic and cultural creation in Eatonville. Each
Eatonville resident retells the tale of the t: outside the courtroom
"the children [engage] in fisticuffy trials of the case"; inside, adults
engage in pretrial argument by playing the dozens, or "specifying,"
across church and class lines (<I>MB,</I> 34). During the official
trial, African American preaching is the discourse of authority in
the courtroom. Reverend Long wins the case with a syllogism that draws
on Judges 15:16, which states that the jawbone of an ass killed 1,000
Philistines:

"The Bone of Contention" stands out as a perfect vehicle for the
reinvention of 1920s black Broadway musicals for a second reason: its
similarity--to a point--with the decade's prototype, <I>Shuffle Along.</I>
Created in 1921 by Noble Sissle, Eubie Blake, and a talented cast of black
performers, <I>Shuffle Along</I> both pushed the envelope and established
the pattern that would be recycled, exploited, and rigidly imposed on
subsequent black musicals by profit-hungry white producers well into the
1930s. <I>Shuffle Along</I> was the first major, financially successful
black musical on Broadway as well as the production that ended the
taboo on serious love scenes in black Broadway shows. For the remainder
of the 1920s, black musicals appeared regularly on Broadway, but the
profitability of <I>Shuffle Along</I> soon led white producers to take
control of the form. Their formula prevented any frequent departures
from the use of minstrel-like malapropisms and chicanery as the basis
of the shows' comedy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even in 1940, Hughes was still "thrilled and delighted" by <I>Shuffle
Along,</I> which featured outstanding performances by the comedy team
of Flournoy Miller and Aubrey Lyles, as well as Sissle and Blake:

<I>Shuffle Along</I> was a honey of a show. Swift, bright, funny,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What captured Hughes's enthusiasm was not the script but the talented,
later famous performers, the music and dancing, and the show's tremendous
popularity. This enthusiasm remained in spite of the fact that by 1928,
according to Rampersad, "all the new plays about blacks affronted him"
(<I>LH,</I> 160). Hughes's complaint about a "terrible" new Miller and
Lyles musical captures his objections to the body of black Broadway
revues and <I>Shuffle Along</I> imitators that controlled the field in
the late 1920s; they presented only hackneyed black stereotypes, including
"a listless chorus in blue overalls, the obligatory cotton field scenery,
[and] stale jokes about blacks stealing" (<I>LH,</I> 160).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hughes apparently hoped to push several steps beyond the pale <I>Shuffle
Along</I> imitators by taking what he enjoyed about the original--the
music, dancing, and comic performances by African Americans (and the
Broadway popularity they inspired)--and adding what even the original
had lacked--a solid script that rejected more of the stereotypes. "The
Bone of Contention" was an ideal vehicle for reforming the stereotypes
of <I>Shuffle Along</I> while still providing a plot that might seem
familiar enough to appeal to Broadway audiences and producers. Both the
musical and the short story include a conflict among men who would be
mayor in an all-black town. In <I>Shuffle Along</I>, political conflict
is largely an excuse for displays of

<B></B>

chicanery, theft, and foolishness by two of three mayoral candidates,
and the idea of black political candidacy seems a source of humor
in itself. In contrast, in "The Bone of Contention" town politics
are produced through a complex interplay of religious conflict and
personal ambition, and there is nothing inherently funny about black
politics. <I>Shuffle Along</I> relies in large part on malapropisms,
slapstick, and comic ineptitude to produce laughs. "The Bone of
Contention" focuses on displays of verbal and physical prowess rather
than buffoonery and draws specifically on rural southern folk traditions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 All of these elements of "The Bone of Contention" are utilized in
 <I>Mule Bone.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston and Hughes used southern folk sources to rere the relationship
between North and South found in typical black Broadway musicals. Such
shows often make a rative trip from South to North, beginning with
songs that harken back to good old plantation days (e.g., "Bandanna
Days" in <I>Shuffle Along</I>) and ending with songs about life in the
North, which is red either as more confusing (e.g., "On Patrol in No
Man's Land" in <I>Shuffle Along</I>) or more sophisticated (in <I>Dixie
to Broadway</I> and <I>Blackbirds</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 In contrast, <I>Mule Bone</I> starts and ends in the South, celebrating
 the folk artistry of an all-black town rather than longing for
 plantations, slavery, and mammies. As I will discuss below, the one
 character who returns from the North, Daisy, is associated with whites
 and threatens traditional black southern folk culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Mule Bone</I> also revises black musical performance traditions by
reimagining the black male song-and-dance team. In the tradition of
Walker and Williams, Johnson and Cole, and the two <I>Shuffle Along</I>
duos--Sissle and Blake and Lyles and Miller--the central characters
of <I>Mule Bone</I> sing and dance for the audience. However, in an
interesting departure from the typical black musical (and "The Bone of
Contention"), Dave and Jim are a song-and-dance team <I>in the plot</I>
as well. The change allows Hurston and Hughes to incorporate music and
dance into the plot fairly realistically rather than presenting a skimpy,
undeveloped plot as an excuse for a musical revue. This change also
facilitates a major revision of previous representations of black men as
collaborators. Leading male duos in black Broadway musicals had typically
been partners in crime in the plot. In <I>Shuffle Along</I>, Steve and
Sam collaborate only provisionally; the majority of their relationship
consists of their repeated betrayals of each other and of Jimtown. They
betray their original partnership as co-owners of a grocery store,
first by running against each other in the election, next by stealing
from the store to buy votes, and finally by hiring an investigator when
they become suspicious of each other. The two men also betray the town
by forming a secret political alliance, promising that the winner will
make the loser Chief of Police. As soon as Steve wins the campaign, he
betrays all those he made promises to, including, initially, Sam. In
short, the plot demonstrates that there is no honor among thieves--or
black male collaborators. The only honest mayoral candidate in the play,
Harry Walton, does not have a male collaborator but rather a lady-love
who stands supportively behind him in a respectable feminine manner.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Mule Bone</I>'s representation of collaboration turns <I>Shuffle
Along</I> on its head by making black male artistic collaboration
a positive force in the cultural life of Eatonville. By transforming
Dave and Jim of "The Bone of Contention" into a song-and-dance team that
functions in both a professional context (playing for white folks) and a
folk context (playing for the Eatonville community), Hughes and Hurston
give them dual status as authors and folk artists who are central to
Eatonville's cultural life. Rather than treating the partners as a
constant double threat to good government and each other, Hurston and
Hughes treat conflict between team members as a rarity that hurts both
team and town. In <I>Shuffle Along,</I> both cooperation and conflict
between black male collaborators is criminal, and such collaboration is
inevitably both corrupted and corrupting. In <I>Mule Bone,</I> only the
rare conflict between black male collaborators is criminalized.

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston's careful development of the team of Lonnie and My Honey in
<I>Polk County</I> demonstrates that the positive reinvention of the
black male musical team was as important to her vision of a "<I>real</I>
Negro art theatre" as it was to Hughes's.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 However, Hughes pushed through another textual transformation that
 Hurston, in the end, could not abide: the substitution of a woman for
 a turkey as the object of contention between Dave and Jim, a change
 that led to the excision of most of the positive representations of
 black women's artistry. By structuring the plot around the conflict
 produced by a romantic triangle, Hughes set in motion a mechanism that
 defined the female love object and male-female relationships as threats
 to the male collaborative relationship at the center of Eatonville's
 cultural life. Hurston had included no romance plot and no such negative
 evaluation of women in "The Bone of Contention." This transformation
 eventually drove Hurston to end the collaboration.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston's dissatisfaction with the romantic triangle is best illustrated
through an examination of the collaboration in relation to the unpublished
<I>Mule Bone</I> manuscripts. The earliest extant notes for the play,
written in Hughes's hand, focus on Daisy and make no reference to the
turkey (N1:1).
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 This suggests that Hughes's decision to focus on the romance plot
 was made very shortly after Hughes and Hurston came together to
 work on their play in the spring of 1930. Rampersad and Gates have
 indicated that Hughes "plotted out" the play; Hemenway (with Sheffey
 in agreement) specifically states that "the turkey was dropped (over
 Hurston's objections) and a girl made the root of the argument," but
 no critic cites early notes or drafts documenting Hurston's side of
 this dispute, nor have I found any.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Nonetheless, I agree with this assessment; plentiful evidence documents
 Hughes's resistance to Hurston's later efforts to insert the turkey and
 deemphasize the romance plot, including a letter he wrote to Spingarn,
 as well as Hurston's individually written draft, titled <I>De Turkey
 and de Law,</I> and Hughes's revisions, discussed below.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 All extant early notes for the play are in Hughes's hand, which suggests
 the possibility

<B></B>

that these notes represent only the ideas he preferred and exclude
Hurston's other early contributions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The substitution of a woman for a turkey would obviously have far-reaching
implications. In all likelihood, Hughes wanted to provide the play with
a structuring device that would be familiar and, therefore, saleable
to Broadway producers and audiences. Sheffey argues that to Hurston,
who had grown up in Eatonville, "the play could legitimately turn on
political and religious power structures of Afro-American men" but
that in 1930, these power structures would have appeared "ludicrous"
or "even unthinkable" to the whites who would be the majority of the
audience for any economically successful Broadway production and that
"Langston, remembered by friends and foes as a playwright who kept a
realistic eye on box office receipts" therefore wanted to deemphasize
those power structures ("HH," 50-1). Hurston seems to have been
persuaded temporarily by Hughes's argument in favor of a romance, but
the manuscripts suggest that the authors were unable to agree on what
kind of character this new female love interest would be. No other
character underwent as many changes. For the duration of the writing
process, the depiction of Daisy swung back and forth between an artist
re and a dangerous temptress who draws men from their art and their
community obligations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The earliest notes begin with a subtitle, "New Gal in Town," that
positions Daisy as the invading outsider (N1:1). The brief character
descriptions in these notes refer to some of the basic political
structures of "The Bone of Contention." The Mayor and the Baptist
minister, "old-timers," who "run the place" and "understand" it, are
being challenged by the new Methodist minister. The only reference to a
woman other than Daisy is in a few lines of dialogue attributed simply to
"Woman": "In Daytona they locks men up fo' beatin' women. You all better
not get no jail here an start lockin' up ma husband cause he beats me
so good." In contrast, Daisy, "dis pretty, strappin' gal done come down
here from up North," is an attractive, "flirtacious," "real free-lover,"
who sings, dances, and wears fancy clothes to attract attention. Neither
woman is derived from Hurston's short story. Daisy's ease of movement
among male lovers and admirers stands in stark contrast to the fixed
position of the Eatonville "Woman." In these notes, Daisy has at least
the potential to function as a positive, independent woman who will
shake up the "old timers," male and female.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the first extant typewritten draft of act 1 (D1:3), however, Daisy
is stripped of her status as a singer and dancer and is portrayed
primarily as a seductress antagonistic to community values. At her first
appearance, Daisy "enters hippily, conscious of her clothes, 'She-ness,'
sportily dressed." She repeatedly threatens the mainstay of Eatonville
culture, the festivities stemming from performances by Dave and Jim
who play together less often now that they are chasing Daisy. The two
men slow their playing when Daisy makes her first entrance. She stops
their performances by "pretend[ing] not to have been entertained" and
by causing the t that ends with the use of the mule bone. A brief
outline of the second act indicates that Daisy attends the trial. It
ends with "Old Sister" explicitly blaming Daisy for Eatonville's troubles:

<B></B>

"Lawd--dis Northern-dressed gal done broke up de Society of dis
holy town." Although the groundwork is laid for the power struggle
between Reverend Simms and Mayor Clark (<I>sic</I>) early in act 1, the
political struggles are left largely undeveloped, even in the notes for
act 2. Instead, attention is focused on the romantic triangle; Daisy's
aggressive female sexuality is the primary cause of community strife.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The next group of notes (N1:2-N1:5) focus again on the political
conflict between Baptists and Methodists that originated in "The Bone of
Contention" and introduce a new and threatening alliance between Daisy
and the white community. Two proposed endings for act 3 highlight this
connection. In the first, she closes the play with: "I'm gonna stick by
my white folks from now on. Dog-gone all men!" In the second, Dave sees
Daisy approaching, "fat and hot and puffing," her attractiveness gone. The
"five o'clock whistle blows. Daisey leaves [Dave and Jim] to go back
to her white folks. Dave and Jim look at one another shamefacedly. Both
tricked, and begin to damn women" (N1:2). The connection between Daisy's
gender and her loyalty to whites over blacks will be developed more
subtly in later drafts. Daisy is also removed from the trial on the
grounds that she must go to work for her white employers. This absence
limits Daisy's role and power, cements her status as a female outsider,
associates her more clearly with the whites, and makes the village-wide
conflict more a result of internal Eatonville politics and less a result
of the invasion of an outsider. Daisy becomes a catalyst rather than a
primary cause of Eatonville's conflict.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The next draft (D1:4) contains evidence suggesting that Hurston had
grown uncomfortable with such a negative portrait of the leading female
character. This draft elaborates on early indications that Daisy would
be an artist re. In D1:4, she appears on the scene as a Harlem
sophisticate, "dressed in the latest Harlem fashion with her hair slicked
down a la Josephine Baker, fingers covered with rings, rather flashily
dressed." The invocation of the name and image of <I>Shuffle Along</I>'s
most famous chorus girl suggests that we will be seeing revisions of
Broadway stereotypes of black women to accompany the new approach to
the male song-and-dance team. In <I>Shuffle Along,</I> her first big
break, Baker was the darkest woman in the chorus, an attribute that,
at the time, seemed to limit her to the role of "high-steppin' clown"
rather than exceptional beauty.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 But by 1925, in <I>La Revue negre</I> in Paris, she successfully
 developed an on-stage/off-stage image as an exotic, erotic
 beauty. Although today most believe that this persona coincides too
 closely with the stereotype of the black woman as "supersexy noble
 savage," in the 1920s, Donald Bogle argues, Baker's new professional
 and personal identity represented a step beyond Broadway limitations
 that many American black women respected and celebrated: "In the black
 community there had long been a fantasy of another world, another place
 and time, where the black woman would be seen for her unique brown
 beauty. In essence and act, Josephine Baker had escaped and lived out
 the fantasy for women back home."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In D1:4, Hurston recreates Daisy as a woman who travels to a faraway,
exotic city and acquires a newly glamorous, sophisticated image, just
as Baker did. Although this

<B></B>

"Harlem Daisy" is not fully elaborated, her initial entrance suggests
that she was to become a more complex character with something valuable
to contribute to the Eatonville community. In this draft only, Daisy is
welcomed warmly by a "general rush of villagers" (women as well as men)
and speaks to the new minister, promising to come to church. Her interest
in reestablishing a connection with one of the community's central
institutions makes her much less threatening to Eatonville's values. This
is also the only draft in which Daisy has returned from a recognizable
and specific black community (Harlem) rather than a foreign but vague
North associated only with flashy clothing and service to white employers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Additionally, all of the changes in Daisy's character in this draft
increase her resemblance to Hurston herself. This Daisy lived in
Eatonville, traveled to Harlem, and then returned home (as Hurston did
to collect folklore). She is no longer the new girl in town or simply
a Maitland resident; this Daisy is compared to a Harlem Renaissance
artist. What clinches the comparison--and indicates that Hurston wrote
this segment herself--is that, for the first time, this Daisy makes a
grand entrance that resembles the one Hurston will write for herself
a few years later in <I>Mules and Men.</I> Both the Harlem Daisy and
Zora of <I>Mules and Men</I> are joyfully welcomed by the folks in
Eatonville, both make contact with old friends and become acquainted
with new residents, and both ask to join in local activities. In <I>Mules
and Men,</I> Zora explains that, despite her northern accoutrements, her
"diploma and a Chevrolet," she "was still just Lucy Hurston's daughter
Zora" when she returned home to Eatonville.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Daisy, in this draft, seems destined to be similarly reincorporated
 into the community, despite her new Harlem chic. In contrast to other
 drafts, Daisy's freewheeling flirtatiousness is consonant with the
 behavior of other Eatonville women. Her first entrance is positioned
 immediately after Teets and Bootsie dance with Joe Lindsay and Walter
 Thomas, and, earlier in the act, a married woman is shown flirting with
 Hambo while her husband is out of town. Friendly flirtations initiated
 by both women and men seem a natural part of town life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But in the next draft (D1:5), the Harlem Daisy is crossed out--apparently
by Hughes--never to appear again. Penned-in corrections and additions
make D1:5 substantially similar to all subsequent drafts of act 1 that
Hughes worked on and to the Harper edition. Daisy, in these drafts, has
been firmly repositioned as an outsider, different from the Eatonville
women. The warm reception she receives from the "general rush of
villagers" in D1:4 is replaced by the specifically sexual interest of
the men on the store porch. Daisy's freewheeling sexuality once again
seems out of place; the flirtation between the married woman and Hambo is
excised, and Daisy's first entrance is connected with Walter's ominous
assertion that friendships among men are inevitably threatened when
disputes over a single woman arise.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Why was the Harlem Daisy eliminated? The answer seems to lie with the
romance plot, including the ultimate rejection of Daisy in act 3. In
act 1, Daisy stands out as a woman who refuses to be limited to one
man. In all extant drafts of act 3, Daisy demonstrates her independence
by agreeing to marriage only on her own specific

<B></B>

and, for Jim and Dave, unacceptable terms. After a traditional courtship
exchange demonstrates Daisy's desire to marry and a ritualized contest
ends with Daisy declaring Jim the winner, she demands to know where
they will live and how they will support themselves. Dissatisfied with
Jim's vague answers about wandering away from Eatonville and continuing
to perform, Daisy insists that her future husband take a steady job as a
yard man for her white employers. In so doing, she asserts her intention
to become an equal partner in marriage at the cost of Jim's dedication
to his art and of Dave and Jim's collaborative artistic relationship--a
cost that the play clearly defines as prohibitive. She also refuses
marriage on their terms in favor of servitude to white employers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Act 3 signifies on Broadway stereotypes of lazy black men by
 demonstrating that Dave and Jim's refusal to work--as domestic
 servants--is actually a choice to do the important cultural work of
 their community instead.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 In contrast, Daisy uses her fluency in the traditional language of
 courtship for purposes that would be detrimental to black (male)
 artistic production.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The romance plot, including the treatment of work described above, had
already been planned when Hurston created the Harlem Daisy in N1:2 and
N1:4. Even the draft in which the Harlem Daisy appears (D1:4) includes
references to her disruptiveness that potentially contradict the warmth of
her reception. To incorporate the Harlem Daisy into the play completely,
Hurston and Hughes would have needed to work through a broad range of
issues, including the relationship between Harlem and southern black
culture, the role of black women as performers in folk versus Broadway
settings, the relationship between black women and black men as artists,
and, perhaps most importantly for Hurston, the relationship between
an Eatonville native influenced by a northern aesthetic and the folk
(artists) who remained at home. A well-developed exploration of any of
these issues would have created a very different play than the version
she and Hughes had nearly completed when she left the collaboration
in May 1930. <I>Mules and Men,</I> which Hurston was structuring and
writing during this period, demonstrates her interest in pursuing these
issues, and Hurston's subsequent musical comedy, <I>Polk County,</I>
demonstrates her desire to explore them in dramatic form. Indeed, in
<I>Polk County</I> Hurston successfully addresses the issues raised
by the Harlem Daisy when she had escaped the restraints imposed by her
contract with Mason and her collaborative relationship with Hughes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Hughes, as I shall demonstrate, objected to any disruption of his romance
 plot. If Hurston and Hughes had inserted the Harlem Daisy into act 3 as
 outlined, allowing her to be rejected by both Jim and Dave, they would
 have created a parable of inevitable conflict between Eatonville and
 Harlem culture, an end result neither author could have wanted.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By late May of 1930, Hughes and Hurston had completed well developed
drafts of act 1, act 2 scene 1, and act 3 using Hughes's structure
(D1:8). This script, which would prove to be the last collaboratively
written version, approves Dave and Jim's decision to earn their living
by playing for the white folks, portraying this form of white patronage
as a necessary and acceptable accommodation to economic reality

<B></B>

that leaves men free to participate in the creation of black art and
black community outside of working hours. In contrast, Daisy, although
an able talker, is not, in the end, a professional artist. Her presence
in Eatonville is destructive to black (male) artistic production, and
her relationship with white employers is judged not as a necessary
accommodation but as a betrayal of her (former) community.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston had good reason to view the objectification of Daisy as an attack
on black women's artistic authority and integrity and, consequently, on
her own artistic vision and authority. If Hughes had encouraged her to
develop the fictionalized self-portrait begun with the Harlem Daisy,
the result might have been a more rounded portrait of a woman as both
a creative artist and a sexual human being, as Big Sweet is in <I>Polk
County</I>. Instead, Hughes insistently refocused attention on Daisy
as a sexual object. One of the play's "village wags," Walter, has a
conversation with Daisy early in act 1 that elucidates the structural
imperatives that govern her role in Hughes's romance plot:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A woman, Walter's remark indicates, naturally disrupts the relationship
between two men who simultaneously desire her. Once such a love triangle
is established, it must be resolved in one of two ways: by one man
gaining possession of the object (hence Walter urges her to "tell us
which one you laks de best"), or by both men rejecting the object in
favor of their relationship with each other, as Dave and Jim ultimately
do in act 3 (<I>MB,</I> 59).
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 If the woman seeks to retain her independence and her relationship with
 both men, she, of necessity, exerts a counterforce upon this cultural
 convention that Hughes's romance plot is not designed to accommodate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At this moment in the writing process--when Daisy's position as a
demonized sexual object had just been fully elaborated--Hurston departed
Westfield to go South, telling Hughes that she would work on the climactic
trial scene of act 2 while she was away. Hemenway attributes the departure
to her perception that Hughes was trying to make Thompson more than a
stenographer and typist; Rampersad simply quotes Hughes's comment in
<I>The Big Sea</I> that Hurston was "restless and moody, working in a
nervous manner" (<I>BS,</I> 320). Both biographers argue that Hurston's
desire to consolidate her relationship with Mason while Hughes's was
deteriorating strongly influenced the breakup, either in May or in the
fall. Both indicate that Hurston avoided Hughes when she returned in
September and failed to keep appointments to work on the play with him
in November and December, but neither notes Hughes's own

<B></B>

report that during that same period Hurston wanted to "put the turkey
back in the story and cut down on the girl-interest."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Additionally, both state that Hurston copyrighted her own version of
 <I>Mule Bone</I> under her name only in October and solicited Carl Van
 Vechten's advice on her own version (D2:1) in mid-November, but neither
 appears to have located that version or interprets these moves as signs
 that dissatisfaction with the collaboratively written script may have
 motivated her May departure or the subsequent authorship dispute.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Indeed, Rampersad mentions Hurston's draft only in an effort to establish
 Hurston's intentional deceitfulness, inaccurately asserting that she
 "sent it to Van Vechten without mentioning Hughes's name" (<I>LH,</I>
 195).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact, Van Vechten wrote that Hurston sent her script with a cover
letter stating, "Langston and I started out together on the idea of the
story I used to tell you about Eatonville, but being so much apart from
rush of business I started all over again while in Mobile and this is
the result of my work alone."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 This statement reveals much about Hurston's conception of
 authorship. First, it indicates that, by this time, Hurston had abandoned
 the idea that collaborative authorship was the best approach to creating
 her <I>Mule Bone;</I> only with full authorial control could she redeem
 the play. Second, it demonstrates that Hurston believed she had a just
 claim to sole authorship of her play based on both oral and written
 uses of the material. Far from hiding her collaborative relationship
 with Hughes, Hurston acknowledged it to a man who was Hughes's friend
 as well as her own. She asserts her claim of sole authorship on two
 grounds: first, that she started anew, writing a unique version on her
 own, and, second, that she already had a claim to authorship of the
 material from a time before the collaboration, when she told the source
 story to Van Vechten. He accepted her explanation without question
 until Hughes pressed his claim.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tendency of critics other than Sheffey to overlook the importance
of Hurston's revisions is less surprising when one considers the state
of the archival material. At the time they were writing, only act 2 of
Hurston's version had been discovered, and the only extant descriptions
of her complete version(s) were the derisive assessments Hughes penned
during the authorship dispute.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 More recently, I have discovered that <I>De Turkey and de Law,</I> which
 Hurston registered at the Library of Congress under her name only on
 29 October 1930, is a complete copy of one of Hurston's individually
 drafted versions of <I>Mule Bone</I> (verifying my supposition that act
 2 of the draft of <I>Mule Bone</I> that Hughes sent to the Library of
 Congress on 19 January 1931 was lifted from Hurston's version). These
 drafts have allowed me to date the other extant drafts held at Howard
 and Yale with much greater certainty than was previously possible (see
 <A HREF="#appendix">appendix</A>). The Howard and Yale archives, which Hemenway, Rampersad,
 Sheffey, and Bass and Gates relied upon, hold only act 2 of Hurston's
 "individually authored" version(s) and only in fragmented, modified
 form, as interpolated into one of Hughes's later revisions of act 2
 for the Gilpin Players (D3:2).
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although <I>De Turkey and de Law</I> is clearly a version of <I>Mule
Bone</I>, Hurston substantially revised the play structurally and
thematically to provide more positive representations of women as
folk artists and citizens. Most importantly, Hurston eliminates
the artistic relationship between Dave and Jim, thereby removing the
structural imperatives that defined Daisy as an enemy of black artistic
production. In <I>De Turkey and de Law,</I> as in previous versions of
<I>Mule Bone,</I> Dave and Jim are friends turned rivals, separated by
their competitive courtship of Daisy, but in <I>De Turkey and de Law,</I>
Dave is a hunter, not a dancer, and Jim plays guitar primarily for the
pleasure of town residents. The number of references to Daisy's white
employers in act 1 is reduced in <I>De Turkey and de Law,</I> reflecting
her decreased role and decreased threat in this version. Daisy remains
a powerful sexual magnet, juggling not only Dave and Jim's interest
but also the successful advances of Lum Boger. In <I>De Turkey</I>
(as in D1:4, with the Harlem Daisy), however, Daisy's flirtatiousness
is a part of normal town behavior, naturalized by new segments in which
the various men court the town women. Indeed, much of act 1 focuses on
the aggressive behavior of a large number of girls and boys and women
and men, who flirt and compete within and across gender lines. And,
significantly, Hurston replaces Daisy's self-centered, feminine cry for
help at the end of the coauthored version of act 1 ("Now who's gonna
take me home?") with the aggressive scheming of Lum, who takes advantage
of Dave's and Jim's absence to instruct Daisy, "tell yo' mama to put
on de hot water kittle. I'll be round there before long." Thus, female
speech and female sexuality represent little threat to black artistry
in this version--they are a routine part of the town conflicts that
feed and comprise vernacular artistry. Hurston also improves the status
of women and girls as folk artists by revising the depiction of other
female characters. She eliminates the early misogynistic representation
of the fat, demanding Mrs. Roberts, who begs Joe Clarke for food and
henpecks her husband, by beginning the play instead with an enhanced
exploration of the interaction among children--particularly older and
younger girls--playing Chick Ma Chick Ma Craney Crow.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Having eliminated the artistic collaboration of Dave and Jim, Hurston is
free to restructure the play to be more like "The Bone of Contention,"
reestablishing the emphasis on intraracial politics and the folk
artistry of the town as a whole rather than emphasizing the professional
artistry of the two male protagonists. Part of this restructuring is the
return to the turkey as an object of contention. In <I>De Turkey and de
Law,</I> Dave, whom the other men acknowledge as the best marksman in
town, competes for Daisy's attention by promising to shoot her a wild
turkey. When Jim claims he can do the same, their Eatonville neighbors
ridicule the thought, urging Jim to stick to his own forte, music
making. Offstage, both men hunt turkey, and Dave returns to the stage
near the end of the act, reporting that he shot a wild turkey and then
fought over the bird with Jim, who claimed to have shot it himself. Dave
tells the audience that Jim used the hock bone of Brazzle's yellow mule
to strike him and win the battle; consequently, Dave asks for Jim's
arrest and expulsion from the town. In <I>De Turkey and de Law</I>, as in
"The Bone of Contention," the hock bone

<B></B>

never appears on stage; its importance lies not in its physical
properties but in its political and rative uses. And unlike the
earlier collaboratively written versions of <I>Mule Bone,</I> act 1 of
<I>De Turkey and de Law</I> ends with several pages of argument among
the town folks, which immediately place the t in symbolic political
and vernacular circulation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Act 2 of <I>De Turkey and de Law,</I> the first full extant version of
the act, again demonstrates the value Hurston placed on representations of
women's skillful use of black vernacular as well as on the reinstatement
of the turkey. Her scene 1 (also included in the Harper edition) takes
place on a street in front of one or two houses--the women's domain--in
contrast to the store porch, which is controlled by the men. This short
scene displays the women's ways of discussing and enacting town politics
among themselves and subjects the men who pass by (Clarke, Lum, Reverends
Simms and Childers, Dave, and Lindsay) to the women's critical gaze--a
reversal of the gender dynamic in act 1. The trial scene (scene 2) opens
with arguments between the (female and male) Methodists and Baptists
before the official trial and closes with the ministers making their
arguments and Mayor/Judge Clarke delivering his verdict. These portions
of the trial scene were retained by Hughes in his revised versions and
were later incorporated into the Harper edition (<I>MB,</I> 108-20,
131-8). The midsection of Hurston's trial scene is devoted to the
turkey, however. Clarke attempts to get Marshall Lum Boger to present
the turkey as evidence but eventually learns that, after Lum prevented
Jim from seizing it, he allowed Mrs. Taylor to cook it and many of the
town members to eat it. The difficulties Clarke encounters in attempting
to get the turkey incorporated into the trial point humorously to
the town members' appropriation and use of the t for their own
specific purposes. (These difficulties also resonate with the trials
Hurston encountered in her effort to get the turkey incorporated into the
script.) When Dave indicates that he wanted to give the turkey to Daisy as
a gift, Daisy's mother stops all further discussion of her daughter. This
act of silencing calls attention to Hurston's deliberate reinstatement
of folkloric components of the story in place of the previous focus on
the romance plot.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The dialogue in act 3 of <I>De Turkey</I> remains similar to that
in previous drafts of <I>Mule Bone,</I> except that, here again, the
turkey is inserted as one of the objects of contention and the artistic
collaboration is eliminated. Thus, when Daisy asks first Jim and then Dave
to marry her and work for her white employers she is asking them to sever
their male friendship and leave the all-black community of Eatonville,
but she is not threatening black artistic production in Eatonville. In
rejecting her, the men continue to prioritize black men's friendship and
economic independence over romance, but the cultural life of Eatonville
is never seriously endangered.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As I will discuss below, <I>De Turkey and de Law</I> is substantially
similar to the version of <I>Mule Bone</I> (D2:1) that she gave to Van
Vechten a few weeks later. Upon first reading her version, Van Vechten
was impressed enough to send the script, without Hurston's knowledge,
to Barrett Clark, a reader for the Theatre Guild. In his capacity

<B></B>

as an employee of Samuel French, Clark offered the script to Rowena
Jelliffe, director of the Gilpin Players, a black acting company located
in Cleveland. Jelliffe was enthusiastic. On January 15, the day before
she received the script from Clark, Jelliffe happened to see Hughes, who
was staying with his mother in Cleveland. Jelliffe casually mentioned to
a shocked Hughes that she had acquired a comedy by Zora Hurston called
<I>Mule Bone.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because we do not have a complete copy of that version of <I>Mule
Bone,</I> we are forced to rely on information in Hughes's letters of
January 1931, when he was attempting to reestablish his authorship credit
and artistic control of the play. Hughes's comments must be interpreted
with caution, for his personal interests at this time were opposed to
Hurston's and, as Hemenway has already documented, his accounts of the
collaboration often contain self-serving inaccuracies and omissions. For
example, in a letter of 21 January 1931 to his lawyer Arthur Spingarn,
Hughes created an inflated picture of his contribution to the script,
indicating that it was his own idea to make Dave and Jim representatives
of warring Baptist and Methodist factions, whereas we know that this
religious conflict was previously included in Hurston's "The Bone of
Contention."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 But, while Hughes's attributions of credit and his evaluation of
 Hurston's script are suspect, I have no particular reason to doubt
 his basic descriptions of the plot, and these descriptions lead me to
 conclude that this version of <I>Mule Bone</I> (D2:1) was quite similar
 to <I>De Turkey and de Law,</I> but included two additions: Hurston sent
 two possible endings to act 1 and two versions of act 3--"the original
 that [Hurston and Hughes] did together last spring [and] a new version,
 based on and very much like the original," a description that could
 apply to act 3 of <I>De Turkey and de Law.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fair or not, Hughes's evaluation of Hurston's script affected its
immediate (as well as its long-term) reception and ultimately led Hurston
to cancel the production. As soon as the script arrived in Cleveland,
Hughes took action to regain both authorship credit and artistic control,
arguing to Spingarn and Jelliffe that Hurston's version was

climax in construction, whereas Miss Hurston's insertion of the turkey

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hughes's comments do not acknowledge that Hurston had originally
sent her version to Van Vechten for advice--not to a producer for
consideration. She may have included multiple endings of act 1 and
multiple versions of act 3 because she regarded this version as a rough
draft, or she may have been willing to consult with performers (as a
result of her previous experiences with folk artists). And, in persuading
Jelliffe that Hurston's version was "out of gear" when measured against
conventional Broadway standards, Hughes prevented her from seeing that
Hurston was working

<B></B>

 to invent a new form that was derived from vernacular folklore and
 performance conventions. After persuading Jelliffe that Hurston's version
 of Acts 1 and 3 should be rejected in favor of the collaboratively
 written version and that he should edit act 2 to complement them, Hughes
 began his campaign to persuade Hurston to authorize his revisions,
 successfully enlisting the assistance of Spingarn and Clark. He
 told Hurston that she could have a greater share of the royalties,
 specifically suggesting a two-thirds/one-third split to Spingarn, a
 concession indicating his awareness that the play was more hers than his.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Critics have favored Hughes's perspective in judging the flurry of letters
that documents the authorship dispute. Hurston's repeated assertions
that the play was entirely hers have been characterized as either the
understandably vengeful response of a wronged friend (by Hemenway) or
the self-deluded beliefs of a slightly mad genius (by Rampersad).
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 A reevaluation of the correspondence in light of the genetic history
 of the text indicates that Hurston had attempted to get Hughes to
 authorize her own plans for revision before finally proceeding with
 her efforts to deauthorize him. In his January 21 letter to Spingarn,
 Hughes casts himself as the unknowing and innocent victim of Hurston's
 disingenuous behavior, stating that when he returned to New York in
 November, Hurston canceled, failed to attend, or came unprepared to a
 series of appointments. Hughes buries his one obtuse reference to their
 artistic dispute--"she thought we ought to put the turkey back in the
 story and cut down on the girl-interest"--amid a catalog of Hurston's
 cancellations and "nervous" behavior, carefully omitting his own opinion
 about Daisy and the turkey in this paragraph. He can therefore conclude,
 "since we . . . <I>had had no disagreements about our work on the play
 together or anything else,</I> I put down her actions to a rush of
 other work, and perhaps nerves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 His description is hardly credible in light of the archival evidence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston's response to Hughes's construction of events is recorded
indirectly in a letter Spingarn sent to Hughes, dictated "in Miss
Hurston's presence":

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What exactly transpired between Hurston and Hughes in the fall? The
archival evidence supports Hurston's statement that by November
she and Hughes were championing two very different versions of the
play. Although Hughes may not have realized that Hurston was going to
circulate her version under her name only, I suspect that by November
at the latest, he knew more about Hurston's version than he was later
willing to acknowledge. If he had spoken of the artistic disagreement,
his claim would have been less convincing. Hurston's statement that
Hughes had suggested

<B></B>

letting the market settle their artistic dispute is credible in light
of the more conventional nature of his preferred version.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even Hurston's claim "that virtually all of the play was written
by her" is reasonable when one values Hurston's performances as a
form of authorship, as she did, and views the play in light of the
dispute. Hughes's primary contribution to <I>Mule Bone</I> was, as he so
often said, "its construction," or structure, and he seems to have created
that structure by making the romantic triangle the center of the plot and
by selecting the portions of Hurston's performances and writing that would
be included in the drama. Her version, as even Hughes admits, deemphasized
his romance plot in ways he considered completely unacceptable and
rejected his selection of folklore, reinstating the turkey that he had
eliminated. In rejecting his structure, Hurston rejected his primary
contribution and, in the face of Hughes's resistance, had ample artistic
and ideological motivations for denying him coauthorship in her version.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although Hughes tried to appease her with a greater share of the
royalties, Hurston was more interested in artistic control than in
financial rewards. On January 20, she sent Jelliffe two telegrams, the
first authorizing the production and the second voicing concerns about
the "integrity of [the] script" and stipulating that "not one word must
be altered except by me."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Jelliffe disregarded this stipulation, allowing Hughes to proceed
 with his revisions--elimination of the turkey, restoration of the
 professional male artistic collaboration, and reemphasis of the
 romantic triangle. As he revised, Hughes eliminated the primary scene
 that represented women's ways of wielding black vernacular, the street
 scene that opens act 2 (<I>De Turkey</I> and D3:2-D3:4). The Gilpin
 Players' production, then, would have excluded any representations of
 women as professional artists comparable in status to Dave and Jim,
 would have cut representations of women's artistry and power to a bare
 minimum, would have identified the central female character as a threat
 to black artistic production, and would have diluted the focus on town
 politics and folklore that Hurston had taken pains to reinstate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From Hurston's perspective, Hughes had butchered her <I>Mule Bone</I>. Her
refusals to reestablish the collaborative relationship and to authorize
the Cleveland production were not primarily personal, emotional, or
financial responses; they were first and foremost actions promoting her
authorial interests, artistic goals, and ideological positions. Although
I am persuaded by Hemenway's assertion that Hurston felt betrayed
by Hughes's growing friendship with Thompson and by both biographers'
assertion that Hurston had much to gain financially by strengthening her
relationship with Mason, I argue that these factors are subordinate to
the artistic and ideological dispute.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Hurston aligned herself with Mason and against Hughes in January 1931
 for the same reason that she had enlisted Hughes as her collaborator
 and co-conspirator against Mason from 1928 to 1930--to realize her own
 vision of a "<I>real</I> Negro art theatre." By 1931, circumstances
 had changed; Hughes was now the impediment to Hurston's goals, whereas
 Mason was in a position to be helpful. It is difficult to

<B></B>

imagine what else Hurston might have done at this point if she wanted
to see her own version of <I>Mule Bone</I> staged.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Characteristically, Hurston performed memorably in the service of
her goals. Van Vechten and Hughes both describe Hurston's scenes of
lamentation and indignation over the course of the winter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 By late January, Hurston saw Hughes not only successfully asserting
 his claim of coauthorship (with Thompson firmly on his side) but also
 successfully regaining artistic control of the script via Jelliffe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 If Hurston was to prevent Hughes's vision of the play from eclipsing
 her own, she needed to take additional action. It was then that Hurston
 told Mason that Hughes and Thompson were having an affair and had gone
 "off to his rooms" while she alone worked on the play.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Although we can never establish Hurston's motivations for this accusation
 with absolute certainly, I would suggest that she was playing the
 role of the trickster by executing an ironic reversal--signifying
 on Hughes's imposition of a romance plot on her tale of politics and
 artistry by imposing a (second) romance plot on their own battle for
 artistic authority.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston's romance plot was successful in that it stopped production
of Hughes's final version of <I>Mule Bone.</I> But Hughes, an able
signifier himself, turned Hurston's romance plot against her by again
triangulating--casting her as a stereotypically jealous female and himself
as the innocent object of a "funny creature[']s" irrational reaction to
"a girl she didn't like." His story of the collaboration in <I>The Big
Sea</I> and the papers he used to document his claim of coauthorship,
now preserved in the archives, have shaped subsequent literary histories
and have served as the basis for the published edition of the play.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Taking a new look at the genetic history of the text leads me not only
to theorize a new cause of the battle for authorship credit but also
to reevaluate the impact of mainstream conceptions of authorship on
the resolution of the dispute. When Hughes turned Hurston's folklore
against her, creating a portrait of Eatonville that diminished women's
artistic authority, Hurston was unable to regain sole authority over the
text and was driven to sacrifice the play along with the collaborative
relationship. This turn of events resulted in no small measure from
the concepts of authorship accepted by Hurston's and Hughes's New
York literary and theatrical communities, which privileged writing and
"construction" over oral performance as methods of authoring a text. This
general definition of authorship also contributed to the creation of
the literary reputations of the individuals concerned. As Van Vechten
wrote Hughes in response to his first claim of coauthorship:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Van Vechten's prediction was accurate; the people who mattered (those
who controlled the production and publication of the play) did believe
Hughes. Hughes's

<B></B>

established reputation as a poet, marked by his recently acquired Harmon
Gold Award for Literature, stood him in good stead. Hurston's reputation
as a raconteur did not. In the end, Hurston could find only one method
of preventing Hughes's preferred version of <I>Mule Bone</I> from taking
the stage. In using it, she acted not "like a lover spurned" but like
an aspiring author silenced and dismissed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston's reputation has risen, collapsed, and risen again since
1931. Although Hughes remains the more prominent literary author in
the 1990s, Hurston's standing as an anthropologist and a recorder and
transformer of Eatonville's folklore has been well established by <I>Mules
and Men,</I> <I>Their Eyes Were Watching God,</I> and the renewed interest
of critics and artists, including Hemenway, Gates, Bass, Rampersad,
Sheffey, and Alice Walker. The rebirth of Hurston's professional
reputation in the 1980s and 1990s led Bass to reinsert a representation
of Hurston into <I>Mule Bone</I> for the play's 1991 premiere at Lincoln
Center. In Bass's new opening, Hurston first enters the scene "with

 This representation of Hurston as folklorist and Eatonville resident
 contextualizes and authenticates the 1930s racial humor for 1990s
 audiences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 It also specifically borrows language from the same segment of <I>Mules
 and Men</I> that is anticipated in Hurston's depiction of the Harlem
 Daisy, demonstrating a simultaneous, interlinked need for deleted
 elements of Hurston's work and for an onstage representation of Hurston's
 (enhanced) literary and anthropological authority. In 1931, Hurston did
 not have the authority necessary to get her <I>Mule Bone</I> staged,
 but in 1991, when theatre practitioners wanted to make Eatonville's
 artistry accessible to New York art theatre audiences, they invoked
 the name and image not of Josephine Baker but of Zora Neale Hurston.

Sheffey devotes only about three paragraphs to a detailed analysis of
specific rough drafts, and she does not indicate where they are located
in the archives. Hemenway and Rampersad frequently do not indicate which
sources they used to support specific statements.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hemenway's opening endnote for the Mule Bone chapter indicates that
his main sources are Hughes's letter to Arthur Spingarn of 21 January
1931, partial drafts and one complete draft of Mule Bone at the
Moorland-Spingarn Research Center (MSRC), Hughes's account in The Big
Sea, his own unpublished interview with Louise Thompson Patterson
of 22 June 1976, and a series of letters held at MSRC, which he lists in
LH, 158. My analysis will document and evaluate sources in detail.

<a NAME="FOOT5" HREF="#REF5">5</A>.
To discuss authorship in a way that reflects Hurston's aesthetic vision,
I define the term "author" specifically as a professional creator
of art (i.e., one who is paid, expects to be paid, or is institutionally
recognized as a creator of high art) and an "artist," more broadly,
as any creator of art--including "professional artists" ("authors")
and "folk artists." In Eatonville's world of folk art, singers, guitar
players, dancers, and storytellers are the creative artists most closely
equivalent to composers, choreographers, or playwrights on Broadway or
in the "art theatre." For this reason, I will not use the terms
"author" and "artist" to distinguish between writers and performers or
among types of art created (e.g., music, dance, literature). These two
kinds of distinctions are typical of the mainstream American and European
understanding of art. Hurston's alternative understanding breaks down
the boundaries among genres, between written and oral culture, and among
creators, performers, and audience. My definitions recognize Hurston's
move towards these forms of integration, as well as the distinction
between professional artistic activity and folk artistry, which evolves
in her dramatic writing between Mule Bone and Polk County
and is central to her struggle to define her identity as an author. See
Zora Neale Hurston and Dorothy Waring, Polk County: A Comedy of
Negro Life on a Sawmill Camp with Authentic Negro Music (Stephen
Kelen d'Oxylion, 1944; James Weldon Johnson papers, Beinecke Rare Book
and Manuscript Library, Yale University, New Haven, Conn.); hereafter

See the <A HREF="#appendix">appendix</A> for an overview of the relevant drafts of Mule
Bone. The Library of Congress recently announced the discovery of ten
carbon copies of play manuscripts by Hurston, including Mule Bone,
registered for copyright by Langston Hughes on 22 January 1931, and
De Turkey and de Law, registered by Hurston on 29 October 1930
("Zora Neale Hurston Playscripts Found in the Library of Congress,"
Library of Congress press release, 24 April 1997). I had discovered
the Mule Bone manuscript in 1995. Neither manuscript has been
evaluated by scholars in print before now. My approach was influenced by
the discussion of feminist textual criticism in Brenda R. Silver, "Textual
Criticism as Feminist Practice: Or, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf Part
II," in Representing Modernist Texts: Editing as Interpretation,
ed. George Bornstein (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1991), 194.

Act 2 scene 1 of the draft Hughes sent to the Library of Congress appears
to be the draft that Hurston and Hughes wrote collaboratively in the
spring and was included in a slightly revised form in Hurston's De
Turkey and de Law. I regard this scene as being primarily Hurston's
because it focuses on female characters and because Hughes eliminated
it in the final versions he edited (D3:2-D3:4).

In this game, a big girl playing "mother hen" protects the younger
children playing "chicks" from a boy who plays a "hawk." Much of the
dialogue associated with this game in act 1 revolves around the power

tells the older child that her mother wants her to go home.

See ZNH, 140; and LH, 195. Hughes and others hoped that
a Cleveland production could be the first step toward a production on
Broadway and possibly even a movie (see ZNH, 144). Although Hurston
and Hughes intended Mule Bone for Broadway, Clark's diversion
of the play to the Gilpin Players suggests that it challenged Broadway
norms enough to be considered more appropriate for a less commercial
venue that was more clearly dedicated to African American interests.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Poet, art critic and promoter, literary critic, journalist, editor
and publisher, novelist, dramatist, movie-script writer, prankster,
pornographer, and impresario of the Parisian avant-garde, Guillaume
Apollinaire is regarded as everything except a political man.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 He himself promoted this view. Writing to the editor of <I>La Plume</I>
 in 1902, he claimed to have nothing to say about politics, a subject
 that is "detestable, deceitful, sterile, and injurious" ("ha&iuml;ssable,
 mensong&egrave;re, st&eacute;rile et n&eacute;faste").
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 In thousands of pages of prewar writing, he signed only one article
 that might be considered political thought.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The fact that he turned to political subjects during World War I might be
 explained contingently in terms of his enthusiasm for the war experience
 and his recognition of its historical import. Yet, paradoxically, never
 was there so relentlessly public a life as Apollinaire's, and no one
 has ever dedicated more energy to the promotion of art as an answer to
 the spiritual malaise of modern life. In that sense, his indefatigable
 production of criticism as well as his unending public performance of
 self were nothing if not political both in intent and effect.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When we look closely at his one published piece of political philosophy,
the paradox begins to unravel. Based on premises drawn explicitly from
Spinoza's <I>Ethics</I> but also from Nietzsche, Apollinaire argued that
politics in the sense of government is

<B></B>

nothing but the pursuit of power by politicians and that any notion
that it might promote social improvement misunderstands the human
condition. Humans may express genuine sympathy for their fellows, but
this sentiment is always subordinate to a primary egotism. While an
individual may be gratified by helping another individual, acts of
so-called "charity" which minister to the collective serve only to
salve the consciences of the rich and powerful. Similarly, "politics
does have the often forgotten aim of aiding others <I>en bloc</I>"
("La politique n'a pour but, souvent oubli&eacute;, que de les aider
en bloc"), but government is too blunt an instrument to succeed in any
such endeavor, excepting perhaps that of allowing politicians to imagine
themselves virtuous.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Is there, then, no genuinely collective mode of social redemption? Though
 the question is not addressed here, it is notable that, less than a month
 later, Apollinaire would see in Picasso's early painting precisely the
 force capable of reawakening "the profound self-knowledge that humanity
 had of itself" and giving us back the "eyes" necessary for entering
 into the social world of children, mothers, beggars, and forlorn old men.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 It was an argument for the socially redemptive power of avant-garde
 art to which he would return on many subsequent occasions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This essay will argue that Apollinaire's apparent apoliticism was a mask
for his deepest conviction, one to which he dedicated his life: that only
through the visionary power of avant-garde art could men and women living
in modern mass societies regain their human capacity for the concrete
experience of life, a capacity that had withered amidst the abstractions
of commodified, urban existence. Far from representing a solution to this
modern crisis, the issue-oriented, materialistically self-interested
politics shaped by newspapers and propelled by the wheeler-dealing of
the democratic electoral process only compounded it. This public sphere
merely reinforced the mechanical, quantitative, and ultimately nihilistic
modes of thought underlying modern industry and science. A revitalized
public sphere would depend crucially upon the restoration of aesthetic
vision, language, and performance to a position of genuine centrality in
modern political life. In a properly aesthetic public sphere, art would
reconnect with daily life and with concrete, national traditions, thus
reviving the national spirit and reconsecrating civic energies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the sections which follow, I aim to show, first, that recent
theoretical and historical work on modernism helps to clarify the larger
context of Apollinaire's aesthetic politics and, specifically, its
nationalistic turn; second, that his nationalism was deeply rooted in
his generation as well as in his own life circumstances; third, that the
model of a performative public sphere with which he implicitly worked
can be reconstructed from his art criticism; and, finally, that his
differences with F. T. Marinetti's Futurism turn on their differing
nationalisms and strategies for confronting mass society and culture
and that, despite appearances, those differences did not abate during
the war. Apollinaire's wartime chauvinism should not be seen as a break
with his prewar aesthetic politics, though it did reflect the greatly
intensified pressures on everyone to prove their national loyalty,
pressures to which he had always, necessarily, been highly sensitive.

1. Modernism, Mass Culture, and Nationalism
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nineteenth-century bourgeois society provided for a freedom of artistic
creation far greater than in earlier societies where art was more
tightly controlled by political, religious, and social mechanisms. As
Theodor Adorno argued in <I>Aesthetic Theory</I>, art had always stood
in opposition to society but, because it was unaware of itself as such,
a fundamentally oppositional art had been inconceivable prior to the
French Revolution.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Bourgeois society emancipates art in the sense that experience is no
 longer forced into apriori genres and period styles but is allowed to
 give birth to artistic form rather than the other way round. Yet, if
 this emancipation makes possible an oppositional art, it also unleashes
 a process of commodification which, by the century's closing decades,
 was threatening to redefine art as entertainment and integrate it even
 more effectively than in earlier, more authoritarian societies. For
 Adorno, this paradoxical situation in which art is simultaneously freed
 in principle and yet neutralized in social practice provides the context
 for, and in a general way defines, the phenomenon of artistic modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernism, as I understand it following Adorno, is the effort to overcome
the commodification of culture through the conviction that art has a
fundamental role to play in restoring, or reinventing, the qualitative
dimension of existence. Modernists see art as a cognitive sphere separate
from, and in opposition to, those of science and morality, thus as one
side of a triangle that, as Habermas following Weber has argued, becomes
constitutive of modern intellectual and cultural life in this period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 For art to help restore the qualitative dimension, which Adorno terms
 the "non-identical," modernists believe that it must come to understand
 itself in its own terms, to pursue its own autonomous cognitive existence
 independent of its earlier religious, moral, and cultic functions. Such
 autonomy does not mean formalism as an end in itself, but it does mean
 close attention to form. Its true end is the suspension of "identity
 thinking" by pursuing art's own immanent logic independent of all
 externally generated values, whether cognitive (like "representing" the
 world) or social (like "entertainment"). It means searching for what
 is art and nothing else. The problem, however, is that modernism is
 never able to realize this autonomy, for to do so would be tantamount to
 locating the essential nature of art. Adorno sees modernism as condemned
 to search endlessly and in vain for this answer, that is, for "the new,"
 which is why he writes that "the new is the longing for the new, not the
 new itself" (<I>AT</I>, 32). Indeed, in its pursuit of the new, modernism
 ends up mimicking the commodity form it had sought to escape: the new
 "is aesthetically the result of historical development, the trademark of
 consumer goods appropriated by art by means of which artworks distinguish
 themselves from the ever-same inventory in obedience to the need for
 the exploitation of capital, which, if it does not expand, if it does
 not--in its own language--offer something new, is eclipsed . . . . [Thus]
 the absolute artwork converges with the absolute commodity" (<I>AT</I>,
 21). Seeking its autonomous essence, modernist art discovers only that
 it lacks essentiality, that it is condemned, like capital, to an endless
 search for the new, to becoming evanescent "fashion."

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This restless, questing character that Adorno sees in modernist art
has been noted by many other observers, most famously perhaps by Renato
Poggioli, who called it the "agonism" of the avant-garde.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Yet, in my view, this agonism ought not to be understood solely as
 an internal characteristic of the modernist avant-garde but also as a
 reflection of, and response to, a late nineteenth-century public sphere
 exploding in vigor and reconstituting itself under the impact of a new
 mass politics. Nowhere was this more true than in France. There, as
 many recent historians have shown, we find a vibrant public life after
 1880 based on a dramatic expansion of mass-circulation newspapers,
 the proliferation of "little reviews," the development of political
 "leagues," "protestations," and mass parties, the beginnings of a
 mass-entertainment industry, the emergence of the "new woman," and the
 "birth of intellectuals" with the media-fanned political controversies
 of the 1890s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Demands from below for inclusion, new media of communication and
 information, new appreciation of the power of irrational symbolic appeals
 such as anti-Semitism, and a proliferation of mass-cultural spectacles
 made for a heady brew.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What French historians have recognized as an intensified
turn-of-the-century public sphere has, however, been insufficiently
integrated into broader theoretical understandings of the bourgeois public
sphere. This neglect probably owes much to the fact that Habermas, in his
now classic study of the topic, was so preoccupied with the deterioration
of the public sphere into a mere "platform for advertising" that he read
this as its predominant tendency all the way back to 1850.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Yet the advance of market forces within the late nineteenth-century
 public sphere was gradual; the overwhelming power of capitalist culture
 industries will be clear only with the triumph of American cinema
 and the coming of the radio age in the 1930s. In what we might call
 the modernist window of 1890-1930, the presence of modern mass
 culture and technology was sufficient to force a rethinking of art,
 commodification, and modern public life, yet it was not so entrenched
 as to seem unsubvertible. This was a transitional period in which the
 relation between market forces, lingering aristocratic standards of
 taste, individual ingenuity and craftsmanship, and a newly enlarged
 mass audience was being renegotiated.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernist intellectuals played a very visible and underappreciated role
in this process of renegotiation. Perceiving themselves as an embattled
minority, a drop of culture in an ocean of philistinism, they sought
to rebuild a public sphere not on an Enlightenment model of rational
discourse but on the agonistic model exemplified by Nietzsche. For them,
public life was best conceived not as a rational process of discussion
governed by consensus and the better argument (a Habermasian ideal they
would have found much too beholden to science and too repressive of the
expressive dimension of communication that they could uniquely offer) but
as one of persuasion by performance--performance still governed by the
creative ideals of the artist and not by market forces. In this sense
autonomous art, far from being a retreat into isolation, represented
precisely the standard needed to govern public life. Only an ideal of
creative performance could hope to overcome the exhaustion of older
aristocratic standards as well as the vulgar materialism of emerging
mass-democratic

<B></B>

 societies, whose politics of who gets what, where, when, how, and from
 whom, either ignored or disdainfully dismissed questions of greatness
 and larger purpose. In modern society, where all particulars become
 fungible, modernists believed that art could reshape public life by
 conducting the exchangeable to critical self-consciousness, that is,
 to an awareness of what lies beyond exchange.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernism, then, was not merely a reaction formation to mass culture,
as Adorno generally viewed it. Modernists believed in the power of their
own creative initiative to seize the day. Yet, for reasons that we have
already identified in Adorno and Habermas, their attempt to reshape modern
public life would ultimately fail. The fact that modernists pursued
such a project, however, has at least three important implications for
our understanding of their efforts. First, it suggests that we conceive
modernism as a decisive break with the Enlightenment metanarrative of
emancipation via public learning modeled on scientific advance. The sorts
of objections to Habermas that Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard would make
in <I>The Postmodern Condition</I> were already the basis of modernist
practice eight decades earlier. Second, their pursuit of an ideal of a
performative public sphere suggests that the response to mass culture
of which they are often accused--that of merely installing themselves
as an elitist alternative to it without engaging the public--is
too simplistic. In confronting incipient culture industries and the
new technologies like cinema on which they were increasingly based,
modernists might be said to have had three choices: to capitulate to
this new reality by seeking to become its "stars," to run the other way
and set up a counter-industry, or to try to subvert this new reality in
a way that accepted the need to play to an expanded public but rejected
exchange as the determinant of value. While modernists obviously did
not always make the same choice, they most frequently followed the
last alternative of bending mass society to their own design. Finally,
and perhaps most importantly, the modernist interest in a performative
public sphere made them much more attuned to the emotional appeals of
nationalism than is generally perceived in the literature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Before we return to Apollinaire, this last point requires some
elaboration. Early in the nineteenth century, nationalist thinking
was stimulated partly under the influence of Napoleonic conquest but
partly too in response to the same separation of cognitive spheres that
stimulated romanticism and ultimately modernism. As George Mosse has
shown for Germany, this nationalist thinking was intensely aesthetic
because it aimed to restore meaning to a sundered experiential life as
well as because aesthetic politics proved to have great mass appeal.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Nationalism's ideal, like that of most Romanticisms and post-Kantian
 idealisms, was that of a retotalized social world in which divisions
 between the divine and human, rational and emotional, public and
 private sides of life would be overcome. Here modernists tended toward
 a different strategy: their commitment to an ideal of autonomous art
 made them wary of reconciling art and culture with the contemporary
 economy and state. Yet their assessment of the problems in modern life
 and their emphasis on the aesthetic brought them close to nationalist
 aesthetic politics, as res such as Maurice Barr&egrave;s and Jean
 Mor&eacute;as remind us. Modernists often found it attractive and
 sometimes necessary to

<B></B>

develop nationalist sentiments of their own, even as they also explored
the universalist, cosmopolitan logic of their creative pursuits. Indeed,
as we shall see, for modernists like Apollinaire whose personal
backgrounds and identities were ambiguous or uncertain with respect to
nationality, the cosmopolitan image of modernism may even have intensified
nationalist sentiment.

2. Apollinaire: The Intellectual Formation of a "Non-political Man"
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Apollinaire published his first major book of poetry in 1913, the
reviewer for the <I>Mercure de France</I>, Georges Duhamel, greeted it
in the following terms:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Nothing makes one think more of a secondhand furniture dealer than
this collection of verse published by M. Guillaume Apollinaire under
the title, at once simple and mysterious, of <I>Alcools</I>. I say
secondhand furniture dealer because a litter of incongruous objects
have been discarded into this slum, some of which have value but none
of which is the product of the merchant's own industry. Precisely there
is one of the characteristics of the secondhand trade: it resells but
does not manufacture. . . . In the massing of objects, a colorful and
dizzy variety takes the place of art. With difficulty one can perceive,
through the holes of a shabby chasuble, the ironic and ingenuous look
of the dealer, which is at once that of the Levantine Jew, the South
American, the Polish gentleman, and the <I>facchino</I> [porter].
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The attack, whose motives are now obscure, must have seemed to Apollinaire
like the flashing forth of a nightmare he had been living since coming
to Paris at the age of eighteen. There it all was: the wandering life of
his Polish mother who had taken him from birth in Rome to Monaco, then
Cannes, Nice, Aix-les-Bains, Lyon, Paris, Stavelot in Belgium, and back
to Paris; his own economic struggles to survive in the French capital
as a bohemian writer; the fact that his mother lived for years out of
wedlock with a Jewish man, Jules Weil; that he himself was often mistaken
for a Jew since "the anti-Semites cannot imagine a Pole not being a Jew"
("les antis&eacute;mites qui ne peuvent se rer qu'un Polonais ne
soit pas juif);
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 that he was uncomfortable enough with his apparently immigrant, Jewish,
 and "southern" background to drop his foreign-sounding surname; that he
 had famously been arrested on suspicion of stealing the <I>Mona Lisa</I>
 from the Louvre; that his life had been full of expediencies and shady
 dealings; that he was, in short, as French xenophobes of the time called
 them, a <I>"m&eacute;t&egrave;que"</I> [wop], and an illegitimate one
 at that.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Painful as his vulnerability to such scurrilousness must have been,
 Apollinaire was hardly unfamiliar with it. From the beginning of his
 literary career, he had been made aware of his ethnic otherness by
 editors who, for example, refused to allow him to replace Kostrowitzky
 with a pseudonym.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Still, he never retreated into a defensive cosmopolitanism but rather, as
 one critic has put it, deployed a "poetic counter-ideology," peopling his
 essays and verse with a "mythology of Tziganes, Bohemians, Germans, Jews,
 Cossacks, etc., into which he integrated his own genealogical fantasies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 In the clear light of day, however, he always regarded himself as a

<B></B>

Frenchman. Indeed, for his adopted homeland he had the passion of a
religious convert. His friends were &eacute;migr&eacute;s or visitors
from every corner of Europe, and he reveled in their company, but even
the Italians he did not regard as in any way fellow countrymen. At
the height of the controversy between cubism and Futurism, he wrote to
Ardengo Soffici, his most faithful correspondent, who had himself lived
seven years in Paris: "But <I>you Italians</I>, don't be unfair toward
the French who have created nearly all of intellectual modernism" ("Mais
<I>Vous Italiens</I>, ne soyez pas injustes envers les fran&ccedil;aises
car ils ont invent&eacute; presque tous le modernisme intellectuel").
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Moreover, he nearly always wrote in French and, when he did deploy his
 Italian, showed that it was rudimentary and error-prone, a product of
 early childhood in a country to which he never returned even for a visit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the firmness of his national identity reflected its objective
precariousness, it was also rooted in an intellectual formation which
was typically and self-consciously French. Admittedly, we do not know
as much as we would like about this formation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Yet when Apollinaire himself reflected back on it in 1908, he singled
 out for attention an avant-garde movement of the previous decade that
 had already nearly been forgotten:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The most important poetic current which, striking the spirit of the
youth of my generation, sought to oppose symbolism, which it succeeded,
was called naturism. It had its day and charmed many new poets. At
that time, because of symbolism, they were still weighed down by the
cumbersome baggage of accessories bequeathed by the Parnassians who
took them from the romantics. The  naturists swept all that away. Then,
prodded by civic enthusiasm, they wanted to mingle with the crowd.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Naturism was quickly forgotten because it was unable to translate its
ideas into distinguished verse, but the ideas themselves, as communicated
in a variety of manifestos, were a powerful reflection of the final years
of the fin-de-si&egrave;cle. Promulgated primarily by two young poets,
Saint-Georges de Bouh&eacute;lier and Maurice Le Blond, naturism embodied
an intense desire to find new ways for a young generation of artists
to have an impact on French politics in the aftermath of the French
police clamp-down on anarchism in 1894. Like Mor&eacute;as, who broke
with symbolism in 1891 to found the &Eacute;cole Romane, the naturists
saw symbolism as having a disdain for the national literary tradition
as well as cultivating a <I>recherch&eacute;</I> language far removed
from that of the street and the practical problems of life. Unlike him,
however, they did not want to create just another <I>"c&eacute;nacle,</I>"
nor to return to traditional verse, but to set a resolutely modernist,
aesthetic-political direction for their generation as a whole. It was a
vision that appealed to some slightly older French intellectuals as well,
such as Andr&eacute; Gide who, in an 1896 letter to Bouh&eacute;lier,
declared his "very lively sympathy" for naturism and signed it as "your
<I>coreligionaire</I>" ("une sympathie tr&egrave;s vive . . . votre
<I>coreligionaire</I>").
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If we turn to naturism's inaugural manifesto, published by
Bouh&eacute;lier in <I>Le ro</I> on January 10, 1897, we
cannot but be struck by the intensely nationalistic rhetoric in which
its largely political purposes are set. It calls for the "resurrection
of national 

<B></B>

cults." It opposes the "northern poets" and wants "regional ceremonies in
 honor of the 'heroes who died for their country.'" It champions "civic
 activity," "glory" and "exploits." It claims that "the next art will
 be heroic" and aims "to create a new conception of the world." While
 some of the language about "moral enslavement" and the "spirit of
 the race" sounds vaguely Nietzschean, non-French writers and artists
 like Nietzsche, Ibsen, and Wagner are held up as "foreigners" who have
 triumphed over properly "ethnic literature." Bouh&eacute;lier concludes:
 "Revival of the national spirit, a cult of the earth and of heroes, the
 consecration of civic energies, these are the sentiments that give to
 contemporary youth such a unique, unexpected and admirable character."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The argument was deepened in essays written for a special issue of
<I>La Plume</I> on naturism that appeared in November, 1897, which
included contributions from Eug&egrave;ne Montfort, Albert Fleury, and
the Belgian naturist Camille Lemonnier, as well as Bouh&eacute;lier and
Le Blond. Striking a revolutionary chord, Bouh&eacute;lier likened the
task of his generation to that of Mirabeau, Robespierre, and Desmoulins,
and claimed that "we are at a turning point between epochs. The world's
equilibrium is being reconstituted. . . . God has disappeared from
the world," but naturism has adopted the "mission" of helping "a new
world free itself from the chaos of our times"("Nous sommes &agrave; un
tournant des &acirc;ges. Le &eacute;quilibre du monde se reconstitue
. . . Dieu a disparu du monde . . . la mission . . . un monde nouveau
se d&eacute;gage du chaos des temps").
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 In his essay, Le Blond connected naturism's nationalist program to
 the failings of the recent French poetic tradition, including the
 &Eacute;cole Romane. For him, the symbolist poets "preferred to be
 the solitary pontiffs of their interior cathedral" rather than "the
 interpreters of a place, region, or people." They cultivated a "special
 jargon" that was little known. Moreover, many of them followed in a
 romantic tradition that was still a "Christian art." Naturists, in
 contrast, cultivate the "ethnic idea." While others before us, like
 the &Eacute;cole Romane, have done likewise, we are forward-looking
 modernists while they are "reactionary" devotees of "archaism." Finally,
 "Mor&eacute;as, who is of Greek origin, may have his reasons for
 celebrating the reeds of the river Eurotas and the snows of Mount
 Olympus. These traditions are not ours. In our view, to the Madeleine or
 the Bourse, monuments based on a pastiche of antique styles, we always
 prefer Notre-Dame of Paris."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Le Blond's chauvinism, with which he here tarred Mor&eacute;as, may
remind us of Duhamel's later tactics. Yet Le Blond and other naturists
understood their commitment to nationality not as an end in itself but
as a necessary condition for freeing modern art from poetic formalism
in order to engage it in the revitalization of modern life. They were
committed to enlarging the concept of art in an inclusive direction, to
overcoming distinctions between high and low art, to reconnecting art
with daily life, and to restoring to the intellectual his human face
("Mallarm&eacute; is an artist, Verlaine is a man" ["Mallarm&eacute;
est un artiste, Verlaine est un homme"]).
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 While they believed that rootedness in concrete ways of life was crucial
 to this endeavor, such concreteness could be Belgian (as with Lemonnier),
 or that of another "border nation" ('nations de fronti&egrave;re') or
 that of a particular French region. Indeed, an important part of what
 was at stake for naturism was the cultural hegemony of Paris.

<B></B>

Naturist writers in Provence, for example, sometimes referred to the
"tyrannical yoke of Paris" ("joug tyrannique de Paris").
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 The <I>Revue Naturiste</I>, which Bouh&eacute;lier and Le Blond edited
 from Paris, in effect agreed with them, proposing in 1898 to decentralize
 itself with three regionally tailored editions in order to increase
 the provinces' sense of dignity (<I>CVS</I>, 82).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Among other naturist projects was a Coll&egrave;ge d'Esth&eacute;tique
Moderne which, during the 1900-1901 academic year, offered a
series of lecture courses by Bouh&eacute;lier, Le Blond, and Montfort,
and which attracted the participation of Apollinaire (<I>CVS</I>,
115-117). For Apollinaire, these would be years of great economic
uncertainty but also of intellectual apprenticeship in the post-symbolist
intellectual free-for-all that was Paris in the time of Dreyfus. He
wrote for a variety of little reviews including <I>La Revue blanche</I>,
<I>L'Europ&eacute;en</I>, <I>Tabarin</I>, <I>La Grande France</I>, <I>La
Plume</I>, and <I>L'Europe artiste</I>. He attended the "soir&eacute;es
de <I>La Plume</I>" that its editor, Karl Bo&egrave;s, gave at the
Caveau du Soleil d'Or on the Place Saint-Michel. There he met all the
naturists as well as other young poets like Andr&eacute; Salmon, Paul
Fort, Alfred Jarry, and M&eacute;cislas Golberg, a Jewish anarchist from
Poland, and more established res like Mor&eacute;as and R&eacute;my de
Gourmont. He entered the polemics on new poetic schools, such as Fernand
Gregh's "humanism," declaring that "poets no longer want ecclesiastics,
scholastics, scholars, students, disciples, or, in a word, slaves" ("Les
po&egrave;tes ne veulent plus &ecirc;tre ni &eacute;col&acirc;tres, ni

ni esclaves en un mot").
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 He began his own journal, <I>Le Festin d'&Eacute;sope</I>, which
 produced nine issues in 1903-04 that included poetry, stories,
 criticism, philosophical articles, and an occasional political article
 and naturist manifesto, but also practical information on medicine
 and financial investments. It was succeeded in April 1905 by <I>La
 Revue immoraliste</I> which, however, lasted but a single issue after
 its patron bailed out. Thereafter, Apollinaire wrote for a variety of
 journals, large and small, mainstream and esoteric, but gave up his
 efforts at being an editor until he established <I>Les Soir&eacute;es
 de Paris</I> (1912-14).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite his naturism, Apollinaire wrote some early poems in
a symbolist vein, and he took a lively interest in the neo-symbolist
initiative of Fort's <I>Vers et Prose</I> when it was launched in 1905
(<I>CVS</I>, 180-83). Yet, when he made the discovery of Picasso's
painting and began to write about it in that same year, the road toward
cultural regeneration through a genuinely non-mimetic mode of expression
increasingly appeared to him to run through the plastic arts. In contrast,
the symbolist way beyond mimesis focused centrally upon Dionysian music,
which symbolists found suggestive of the impalpable powers associated
with an ideal language. While they were not entirely uninterested in the
visual and plastic arts, they tended toward the belief that such arts
imposed too great a mimetic constraint. That Apollinaire increasingly
conceived matters differently owed a great deal to what he saw in painters
like Picasso, though it may also reflect the changed status of visuality
within the cultural world more generally. His was the century of film,
after all, and Apollinaire was very interested in cinema both for its
own sake and for the ways in which it might invigorate the other arts,
especially poetry.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Picasso and other new painters inspired Apollinaire to believe was
that the creative artist can best think through the possibilities of an
autonomous, non-mimetic art by confronting external appearances, not by
attempting somehow to get above or within them. This is precisely what
he saw Picasso doing: accepting the irreducible difference represented
by the object but then investigating that difference in a playful,
creative way that allowed him to express his own world rather than
duplicate an external one. Through play with the object, Picasso was
able to investigate the relation between seeing, remembering and artistic
presentation, and thereby "reenchant" a disenchanted world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire collected the most important of his Picasso-inspired
reflections on cultural regeneration, revised them, and then published
them as <I>M&eacute;ditations Esth&eacute;tiques: Les Peintres
Cubistes</I> in 1913. As we will see, they represent the theoretical
foundation not only of his own poetic art but of his approach to the
public sphere and the larger political hopes so beautifully encapsulated
in the lines from the "Po&egrave;me lu au mariage d'Andr&eacute; Salmon"
which serve as the epigraph to this essay. Before concluding this
section, however, we need to complete our brief picture of Apollinaire's
intellectual formation with two points that complicate the vision of a
socially redemptive art which the <I>M&eacute;ditations</I> articulate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first of these is the naturist legacy: Apollinaire consistently placed
his vision of a socially redemptive art within a nationalistic frame,
even as he sometimes softened the ethnic-nationalist understanding of that
frame which one finds in a Bouh&eacute;lier, Le Blond, or Barr&egrave;s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 As he put the point in an essay on the decorative arts: "The artisan who
 chisels, shapes, or carves out an object meant for everyday usage ought
 to remain anonymous. The taste of which the object is a manifestation,
 like the decorations that adorn it, belongs to a given period, nation,
 and environment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Genuine art is always rooted in the concrete national conditions of a
 people. Even mere exposure to foreign art may sow "confusion . . . in the
 minds of our artisans" as well as doing them "great harm" commercially.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 For obvious reasons, however, Apollinaire was more reluctant to
 dismiss "foreigners" as irrelevant to French art in the manner
 of Bouh&eacute;lier. As the judge of an exhibition, for example,
 "a foreigner, who is outside the Parisian coteries and free of the
 influence of critics who are often submissive and rarely disinterested,
 will be naturally drawn to the most important works."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Moreover, Apollinaire generally did not define as a foreigner anyone
 who falls outside the French "race." He most often operated with an
 inclusive definition of Frenchness that is civic rather than ethnic. He
 was not, however, entirely consistent in this regard and occasionally
 utilized a concept of "Latinity" which, from its association with
 Edouard Drumont and Charles Maurras, had ethnic-nationalist and even
 anti-Semitic overtones.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 All that is certain is that the naturist view that art and its capacity
 for social redemption must always be connected with the concrete national
 conditions of a people remained fundamental for him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The second point concerns the danger represented by processes of
industrialization and commercialization for the eclipse of avant-garde
art. Apollinaire was more nervous about the survivability of avant-garde
art than the discussion of the

<B></B>

<I>M&eacute;ditations</I> would suggest. In an article for the republican
journal, <I>La D&eacute;mocratie sociale</I>, for example, he argued
that "mechanical processes threaten every form of art that involves the
physical capacities of the artist." Art was becoming "industrialized." Yet
while orchestras, theaters, and "painters who content themselves with
copying nature" might give way to the phonograph, the cinematographer,
and the photographer, Apollinaire here argued that "great painters" who
"express the sublime plastically" cannot be replaced.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Still, the level of anxiety in the article is sufficient that one is
 not surprised to read elsewhere in Apollinaire that "today's young
 painters" are succumbing to the dangers of "industrialization" and
 artistic overproduction far more than established avant-gardists like
 Picasso, Braque, Derain, and de Chirico.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 The evident implication, which he chose not to make explicit, was that
 the days of avant-garde art might well be numbered.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

3.  Apollinaire and the Public Sphere
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire's idea that the socially redemptive role of avant-garde art
was best conceived in terms of the "plastic virtues" that symbolism had
largely neglected emerged only after his reflection upon the painting
of Picasso and Matisse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Yet some of his earliest poems already evidence an interest in
 language very different from the symbolist quest for an ideality
 merging concrete world and poetic imagination. As Timothy Matthews
 has persuasively argued, poems such as "L'Adieu," which Apollinaire
 published in <I>Le Festin d'&Eacute;sope</I> in December 1903, aim
 primarily to undermine any stable sense of the relation between words
 and sensations or experiences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 In such poems, language is presented as a form of purely human
 expression, as a set of word-constructs that recognizes its own
 artificiality and that defies ready reference to any framework outside
 the poem itself. If symbolism sought to transcend difference and
 merge with nature, Apollinaire emphasized the failure to merge, the
 unbridgeable gap between language and experience that derives from
 language's own materiality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 For him, poetry did not spring from a muse but represented a
 confrontation with difference in which the intellect struggles to
 understand not the image itself but what it means to perceive an image
 and to register that perception in language.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his early poetry, then, Apollinaire was already pursuing a relation to
the natural object which artists like Picasso would teach him so much more
about, one in which the object is not represented and yet also does not
disappear entirely from view. Pursued at the highest levels where they
become self-conscious activities, both poetic language and pictorial art
reflect an indeterminacy from which artistic creativity springs. Yet if
Picasso's painting is not about revealing the object in nature but about
revealing material that allows for the creative search for the object,
about <I>his own</I> interconnected processes of perception, memory,
and presentation, then what can it mean to say that "it is the social
function of great poets and artists to renew continually the appearance
nature has for the eyes of men"?
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 If creative works do not share common objects or subjects, if our
 language is fully enclosed within our own experiences, memories, and
 creative acts, which are <I>sui generis</I>, how is social

<B></B>

communication of any sort possible? A Picasso painting may be likened
to a statement, but it is difficult to see how it could be clarified by
a counter statement or opened to questioning. Apollinaire's answer, I
want to suggest, is that the avant-garde work of art must be conceived
as a performance, as an effort to influence that its audience can accept
or reject but that it cannot directly engage.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If avant-garde works of art are performances, then the public sphere
in which they are presented is one of agonistic exchange rather than
mutual dialogue. This idea ought not to sound strange. In our own
world of sound-bites and thirty-second television spots, a performance
politics based on analogous logic reigns supreme and, indeed, testifies
to Apollinaire's historical perspicacity. Yet the difference between the
two worlds is at least as important as what they share. Our performance
politics is ultimately quantitative and linked to a conception of value
in exchange, while Apollinaire imagined a performance politics governed
by a claim of taste, of artistic genius, through which the audience would
be led to a greater appreciation of the qualitative dimension of life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire's fullest articulation of his concept of
avant-garde performance is found in the <I>M&eacute;ditations
Esth&eacute;tiques</I>. Here he argues that, unlike the traditional
artist who finds inspiration in a purposive natural world which he then
mimics, the avant-garde artist recognizes the world, in both its natural
and social dimensions, as fundamentally without purpose: "The rainbow is
bent, the seasons quiver, the crowds push on to death, science undoes
and remakes what already exists, whole worlds disappear forever from
our understanding, our mobile images repeat themselves, or revive their
vagueness, and the colors, the odors, and the sounds to which we are
sensitive astonish us, then disappear from nature--all to no purpose"
(<I>CP</I>, 9). Yet, for avant-garde artists, the fact that no divine
order inheres in the world as given, that "no muse inspires them," is
no impediment to art but rather its source. Like Nietzsche's "active
nihilist," Apollinaire's avant-garde artist responds to a meaningless
world by forging "his own divinity"(<I>CP</I>, 10). This "divinity" makes
him "master" of the creative process, freeing him from any subservience
to the creative acts of forces outside himself. But it also has two more
specific effects. As Apollinaire writes of Picasso: "A new man, the world
is his new representation. He enumerates the elements, the details, with
a brutality which is also able to be gracious. New-born, <I>he orders
the universe in accordance with his personal requirements, and so as to
facilitate his relations with his fellows"</I> (<I>CP</I>, 23, emphasis
added). In its freedom to deal with "elements" and "details" in terms
of the "personal requirements" of the artist, avant-garde performance
presents a world that is unique, that discloses a personality, that is
therefore qualitative, concerned with the status of the unreproducible
particular, and completely foreign to what is merely "fashionable"
(<I>CP</I>, 11). Yet, in Apollinaire's view, the best avant-garde
performance is able not only to reconnect with the concrete experience of
life but also to communicate that experience to others. Art "facilitates
his relation with his fellows" in the sense that "the picture which he
offers to the admiration of men will confer upon them, likewise, the
glory of exercising their divinity--if only for a moment" (<I>CP</I>,10).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In speaking of divinity, then, Apollinaire appears to refer to the
absolute freedom to create, which in turn implies the presentation of
a personal world powerful enough to reconnect individuals in a mass
society with the qualitative dimension otherwise missing from their
existences. And by becoming divine in this sense, the avant-garde artist
rescues modern society from nihilism and meaningless repetition.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Without poets, without artists, men would soon weary of nature's
monotony. The sublime idea men have of the universe would collapse
with dizzying speed. The order which we find in nature, and which is
only an effect of art, would at once vanish. Everything would break up
in chaos. There would be no seasons, no civilization, no thought, no
humanity; even life would give way, and the impotent void would reign
everywhere (<I>CP</I>, 14-15).
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With such artists, on the other hand, the experience of the qualitative
reawakens: thought, humanity, order, and the sublime all once again
become possible.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To anyone who reads Apollinaire's day-to-day art criticism, however,
this happy vision of avant-garde and public marching hand-in-hand
toward a respiritualization of the world must appear problematic. For
it is precisely the critic's function to mediate this relationship, one
that, by itself, is made distant by an uncomprehending public mired in
the quantitative and commodified, as well as by the solitariness of the
avant-garde's quest for an autonomous art. In his criticism, Apollinaire
refers constantly to this distance and, though he rarely reflects on
the critic's task <I>per se</I>, his practice suggests that he does not
regard it as an avant-garde performance in itself but as a promotional
and educational activity. It is notable that, unlike avant-garde critics
such as Marinetti, Apollinaire does not write manifestoes. Rather his
preferred presentational modes are the exhibit review and the brief
programmatic treatise for the exhibit catalog. His other characteristic
forms of critical writing--art news, freestanding interpretations of
individual artists, promotional and self-promotional blurbs, and polemics
against rival critics--confirm the impression that their primary aim is
to create the public that avant-garde art requires.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire sees the public sphere as a complex field of positions
including, most saliently for him, artists, critics and the press,
salon juries and judges, artist organizations, dealers and gallery
owners, and the public at large. His own critical practice takes each
of them into account, now chastising a gallery owner for "deliberately
under-representing" C&eacute;zanne or being overly preoccupied
with the "taste of the moment," then needling the "gentlemen of the
(judging) committee" for their "intellectual poverty," or supporting
"young painters" against the "venomous spirit in our art critics," or
commending the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Ind&eacute;pendents for the
growth in its membership.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Yet, in every encounter, his unwavering goal is to reduce the distance
 between the most talented and sophisticated artists and their potential
 public, and to do so in clear language accessible to as broad a public
 as possible. "Henri Matisse, whom so many uninformed viewers find
 disconcerting, is an extremely appealing painter."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Or: "People will also admire Albert Gleizes's <I>Fishing Boats</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Such sentences are typical of a practice in which Apollinaire approaches
 the public alternately

<B></B>

as tour guide, investment adviser, or technical expert and connoisseur,
but always with the aim of quickening their appreciation of the
performance before them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire conceives his mission as defending the art he considers most
meritorious and tasteful; thus he advocated cubism even though he was
not particularly excited by it. In this sense, his criticism seeks to
be educational as well as promotional, and he sometimes appears almost
professorial, doling out grades to some artists ("Mme. Lewitska's
landscapes of Roussillon are solid and full of poetry. . . . Lhote,
who is improving markedly . . . Frank Burty who is also improving
. . . Delaunay is one of the most gifted and most audacious artists of
his generation"), while scolding others for being beholden to motives
(like "profit") inappropriate in the pursuit of pure art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Despite his high regard for the French, he treats France as a country
 in which philistinism predominates but of which he is self-appointed
 eradicator. He hopes particularly to educate youth: "It seems to me a
 must to visit the Salon d'Automne; fathers will do well to take their
 sons there, both from a pedagogical and humanitarian point of view."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet, despite Apollinaire's very evident seriousness of purpose, the
jocular spirit for which he was so well known constantly broke through,
making him an educator at least as attached to humorism as he was to
logical forms of persuasion. Thus, to promote "women's writing," he
wrote a year's worth of columns for Montfort's <I>Les Marges</I> under
the signature of "Louise Lalanne" before first having Montfort announce
that Louise had been abducted by a cavalry officer and then finally
revealing her true identity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Later, during the war, when he was assigned to translate news reports
 from the English press for <I>Paris-Journal</I>, he seems to have
 "translated" entirely from his own imagination, pointing out that
 "there is no better way to influence events."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Such playfulness carried over as well into some of his attitudes about
 art. Thus, he commended plagiarism as an activity in which "so many great
 men have engaged" and shrugged aside the idea that there was anything to
 be concerned about in artistic "fakes." Here he commended the attitude
 of the German curators who, he claimed, "instead of lamenting the fact
 [of a fake] and transporting the work to the attic . . . simply place the
 little word <I>'nach'</I> ('in the manner of') before the artist's name."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire's tricksterism, however, was not merely a matter of personal
style. It also reflected his awareness that humorist appeals, so commonly
exploited by the rising industries of mass entertainment, would help to
provide him with the widest possible audience. Like the naturists and
others reacting against the hermeticism of the symbolist generation,
Apollinaire was never content with limiting the reach of avant-garde
art to an elite public. He knew that the capacity of avant-garde art
to make an impact on the problems of modern life--commodification,
industrialization, uglification--depended upon its ability to address
a broad public. And he knew that to address a broad public, neither
avant-garde performance itself nor the critics who mediated it could
afford to isolate themselves from the sort of appeals that mass culture
deployed. In practice, the three components of his model of the public
sphere--agonistic performance by an avant-garde, its mediation by
critics, and its reception by a broadly democratic public--were all
mutually interdependent.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No attitude comes through more strongly in Apollinaire's art criticism
than his receptivity to mass culture. The modern world had become a place
where we are "surrounded by ugliness on every side. We allow horrible
buses to disre the streets of Paris without protest, and our houses
are the ugliest possible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Whatever can be done to enhance the beauty of the lived environment is
 of benefit, whether that means the paintings of a Matisse hanging in a
 left-bank gallery or the advertising posters of a Jules Cher&eacute;t
 which have so "ennobled the art of street decoration."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Apollinaire wrote frequently on the decorative arts, and he could
 appreciate an electric chandelier with bulbs made to look like sea
 urchins as much as a new avant-garde talent.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 He thought inventive commercial applications of the arts not only
 beautified the environment but provided the masses with a taste of
 art, one that might lead them closer to avant-garde works. Thus a cheap
 reproduction of Seurat's <I>Circus</I> had its place, and popularized
 books on the designs of the "great masters" might even encourage their
 readers to find their way to a museum.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Apollinaire's attitude towards the mixing of art and commerce was often
 playful and without a sense of threat, as when he amused himself with
 imaginary conversations about dress shops exhibiting at the next Salon
 d'Automne.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Avant-garde painting needs a "great marketplace," and whatever stimulates
 art generally will help provide it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 A frequenter of the M&eacute;drano Circus all his life, Apollinaire
 foresaw a future rapprochement between circus and theater in an interview
 during the war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 As editor of the journal <I>Les Soir&eacute;es de Paris</I>, he showed
 an avid interest in mass culture, even publishing an article about
 American baseball.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Cinema too excited him immensely, and <I>Les Soir&eacute;es</I> featured
 a regular column on it by Maurice Raynal.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet Apollinaire's enthusiasm for mass culture was not blind. He approved
of it so long as it contributed to the dissemination of artistic taste to
a wider audience, but his attitude became disapproving when standards of
taste were greatly weakened or lost. He was particularly harsh when he
thought avant-gardists were surrendering to popular appeal rather than
excellence as the ultimate arbiter of their success. The Futurists, for
example, sometimes succumbed to a "popular, flashy art," and he thought
Marinetti's ideas on variety theater courted "the danger . . . of falling
into that refined half-heartedness, poor and pretentious, half-Munich and
half-Salon-de-Automne, which is the most obnoxious kitsch [<I>pompier</I>]
there is today" ("le danger . . . de tomber dans cette ti&eacute;deur
raffin&eacute;e, pauvre et pr&eacute;tentieuse, mimunichoise, mi-Salon
d'automne, qui est bien ce qu'il y a des plus odieusement <I>pompier</I>
de nos jours").
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Such avant-garde performances were no longer primarily governed by
 claims of taste but had, despite their own intentions, subordinated
 themselves to the principle of exchange value.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is, then, in Apollinaire's conception of a modern public sphere,
a delicate and ultimately precarious balance. As the fullest expression
of the search for art's autonomous essence, avant-garde performance is
modernity's best hope for getting back in touch with the qualitative
dimensions of existence that lie beyond exchange. And such performance
is itself quintessentially modern, growing out of the same ingenuity
and imagination that have produced modern industry and technology. In

<B></B>

this sense, avant-garde art and mass culture are continuous with one
another, each an expression of the aesthetic potentials of modern life,
which are very great. "Modern style," Apollinaire wrote in 1912, lies
above all in "its iron constructions, machines, automobiles, bicycles,
and airplanes," and he who sees in the Eiffel Tower a "lack of style"
is quite mistaken ("le style moderne . . . les constructions de fer,
les machines, les automobiles, les bicyclettes, les a&eacute;roplanes
. . . manque de style.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Two decades before Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Kracauer, Apollinaire
 was calling attention to the democratic potential of the work of art
 in an age of "mechanical processes," even while also expressing the
 fear that the "industrialization" of art might ultimately seduce the
 avant-garde from its pursuit of a pure art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 That was of course the other side of the balance. Market forces
 pressured younger painters to produce too much and too soon, and a
 market-stimulated "art of the boulevards" was threatening to undermine
 the avant-garde from within.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 His anger at this potential even led Apollinaire into the occasional
 anti-Semitic remark, as when he wrote of Heinrich Heine as "a Jew who
 tried to gallicize himself, and unfortunately it is this caustic Jewish
 spirit that has managed in large measure to replace the simplicity of
 the French spirit; the art of the boulevards is Jewish to the point
 of excess."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Embedded within this unfortunate display of rancor, however, lies an
important point, one that will play a central role in "The New Spirit
and the Poets," his most important late essay. For Apollinaire, the
main antidote to the collapse of avant-garde values before the demons
of exchange was the naturist principle that genuine art must be rooted
in the concrete national conditions of a people. So long as avant-garde
art remained connected to folk traditions, customs, specific locales,
and the life circumstances of a particular people, its anchoring
in the qualitative appeared secure. But when, as with many of the
Futurists, it lost touch with its roots in a vain quest for an avant-garde
internationalism or notoriety for its own sake, it was prone to seduction
by the quantitative and abstract despite its own best intentions.

4. Futurism, World War I, and the "New Spirit and the Poets"
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is one notable exception to Apollinaire's lack of interest
in writing manifestos: the brief Futurist manifesto he wrote in the
spring of 1913 that appeared in the Florentine journal <I>Lacerba</I>
that September.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 Yet even this is not quite the exception that it initially appears to
 be. From the first Parisian exhibit of the Futurist painters at the
 Bernheim-Jeune gallery in February 1912, Apollinaire had been lukewarm
 toward the Milanese movement, claiming that they were "nothing but
 imitators . . . of the avant-garde French schools."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Though this view provoked the hostility of some Futurists, especially
 Umberto Boccioni, Marinetti himself recognized the immense value of
 having Apollinaire in his corner and reacted more strategically. Through
 pressure on Ardengo Soffici, a Florentine Futurist who had known
 Apollinaire from a long sojourn in Paris, Marinetti seems to have teased
 Apollinaire into writing a Futurist manifesto.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Yet, according to the later recollections of Carlo

<B></B>

Carr&agrave;, when Marinetti received the manuscript, he judged it
interesting but not yet written in manifesto form. The elaborate font
and typeface variations of the version that appeared in <I>Lacerba</I>
were Marinetti's work, though they met with Apollinaire's approval.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ironically, the one Futurist influence upon Apollinaire that seems
incontrovertible are Marinetti's ideas about typography, punctuation, and
visuality in poetry. On more substantive matters, however, Apollinaire
was critical of Futurism both before and after the brief parenthesis
represented by his manifesto. The reasons for this attitude are not
hard to discern. As already indicated, Apollinaire feared that Futurism
was insufficiently serious about artistic values and too given to the
fashionable. Futurism also seems to have especially provoked his anxieties
about being French; nearly all of his articles on the movement treat
it in the context of a Franco-Italian avant-garde rivalry. Apollinaire
clearly reacted against Marinetti's autocratic leadership style, as
would the Florentine Futurists in the spring of 1914.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Yet Apollinaire also had deeper reasons for being cool towards Futurism,
 reasons connected with his ideas about an avant-garde strategy adequate
 to modern innovations in culture and communication.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Marinetti, the modern world was veering decisively away from written
persuasion, especially in extended forms like the book, and toward the
visual, cinematic, and verbal-performative.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 Accordingly, the fundamental form of his avant-garde practice
 was the Futurist "evening" (<I>serata</I>) in which written poetry
 became only a means within a staged performance that drew its energy
 from a calculatedly hostile relation with its audience. In contrast,
 Apollinaire jealously guarded the specificity of the literary, defending
 the written page and the book against obsolescence and against being
 reduced to its present, performative value, even as he sought to push
 writing in a more visual direction. This attitude was linked with
 a view of language which, as we have seen, remained analytical and
 intellectualistic in its insistence upon its own artificiality and
 separation from experience. Language for Apollinaire was a critical
 instrument for investigating the difference and otherness of the
 confronted object rather than, as in Marinetti, a medium through
 which human bodies and the world were to be ecstatically merged. To
 follow Marinetti's irrationalist and apparently world-transforming
 understanding of language, Apollinaire feared, was actually to
 return art to a traditional-mimetic understanding rather than a
 modernist-autonomous one. As he wrote in the <I>Soir&eacute;es</I>,
 "Marinetti's words-in-freedom [<I>mots en libert&eacute;</I>] bring
 about a renewal of description and as such they have their importance,
 but they also imply an offensive return of description and are in this
 sense didactic and anti-lyrical."
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to some critics, however, Apollinaire's enthusiastic, sometimes
ecstatic response to the war represented a movement back toward Futurism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 This is a view we will consider--after we have briefly enumerated the
 essentials of that experience. As a foreign-born resident of France,
 Apollinaire was under no obligation to enlist. He could have gone to
 Switzerland, as some friends suggested, or to New York with artists like
 Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia, and Albert Gleizes, or he could simply

<B></B>

have stayed in Paris as Picasso did. For reasons that should by now
be evident, however, Apollinaire made immediate efforts to join the
French army. Initially, these efforts failed because of his Polish
name, his mother's Russian birth, his own Roman birth, and the fact
that, despite his French nationalism, he had not troubled to apply
to become a naturalized citizen until just a few months before the
outbreak of conflict. Ultimately, however, the army's need for
manpower prevailed. By December he had joined the 38th regiment
of field artillery at N&icirc;mes, and by April 1915 he was at the
front. There he mostly remained until a shell splinter penetrated his
tin helmet on March 17, 1916, eight days after finally being granted
French citizenship. Apparently superficial at first, his head wound soon
proved otherwise, temporarily paralyzing his left hand and forearm and
putting so much pressure on his brain that the army doctors ordered him
to be trepanned.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During his months of combat, Apollinaire wrote a number of poems--notably
"Merveille de la guerre," "La petite auto," "Fus&eacute;e," and
"A l'Italie"--that appear to celebrate the butchery of war and to
aestheticize the experience of it in a manner not unlike Marinetti's. "Ah,
Dieu, que la guerre est jolie" is the most often cited line of his
war poetry and, not infrequently, it serves to end as well as to begin
discussion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 Yet the most thoughtful interpreters have tended to reach the same,
 obvious conclusion. As Matthews poignantly argues, "certainly it is
 impossible to ignore that Apollinaire poems exist that are difficult
 to read other than as attempts to establish dominance, whether real or
 imaginary," that are "expressions of a desire for power, for a willful
 suppression of difference," and that "move at will from concrete to
 imaginary, experience to creativity, image to myth."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 I regard this as a harsh assessment, but I have no reason to quarrel
 with it. That the war may have caused Apollinaire to lose touch with his
 critical faculties temporarily, as Matthews intimates, seems readily
 explicable in view of Apollinaire's intense desire to prove himself
 fully French. And, as Kenneth Silver has argued, pressures on everyone
 living in France to be accounted fully loyal to the war effort were
 the decisive feature of cultural experience in these years.
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But was Apollinaire's reveling in war a function of a renewed
Futurism? Here Matthews's answer seems ultimately uncertain, but that
of Raymond Jean is not. Jean argues that the shock of the war threw
Apollinaire into a crisis of identity so deep that he lost all rational
control over his faculties. In his view, the "counter-ideology" of
ethnic fantasy and exile that had permeated Apollinaire's poetry from
the beginning was an escape, a refusal to confront the likes of Duhamel
in rational argument, and an unconscious flight into myth that marked a
profound alienation. The shock of the war so intensified this alienation
that he was no longer able to accept the involvement of individual
existence in history, a primal refusal that Jean finds expressed in
Apollinaire's Futurist "antimanifesto" where it speaks of a "suppression
of history." Yet why should the fantasies of ethnicity and exile that
inhabit Apollinaire's poetry be treated as an escape from historical
responsibility? Jean appears to assume that the only appropriate
response to Duhamel's racist xenophobia would have been an assertion of
cosmopolitanism and that any counter-nationalism must be an irrational

<B></B>

escape. As has been argued in this paper, however, Apollinaire was a
French nationalist from the beginning for reasons very much bound up with
his attraction to naturism. From this point of view, his enthusiasm for
the war is explicable as the full blossoming of attitudes he had always
held. To believe that his attitude towards the war requires some special
explanation is to fail to recognize the depth both of his own prewar
nationalism and of the nationalist tendencies of the prewar French
avant-garde as a whole.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That Apollinaire's hearty embrace of the war was not a function of any
return to Futurism is also evident from the argument of "The New Spirit
and the Poets," which he delivered as a lecture in November 1917 and
which was published posthumously in the <I>Mercure de France</I> of 1
December 1918. The crisply written essay is a brilliant synthesis of
his value commitments, his view of public life, his sense of the coming
transformations in culture and technology that will affect that life,
and his understanding of the historical role avant-gardes must continue
to enact.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From its opening sentence, which touts France as the world's
cultural center, the essay rings with nationalist rhetoric. "The
strong intellectual discipline which the French have always imposed on
themselves" will save them from the "excesses of the Italian and Russian
Futurists." Yet Apollinaire's argument for the importance of national
rootedness pertains to every nationality, not just the French. "Truth,"
he claims, must be explored "as much in the ethnic domain . . . as in
that of the imagination." He also proclaims his confidence that "social
developments will [never] go so far that one will not be able to speak
of national literature," a formulation that seems driven as much by his
fear of global cultural forces as by his dispassionate analysis of the
present. Indeed, he goes so far as to say that "art <I>increasingly</I>
has a country;" he explicitly rejects cosmopolitanism; and he emphasizes
the old naturist principle that "poets must always express a milieu, a
nation," that artists are always the "expression of a race, of one given
environment. Art will only cease being national the day that the whole
universe, living in the same climate, in houses built in the same style,
speaks the same language with the same accent--that is to say never."
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 Case closed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Apollinaire knows full well that the "old regime" has expired on the
battlefield and that "the new spirit" whose outlines he is trying to
discern is linked to rising forces of cultural democratization, globalism,
and technology. Yet the effect of these realizations is mostly to excite
his desire for a "return to order."
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 The values he declares are rational and orderly: "The new spirit which
 is making itself heard strives above all to inherit from the classics a
 good sound sense, a sure critical spirit, perspectives on the universe
 and on the soul of man, and the sense of duty which lays bare our
 feelings and limits or rather contains their manifestations." The
 trick will be to integrate these values with the modern technical
 prowess that the Futurists so celebrate and the importance of which he
 certainly acknowledges too. "Typographical artifices," for example,
 "have the advantage of bringing to life a visual lyricism which was
 almost unknown before our age." Ours is the "era of the telephone, the
 wireless, and aviation," and the "popular art <I>par excellence</I>"
 is the cinema. Poets will respond with enthusiasm. "They want to be
 the first to provide a totally new lyricism for these new

<B></B>

means of expression which are giving impetus to art--the phonograph
and the cinema." Yet the exciting potential of these modern technical
triumphs is sharply distinguished from the moral values the Futurists
associate with them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The essay prefers to speak of "new spirit" and "poets" rather than
avant-gardism and avant-garde, but it is clear that, despite its
return-to-order tenor and opposition to Futurist values, Apollinaire
remains committed to an agonistic public sphere based on avant-garde
performance. "Poets and artists," he <I>writes</I>, "daily increase the
patrimony of civilization; and through the truth and joy they spread, they
will make this civilization, if not adaptable to any nation whatsoever,
at least supremely agreeable to all." And: "since men must live in the
end by truths in spite of the falsehoods with which they pad them, the
poet alone sustains the life whereby humanity finds these truths." There
are signs, however, that Apollinaire is moving toward a more democratic
notion of the avant-garde. Like Antonio Gramsci who responded to the
postwar era by declaring that everyone is an intellectual, Apollinaire
declares that "one can be a poet in any field: it is enough that one
be adventuresome and pursue any new discovery." Poets are all those
who "undertake discoveries." They "are not simply men devoted to the
beautiful. They are also and especially devoted to truth, insofar as the
unknown can be penetrated, so much that the unexpected, the surprising,
is one of the principal sources of poetry today."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the nearly three years between his head wound and his death from
influenza, Apollinaire lived his life in tune with this same balance
of values. He wrote the program notes for Paris's major avant-garde
performance of 1917, <I>Parade</I>, which featured set designs by Picasso,
music by Eric Sati, and a libretto by Jean Cocteau. In these notes, the
word surrealism appeared for the first time. He remained abreast of new
avant-garde developments like dada, and gave early, enthusiastic support
to Tristan Tzara.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
 Yet, at the same time, the values he articulated shifted sharply to
 the conservative side, and he began to write more explicitly political
 articles and to show new enthusiasm for Charles Maurras and Action
 Fran&ccedil;aise.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 When Tzara approached him regarding his journal <I>Dada 2</I> in
 1918, Apollinaire coldly responded that "it would be compromising
 for me . . . to collaborate on a review . . . that has Germans for
 collaborators, even if they should favor the Entente" ("il pourrait
 &ecirc;tre compromettant pour moi . . . de collaborer &agrave; une
 revue . . . qui a pour collaborateurs des Allemands, si Ententophiles
 qu'ils soient").
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 Such Germanophobia had not prevented him from lecturing at the <I>Der
 Sturm</I> gallery in Berlin in 1913, but the devastation of war and
 the uncertainties of the new era that loomed before him redoubled the
 nationalist instincts that had always undergirded his thinking about
 the nature and political potential of cultural modernism.

It may be a legal or a theological fiction (as Joyce would probably have
insisted), but the impending millennial changeover seems to encourage
the asking of large questions and the taking of long views. This essay
will be an instance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The imminent end of what we think of as "our" millennium also seems to
breed surveys and polls, and few readers of daily newspapers can have
escaped seeing one or more lists of "best books" or "most important
authors" in which James Joyce and his works re prominently. Among
the large questions I find myself asking at this transitional moment
are: "What is the significance of Joyce's emergence as the preeminent
literary re of the twentieth century and one of the most admired
artists of the second millennium? And in the face of this pre-eminence,
what are the responsibilities of those who are professionally involved
with Joyce as we look ahead to a new era?"

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

1.  An industry without limits
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When one is starting on a career as a scholar and critic, it's a common
mistake, and perhaps even a necessary one, to think of one's work as
leading, together with the work of one's colleagues, to a solid edifice
which will stand as a firm and unchanging basis for further scholarly
and critical building projects. Each stage in this process, one assumes,
will lead the scholarly community closer to the goal of full and final
exegesis together with textual stability and historico-biographical
certainty. From this perspective on critical practice, the massive
accumulation of commentary on Joyce can only be dispiriting:

<B></B>

 after the deployment of so much skill and the expenditure of so
 much effort, surely we should be approaching something like a full
 understanding and appreciation of his work. The avalanche of books
 and articles should be slowing down as unexplored areas become fewer,
 explications more accurate, critical judgments sounder. But the very
 opposite seems to be happening.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are several reasons for this. One is the fact that, although
the number of different commentaries on Joyce seems bewilderingly
large, it's only a tiny proportion of the <I>potential</I> number. Even
works significantly less complex than Joyce's allow of a huge variety
of critical responses. We like to think that, because there are so
many books on Joyce on our library shelves, there has been a logical
progression whereby important topics have been systematically covered
and gaps gradually filled; but in fact authors' choices of subject
and editors' and publishers' decisions about publication are in large
measure the product of pressures and contingencies that have nothing
to do with intellectual or cultural need. Think how many biographies
of Joyce <I>could</I> be written, each quite different from the last;
how many editions of each of his books could  be produced; how
many textual details could be explored, how many critical approaches
employed, how many intertextual and historical connections drawn. The
graduate student embarking on a dissertation on Joyce is likely to survey
the array of secondary literature and feel despairingly that there is
nothing left to be done. What we actually have, however, is a small,
and rather random, selection of what is possible according to current
canons of critical activity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A second reason why the model of a closer and closer approach to full
understanding is not appropriate is that it fails to take the essentially
temporal and spatial nature of the cultural field into account. That is,
the meaning and value of a cultural object--such as <I>Ulysses</I>--is a
product of that object's interaction with a specific cultural matrix,
and cultural matrices vary across time and space. The consequence
is that Joyce's works, like any artefacts sufficiently rich in their
relations to their constituting context, can never be exhausted: after
a certain measure of time (in a given place), the object is no longer
the same object, and commentary has a new task. In fulfilling its
new task, commentary also helps to constitute the object in its new
form. The humanist <I>Ulysses</I> is partly displaced by the formalist
<I>Ulysses</I>, the poststructuralist <I>Ulysses</I>, the new historicist
<I>Ulysses</I>, the postcolonial <I>Ulysses</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I say "partly displaced" because we are not dealing with a succession of
quite differently constituted works; the sedimented history of readings
often persists in its effects, complicating and sometimes enriching
current readings. An interpretation of <I>Ulysses</I> that can be said
to do justice to it in the specific context of the late twentieth century
will be alert to its engagement with Ireland's history as a metropolitan
colony, but will also take account of its destabilization of the norms
of Enlightenment thinking, its formal intricacy, and its convincing
representation of the inner lives of human characters. However, working
against this survival of past modes of commentary is a third factor that
prolongs the critical endeavor: the ease with which we forget what has
been written, and write it over and over again, using a newer vocabulary
to articulate the same insights. Because the library of Joyce criticism
is so vast, there is very

<B></B>

little chance that a critic writing today will track down
<I>everything</I> that has been said on his or her chosen topic; and
as the critical history grows longer and longer, the opportunities for
recycling increase.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The fourth and final factor behind the increasing productivity of Joyce
criticism that I want to mention is a simple but often overlooked truth:
the more that is written about a topic, the more there is to write. Every
fact invites a further exploration, every judgment a counter-judgment. Not
long after Joyce has become a topic for critical writing, Joyce criticism
becomes a topic. If the avalanche ever subsides, it will not happen
because there is less to say about Joyce and what has been made of
Joyce. On the contrary, there is more and more to say about Joyce every
year because more has been said--more to build on, more to disagree with.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The new millennium is not likely to bring a diminishment in the quantity
of books and articles on Joyce, then. Much of the huge potential for
commentary will remain to be tapped; cultural and historical shifts
will permit hitherto unforeseen ways of reading; older readings will
be forgotten and repeated in new guises; and the mass of existing
texts about Joyce, in conjunction with the increasing availability of
original documents, will provoke further texts, which in their turn will
provoke yet more. There is not much substance to the argument that Joyce
criticism has virtually exhausted its topic, and that it is time to turn
to other things. If it is true that downsizing would be appropriate in
the Joyce industry, it's not because of an imminent drying up of supply
or of demand.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
<!--_a-head-->
2.  Joyce triumphans
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When I look back over my own writings on Joyce during the past seventeen
years or so, I'm struck by their uniformly positive assessment of
Joyce's achievement. Everything I've written rests on the same basis: the
assumption that Joyce's writing is to be enjoyed, admired, and learned
from rather than weighed in evaluative scales and pronounced good, bad,
or a mixture of the two. I'm not unusual in this; almost everything that
has been published on Joyce during the same period has proceeded on its
business of interpretative exegesis, historical mapping, biographical
exploration, pre-textual investigation, political commentary, or whatever
it might be, without seeing any reason for questioning the fundamental
proposition that Joyce's work is a fully achieved artistic success and
a highly valuable contribution to our cultural life, and often our moral
and political life as well.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 (I'll return in due course to some exceptions.) I don't believe this is
 just a story of uncritical adulation; what I want to suggest is that it
 is, at least in many cases, the product of a certain kind of critical
 responsibility, responsibility to and for Joyce, or, more accurately,
 Joyce's work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Responsibility, if it is to mean anything other than conformity to an
existing moral code, is responsibility to and for <I>the other</I>;
that is to say, the experience of obligation to that which one does not
and cannot fully know. To act ethically is to respond with justice to
the other, and this involves <I>both</I> a careful weighing up of the
evidence <I>and</I>

<B></B>

an acknowledgment that the evidence is always inadequate, necessitating
what we might term, after Kierkegaard, a leap of trust in the other.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 We can only, of course, make this leap if we find ourselves in some way
 summoned by the other, called to respond to it, and much therefore
 remains beyond our conscious control in this process; but it is
 possible to prepare the ground, to develop one's receptivity to what
 might come (though it will still take us by surprise if it is genuinely
 other)--and equally possible to close oneself in advance to the chance
 of the other's arrival. If someone tells me, "I've never been able to
 appreciate Joyce," I'm ready to believe that for substantial reasons
 of individual character, taste, cultural background, and so on, Joyce's
 writing is simply unavailable to that person; but it is always possible
 that part of this response is a failure of openness to an alterity that
 would challenge cherished habits or assumptions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many of the unfailingly positive responses to Joyce's work, then, arise
not from a belief that it is without faults or potentially dangerous
effects but from an initial, and continually sustained, <I>commitment</I>,
one that exceeds any objective assessment of aesthetic, moral, or
political worth. The parallels with the kinds of commitment we make
to other persons or, sometimes, institutions or communities, will be
evident. Normally, there is a built-in safeguard in the knowledge that
others have made and will make different commitments, and will remain
critically alert to all the possible failings in the object of <I>my</I>
commitment; so that, looking at the wider picture, the judgments we all
make ensure that both the potential value and the inevitable limitations
of a wide variety of judgeable entities is registered.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But as we approach the year 2000, and we find it possible to say with the
likelihood of a fair measure of agreement from readers in many parts of
the globe, "James Joyce was the most important writer of the twentieth
century," I am forced to wonder if, in this case (and one can think of
a few others), such a process has really happened. Saying good things
about Joyce (or working on Joyce with the implication that he is worth
a great deal of time and effort) has become such a profitable pastime
that it seems to have made it all but impossible for counter-voices to
emerge, or to be heard if they do emerge. At the very least, this may
be the moment for those who are committed to Joyce to think about their
responsibility to other works, other writers. When a body of work has
gained such massive international endorsement, when a single artist is
the subject of such an extensive and meticulous critical enterprise, is it
perhaps not time for critics to direct their energies elsewhere, to look
for other writers who can teach and entertain us in different ways, ways
perhaps more appropriate to the needs of the twenty-first century? This
may be a better reason for downsizing the Joyce industry than the
feeling that there is less and less to be said. If the best readings
of an oeuvre are those that are as responsive to the particularities of
their own time and place as they are to the work itself, it may well be
that the new millennium, or at least the new century and the increasing
globalization of culture that it is sure to bring, require less of James
Joyce and more of a diversity of artists with a variety of backgrounds
operating with different techniques and different aims.

<B></B>

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

3. Judging Joyce
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My suggestion, then, is that the millennial musings of those of us who
feel committed to Joyce in the way I have described should include
an attempt to stand back from him, to bracket as far as we can our
admiration and enjoyment, and to ask what possible negative consequences
follow from his current preeminence within the cultural arena. We
might, for instance, ask how the current hegemony exerted by his work
matches up to the values embodied in his writing, as we now perceive
them. Don't the comic deflations of <I>Ulysses</I> and <I>Finnegans
Wake</I> have a bearing on the eminently serious endeavors of Joyce
scholars and editors around the world? How does Joyce's domination of
twentieth-century reading lists square with the sympathy for the underdog
and the suspicion of authority manifested in his writing? Although it's
hard to imagine Joyce himself ever being pleased by a move to dislodge
his name from the pinnacle it currently occupies, it could be argued
that his global prominence, and the consequent demotion of a number
of other writers equally worth our attention, constitute a large-scale
instance of the kind of closing off of opportunities that a number of his
works dramatize and derogate. (Think, for instance, of all the lives in
<I>Dubliners</I> that are confined and limited by those in the social
sphere who wield influence and authority). This is one of the oldest
games in the critical book, of course, and one that I have often played:
using the values embodied in Joyce's work (as perceived by the critic)
as a means to expose weaknesses in the approaches of others, including
approaches that, it is claimed, praise Joyce for the wrong reasons.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But such a strategy of displacement, while it would use Joyce's warrant in
order to turn away from Joyce and devote one's energies to other writers,
would still in a sense leave him unchallenged as the preeminent re,
proved yet again to be ahead of his time, foreseeing all our critical
and ethical needs. What is more, the general point that the dominance
of one author results in the occlusion of a number of others tells us
nothing <I>specific</I> about Joyce. Should we not, in assessing Joyce
at the millennium's end, aspire to something more nuanced by way of
critical judgment than the simple cry of <I>Basta!</I>?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another responsibility, I would suggest, is laid upon us. We have to
try to distance ourselves further from our enjoyment and admiration
of Joyce's work and our involvement in the seductive Joycean milieu in
order to ask: are there aspects of Joyce's work that deserve a negative
response? Should the conversation about Joyce in the twenty-first century
be a debate about strengths and weaknesses, benefits and dangers, as are
the conversations about T. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Ezra Pound, Wyndham
Lewis, and many other modernist writers? In raising these questions, it's
<I>Ulysses</I> we need to focus on, since it's above all on <I>Ulysses</I> that Joyce's reputation rests. Had he written only the earlier
works, he would remain an important twentieth-century re, but he
would not have become the giant we now know. And negative judgments
of <I>Finnegans Wake</I> are not rare; even if there is seldom a word
said against it in the public halls of Joyce symposia these days, there
are many complaints in the corridors. It is, I suspect, largely on the
strength of <I>Ulysses'</I> huge success that the <I>Wake</I> has, at
least in the past two decades, escaped significant onslaughts in print.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a way of initiating the process of judgment, let us ask what have
been the most persistent and telling critiques of <I>Ulysses</I> since
its publication, not in order to parry them but in order to assess
their merit today. (In doing so, we need to set aside at the outset the
numerous objections that have been made on the basis of prudishness,
anti-intellectualism, class bias, religious dogmatism, and other
limiting prejudices or proclivities). We might think of all evaluations
of artistic productions as falling roughly into two categories, though
any final separation between them would be impossible: we can call them
the <I>extra-cultural</I> and the <I>intra-cultural</I>. An extra-cultural
evaluation judges a work by its likely effects on some domain beyond that
of the culture to which it belongs, and is based on the prior acceptance
of certain goals, whether they be religious, moral, or political, which
it is felt any work of art should serve. Intra-cultural evaluations,
by contrast, operate in terms of a standard internal to the cultural
field in which the work is produced and received; in so far as they
are concerned with effects, it is with the effects on the reader in his
or her capacity as reader (rather than as religious believer, artist,
moral or political agent, and so on), and more particularly as literary
reader. (It will no doubt be obvious that I'm putting a lot of weight
on a notoriously murky word, <I>culture</I>, and that I'm doing this
in part, at least, to avoid another murky word, <I>aesthetic</I>. There
isn't time to defend my practice here; suffice it to say that by culture
I mean the ensemble of social practices, productions, and knowledges
within which what has traditionally been called the aesthetic finds
its place, but which embraces much that would be judged unaesthetic, or
anti-aesthetic, by traditional norms).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One strand of extra-cultural critiques derives its general standards
from some variety of Marxism: <I>Ulysses</I> has often been pronounced
too subjectivist and too bourgeois (a pair of related sins) to further
the revolution.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The names of Karl Radek and Georg Luk&aacute;cs come to mind;
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 less well-known (and more balanced) are the critiques of Alick West
 in 1937 and Arnold Kettle in 1953.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 "Second-wave" feminism, especially in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
 judging Joyce in terms of his representation of women, sometimes found
 that his writing served to retard progress towards gender equality. Kate
 Millett, Florence Howe, Carolyn Heilbrun, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar,
 and others criticized Joyce for his conventionally sexist attitudes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Such critiques don't, I feel, carry enough weight at our present moment
 to contribute towards an argument about the value of <I>Ulysses</I>. The
 hostile Marxists have been countered by other left-wing critics who
 regard <I>Ulysses</I> as a valuable reflection of a certain stage of
 capitalism (one could cite Franco Moretti's "The Long Goodbye" and
 Fredric Jameson's "<I>Ulysses</I> in History") or who are unapologetic
 about their admiration and enjoyment of the book (Raymond Williams would
 be one example); and the critical feminists have been answered by a large
 number of others who find in Joyce more to admire than to castigate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 There's little evidence that, on the whole, Joyce's work has had a
 harmful effect upon the societies in which it has been widely read,
 nor that it has much potential for harm; and I don't believe this is a
 contentious statement in 1999. (Whether the extra-cultural claims made
 for the potential <I>benefits</I> a careful reading of Joyce can bring
 are all justified--and there have been many,

<B></B>

humanist, socialist, feminist, poststructuralist, postcolonial--is
a different question, which I shall touch on in the last section of
this paper).

4. Intra-cultural critiques
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To find a way of judging Joyce that has more bite today, we need
to turn to intra-cultural critiques. An intra-cultural critique, as
I've suggested, attempts to assess the success or failure of the work
by measuring it against some standard deemed to be internal to the
cultural field in which it occurs, most commonly an aesthetic standard
(in earlier periods often labeled <I>taste</I>) but sometimes a broader
one, including--if the cultural field is defined in moral or religious
terms--a moral or religious one. Such standards are, of course, culturally
produced and hence variable (although this fact is not always appreciated
by those who apply them); and a successful work like <I>Ulysses</I> to
some degree (as Wordsworth put it) creates the taste--or perhaps the moral
sense--by which it is judged. I would also argue, with Derrida, that the
"it" that is being assessed is not a permanently self-identical entity
but something more like a repeated event or performance, always changing
as the conditions in which it takes place change.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Most intra-cultural judgments of Joyce, like most extra-cultural
 judgments, have been, explicitly or implicitly, positive, whether the
 standard applied has been that of truth to a certain notion of the
 historical condition or of human experience, subtlety and complexity
 of aesthetic ordering, comic effectiveness, or some other measure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Among the negative evaluations of Joyce on an intra-cultural basis, the
most tenacious and widespread (particularly in relation to the later
works) has been that there is an excess of technique over content,
intellect over feeling, and will over spontaneity. These are closely
enough related to be considered a single objection, responding to
a single tendency in Joyce's text (though manifested in a variety of
ways), and it's this recurrent objection on which I want to focus. Many
of those who find today that they can't read <I>Ulysses</I> with any
real pleasure--and there are many, whatever the polls say--experience
some version of this unease; and many who do enjoy <I>Ulysses</I> can
get nowhere with <I>Finnegans Wake</I> for the same reason. (There are
also those who find most of the later chapters of <I>Ulysses</I>--except
perhaps "Penelope"--a disappointment after the earlier ones, because
Joyce's technical display becomes harder and harder to ignore or justify
in traditional terms.) Some of us relish untangling the delicate threads
Joyce has woven together in the late books, while to others it is an
excruciatingly tedious business, in comparison with the excitement offered
by the insistent onward impulsion in a writer like--to take a name often
proposed in opposition to Joyce--D. H. Lawrence. To some degree this must
be a matter of individual preferences, the product of familial and social
conditioning and perhaps even genetic make-up: sometimes it seems, to
parody W. S. Gilbert, that everyone who's born into the world alive is
either a little Joycean or else a little Lawrentian. (Certainly, when
I was an undergraduate in a fiercely Leavisite English department

<B></B>

in South Africa, I quickly learned to stifle my Joycean tendencies
and to pay homage to Lawrence; but the experience didn't turn me into a
Leavisian or a Lawrentian). If it's the case that some such deeply-rooted
personal predisposition is the real impetus behind a number of elaborate
critical arguments, both negative and positive, there is little we can
do to allow for it, and we have no option but to weigh up those arguments
on their intellectual merits.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first extended critique of <I>Ulysses</I> along these lines is Wyndham
Lewis's, in <I>Time and Western Man</I>, published in 1927. Although
Lewis's overarching argument is that <I>Ulysses</I>, like <I>&Agrave; la
recherche du temps perdu</I>, is, to its great disadvantage, a Bergsonian
"time-book," much of his criticism is directed at the disparity between
elaborate technique and what Lewis sees as banal content. For instance:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
What stimulates him is <I>ways of doing things</I>, and technical
processes, and not <I>things to be done</I>. Between the various things

writes, or what idea or world-view he expresses, so long as he is trying
his hand at this manner and that, and displaying his enjoyable virtuosity.

Lifeless technique and sterile complexity are also what Leavis finds
objectionable in <I>Ulysses</I>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It seems plain to me that there is no organic principle determining,
informing, and controlling into a vital whole, the elaborate analogical
structure, the extraordinary variety of technical devices, the attempts
at an exhaustive rendering of consciousness, for which <I>Ulysses</I> is
remarkable, and which got it accepted by a cosmopolitan literary world
as a new start. It is rather, I think, a dead end.

Behind Leavis we may hear his lodestar, Lawrence: "James Joyce bores

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Boredom, in fact, is the typical experience of those readers who find
the technical display oppressive: Leavis finds Joyce's "subconscious" (as
exhibited in <I>Finnegans Wake</I>)  "sadly boring"; George Moore
is reported as saying of <I>Ulysses</I> in 1922, "I read a little here
and there, but, oh my God, how bored I got!;" and Jung in 1932 managed
to wax lyrical over the apocalyptic boredom produced in him by the book:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Joyce bores me to tears, but it is a vicious dangerous boredom such as
not even the worst banality could induce. It is the boredom of nature,
the bleak whistling of the wind over the crags of the Hebrides, sunrise

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Jung is, however, willing to justify this boredom extra-culturally: for

he feels is rampant everywhere around him, by opposing excess of feeling
with complete absence of feeling. Indeed,

<B></B>

those who are <I>not</I> bored by the book are misreading it, and the

such misreading has been very common:

The book must mean something to them, must even reveal something that
they did not know or feel before. They are not infernally bored by it, but
are helped, refreshed, instructed, converted, "restratified." Obviously,

the blackest hatred could enable the reader to go through the book from

Another early critic of <I>Ulysses</I> who, like Jung, balances blame
with praise is Rebecca West.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

 Reading a transparently bad poem of Joyce's one day in Paris, she has
 her earlier suspicions confirmed: "Mr. James Joyce is a great man who
 is entirely without taste" (<I>SN</I>, 15). She goes on to discuss what
 for her is a consequence of this lack of taste: what she calls "the gross
 sentimentality which is his most fundamental error" (<I>SN</I>, 15). This
 may sound like the exact opposite of Jung's complaint; but this is not
 sentimentality in the usual sense. West describes it in terms that by
 now sound familiar: instead of "real creative writing" (<I>SN</I>, 17),
 Joyce's work is willed and calculated. It is governed by narcissism,
 "which inevitably deforms all its products with sentimentality, since the
 self-image which it is the aim of narcissism to create is made not out
 of material that has been imaginatively experienced but out of material
 that has been selected as likely to please others" (<I>SN</I>, 22).
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Complaints about excessive technical complexity in <I>Ulysses</I> seem
less prevalent in critical studies of Joyce after the 1930s, perhaps in
part because "Work in Progress" and then <I>Finnegans Wake</I> made the
earlier book seem transparent by comparison, but largely because in the
U.S.A--by this time the source of most serious criticism as it has been
ever since--Joyce's reputation was established and the long project of
elucidation and exegesis (which simply took Joyce's merits for granted)
had begun.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The Leavisian inheritance remained powerful in the U.K. and its colonies,
 though the effect of this was not to produce negative critiques so much
 as to inhibit any extended discussion of Joyce. One exception was the
 Australian critic Samuel Goldberg, who attempted a balanced, largely
 Leavisian, evaluation of <I>Ulysses</I> in <I>The Classical Temper</I> in 1961.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Goldberg's admiration is moderated by a distaste for what he calls
 Joyce's "busy ant-like industry" (<I>CT</I>, 300) and his "unintelligent
 intellectuality" (<I>CT</I>, 311); he also cites Lawrence's complaints
 (including "wilfulness" and "lack of emotional spontaneity") with
 approval (<I>CT</I>, 309).
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 One of Joyce's limitations as a novelist is "the tendency to
 intellectualize his vital intuitions" (<I>CT</I>, 314). Not surprisingly,
 it is the later chapters such as "Oxen of the Sun" and "Eumaeus" that
 he finds most limited (the latter is "too boring a way of expressing
 boredom" [<I>CT</I>, 258]).
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Even if we do not find these--or any--chapters of <I>Ulysses</I> boring,
 technically excessive, over-intellectualized, or too much the product
 of the will, critical



responsibility demands that we make an effort to understand these charges,
repeated as they have been over several decades.

5.  Against "Ulysses"
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The final intra-cultural critique of <I>Ulysses</I> on which I want to
focus, and which will help us to assess the relevance of these charges
today, is one of the few published in the last two decades, and to
my mind the most significant of them. Leo Bersani published "Against
<I>Ulysses</I>" in <I>Raritan</I> in 1988 and included it as a chapter
of <I>The Culture of Redemption</I> in 1990.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 One might have expected an essay by a leading cultural critic of our time
 that takes issue with the reputation of Joyce's most highly acclaimed
 work to have initiated an extended discussion in the many organs of
 Joyce criticism, and in books and symposia dedicated to Joyce, but
 there has in fact been very little by way of response.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 No ripples have appeared in the uniformly positive surface of commentary
 on Joyce.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although Bersani's essay is essentially intra-cultural in its arguments,
it has an interesting relation to extra-cultural criticism in that it's
part of an argument <I>against</I> the notion that art has the power
to improve the world. Bersani argues that <I>Ulysses'</I> failure lies
in its very claim to authority, its confidence--shared by most Joyce
critics--in its own power to promote the cause of Western culture, the
vast intertext in which it situates itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 So Bersani judges that <I>Ulysses</I> (like every other work of art)
 has <I>no</I> significant potential to heal the world's wounds, and
 that its own faith in the potency of literature is a mark against it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I partly share Bersani's scepticism about the redemptive power of art. I
would not wish to deny that works of art can have powerful effects on the
cultural/ethical/political world, but I would insist on two qualifications
which bring me closer to his position: these potential effects are always
unpredictable (potentiality, in other words, does not imply a latent
instrumentality waiting to be released), and they are always dependent
on readings of the work in question, readings which are themselves
unpredictable. This effective unpredictability I see as constitutive
of art in the western cultural tradition; it is closely related to the
demand for innovation which is inseparable from artistic creation and to
the alterity of the new art-work, or the art-work re-experienced as new.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 If a work of art <I>does</I> have a restorative effect on an individual
 or a culture, it's not an effect that could have been deduced or foretold
 with any certainty by a critic, although a critic's work may have
 been crucial to the particular acts of reading which produced it. The
 important question, then, is not whether <I>Ulysses</I> has had or is
 likely to have certain consequences in the world, but whether Bersani's
 description of it as a work which implies certain claims about those
 consequences is accurate, and if it is, whether the making of those
 claims constitutes a flaw.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some of Bersani's difficulties with <I>Ulysses</I> echo the complaints
we have already heard from Lewis, Lawrence, Leavis, and Goldberg. His
depiction of <I>Ulysses</I> as a

<B></B>

conventional novel of character-psychology disguised as an avant-garde
experiment sounds like Lewis. When he calls it "a text to be deciphered
but not read" he sounds like Lawrence and Leavis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 And when he speaks of the "technical machinery" that "obscures our
 view of what is happening" (<I>CR</I>, 156), he himself acknowledges
 Goldberg's study of <I>Ulysses</I> as a "notable expression of this
 complaint" (<I>CR</I>, 226 n. 2). As with many of the readers who
 find the excess of technique a problem, Bersani fails to acknowledge
 the degree to which the book demands a way of reading different from
 that required by most novels, and therefore finds his expectations
 disagreeably thwarted. For instance, he stresses--quite rightly, I
 believe--that part of <I>Ulysses</I>'  lasting popularity rests on
 the intimacy with which readers feel they come to know Stephen, Molly,
 and Leopold, but he assumes that this must mean that stylistic features
 serve as reflexes of character in an entirely conventional manner. The
 deformed names in "Scylla and Charybdis," he suggests, arise because
 Stephen is playing with them in his mind; the style of "Eumaeus" is how
 Bloom would write the chapter, and provides us with a fuller picture of
 his personality. Whatever credence one might give to these particular
 examples (I'm not at all convinced by them), they imply a way of reading
 the stylistic peculiarities of <I>Ulysses</I> that is bound to produce
 confusion and frustration. What the best readings of the book over the
 past twenty years have taught us is that it is perfectly possible to
 enjoy the credible minutiae of individual personality and the sense of
 intimacy they produce without assuming an organic relation between style
 and character. Joyce's technical extravagances, and the pleasures they
 offer the reader, are not wholly concerned with accurate portrayals
 of people we might meet; without compromising that accuracy, they
 provide insights--very often comic insights--into the very processes
 of linguistic representation, historical reporting, psychological
 theorizing, political programming, and so on.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A related issue is that of the phenomenology of the reading experience:
critics like Lawrence, Leavis, Goldberg, and Bersani like to be carried
forward in linear fashion by the words they are reading, the elements
of their intellectual and emotional apprehension working together
in an illusion of continuity and wholeness. <I>Ulysses</I> holds
up this preference for inspection, as only one of a number of ways
of reading; and those who are able to take pleasure in tracking back
and forth, skipping and re-reading, moving from text to reference book
and back to text, sharing partial insights with a group and having them
disconfirmed or extended, and simultaneously registering the vividness of
the reality represented <I>and</I> the comic exposure of the subterfuges
of representation, are bound to derive a great deal more from Joyce's
writing. Not surprisingly, Bersani finds the "Ithaca" episode barely
readable--and it <I>is</I> barely readable by the mode of verbal ingestion
he prefers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Notwithstanding these limitations in his approach, I believe that
Bersani's critique points us towards an aspect of <I>Ulysses</I> that
should at least make us hesitate before we exultantly carry it into the
third millennium as the supreme literary text of our time. Particularly
useful is his recognition--implicit if not explicit--that it is not
<I>Ulysses</I> itself (if there were such a thing) to which he is saying
a regretful farewell, but



<I>Ulysses</I> as it has been produced by its readers and their changing
cultural matrix over the past seventy-seven years. As I have been arguing,
the <I>Ulysses</I> which we are trying to evaluate in this way is not
the book that appeared in 1922, or the book that upset Lewis in 1927 and
appalled Jung in 1932, or even the book Goldberg tried to evaluate in
1961. Thanks to the amassed achievements of Joyce critics over several
decades in response to the features that disturbed these critics, the
<I>Ulysses</I> of 1999 is something different: a dense encyclopedic
hypertextual web of internal cross-references, historical and cultural
allusions, and authorial emendations and accretions, existing not as an
isolated linguistic and material entity but as a borderless presence
within a continuous expanse of signifiers, visual and aural, textual
and graphic, substantial and electronic. Before very long, we (or our
wealthier libraries) will be able to purchase a magnificent embodiment
of this evolved entity (no longer a "book," let alone a "novel"): a
hypermedia <I>Ulysses</I> which, it is promised, will include "several
versions" of the text, definitions, annotations, source works ("such
as <I>The Odyssey</I> and <I>Hamlet</I>"), Joyce's schemas, an archive
of critical books and articles linked to specific textual sites, maps,
photographs, film clips, songs and sound effects, and a complete audio
performance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 To read <I>Ulysses</I> today as primarily a novel of character
 and event is to read it against its history, against what it has
 become. Although Bersani begins his essay by proposing to approach
 <I>Ulysses</I> "naively," he quickly, and correctly, adds that "this
 decision can be little more than a ruse" (<I>CR</I>, 155). And at
 the end of the essay he ascribes the erroneous ascription to art of
 redemptive power not to Joyce's book on its own but to "the community
 of <I>Ulysses</I> and its exegetes" (<I>CR</I>, 178).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although for many of us this historical transformation of <I>Ulysses</I> into a rich, unhierarchical, unboundaried, intertextual fabric has
enhanced, rather than diminished, its enjoyability, it may be just this
that has rendered Joyce's work less worth our attention as critics. This
is not, as I pointed out earlier, because we are left with less to do
than earlier critics, but because the hypertextualizing of <I>Ulysses</I>
has diminished the force of the book that exploded upon the cultural
stage in 1922, and has made our task a very different one. What those
earlier hostile critics were reporting on was <I>Ulysses</I>' otherness,
its refusal to be assimilated to existing cultural norms, its powerful
resistance to the most strenuous interpretative efforts. Many readers
quickly gave up; some, like Lewis, Jung, and West, worried away at it
even though they had at best very mixed views of what it was doing; and
some glimpsed through the intensity of their engagement a new future
for literature.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What Bersani is registering in his essay, on the other hand, for
all its echoing of earlier comments, is a problem that exists in the
present, thanks to the highly successful labors of the Joyce industry: an
excessively cosy relation between Joyce's text and the cultural envelope
within which it finds its meanings. Western culture, he comments, "dies
in the Joycean parody and pastiche, but, once removed from historical
time, it is resurrected as a timeless design. Far from contesting the
authority of culture, <I>Ulysses</I> reinvents our relation to Western
culture in terms of exegetical devotion, that is, as the exegesis of
<I>Ulysses</I> itself" (<I>CR</I>, 170). In elaborating his case,

<B></B>

Bersani contrasts <I>Ulysses</I> with Flaubert's <I>Bouvard et
P&eacute;cuchet</I> and with the writing of Samuel Beckett. Flaubert,
he writes (and the comment seems equally apt for Beckett), "erases our
cultural memory at the very moment he awakens it." For these writers,
"the textual act of quotation is simultaneously a disqualification of the
citational process" (<I>CR</I>, 163). The work of art "can only exist
in a continuous anxiety about its capacity to sustain itself, perhaps
even to begin itself" (<I>CR</I>, 163). For Joyce, however, "art is
by definition the transcendence of any such anxiety" (<I>CR</I>, 163);
Joyce's intertextuality functions not as an erasure of cultural memory
but as a principle of cultural continuity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I am not convinced that the <I>Ulysses</I> of 1922 <I>did</I> function as
a principle of cultural continuity; it was certainly not widely received
as such.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 But it may be that the <I>Ulysses</I> of 1999 does, that the work
 of exegesis and commentary, allusion-hunting and cross-referencing,
 theoretical and cultural placing, though it has inevitably failed to
 exhaust the text's difficulties, has succeeded only too well in disarming
 it of its alterity and finding a snug cultural home for it. No longer
 a challenge to the way we read and think, it has become a triumphal
 assertion of the scope and integrity of the culture of which it is one
 of the finest monuments. Where earlier readers grappled with page after
 dense page, a great deal of it incomprehensible, we turn to Thornton
 or Gifford, the <I>Bloomsday Book</I> or <I>The Chronicle of Leopold
 and Molly Bloom,</I> to ease our passage.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 It might be objected that we do not have to read <I>Ulysses</I> in
 this way, through the lens of reference books and exegetical texts, but
 there is certainly great pressure to do so; and there would be something
 disingenuous, as Bersani notes, about pretending they didn't exist.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If this account of what I have called the hypertextualized <I>Ulysses</I> is accurate, there is sufficient reason to turn our attention
elsewhere--not merely because it is grabbing the limelight and casting
other worthy books into darkness, but because its cultural supremacy,
and the scholarly efforts which reflect and promote that supremacy, have
turned it into a text that confirms us in our satisfied certainties
instead of one that startles and defies us and thus opens new avenues
for thought and pleasure. It now reassures us of our place in what might
otherwise seem a chaotic universe, or it provides a model of coherence
to take refuge in, a satisfying structure where the details all make
sense--or if they don't, we can be confident that one day they will,
thanks to the tireless efforts of a world-wide band of scholars. In so
doing, <I>Ulysses</I> works in concert with the globalizing tendencies of
international capital, which create a spurious sense of rich complexity
by reducing differences and distinctions. Even readers who are out of
sympathy with its non-linear, highly mediated narrative and stylistic
procedures, such as Bersani, respond to it not as a profound challenge
to their assumptions and beliefs but, thanks to the availability of
a mass of helpful criticism, as a dismissable intellectual exercise,
smugly sure of its honored place in the world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course this is only one possible outlook for <I>Ulysses</I>. In my
own writing on Joyce's work I have tried to preserve, or rather find
new ways of producing, its difficulty and strangeness, its resistance
to what is habitual and shallow in our cultural

<B></B>

practices, and a number of critics are continuing to work valuably in
this vein (although it must be said that there are now other texts and
other writers who lend themselves more fully to this type of project--one
of whom, as Bersani appreciates, is Beckett). The future may hold new
modes of response to Joyce which will transform his works into challenges
once more.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Criticism and literary history that, rather than focusing on Joyce,
 examines his work in the context of its time (including the context
 of Ireland's colonial subjection) may continue to throw up fresh and
 provocative insights. The very magnitude of the encyclopedic Joycean
 hypertext can itself be unsettling, as Derrida has remarked.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 And it may be possible to produce a hypermedia version of <I>Ulysses</I> that is anything but reassuring, and that revives, in new ways,
 the provocations and disturbances of the original publication. That
 there are (at least) two such projects in progress is all to the good,
 in reducing the risk of monumentality and in demonstrating, by the
 inevitable differences between the two productions, the contingency
 and incompleteness at work in even the most ambitious critical projects.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is another recent development that holds out the possibility of a
newly defamiliarized <I>Ulysses</I>, one that will challenge its readers
in ways that we cannot entirely foresee and that will truly belong to the
third millennium. If you open one of the many institutional and personal
sites devoted to Joyce on the World Wide Web, you enter a hyperspatial
network of Joycean links without anything like the packaged security of a
university press CD-ROM or DVD. Each of these sites gives you the option
of moving to several other sites, which in their turn present you with
further options for retrieving Joycean and para-, sub-, or extra-Joycean
material. This expanding universe of text, sound, and image may be the
closest we can now come to the Joycean spirit that animated the then
unimaginable excesses of the 1922 <I>Ulysses</I>. Just as those early
readers of Joyce's book found it impossible to conceptualize the work
as a whole, baffled by its unprecedented scale, its lack of an obvious
center, and its continuity with a range of nonliterary discourses,
so we encounter an ungraspable electronic text that is centerless and
borderless, constantly evolving in content and reach, and out of the
controlling hands of any single author or arranger. Add to this the
potential unreliability or irrelevance of any given piece of information
it offers, and its openness to the random, to chance and coincidence,
and you have a text that requires a reader--now too passive a term--who
is an ingenious, energetic participant in the creative process.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And we still have the challenge of <I>Finnegans Wake</I>, which
hardly needs the World Wide Web to make its readers into creative
participants. One can imagine Joyce, having just completed <I>Ulysses</I>,
foreseeing the day when it would no longer make almost impossible demands
on the reader and immediately setting to work on the book that would keep
us baffled into the next millennium. We have no shortage of reference
texts and guides to assist us with the <I>Wake,</I> but as anyone who
has wrestled with a single page knows, these leave unaddressed more
problems than they solve. This is not to deny the extremely valuable
work of exegesis that has helped make Joyce's last book more readable
than could have been imagined fifty years ago, nor the effects of

<B></B>

cultural developments--the tangle of aesthetic, critical, and political
conditions that we term "postmodernism"--that have rendered it less
freakishly isolated. The fact remains that the <I>Wake</I> is largely
unassimilated, and while it is widely respected it is not a major element
in the ranking that Joyce consistently achieves in the end-of-millennium
polls. The day when our exegetical and theoretical efforts are equal to
its demands will not dawn soon. If such a consummation ever were to be
achieved, our cultural map, as I have argued elsewhere, would have to
have been completely redrawn.

It is important to note, finally, that what I am saying in no way
implies that the reading or teaching of <I>Ulysses</I> should abate: new
readers, in or out of school, are much more likely to experience a text  akin to the one that was read in 1922 or 1961, in spite of the fact
that many of Joyce's technical innovations have now found their way into
the aesthetic practices of popular culture. It does imply, however, that
the best teachers are those who find ways to sustain the disruptive force
of <I>Ulysses</I> even while they do their necessary work of explaining
and demystifying. And this, surely, will still be true in 2999.

One reason for the relative absence of negative criticism of Joyce may
be the sheer difficulty of his work, which has made exegesis a dominant,
and lasting, critical mode. Richard Poirier notes that "there have been
far fewer persuasively critical than doggedly interpretive readers
of twentieth-century or modernist classics," and relates this to the
promotion of difficulty as a virtue in modernist writing, <I>The Renewal
of Literature</I> (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1988), 98.

were echoes of early Stalinist objections to the book's preoccupation

simpler rejoinders than Donoghue's trawl through Saussure, Deleuze and

In <I>The Renewal of Literature</I> Poirier argues, like Bersani, against
a notion that the reading of literature can be a source of cultural
renovation; but he adopts a very different attitude to the technical feats
of modernist writers, including Joyce. Of the latter he writes, "No one
more brazenly celebrates his own sheer capacity for what James called
'doing'" ; but this is in the context of a claim that the reading of
such works is "an activity by which with great difficulty we can become
conscious that any structure, technique, code, or system of signs is
likely to prove no more than extemporized and transient" . Poirier
is surely correct to insist that "it is not the substance but rather the
act of allusiveness or of schematization which should occupy the reader"

an advanced student or professional scholar, is no longer the vigorous,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This paper was written in response to two different and in their
ways equally vivid experiences. The first was an encounter with
a monotype by Degas in the Art Institute of Chicago, a work from
the mid-1880s, measuring approximately eight by sixteen inches (<A
HREF="6.3harrison_1.html"> 1</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 To make a monotype the artist normally draws in printing ink directly
 onto an unabsorbent surface, such as an unmarked engraving plate. The
 plate is then put through a press, transferring a single clear image
 directly onto paper. Since the image is unfixed, this process effectively
 erases it, though sometimes a sufficient residue of ink is left on
 the plate to permit a second and fainter impression to be made. Where
 Degas recovered a second impression in this manner he would frequently
 work over it in pastel, developing the motif substantially as he did
 so, sometimes adding paper to extend its margins and thus to enlarge
 the original pictorial space. He was to do just that with a second
 proof of the monotype from Chicago, adding strips of paper at top and
 bottom to make a nearly square overall image, in the process locating
 the represented re at a more conventional distance from the picture
 plane, and thus transforming the effect of the composition. It is with
 the first and unaltered impression that I am principally concerned,
 however, since its very containment and darkness are crucial to its
 individuality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this case Degas worked in negative, covering the entire plate with a
film of ink, then scraping, wiping and dabbing at the oily surface to
produce an image. This image takes a moment to discern, as if we had
to adjust our eyes to the darkness before it will come clear. What it
shows is the nude body of a woman, reclining on a couch with her right
elbow and forearm

<B></B>

 close up to the picture plane at its lower edge, her raised left
knee breaking the picture's upper edge, and her legs extending into the
deepest part of the pictorial space at the top right-hand corner. At
the lower left corner a circular area has been wiped clean of ink to
signify a table lamp. This forms the picture's only light source. The
re's head is particularly difficult to make out. This difficulty may
be partly accounted for by the dazzling effect of the lamp, but there
is also a suggestion that the head is as it were too close--too nearly
identified with the picture plane itself--to bring properly into focus. It
was this suggestion in particular that brought me up short when I first
saw the monotype a few years ago. When combined with the literal and
rative darkness of the image, the effect was of something analogous
to a failure or deprivation of the sense of sight. My first motive for
this paper, then, was to explore and to explain that sense of failure
or deprivation. I shall take a long way round in the attempt to do so,
but I shall come back to the monotype in the end.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is one last point I should make in introducing the image in
question. As if to underline the uniqueness of the impression, the artist
marked it not simply with a signature but with a dedication, "Degas
&agrave; Burty." Philippe Burty was a writer sympathetic to the work of
the Impressionists and a major collector of modern prints, Degas' very
much included. This was not a work conceived for exhibition, then. It was
a gift to a male friend, as were three other related monotypes showing
nude female res, each of which is named for a different recipient.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 In the climate of art history and art criticism that now surrounds the
 work of Degas there is an uncomfortable implication to be drawn from
 these dedications. It is best that

<B></B>

we face it squarely. It concerns the meaning of the work's privacy. The
almost inescapable suggestion is that images such as this circulated
outside any public view precisely because their combination of artistry
with indecency destined them for the secluded enjoyment of men of a
certain sophistication. In other words, the intended function of the
monotype was to supply an expensive taste for erotica. I mean in the
end to argue against this view, but its apparent plausibility should
nevertheless be faced when we consider how the effects of the image are
in fact produced. If left unacknowledged, assumptions about the functions
of works of art are all the more likely to inflect inquiries into their
composition. Possessed of an unexamined certainty that a given work was
designed to serve the interests of fantasy, we are less likely to look
for the kinds of effect that might produce a realistic self-consciousness
in the spectator.

This takes me to the second experience by which this paper
was prompted--in this case the effect produced by a body of
interpretation. Over the course of the past twenty years or so, Degas'
pictures of women have been subject to extensive re-examination in the
light of a wider feminist re-reading of modern art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 It is through the initiative of feminist art historians in particular
 that the viewer's psychoanalysable response to the individual work of art
 has come to be accorded a deciding role in inquiries into its meaning
 and even into its value. And since it is a fundamental assumption
 of psychoanalysis that we must respond differently according to the
 differences in our gendering, it follows that considerations of the
 relativities of gender must play a large part in such inquiries. So
 long as differences of gender were <I>not</I> held to be of any
 account in the interpretation of art, it could be assumed that it was
 differences of opportunity or disposition alone that stood in the way
 of an equal enjoyment of images such as Degas' pictures of bathers
 (<A HREF="6.3harrison_2.html"> 2</A>). To analyze an artistic
 composition was traditionally to show how these differences might be
 overcome in principle; that is to say, it was to elucidate a structure
 of effects that were conceived of as aesthetic, and thus as potentially
 open to experience by all. In the memorable words of Clive Bell, "To
 appreciate fully a work of art we require nothing but sensibility. To
 those that can hear Art speaks for itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 As so often, however, it transpired that the illusion of universal
 agreement was simply a consequence of women's voices being silenced or
 going unheard. Nowadays, where the analysis of effects is at issue, a
 vigilant feminism encourages us to ask "effects upon whom?" And once
 that question has been asked we can no longer take it for granted that
 the pleasures art has to offer <I>are</I> potentially pleasures for
 all. Claims for objectivity in aesthetic judgement have of course been
 troubled since the nineteenth century by reflections on the effects of
 cultural difference and by the findings of class analysis. But it is
 one thing to acknowledge the significance of cultural familiarity or
 the relative advantages of education, class, money and leisure when it
 comes to the appreciation of art; it is quite another to say of a work
 of art that its responding spectator is <I>necessarily</I> male.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This point has been well rehearsed in readings of late-nineteenth century
French painting. It takes an emphatic form in the recent literature on
Degas' bathers, occasioned

<B></B>

 as this has been by a series of major exhibitions in which these works
 have featured.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Heather Dawkins, for instance, describes one of her several papers on
 the artist as "a study that negotiates my displeasure in studying an
 artistically heterosexual drive."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 In the view of a second writer this drive is both prurient and
 punitive. What Anthea Callen regards as the artist's "tortured twisting
 and dislocation of female anatomy," suggests to her "not only the pain
 of shame but its punishment." The shame is the shame occasioned by
 men's prostitution of women, the punishment women's reward for serving
 as the objects of men's desire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Griselda Pollock proceeds further along similar lines. "As a woman
 viewer," she writes, "I am forced to take up the proffered sadistic
 masculine position and symbolically enact the violence of Degas'
 representations, or identify masochistically with the bizarrely posed
 and cruelly drawn bodies"--bodies "which in social exchange he debased
 and abused, and which in aesthetic practice he punished and tortured."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was the experience of these voices--voices speaking in virtual
unison--that provided the second prompting for this paper. The coincidence
of these two promptings is clearly problematic. At the least I am bound
to reflect on the nature of my fascination with the monotype and on the
pleasure I generally take in Degas' pictures of women. Analyses such
as those I have cited are not to be swept aside either by reference to
the artist's incorrigible genius, or because they threaten men's sense
of themselves as civilized beings. On the other hand if we are honest
about our responses to works of art we must acknowledge that we can't
just haul them into line with some supposedly virtuous position. We
can't just like what we may think we  ought to

<B></B>

like. In this particular case, I find myself drawn involuntarily into a
game of high stakes. It is not simply that I have been happy to accept
Degas as a significant re within the modern period. He appears to me
now as one of the principal artists of the entire Western tradition. Of
course, this would be no problem if the man who painted could be kept
safely apart from the man who lived an examinable social and moral
life--if we could say that ethics has nothing to do with aesthetics;
that Degas' pictures could be the over-determined products of an abusive
and sado-masochistic obsession and nevertheless be admirable. There are
indeed those who believe that the matter of an artist's social conduct is
irrelevant to his artistic practice--and by extension, presumably, that
the personal predilections of the spectator play no part in a properly
"aesthetic" response. Unfortunately I am not one of these. I have to allow
that if the writers I have quoted are justified in their reading of Degas'
work, then my liking for it must be an incidence of bad taste--evidence,
in other words, of deficiency or failure of the critical imagination.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So I propose to look again at Degas in the light of the feminist
case. I should make clear that my primary aim in doing so is not to
claim a position in academic debates on his work, but rather to respond
to an implied critique of those such as myself who esteem his images
as pleasurable, and to re-examine the grounds of that esteem and that
pleasure. There are two connected charges which it seems that the work
in question must be made to answer. The first is that it is implicated
in processes of prostitution; the second that its effect is to leave
its viewers caught between a sadistic voyeurism and a masochistic empathy.

I should first establish some undisputed common ground. The broadly
feminist account of late-nineteenth century French painting is clearly
justified in two important respects. The first is in drawing attention
to the tendency for pictorial compositions to be oriented towards
an imagined male spectator. The second is in alerting us to the fact
that the question of how women look and are looked at is a significant
concern in rative art during the period. In fact I think that these
two points can be brought together to construct a stronger claim than is
generally made by feminist art history itself. It is this: that during
the first period of development of modernism in painting--say in the
fifty years between 1860 and 1910--the matter of how women look was an
issue so central to work done by male artists that it was decisive for
the character of that development.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 So far as art is concerned, there seems little point in talking about
 development at all unless what we are addressing are changes in the
 criteria of aesthetic success and failure. The implication of the
 claim, then, is that the question of how women look was a matter of
 such moment to the early modern practice of painting as somehow to bear
 upon the aesthetic merit of any relevant work. Of course this is not a
 hypothesis that anyone should be asked to accept without considerable
 elaboration. In particular we need to know just <I>how</I> it is that
 the success of the artist's work is affected and decided. And before
 we can properly address that question we need a clearer sense of just
 what it is that is supposed to be doing the affecting; what it is, in
 other words, that is included in the question of "how women look." These
 issues are best understood by reference to examples. Suppose, for

<B></B>

instance, that one was asked to decide on aesthetic grounds between
Degas' <I>Combing the Hair  </I>in the National Gallery, London,
and Luke Fildes' near-contemporary <I>An Al-fresco Toilette</I> in the
Lady Lever Art Gallery (. <A HREF="6.3harrison_3.html">3</A> and <A HREF="6.3harrison_4.html">4</A>). What kinds of difference in
observation, imagination and composition might one have to take into
account in explaining one's judgement?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is clearly an ambiguity at the heart of this matter. It revolves
around the passive and active senses of looking. To ask how women look
is to consider both what women look like and what it is like for women
to look. This ambiguity is so firmly built into our language that it is
hard to dislodge. In our ordinary social experience there is a typical
moment upon which the resulting confusion bears down to vivid effect. It
is the moment at which the one looked at looks back; when someone is
<I>caught looking</I>. The resulting exchange is one with potentially
infinite social and psychological content. One's gender, one's sexuality,
one's age, one's class, one's race, one's relative financial power--all
these are at play and at stake. And what typically happens is that the
relations in question are resolved in an instant, leaving one or other
party relatively empowered, one or other looking away.

Moments with infinite content are meat and drink to the art of
painting. In the 1860s and 1870s the exchange of glances becomes of all
painting's potential themes the one most diagnostic of its modernity
(if not of its modernism). Both the ambiguity and the vividness of such
exchanges are clearly caught in a number of memorable and canonical
images. The women in Manet's <I>Olympia</I> (<A HREF="6.3harrison_5.html"> 5</A>) and Renoir's
<I>La Loge</I> (<A HREF="6.3harrison_6.html"> 6</A>) are carefully described as the bearers of a
specific self-consciousness. And in each case we are instructed by the
organization of the composition to furnish an appropriate cause. The look
of the women will only make sense, that is to say, when we see them as
appearing under the regard of an imagined male. And it will be a matter
critical to the effect of the painting in question whether or not this
regard is seen as returned, and how the relative powers are then seen
as distributed. Of course, it tells us nothing we don't already know
about social and sexual  relations in nineteenth-century France to
observe that the female party in any actual exchange was generally the
one obliged to look away, or that the woman who failed to do so was in
danger of being deemed immodest. But we should not assume that the art of
painting will conform straightforwardly to the kinds of generalization
that may be supported through social and historical research. The
production of modern aesthetic effects may depend on modes of critical
self-consciousness which are opaque to such researches precisely to the
extent that their causes are private, inescapable,

<B> [Begin Page 65]</B>

and thus realistic. In fact the ability to bring some social and
psychological complexity to the exchange of glances is a noticeable
measure of modernity in relevant paintings from the mid-1860s until at
least the end of the century.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It should be clear that this was not simply a matter of differences
in subject matter; of picturing one type of woman or one social
situation rather than another. The more significant differences were
compositional. That is to say they were differences in the means by which
the spectator's imaginative activity was stimulated and structured by the
painting. There is an important implication here. If it is true that a
preoccupation with how women look bears down in some general way on the
development of painting as a medium in the later nineteenth century, then
certain technical changes noticeable in paintings which are pictures of
women are of relevance to the evaluation of modern painting in general,
whether or not women are pictured.

These are difficult issues to grasp in the abstract. They may be best
considered through a relevant comparison. I am as certain as I can be
that Auguste de Molins' painting <I>The Coming Storm,</I> which appeared
on the London art market in the mid 1980s, is the work exhibited in Paris
in 1874 in the first independent exhibition of the group that was to be
known as the Impressionists (<A HREF="6.3harrison_7.html"> 7</A>). The title was listed in English
in the original catalogue.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The artist was one of that cohort of relatively conservative independents
 that art history has for

<B></B>

the most part forgotten. The paradigm spectator to whom the painting
caters is someone practiced in the relatively unsophisticated business
of seeing the joke, which here concerns the relationship between
the weather conditions described in the background and the trio of
res isolated in the foreground, each of whom represents a type
easily enough exemplified in the 1870s both in literary fiction and on
the actual streets of Paris: the colorless ranks of the bourgeoisie at
the hour of promenade; the publicly respectable and privately lecherous
gentleman; the interloper in whom the identities of decadent artistocrat
and aspiring plutocrat are purposefully confused; and, crucially, the
enticing re of the well-dressed woman in whose image another confusion
is strategically maintained--those of the fashionable bourgeoise and
the glamorous prostitute. The respectable gentleman is about to lose
the game the picture plays out. It is coming on to rain and he has no
umbrella. The woman has only a parasol. The picture implies that she is
open to offers. The interloper has a waiting carriage with a hood, and
thus a decisive advantage, as he clearly knows. He is going to get the
woman, though he may not know what woman it is that he will actually
be getting. To the small delight of its prospective consumer, the
painting plays upon topical themes of sexual opportunity and of social
and economic competition, of prospective conquest versus on the one hand
and of jealousy and affront on the other. Pleasure, for this consumer,
lies in observing the human comedy from a position safely this side of
its surface.

Also contributing to the same independent exhibition was the now
better known painter Auguste Renoir. The work called <I>Les Parapluies</I> was begun some years after that exhibition, and my guess is that it
was prompted in part by a memory of de Molins' work, conscious or not
(<A HREF="6.3harrison_8.html"> 8</A>). For what Renoir has done is to take something very close to the
same topical theme and to modernize it. As in the earlier painting, rain
is falling at the hour of promenade. The well-dressed working girl at the
left of the picture appears to be the object of speculative attention
from the gentleman behind her, who in this case is equipped with an
umbrella, as the girl is not. Where, then, is the second gentleman, whose
presence is required in order to bring an animating tension and urgency
to the pictorial drama? The answer, of course, is that his position must
be occupied by the imaginary spectator, who thus becomes what Richard
Wollheim has called the "spectator in the picture."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 It is he who is seeing what the picture shows.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For the sake of my argument, there are two particular points to note;
the first is that the presence of this spectator is cued or required
not only by the curious outward stare of the little girl at the right
of the painting, nor simply by the angle of vision to which the entire
composition submits, but more poignantly by the carefully described
self-consciousness of the woman in question, around which the effects
of the painting are thus made to revolve. The second point is that
these effects are of no real account unless they construct an answering
and thus implicated self-consciousness as it were on this side of the
picture plane.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Renoir has sophisticated the mode of reference to the topical theme
 of sexual speculation by rendering the spectator both an imaginary
 occupant of the social world described, and an active imaginative
 agent in its conduct. He has managed this by taking the narrative
 components out of the fictional depth of the pictorial space, where
 de Molins has them safely embedded, and redefining them as features of
 the spectator's social and psychological world. To become a competent
 spectator of Renoir's painting, then, one begins by occupying this
 world in imagination as someone disposed and equipped in the precise
 terms that the work itself defines. This means that one occupies it as a
 man--a fl&acirc;neur perhaps--whatever may be one's actual gender. But
 if someone is to argue that the effect of this is to privilege the
 male spectator, I would ask them who will find it hardest to occupy
 the fl&acirc;neur's position: the well-read middle-class woman, or
 the iconoclastic working-class male? Note that Renoir offers no guide
 to the outcome of the exchange of glances, nor any judgement upon its
 ethical character. What he does is to define with consummate pictorial
 skill the specific character of that "moment with infinite content."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was fashionable a few years back to condemn Renoir as a kind of male
chauvinist. Much was done to draw attention to the implicit gendering
of the spectator and to the regressive attitudes to women discovered
in such pictures as this. We need to be careful, however. In art as in
literature it often turns out that the painting or the text has got there
before us, and that that which we think we have exposed in it was always
a part of the content which it had taken into itself and reflected back
in critical form, had we only been assiduous enough readers to notice. It
is one thing--

<B></B>

proper to all critical activity--to revise the bases upon which we make
our judgements and accordingly to review the objects of traditional
admiration. But we need to be sure that any naivety we think we have
discovered in the works in question was not actually our own. The
admonishing finger we point at the moral life of the artist may
otherwise miss the target of the work by a distance that must in the
end be embarrassing to ourselves. The moral character of the producer
may indeed determine the aesthetic character of the production, but it
will not necessarily do so in ways conforming to our own self-images as
moral beings. Renoir might well have fallen short of our contemporary
notions of correctness in sexual relations. But if his painting pictures
the exploitable female as a potential object of consumption, it also
allows us to experience in imagination what it is like both to look
<I>and to be looked at</I> like this. It is thus edifying irrespective
of the gender we actually inhabit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though the two paintings here compared are indeed paintings that
include pictures of women, what the comparison crucially reveals is a
revision in the priorities according to which the surfaces of paintings
are conceptualized and developed. In other words, if the forms of
self-consciousness involved in the development of a modern art are
indeed largely learned and practiced in paintings that are pictures of
women, once the relevant changes are effected they become conditions
of modernism and of aesthetic adequacy in painting as a whole. Beyond
a certain point, in other words, it becomes impossible for a painting
if it is to be modern to evade the issue of who it is that the pictured
world is supposedly being seen by, and how it is that it is therefore
being seen. Indeed, I would suggest that by the 1870s the modernity of
a painting's composition could be recognized in the following terms:
that it was so ordered and distinguished as to pose the question, "Who
is supposed to be seeing what this picture shows?" and to do so as a
necessary part of its effect. Of

<B></B>

course, to say that this was a question <I>raised</I> by the typical
modern painting is not to say that it was a question to which all
spectators necessarily responded.

It's time to return to Degas. His painting <I>Au Caf&eacute;</I> (also
known as <I>L'Absinthe</I>) was painted in the late 1870s (<A HREF="6.3harrison_9.html"> 9</A>). Its
evident focus is upon a woman sitting alone at a caf&eacute; table--or
at least we take her to be alone, her isolation being suggested by
the palpable absence of any sense of contact with her neighbor at
the table. Viewed thus the picture can be seen as testifying to that
documentary interest that the patrician realist maintains in the lives
of those beneath him. As the supposed author of such a picture, Degas
stands as it were outside its world looking in. This was the Degas whom
many of his contemporaries likened to the misanthropic scientist, whose
disengagement from the human tragi-comedy ensures the dispassionateness
of his findings. Of course, it was with regard to his pastels of women
bathing that this combination of misanthropy with disengagement was
particularly observed. These are pictures of prostitutes, it was assumed,
since only a prostitute would allow herself to be shown in the process of
intimate ablution. Poverty and prostitution are degrading, so the argument
went. Furthermore, the woman whose business is the arousal of men is no
better than an animal. It follows that the ugliness and bestiality of the
women is a guarantee of the accuracy--the truth--of the artist's vision.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 To be outside looking in is also to be in the position of the voyeur; of
 the man, that is to say, who consumes the appearances of others from a
 distance that ensures his own safety. Thus the late-nineteenth-century
 reading of Degas the misanthropic realist prepares the ground for
 the late-twentieth-century reading of Degas the abusive and sadistic
 voyeur. The advocates of the latter are the natural heirs of the
 proponents of the former. In the first case, the ugliness of the women is
 attributed to the brutalizing effects of their existence and the animal
 nature of their trade; in the second, it is attributed to the sadistic
 operations performed by the artist upon their bodies. But in both cases
 it is the (mis)perceived ugliness of the women that produces the reading.

We may gain a better understanding of Degas' picture if we set beside it
another in the same vein--or in what Fernand Lungren, who painted it, no
doubt thought of as the same vein (<A HREF="6.3harrison_0.html"> 10</A>). The contrast serves to draw
attention to those formal and technical properties of Degas' work which
may go unremarked even as its ostensible subject is noted. Lungren's
picture has an emphatically conventional viewpoint and perspective, its
tables ranged neatly parallel to the picture plane. The effect is to
locate an imagined viewer at a socially and psychologically normative
distance from its represented subject--just where we might expect to
find the male this female's presence invites. What the comparison makes
clear is that the organization of Degas' picture actually presupposes
a viewpoint virtually within the picture plane, which its nearest
table intersects. The angle of vision is oblique, the perspective
unsettled. Where Lungren's picture is painted with a consistently sharp
focus, Degas learns a lesson from photography and employs change of focus
as a compositional device; sharp on the features of the woman, so blurred
on the objects near at hand that their identities are in doubt. And once
that difference of focus has registered in relation

<B></B>

to the viewpoint, the sense of a viewing position outside the represented
scene collapses totally. It transpires that the position of the imaginary
viewer is as inescapably located within the world depicted as is the woman
herself. In which case, what price the supposed distance between viewer
and viewed? We are now in a better position to appreciate the apparently
intrusive and ambiguous shapes with which the foreground of Degas'
picture is populated. They are indefinite because they are found at the
margins of the imagined spectator's consciousness, where newspapers and
matches would be for someone looking up and across the caf&eacute;. Their
function is both to define that consciousness and to locate it. Degas'
educated contemporaries placed themselves outside the world of the
picture because they could imagine themselves nowhere else. But that
is not where the picture places its own imagined spectator. This latter
spectator is the product of the painter's artifice. To the question, "Who
is seeing this?" the painting's actual spectator answers unthinkingly,
"I am." Yet it would actually be nearer to the truth of the painting to
say, "She is." In other words, the imagined viewer occupies a position
which is far closer to that of the pictured woman than it is to that
normally assumed by the fascinated or condescending bourgeois male.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If we want to explore the implications of Degas' work, we could do worse
than to look to the younger artists who worked

<B></B>

under his shadow. During his so-called Blue period, the young Picasso in
particular produced a number of perceptive paraphrases of Degas' inquiries
into the nature of looking and representing (I think particularly of the
damaged <I>Portrait of a Man</I> from the winter of 1902-03, now in
the Mus&eacute;e Picasso in Paris). "Who is this and who am I?" he seems
to ask with regard to the res he paints, but also "What is it to be
an artist? Does my vocation keep me apart from these others, so that
I remain in my world, regarding the evidence of their poverty with an
interest which is academic, touristic, voyeuristic. Or are artists fellow
denizens of Bohemia? Could such images show how I too am seen? Are they
really forms of self-portraiture that I am painting, so that the demand
these pictures will in the end make of their spectators is that each
realigns his or her self-consciousness with the image I am describing?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is one last point to be extracted from the example of the woman in
the caf&eacute;. What we have done is to put the various elements of the
composition in place as means not simply to define a woman in a certain
situation, but more tellingly to identify the represented moment with
another imaginary consciousness--the consciousness of someone also present
at that moment. Yet of course, this sense of the woman as <I>seen</I> and
experienced serves both to qualify and to deepen our sense of her. In
the end the apparently arbitrary detail in the foreground of Degas'
picture proves indispensable to the poignancy of the image. But what if
we had viewed this detail from the point-of-view of a more conventional
representation? For instance, imagine what would happen were we to
insinuate into Lungren's picture a device like the newspaper invading
Degas' composition from its left-hand edge. The effect, I suspect, would
be one of dissonance and dislocation. Lungren's composition speaks to a
kind of naturalistic mind-set in which such disruptive pictorial events
have no place.

Viewed from within just such a mind-set, Degas' portrait of Carlo
Pellegrini shows a picture of a man so cruelly tortured and monstrously
distorted that his left foot grows directly out of his right shin
(<A HREF="6.3harrison_1.html"> 11</A>). Of course, it is actually nothing of the sort. Carlo Pellegrini
happened to be a very small man. The conventional means of making a man
look small would be to show him in relation to something measurable, like
a doorway. Degas does something different: he shows how Pellegrini might
look to a man of normal height standing beside him. Such a person would
be looking down at a steep angle, the ground plane would appear sharply
inclined, and the small man's feet would appear placed as they do in the
picture. By this means the property of smallness is attributed by the
viewer to Pellegrini and becomes as it were his pictorial possession--a
possession he is allowed to carry with a certain style. But a considerable
risk is taken in the process, for the extraordinary profile that Degas
creates around his re is not one we can easily confirm by reference
to our ordinary perceptions. It is a significant difference between
quotidian sight and artistic representation that the mind tends to
adjust for angle of vision even before such effects are registered, so
that images such as this remain as it were unseen. The risk, then, is
that we will fail to trust the picture's interest in its subject; that
we will accordingly refuse to follow the imaginative instructions of
the composition, and that we will insist on seeing the image literally,
which is to say as distorted. (His readiness to take such risks is a
factor serving significantly to distinguish Degas' drawing not only from

<B></B>

the academic practice of the time but also from the work of all his
avant-garde contemporaries with the exception of C&eacute;zanne.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It may help to make clear the direction of my argument if I recapitulate
the points these various examples are intended to convey. First I
have proposed that the question of how women look is central to the
development of modern painting. Second I have proposed that this
question is typically addressed not simply through the picturing of
women, but more significantly through the evocation of complex states
of self-consciousness on the part of an imaginary viewer. Third, I have
intended to show that if the actual spectator is to gain imaginative
access to these states it will not be enough just to see what the picture
depicts. What will be required is response to the work of art in its
entirety, and particularly to its composition and technique. It is
only once the purposes of composition and technique have been properly
taken into account, I suggest, that we can safely speak of distortion
and dislocation, let alone read in motives for such distortions as we
may observe. Fourth, then, if the case against Degas is to rest upon
the supposed distortions practiced upon women in his pictures, the
very least we should ask of those making the case is that they be well
guarded against the dangers of literalism in their readings of pictures
(that they are

<B></B>

not art history's equivalents for Mr Partridge at the performance
of <I>Hamlet</I><B>:</B> unable, for the purposes of criticism, to
distinguish between naturalistic reactions and the effects of artifice).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 We need to be sure, for instance, that they are not imposing as
 conditions of psychological hygiene what are in fact no more than the
 normal habits of vision, entrenched as these tend to be in conservative
 canons of pictorial naturalism. In Degas' work, in particular, it is
 through the very <I>disruption</I> of conventions of naturalism that
 pictured res are endowed with imaginary life and individuality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The suggestion to which I have been leading, then, is this. Where Degas'
contemporaries saw the realistic observation of degradation, and where
some of our own contemporaries see the abusive vision of the sadist,
there may actually be something at work in Degas' mature pictures that
is stranger than either; something indicated primarily by the highly
idiosyncratic nature of their drawing and their compositions. They
are driven, I think, by a curiosity which is neither academic nor
self-preserving. "What is it like?" they ask, "What is it like to look
like this?" I will acknowledge that there is nothing in the early
critical commentary on Degas' work that I can use in direct support
of this suggestion. But then we have little reason to suppose that the
literate bourgeois male of the time would have been likely to entertain
such a question in front of a picture of a woman. And it is a part of
the burden of my thesis that Degas' work was highly exceptional.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I turn now more directly to the subject of Degas' nudes and to the
question of their implication in the prostitution of women, and more
explicitly the relationship between those works that are quite clearly
identifiable as scenes from the brothel and those that show individual
women washing, bathing, toweling themselves, brushing their hair and
getting into bed. The relationship between these two sets of works is
a matter for open inquiry. According to one view they are categorically
distinct.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Thus we might regard the brothel scenes as restricted to works produced
 as monotypes and on a small scale, none of which was publicly exhibited
 in Degas' lifetime (at least so far as can be established from the
 available evidence). And we might place in an entirely separate
 category those works that show single res in apparently private
 settings. These were for the most part executed in large format in
 pastel, and some of the earliest of them were publicly displayed at
 the Eighth Impressionist Exhibition in 1886. According to another
 point of view, however, the two sets of work overlap and are mutually
 implicated. For writers of this persuasion, the technical distinction
 between monotypes and pastels is not to be fudged into a distinction
 between prostitutes and honest women. The intimate subjects of the
 pastels are not such as Degas could have studied in the decorous
 confines of a bourgeois home, or even in a studio conducted according
 to the decorum of the time. In order to gain a pictorial access to the
 life they represent, so the argument goes, he either paid prostitutes
 to pose for him, or effectively prostituted his models, which amounts
 to the same thing.

 These, I take it, would be among  the forms of abusive and debasing
 social exchange to which Griselda Pollock refers.

We can deal first with the more clear-cut cases. Several of the extant
monotypes are clearly based on observations made in brothels. The largest
of them is little more

<B> [Begin Page 75]</B>

than two feet square, the majority only six or eight inches across. They
show women waiting in the salon, greeting potential customers (<A HREF="6.3harrison_2.html"> 12</A>),
partying for the benefit of clients, offering themselves for sex, and in
a few cases actually engaged in sex, though it is sex of a thoroughly
desultory sort. Some show women washing or dressing their hair while
clients watch, thus encouraging a reading of the larger pastels as
representations of sights seen by voyeurs (<A HREF="6.3harrison_3.html"> 13</A>). The prostitutes are
for the most part drawn with the conventional appurtenances of sexual
prettiness--long hair, stockings, ribbons around their throats--but they
are neither posed nor represented as beauties. Indeed, they are not posed
at all. These are rapidly executed monotypes, we should remember, not
studied studio drawings. Some of the women are characterized as tired,
worn and middle-aged. When we consider modern art's inquiry into the
matter of how women look, then, these images too are to be taken into
account (<A HREF="6.3harrison_4.html"> 14</A>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As for the men, they could hardly be said to profit by the comparison. As
Degas shows them they are for the most part ugly, aging, balding and
uncomfortably overdressed, and they are always absurd. It is all much as
one might expect. Yet it is easy to understand that such pictures could
not have been publicly shown in the later nineteenth century. They would

<B></B>

presumably have been condemned as obscene. They are not obscene,
however. What they are is both more matter-of-fact and more richly
steeped in the materials of irony than any public discourse on sexual
morality is ever allowed to be. Technically they combine decorative
vitality with an incisiveness of observation that continually skirts the
margins of caricature. But whatever they are, they are not scenarios that
Degas was responsible for inventing. Nor are they pictures of distorted
women. Indeed, I can see nothing in Degas' drawing of these res
to justify the suggestion that he was involved in the degradation and
abuse of the women they depict. Rather these images seem refreshingly
resistant to the easy assumption that prostitution is just one thing,
making just one kind of stain on the social tableau, a prostitute just
one kind of person engaged in just one form of activity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 As Norma Broude has noted, if Degas was not himself a feminist,
 there were those among his acquaintances who were. One of these, Diego
 Martelli, was actively engaged in campaigning both for the liberalization
 of laws by which prostitutes were persecuted, and, more tellingly, for
 recognition of the extent to which women in general were effectively
 prostituted by marriage.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Martelli lived for thirty years with a woman he had met in a brothel. His
 picture by Degas hangs in Edinburgh. We look in vain for signs of the
 sitter's shame or the artist's disapproval.

Before we leave the brothel scenes there is one point worthy of
note. A few of them show women relaxing in what appear to be off-duty
moments. But either the women appear in twos and threes, or if alone
they are represented in such a way as to assume a viewpoint directed
upon them. In none of the brothel scenes, in other words, is a woman
shown to be the sole occupant of her own space. What Degas' pictures

<B></B>

make clear is that whatever the prostitutes are doing in them, even
if they are literally doing nothing, they are always and everywhere
available to be looked at (<A HREF="6.3harrison_5.html"> 15</A>).

The pastels are for the most part much larger. In some of them the res
are almost life-size. Yet these res are generally set much closer to
the picture plane, they occupy far more of the total represented space
and, crucially, they tend not to be prefaced by the kinds of situational
cues by means of which the position of an imaginary spectator would
normally be established. I should try to make clearer just what I mean. In
the <I>Dancer in her Dressing Room</I> in Winterthur the half-open door
at the right serves to define a position outside looking in, and thus to
render the dancer the explicit object of an interested regard--very much
the same kind of regard, in fact, as that to which the single res of
prostitutes are subject in their moments of quasi-isolation (<A HREF="6.3harrison_6.html"> 16</A>). We
might go so far as to say that it is not so much the dancer herself as
the experience of seeing her that the picture is concerned with. If we
now compare the <I>Bather with a Towel</I> from the Metropolitan Museum
in New York I think we will find it much harder to separate sensation
of the re from the re seen (<A HREF="6.3harrison_7.html"> 17</A>). There is no cued external
position  to help us prize the two apart. Unlike the door, the
towel attaches to the woman's torso; it remains, as it were, a condition
of the body's imagined sensation of its own surface. In fact the more
we look at the pastels of bathing women the clearer this difference
becomes. All those pictorial furnishings and foreground devices that
normally serve to orient the spectator relative to the pictured re
are here made to serve a quite different end: they function, in fact, to
suggest, to define and to qualify the sensuous self-absorption of the
represented re. Thus, in the large pastel in the National Gallery,
London (<A HREF="6.3harrison_2.html"> 2</A>), as in the related picture in the Courtauld Institute,
the ensembles of re, towels,

<B>[End Page 77 Begin Page 79]</B>

and tub chair constitute an enclosed and self-sufficient tactile
world. Similarly, in each of the long series of drawings of a woman
bending to dry her feet, the position of her buttocks relative to the
rim of the bath is established with minute care, as if the vitality of
the re as a whole were assured by the sensation of their contact
(<A HREF="6.3harrison_8.html"> 18</A>).

I will try to be explicit in the conclusion I draw from these various
observations. In the matter of how women look, there was no equal
distribution of powers in Degas' day. This inequality was exploited in
a great deal of painting produced in the later nineteenth century, much
of it trivially meretricious, some of it seriously absurd.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 In the work of a few remarkable artists, however, the inequality
 was acknowledged and its conditions laid open to imaginative
 reconstruction. In the work of Manet and Degas it was made clear that
 the exchange of glances was never an exchange conducted on level terms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Each in his own way worked to imagine and to represent what it must
 be like always to be looked at. Each in his own way questioned that
 hypocritical system of thought according to which a prostitute could not
 be allowed to be attractive (<A HREF="6.3harrison_9.html"> 19</A>). Each, in allowing the represented
 prostitute to appear human, offered the actual male viewer an image of
 himself as the imaginary abuser.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 But Degas, I think, went further. The evidence is there in the
 pictures if we can only read them on their own terms. I will make
 my point in the form of a question. Given the conditions we have
 been considering--conditions in which the look of women was an issue
 bearing crucially upon the success or failure of a painting--what if an
 artist took it in mind to paint a woman who was <I>not</I> being looked
 at? A woman, that is to say, who was allowed to be the unselfconscious
 possessor of her own space, her own body? How might he go about it? Of
 course the enterprise would be deeply paradoxical and ambivalent, since
 the end result must always be a visible image. But it might be possible,
 at least, to counter the presupposition of the eternal male spectator
 in the picture; to fill his conventional place with other stuff; to
 summon up whatever normally served to indicate his presence and to
 replace it; even, if necessary, to employ a chaperone to displace him.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 But what would first and foremost have to be achieved is an almost
 unprecedented act of imagination enacted by means of a highly practiced
 technique. There could be no effective dislocation of the spectator
 unless the pictured woman were shown--albeit quasi-metaphorically--to
 be in possession of herself<B>;</B> unless her self-absorption could
 be convincingly rendered.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This rendering would require two distinctive forms of competence. Firstly,
it would require knowledge--knowledge sufficient to produce a realistic
re in the absence of that re's supposed referent in the actual
world. And how could such knowledge be gained without an apparently
obsessive working and reworking of the body's real  appearance? It
is highly significant in this respect that the great majority of Degas'
finished pastels of women are complex variations on life studies or
photographs, often derived from successive tracings. That is to say,
they are made from other pictures, not directly from posed models.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Secondly, it would require that the literal surface of the picture be
 endowed with extraordinary metaphorical potential--the potential to
 evoke another's bodily sensation. It was to this end, I think, that
 Degas so busily animated the surfaces of his pastels. It mattered less
 that they should

<B></B>

capture the naturalistic conrations of the body than that they
should convey that body's radiant warmth, its tension and relaxation,
its balance or stability, its own responsiveness to texture and to touch.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is a supreme and ghastly irony that when these works were first
exhibited the commentators for the most part read their surfaces
literally. What they saw was the labored texture. They saw it as blotchy
skin--"the streetwalker's  modern, swollen, pasty flesh," to quote
one writer on the Impressionist Exhibition of 1886.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was the same, of course, with the reading of the res' poses. What
the viewers saw was res in poses they were unable to recognize as
natural. They thus interpreted the res as ugly and explained their
ugliness as the sign of prostitution. In fact the reason the viewers
were unable to see the women as ordinary was not that their poses
were unnatural in the sense of having no straightforward biological or
aesthetic justification; it was because they failed to conform to the
conventional means of organizing women into pictures. Of course, this
was precisely the point. How is a woman to be shown <I>in art</I> as if
she were alone and not being seen? The answer is that she must be shown
as not <I>arranged</I> to be seen, not displayed, not

<B></B>

already aestheticised--she must appear, in fact, as if not posed. Hence
the unusual requirements that Degas made of his actual models; the
traditionally  comfortable and sustainable poses of the studio were
just those that his enterprise must rule out. We may feel some sympathy
for those actual women who were conscripted into an endeavor they are
unlikely to have understood. But only an eagerness to condemn could lead
us to conceive of that endeavor as a debasing and abusive social practice.

In fact for some of his most uncanonical res Degas used
photographs. The extraordinary work from Philadelphia is a case in point
(<A HREF="6.3harrison_0.html"> 20</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 The nature of the artist's interest in photography may be used to
 advance my argument. There were two significant aspects to this
 interest. On the one hand, Degas made use of what would have been
 considered at the time the accidental effects of the photograph: the
 blurring of a limb in movement, the disappearance of a detail into a
 halo of light, the cropping of a re caught moving into or out of
 the frame. On the other, he informed himself of the scientific work of
 Muybridge and Marey. The particular relevance of this work is that it
 employed photographic techniques as a means of studying a world beyond
 the normally visible. Like those amateurish snapshots that caught
 res in accidental movement, what the images of Muybridge and Marey
 recorded was a range of movements and positions outside those canonized
 in normal vision.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The end that photography served for Degas was thus to furnish him
 with powerful

<B></B>

resources for the critique of naturalistic conventions. For example, it
clearly went against the taste of the time to conceive of the pastel now
in the Metropolitan Museum in New York as a naturalistic picture of an
ordinary woman entering a bath (<A HREF="6.3harrison_1.html"> 21</A>). But photography will show, and
an unbiased eye will eventually learn to see, that this is indeed how a
conventionally attractive woman may look. The re is neither debased
by the effects of prostitution nor distorted by the artist's misogyny. She
is simply uncanonized, unposed, and thus <I>not being seen.</I>

It is nearly time to return to the monotype with which I began. There is
one last issue to address. It concerns Degas' motivation. This question
is most urgently raised, I think, by those images that seem to fall
somewhere between the brothel monotypes and the large pastels. Though
smaller and less heavily worked than the latter, they lack the appearance
of spontaneity and near-caricature by which the former tend to be
distinguished. One of the most remarkable of them is a small image
developed in pastel over the faint second impression of a monotype. It
shows a woman washing at a bidet--a moment that the typical male
imagination holds as paradigmatic of feminine physical privacy (<A HREF="6.3harrison_2.html"> 22</A>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are two different kinds of conclusion we might draw from such
images. If it is allowed that the pastels can justifiably be regarded
as attempts to explore how women look when they are not being seen,
this would still leave the matter of the "heterosexual drive" to be
answered. It might be said that all I have done is add substance to the
very view I was concerned to oppose: the view that what these pictures

<B></B>

do is bring artistic sophistication to the proclivities of the voyeur. In
other words, for all that the skills involved may be exceptional, what
they are being used for is to pry into the most private of moments;
to appropriate even the woman's own bodily sensation, and to render it
consumable by the male spectator.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The main objection to this conclusion is that voyeurism, as conventionally
understood, is by its very nature unsympathetic. That's to say its aim
is not to recognize the distinctive nature of the other's experience,
but rather to conscript that experience as a form of exciting narrative
within one's own. Whatever artists may or may not wish to do, aesthetic
success and failure are at any given time relative to certain material
conditions. If I am right about the conditions bearing down upon
the French art of the later nineteenth century, a predisposition to
unsympathetic voyeurism would not have been an advantage. My contention
is that by the mid 1880s the ability to represent the female re as
the sole possessor of her own space and body was an <I>aesthetic</I>
requirement that the work of Degas and others was bound to face. (It may
be significant that it is at around this same time that Degas' dancers
tend to step out of the spotlight and into the wings, where, out of
sight of the audience, they become pre-occupied with the details of
their costumes and their coiffeurs.

<B></B>

For examples, compare the <I>Curtseying Danseuse with Bouquet</I> of
1878, in the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, with the <I>Danseuses bleues</I> of
ca. 1890 from the same collection or with the <I>Red Ballet Skirts</I>
of ca. 1897-1901 from the Burrell Collection.) I suppose that what
I am saying in the end is that the issue gets decided aesthetically, on
the basis of results. Aesthetic achievement, then, would have to be seen
as a measure of avoidance of voyeurism. If that is indeed the case, then
a reading that would insist on the implicit violence of these images is
one that must deny such aesthetic properties as they may have in order
to protect <I>assumptions</I> about their motivation.

I return, then, to the question of what it is that drives this art--if
it is not an ultimately voyeuristic and prurient interest. My answer
would be that they are driven both by desire and by imagination. A desire
that that which they show <I>might</I> be capable of being seen; and an
imaginative insight into the conditions required if that possibility were
to be realized. It may well be that in the 1880s only a woman who was
a prostitute could have allowed Degas to see that which is pictured in
the image of the woman at the bidet. But a picture for which a prostitute
models is not necessarily a picture of a prostitute, any more than the sad
woman in the caf&eacute; was a portrait of the actress Ellen Andr&eacute;,
who actually posed for it. In fact what the worked-over monotype shows is
a sight now open to association with the conjugal intimacy of a shared
bedroom, rather than the hygiene of the prostitute. In this respect we
are perhaps  luckier than the men and women of Degas' day. Time
has passed. Of course paintings cannot predict the future. What they can
do, however, is to show what is lacking from the present, though in the
process they may render their critical content virtually imperceptible to
their contemporary spectators. It is for this reason that the testimony
of the artist's own time proves so frequently unreliable as a guide to
interpretation. Is it so inconceivable that Degas could have understood
the grounds of his own misfortune; understood them and tried to imagine
them realistically transformed? Might it not be that this is what his
mature pictures show? That if a woman's intimacy were really her own,
then an equal exchange of intimacies might realistically be imagined
and the "moment with infinite content" might become more than just a
glance. Degas was certainly clear enough in his earlier work about what
life must be like where there is neither empathy nor true intimacy. The
conclusions are unmistakable both from his formal family portraits
(see <I>The Belleli Family,</I> Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay) and from the two
essays in genre painting known respectively as <I>Interior</I> (or more
dramatically and probably misleadingly as <I>The Rape</I>) and <I>Sulking</I> (respectively, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and Museum of
Art, Philadelphia).
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 It is also very clear from the evidence of his work that he could imagine
 what it was like when the absence of self-possession left women condemned
 to a public isolation  (<A HREF="6.3harrison_3.html"> 23</A>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I should perhaps try to put some form of theoretical scaffolding under
the conjectural aspects of this paper. Of course it would be a nonsense to
claim that we could now straightforwardly recover what was not visible to
the contemporary spectator of Degas' work. It may be, however, that we can
recover it as a form of understanding of what it was that was then <I>not
to be seen.</I> To the extent that it is sensible to talk in such terms,
we exercise a kind of interpretive competence which the painting may

<B></B>

originally have put itself beyond. Of course there are limits on
the competences we can bring to bear, as there are on our capacity
practically to imagine, for example, what it is like to inhabit the body
of another. But it is precisely at the limits on and of the imagination
that art does its most indispensable critical work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The argument may be put in the form of a series of theses.  The
intensional properties of a painting, or, if we avoid pandering to a
prissy prejudice, its qualities are <I>produced</I> properties. They are
constitutive and definitive of the painting.  These properties are not
necessarily to be identified with such properties as may be predicated
of the painting or attributed to it, since they may be such that they
are not to be seen in advance of some transformation in the spectator,
some self-critical process or other process of edification.  The
painting whose properties are not to be seen (by the spectator) will
be described and interpreted (by that spectator) as that which it is
not.   To perceive that a description or interpretation of a painting
is a description or interpretation of that which it is not, is to act
under an intuition of that which is not to be seen. We might call this
intuition "aesthetic."  This intuition implies some convergence
between that which is not to be seen (or said of) the

<B></B>

painting, and that which is not to be seen in (or said of) the world
of the spectator.  It does not follow that the properties of the
painting are <I>relative</I> to what may be seen and said in the world
of the spectator.  A painting may serve to divide its spectators into
(i) those who cannot see it and will not see it and who must therefore
describe it as that which it is not; (ii) those who cannot see it, but
who nevertheless do not describe it as that which it is not (and who are
thus pre-transformational from the point of view of the painting); (iii)
those who can see it and who are thus post-transformational from the point
of view of the painting.  The transformation involved is one that the
painting specifically requires by virtue of its produced properties. The
process might be thought of as the coming-to-awareness of an unconscious
intention, where intention is conceived of as a historical rather than
merely psychological category.  The possibility of transformation in
the spectator may entail the capacity to imagine himself or herself either
as pictured or as seeing what is pictured (or otherwise represented), or
both.  Imagination of this order has conventionally been conceived
of as a form of empathy. However, we need a way of thinking of the
mechanisms involved that does not tend to sentimentalisation of the
forms of experience at issue, and that is not diverting--as empathy
tends to be--from the formal and pictorial instruction of the relevant
imaginative activity, i. e. from the painting's effect.  Any effect
we attribute specifically to painting will be a function of some playing
on the relationship between picture plane and literal surface.  To
talk of painting as an art is to imply that this game is such as in turn
to problematize the relations between (i) that which is normally to be
seen and represented according to the culturally available resources of
expression in the practical world from which the painting issues, and
that which is not; (ii) the painting in question and other paintings;
(iii) the spectator and other paintings; iv) the world of that which the
spectator can see (and describe and interpret) and that which he or she
cannot see (and etc.).  To imply that a painting produced at time
T1 can have as one of its produced properties the capacity to challenge
resources of expression at time T2 would be to attribute to paintings
the capacity to predict the future. The challenge in question may be
conceived of as a constant property <I>only</I> to the extent that the
need to represent that which is not to be seen is discoverable under
different social and historical conditions.  These may also be the
limits according to which what has been called aesthetic experience may
justifiably be conceived of as a constant in human cultures.

Finally, then, to the monotype which started all this. It may by now how
have become clear where my argument has been leading, and how I mean to
explain the sense of blindness that the monotype momentarily induced in
me. Of course, it would be easiest to step back and to play the voyeur,
with all that that would imply for our understanding of the artist's
desire in producing his picture--and for all that it might suggest about
the nature of his exchanges with his friends. But in fact the composition
offers us no space to retreat to. There is even less than in the large
pastels. It is not simply that this is an image without an external
spectator, though I think it is certainly and crucially that. This is
a body seen from the virtual position of its

<B></B>

own head. And what would it mean for the male spectator to occupy that
position? To look down the body of the other as if from within its
own imagined self-consciousness? What would it be like to look like
that? Rather than writing from certainty either about the artist's
mentality or about our own appearance, perhaps, like Degas, we should
try to see.

Norma Broude claims with some justice that "The issue of gender was
first introduced as a site of conflict in modern Degas studies in the
mid-1970s" by her own article, "Degas's 'Misogyny,'" first published
in the <I>Art Bulletin</I>, March 1977; see her review of <I>Dealing
With Degas: Representations of Women and the Politics of Vision</I>,
ed. Richard Kendall and Griselda Pollock (New York: Universe, 1991),
in <I>Woman's Art Journal</I> 6.2 (Fall 1995/Winter 1996): 35-40
. The 1977 article sought to question the assumption of Degas'
misogyny which had been prevalent since the first exhibition of his
"suite de nues" in the 1886 Impressionist exhibition. The later review
notes the reinstallation of a Degas "framed as the perverted instrument
of society's power structures and obsessions" in some recent writing
by feminist art historians . The review provides a useful summary
of some of the issues raised in interpretation of Degas' work, with
references to some relevant publications.

Wollheim's concept of the "spectator in the picture" is discussed at
length in ch. 3 of his <I>Painting as an Art (</I>Princeton, N.J.:
Princeton University Press, 1987)<I>.</I> His claim is that there are
certain paintings that have "a representational content in excess of
what they represent"  and that this is to be accounted for by
the presence of an imaginary spectator who, though unrepresented, is
"internal" to the given picture. That is to say, the picture may be
imagined as showing not only what this spectator sees but <I>how</I> he
or she sees it. Wollheim characterizes the "spectator in the picture"
as a "protagonist" to whom a "repertoire" is assigned by the artist
. "The external spectator identifies with the internal spectator,
and it is through this identification that he gains fresh access to
the picture's content. In a licensed way he supplements his perception
of the picture with the proceeds of imagination and does so so as to
advance understanding" . As Wollheim applies the concept of the
"spectator in the picture" it is subject to a problematic and conservative
limitation: it is established solely through the rative scenario of
the given picture. It is thus not clear how the effect of the picture's
factive aspects might combine with the effect of the external spectator's
identification with the internal spectator to produce understanding
of the picture. The question is a crucial one where Degas' pastels
are concerned. In no pictorial work--with the possible exception of
C&eacute;zanne's--is the repertoire of the "spectator in the picture"
so clearly qualified or challenged by the expressive properties of the
literal worked surface. Yet if the spectator in the picture could be
allowed to meet this qualification or challenge there seems no reason
why the concept should not be extended to such <I>non</I>-rative
paintings as those of Rothko, to which it seems highly appropriate.

This painting was discussed by Neil MacGregor, Director of the National
Gallery, London, in the first program of the televised series <I>Making
Masterpieces</I> on BBC2 on 20 October 1997. Drawing upon a recent
examination by the gallery's scientific department and conservation
studio, MacGregor noted the alterations by which Renoir had "dressed
down" the main re to lower her class and to make more poignant her
apparent discomfort at the attentions of the man behind her. "Is this
the first politically correct painting?" he asked, concluding, "It may
well be." The sound-bite gets the painting half right. But, <I>pace</I>
Wollheim, we need to remember that a picture is always first and most
crucially seen by the person who both makes and imagines it from a
position this side of its surface. If I am justified in my reading of
the painting and its critical connection to de Molins' earlier work, it
is to the man <I>in front</I> of the pictured woman that we should look
for the true--and more complex--source of her discomfort. It is <I>his</I> motivated inquisitiveness about the girl's social and economic
position that the alterations to her costume and her bodily demeanor
serve most tellingly to establish. (See the clearly managed review of
MacGregor's program in David Lister, "A Study in Sexual Politics," <I>Guardian</I>, 16 October 1977, "Eye on Thursday section," 1.)

The locus classicus for this reading is Joris-Karl Huysmans' essay on
the pastels, first published as "Degas" in his <I>Certains</I> (Paris:

<I>Art in Theory 1815-1900</I> (Oxford: Blackwell, 1998),
893-95. Huysmans writes of the artist's "painstaking cruelty and
unshakeable hatred." Martha Ward has provided a thorough analysis of
critical responses to the showing of Degas' "suite de nues" at the eighth
Impressionist exhibition in 1886, demonstrating how assumptions about
the artist's misogyny were variously connected to characterizations of
the poverty, ugliness, and amorality of the represented women, with the
typical consequence that the images were read as harshly "realistic." See
"The Rhetoric of Independence and Innovation" in <I>The New Painting:

Anthea Callen writes of "anatomical distortions which flatten and fix the
re into a shallow pictorial space," cataloguing the "distortions" in
various pictures by reference to an assumed biological naturalism. She
then explains the distortions in question in terms of a desire on Degas'
part both to contain female sexuality and literally to manipulate the
female anatomy ("Degas' <I>Bathers</I>: Hygiene and Dirt--Gaze and
Touch," 168-70). In her more sophisticated treatment of the same
issue, Heather Dawkins remarks that ". . . as many have noticed, Degas'
sense of the body, especially from the 1870s, was very tenuous: anatomies
under <I>tutus</I> are implausible, legs join to torsos problematically,
women stepping in or out of baths threaten to split up the middle, and
so on." Sensibly opposing those who would attribute the "tenuousness" of
Degas' sense of the body to "lack of representational skill," Dawkins
explains it rather in terms of "the necessity for a constant deferral
of gratification in fantasy . . . met in part by the necessary phobic
avoidance of the object in projection" (Dawkins, "Frogs, Monkeys and
Women: A History of Identification across a Phantastic Body," <I>Dealing
with Degas</I>, 206-10). That psychic projection played some part in
Degas' work seems plausible enough. It presumably does in everyone's. The
point at issue is how we are to isolate the significant effects of that
projection, <I>in the absence</I> of some adequate theory of artistic
style and some relevant account of its development (i.e. without some
possibility of eliminating the effects of our own projections). To put
the matter bluntly, with such theoretical instruments to hand, what
might someone <I>not</I> make of the work of Picasso or Matisse or Dali
or etc. in the 1920s? We should also bear in mind that the Wollheimian
concept of the spectator in the picture has considerable potential to
damage interpretations such as those of Callen and Dawkins, based as
these are on the assumption that it is the artist's unreflected motivation
that the forms of his pictures express (see note 11).

"These women, officially classed as 'other,' have indeed been debased

Powerful evidence of misogyny and sadism is certainly there to be
found in the French painting of the nineteenth century. The imaginative
anticipation of acts of rape was regularly on offer in paintings exhibited
at the Salon, from Marc Gleyre's deeply unpleasant <I>Roman bandits</I>
of 1831 (now in the Cleveland Museum) to Paul-Joseph Jamin's fatuous
<I>The Brennus with his Share of the Spoils</I> of 1893 (now Mus&eacute;e
des Beaux-Arts, La Rochelle). Unwillingness to make discriminations on
aesthetic grounds is often raised to the status of a principle in cultural
studies. I would want to propose, however, that aesthetic difference is
the surest guide to <I>other</I> kinds of difference between pictures
such as Gleyre's and Jamin's on the one hand and those of a Manet or a
Degas on the other.

  Confronted with Degas' sketch of <I>Woman With a Lorgnette</I>
(ca. 1866 British Museum, London) in the 1988 exhibition at the Grand
Palais in Paris, Griselda Pollock interprets it and its related studies
of a woman looking directly out of the picture not as indications that
Degas might possibly have got there before her in critical reflection
upon the distribution of powers in "the Gaze and the Look," but as
further evidence of the artist's need that the look be "captured and
tamed" ("The Gaze and the Look: Women with Binoculars--A Question of
Difference," <I>Dealing With Degas</I>, 106-130). One is reminded
of the policeman so secure in his knowledge of the suspect's guilt that
any old evidence will do to confirm it.

Manet's <I>Blonde aux Seins Nues</I> is a picture of an attractive
woman whose breasts have clearly been bared to be seen (she still wears
blouse and hat)<I>.</I> While it breaches the decorum for a respectable
portrait, the explicitly self-conscious expression of the woman lifts it
out of the category of a mere life study from a professional model. In
the 1870s there were few other social categories to which the woman could
be assigned apart from that of prostitute. But in cultural circumstances
in which prostitutes were publicly supposed to be ugly and bestial, what
was the male viewer to do with a picture which reflected back <I>both</I>
his own attraction to the woman <I>and</I> her psychological remoteness
from him?

<a NAME="FOOT23" HREF="#REF23">23</A>.
As with my earlier reference to Picasso, I suggest that circumstantial
support for this reading of Degas' endeavor is provided by those ensuing
works by Pierre Bonnard which are clearly designed to explore just this
possibility. I have specifically in mind those works, such as <I>La
Table de Toilette</I> of 1908 (Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, Paris), <I>The
Bathroom Mirror</I> also of 1908 (Pushkin Museum, Moscow), <I>Dressing
Table and Mirror</I> of 1913 (Museum of Fine Arts, Houston) and <I>The
Mantlepiece</I> of 1916 (Margoline Collection), in which a mirror above
a washstand or mantlepiece is made to reflect a nude female re just

There is considerable evidence that Degas associated the conventions of
direct life study with a tendency for <I>loss</I> of expressive potential
in the whole re. His notebooks of 1877-83 record the following
"studio projects" in the form of admonitions to himself. "Set up tiered
benches round the room to get in the habit of drawing things from below
and from above. Only be allowed to paint things seen in a mirror so
as to instal a hatred of <I>trompe l'oeil</I>. For a portrait have the
re pose on the ground floor and have to work on the first floor to
get used to keeping a grasp of the forms and expressions, never drawing
or painting <I>directly</I>." (Author's translation from <I>Art in Theory

Does it have a politics? Wouldn't we all like to know, more than
seventy-five years later? But we have little chance unless we give
up the pleasures of the heavy club and the coarse concept: running
dog/subversive cat--reaction/revolution. The pre-<I>Waste Land</I> Eliot
knew the difficulty well, writing with wry self-irony that he found
himself a Conservative in the United States but a Labourite in London.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What happened back there was a poetic improvisation within a social
convulsion, and my aim is to restore <I>The Waste Land</I> to a
distinctive conjuncture that we have casually let dissolve. It has
been too tempting for too long to assimilate the poem to the events
that came later in the decade, even shortly later, to see it as safely
predicting the dispositions of the mid and late twenties: the poem
as proto-Anglican, crypto-classical, or neo-monarchist. Eliot himself
uttered the best warning when he wrote:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Only from about 1926 did the features of the post-war world begin
to emerge--and not only in the sphere of politics. From that date one
began slowly to realize that the intellectual and artistic output of the
previous seven years had been rather the last efforts of an old world,
than the first  struggles of the new.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Whether or not he meant to be writing of himself, we can certainly say
that the features of his own postwar world only emerged "from about
1926" and that the immediate period



after the war marked a epoch in its own right--the years 1919 to 1921
or 1922 have a density more often found in decades. Accordingly, to put
the question of politics to <I>The Waste Land</I> must be to put it to
this brief but decisive historical moment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Eliot settled in London, he moved steadily into an infatuation with
his new home. "I like London better than before"--"I like London very
well"--"I have been to a cubist tea"--"I want to live in London"--"I
love to be in London" (<I>LOTSE</I>, 55, 57, 77, 107, 122). Still,
within the chanting, crooning enthusiasm, he remained acutely conscious
of the strains on a foreigner. It's no surprise that his affection
for the city grew in proportion to the successful spinning of a social
web. He repeatedly counts the number of friends in those early months;
he needs those friends because, as he later put it, "getting recognized
in English letters is like breaking open a safe--for an American"
(<I>LOTSE</I>, 392).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By 1919 Eliot can boast that he has "more <I>influence</I> on English
letters than any other American has ever had, unless it be Henry James. I
know a great many people, but there are many more who would like to know
me . . ." The possibility of returning to the United States lingers:
Charles W. Eliot, the ex-President of Harvard, asks how his kinsman
"can forego the privilege of living in the genuine American atmosphere--a
bright atmosphere of freedom and hope" (<I>LOTSE</I>, 323). But whatever
the attractions of freedom, London has the allure of power: "if one is to
do anything in literature this is the best place to be," and this because
"London imposes her acceptance of a man's work on all the English speaking
world and . . . accepts no other standard than her own" (<I>LOTSE</I>,
107, 102). On this point Eliot is clear, convinced, and self-delighted:
London is the imperial capital of culture, and to break open its safe
is to uncover riches that can be redeemed in any literary market.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "safe" is, of course, a resonant re of speech for a young banker,
resonant but not suprising, because we certainly misread both Eliot's
modernity and his urbanity if we ignore his role as a practitioner of
economics, working amid various subtle currencies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 What appears in one guise as the question of war reparations,
 shows itself in another as a problem in the economies of literary
 reputation. From the start of his London life he understands and accepts
 the material conditions of success, the economy of reputation. It
 is essential, he concludes, that a writer "should establish solid
 connections with at least one important paper" (<I>LOTSE</I>, 358)--and
 there follows the coldly unsentimental insight:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
There are only two ways in which a writer can become important--to write
a great deal, and have his writings appear everywhere, or to write very
little . . . I write very little, and I should not become more powerful
by increasing my output. My reputation in London is built upon one small
volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in
a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in
their kind, so that each should be an event. (<I>LOTSE</I>, 358)

that he is intent to keep his book of criticism short: "I want it
small," he writes, "in order to make it a single distinct blow"

way, Eliot acknowledges the power of cultural mystery, of the reticent
perfectionist, who locks the safe he has broken open, and who, to change
res, creates hunger by feeding the public so sparingly. At the same
time he opens a connection between the conditions of reputation and the
forms of literary experiment practiced in those early London years. The
suppression of a narrative continuity that was still flickering in
"Prufrock" and "Portrait of a Lady," the burnishing of smaller fragments,
the violent shift in attention between verse paragraphs, the movement
to the greater difficulty of the quatrain poems, "Gerontion," and
climactically <I>The Waste Land</I>--all this occurs within the complex
cultural universe that Eliot seeks to command through the economic
resources of the "single distinct blow," whether it take the form of
a short critical book or a self-standing poetic conceit: "A woman drew
her long black hair out tight."

Through the grimness of the war years, Eliot sought and quickly felt
the mastery of the imperial literary summit. In the spring of 1919 he
writes, "I am getting to know and be known by all the intelligent or
important people in letters" (<I>LOTSE</I>, 285). And yet through the
course of that year Eliot felt a sudden dissolution of the carefully
prepared edifice of mastery. The wartime metropolis had been a depleted
city, where literary activity had been reduced to a low simmer. Even as
some modernists fought and died--T. E. Hulme and Gaudier-Brzeska among
them--those who stayed home in London had found an urban culture small and
pliable enough to yield to literary activism. Surely it's telling that
the great moment of crisis in Eliot's work coincides with the recovery
of peace. The postwar metropolis became the saturated city again, but
for Eliot the vigorous city was a new difficulty. "London has never been
so full," writes Vivien Eliot, "the crowds are so enormous, everywhere,
in the streets and public places, theatres restaurants . . . one sees
Americans at every turn" (<I>LOTSE</I>, 265).

Written so soon after the carnage of the war, the poem has naturally
been understood as an engagement with the civilization of violence. But a
burden of this argument is that <I>The Waste Land</I> needs to be located
within the immediate surround of the postwar city, the city cursed not
by military violence, but by hectic peace. It's the city of the dead,
as we have always known, but these are peculiar corpses: they twitch
so spasmodically. Eliot's London letters for <I>The Dial</I> and his
private correspondence describe "the putrescence of English literature"
(<I>LOTSE</I>, 431), but the accumulating picture is one of a seething
putrescence, a frantic routine. The drafts of "The Fire Sermon" are
searing.

its most lofty summit. What he saw was the fatal emptiness of the grand

More than Jessie Weston, more than <I>The Golden Bough</I>, <I>The
Economic Consequences of the Peace</I> anticipates the ghostly modality
of <I>The Waste Land</I>, the spectral insight into the fictions
of modernity. Keynes's Paris is the unreal city of peace: there are
no living people there, only the heavy masks of insubstantial men,
flapping the artificial wings of leadership. Since the work of Eleanor
Cook we've had reason to ponder the connection between Eliot and Keynes,
and reason to connect Keynes' book to Eliot's labor at Lloyds Bank, where
he described himself as "dealing alone with all the debts and claims of
the bank under the various Peace Treaties" (<I>LOTSE</I>, 451).

 But <I>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</I> must be read as more

<I>Power absconditus</I>--that is the savage Keynesian insight: those who
have been entrusted with the world's fate have withdrawn into the fantasy
of an untenable peace. It is all like Tolstoy, shrieks Keynes, it's like
Hardy's <I>The Dynasts</I>, this spectacle of "events marching on to
their fated conclusion uninfluenced and unaffected by the cerebrations
of Statesmen in Council" (<I>ECP</I>, 6).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here is the first cold perception that we need to bring to the
politics of <I>The Waste Land</I>, exactly the perception of <I>power
absconditus</I>. There was an Archduke who once took Marie out on a
sled. There was a Coriolanus, now broken. There were loitering heirs of
city directors, now departed, having left no addresses. There was a Fisher
King. All these powers have receded, creating a landscape in which fearful
selves are left to wander, at the mercy of forces no longer governed by
once formidable authorities, Kings and Generals, Directors and Dukes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And yet when big power absconds, it leaves little power behind. Such is
its genius.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The epigraph from <I>Heart of Darkness</I>, discarded in the late stages
 of revision, belongs to this pattern of abandonment. Kurtz is yet another
 recent leader whose recession will abandon events to their own blind
 course. And yet we know that the agony of Kurtz's retrospection--his
 horror, his horror--is both a crisis in social power and a crisis of
 subjectivity. No doubt the allure of Conrad's Kurtz for Eliot, as an
 exemplary, epigraphic re, depended on the productive confusion of
 realms: personal agony indistinguishable from political catastrophe.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>The Waste Land</I>, with all its toppled towers of authority, displays
power persisting. It persists in the opportunities within the zone of
personal intimacy, in the micro-power of intersubjectivity. The barbarous
king who rudely forced Philomela is the terrible re for the politics
of intimacy, power between bodies, whose effects are written throughout
the poem. Eliot envisions the local dyad, two flailing, flirting subjects,
as a little system of submission and hierarchy, obedience and control. As
the glimpsed idyll in the poem's final movements puts it, "your
heart would have responded/ Gaily, when invited, beating obedient/ To
controlling hands" (<I>TWL</I>, 146, 420-22). Give, sympathize, and
control--these are the overcharged imperatives of regulated subjectivity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"It is terrible to be alone with another person,"--so Eliot had written
(in "The Death of the Duchess," <I>TWL</I>, 105, 25), and the ferocity of
this insight is everywhere abrasive in <I>The Waste Land</I>. Two people
make their own politics. Whether they give or control, either in silence
or in howling eroticism, the mere human pair are already expert in the
administration of power. "What is to be done?" demanded Lenin. In the
drawing-room politics of <I>The Waste Land</I> this becomes, "What shall
we do to-morrow? What shall we ever do?" (<I>TWL</I>, 138, 133-4)
All through the poem runs the appalling compound of bottomless demand
("Stay with me," "Speak to me," 138, 111-12) and endless refusal
("I can't bear to look at you," 146). This is what Beckett will exploit
and exhaust: this scene of two creatures alone, begging, clutching,
biting, tickling, loving, loathing, without even the solace of a frame
around the misery.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What the micro-politics of intimacy lacks is a world to inhabit, a
society stretching out around the desperate dyad, a political context
within which helpless subjectivity might orient itself. In a universe
where "each man fixed his eyes before his feet" (<I>TWL</I>, 136, 65),
even the intelligibility of space disappears. You trace the steps of the
one in front of you, or you find yourself in a closed car; you follow
the current of the city streets, or you drift with the river; but you
never assemble a coherent or stable milieu that might be called an
"outer world." These grammatical subjects can finally

<B></B>

do little more than testify to their victimage: "I read much of the night"
(<I>TWL</I>, 135, 18); "After the event/ He wept" (143, 297-98);
"I can connect/ Nothing with nothing" (143, 301-2).

The disappearance of the background of conviction, the dissolution
of a world-picture--Keynes is at his most searching when he describes
their loss. We never noticed, he writes, that what we took as natural
and permanent, namely, the political life of the West in the fifty
years before the war, was in fact "intensely unusual, unstable,
complicated, unreliable, [and] temporary." The end of the war has
exposed the truth: that what Europe understood as the order of things
was a recent contrivance whose collapse leaves us on a "sandy and false
foundation" (<I>ECP</I>, 3). The great rise of European capital depended
on <I>naturalizing</I> an artifice as something "normal, certain, and
permanent" (<I>ECP</I>, 12). But now Europe must live with the dissolution
of the norm, the decay of the natural.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What happens then to politics when its "nature" can no longer mystify,
when the great statesmen stand revealed as puppets, when potent events
overwhelm paltry agents, and when paltry agents are left to exercise
power on their own? The answer for Keynes, and no less for Eliot, is
that politics devolves into an economics, where economics is the name
for the play of interests and desires when they are no longer veiled
(or constrained) by the theatrics of political deception. The system of
Europe had depended on the "double bluff," by which the great capitalists
agreed to invest, not to consume, and workers were persuaded that they
somehow had a stake in the wealth of others. After the war the bluff
has been exposed; politics descends into the unsentimental truths of
economics, the truth of the power in material interests.

In its crowds on the bridge, in its hooded hordes, <I>The Waste Land</I>
tersely acknowledges the class basis of the disenchanted postwar world,
but just as the London crowd resolves into Stetson, so the poem makes
its sharp turn toward individuals, and public concerns gather around
personal pronouns: my ruins, my lands. But in this Waste Land to remain
alone is exactly not to escape the politico/economic crisis of those
first postwar years, the crisis Keynes identified with the insight of
Lenin, who thought that "the best way to destroy the Capitalist system
was to debauch [its] currency." A "debauch" is just what the <I>Times</I>
called it, this period of startling inflation built on the quicksand of
rising prices. The cost of living rose

<B></B>

month by month, climbing to a peak at the end of 1920, and the difficulty
wasn't scarcity of goods: the problem was "scandalous profiteering,"
middlemen with ample supplies unwilling to bring prices down, intent to
enjoy, for as long as they could, the artificial boom.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 The government was seen as helpless--bands of shoppers, hoodless hordes,
 took matters into their own hands, organizing boycotts against the
 profiteers. When the Eliots looked for a new flat in 1920, they found
 that the "fantastic" rents were running "from two to four times what
 we pay now" (<I>LOTSE</I>, 406, 390). The sagging poet complained to
 his mother that though his salary had risen to &#163;500, "which would
 have seemed a fortune . . . four years ago" (<I>LOTSE</I>, 353), now
 it is worth scarcely more than &#163;250.

The notorious young man carbuncular in <I>The Waste Land</I> is, notably,
a small house agent's clerk, who (the drafts explain) "flits" from "flat
to flat" with clients like the Eliots (<I>TWL</I>, 45, 157-58). He is
a case worker in the inflationary epidemic--a middleman within the system
of profiteering. If he has a bold stare like a Bradford millionaire,
that is because in the city of flowing money, numbers now change their
meaning. As Keynes caustically put it, "Where we spent millions before
the war, we have now learnt that we can spend hundreds of millions and
apparently not suffer for it" (<I>ECP</I>, 4).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As for the clerk's metropolitan bride, the typist home at teatime, she
has already led a semi-lustrous life in Eliot's correspondence, where
in describing the world of Lloyds Bank, he had written, "I have half
of a room, two girls, and half of a typist" (<I>LOTSE</I>, 232), and
then goes on to explain the problem with typists. The trouble is that
some of them "don't have to work:" they just "want something to do"
(<I>LOTSE</I>, 204). In <I>The Waste Land</I>, of course, this turns into
the something-to-do of sexuality. The end of the war brought the arrival
of single women in public places, on the bus and in the squares. Peter
Walsh in <I>Mrs. Dalloway</I> returns to London from India and swoons
before the women on the street: "even the poorest dressed better than
five years ago surely; and to his eye the fashions had never been so
becoming; the long black cloaks; the slimness, the elegance, and then
the delicious and apparently universal habit of paint . . . this taking
out a stick of rouge or a powder-puff, and making up in public."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Eliot himself has known the subterranean tie between London and
 libido. Several years earlier he had described "one of those nervous
 sexual attacks which I suffer from when alone in a city . . . One
 walks about the street with one's desires, and one's refinement rises
 up like a wall whenever opportunity approaches" (<I>LOTSE</I>, 75). But
 it's in the period of the twenties that the sexual heightening becomes
 conspicuous and inescapable; it appears as its own form of inflation,
 product of and counterpart to the inflation in prices, incomes and
 rents; and it appears up and down the social ladder.

traffic in currants yields enough cash for a lurid weekend. Those heirs
to banking directorships may not yet have come into their plush offices
on Threadneedle Street, but their silk handkerchiefs and cigarettes
can still beguile the nymphs on the upper Thames. Such res are the
postwar successors to Fisher Kings and Archdukes, dispersed modern powers
who can ride the crest of easy money. When "Death by Water" records the
forgetting of the "profit and loss," it not only suggests a transring
death, it enacts the poem's own disengagement with bad currencies.

The headnote to "What the Thunder Said" evokes the "present decay

final movement (<I>TWL</I>, 148). If the phrase is taken only, or even

happened--then we acquire a distorted view of both the poem's historical
situation and its political impulses.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Here is where the connection between Eliot and Keynes is most urgent. The
 last section of <I>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</I> forces
 attention to the breakdown of Central and Eastern Europe after the war,
 not as a problem of workers' revolution but as a sign of the collapse
 of world economic order. Keynes pleads for recognition of the "the
 menace of inflationism," which "is not merely a product of the war, of
 which peace begins the end. It is a continuing phenomenon of which the
 end is not yet in sight" (<I>ECP</I>, 248). The systematic disease is
 ravaging not only Russia but also "Turkey, Hungary, [and] Austria, where
 the most dreadful material evils which men can suffer--famine, cold,
 disease, war, murder, and anarchy--are an actual present experience"
 (<I>ECP</I>, 255). Nothing in these pages sees the crisis as revolution
 in Russia. The desperate problem is rather the structural collapse of
 nineteenth-century capitalism. Far from calling for the repression of
 revolutionary movements, Keynes remarkably identifies "the replacement
 of the existing governments of Europe" as an "almost indispensable"
 step, if we hope to deliver ourselves from this world predicament
 (<I>ECP</I>, 256). If, on the other hand, we set ourselves against
 Russia,--and if we aim

The only hope lies in recognizing that "the solidarity of man is not

run everyone will be affected by "the bankruptcy and decay of Europe"
(<I>ECP</I>, 296).

Eliot's formulation of the "present decay of Eastern Europe" may well
have grown from this last phrase in Keynes; more importantly, the general
political disposition of <I>The Waste Land</I> seems to owe a great deal
to the terrible Keynesian vision: bleak, bitter, frightened, and more
anti-capitalist than counter-revolutionary. Only a blurred historical
focus can permit the thought that Eliot in 1921-22 is "sympathising
with the Russian Tsars."

 On the contrary, he is responding directly to an anarchic capitalist
 economy, and to the extent that he can imagine a positive social act,
 it lies not in imposing discipline on revolutionary hordes, but in
 accepting responsibilities here in one's own waste capital: "Shall I

The drafts reveal what the finished work more subtly indicates: the extent
to which <I>The Waste Land</I> becomes an anti-finance poem. Eliot had
entered London banking at a time when the City, the financial square mile,
was still at its extraordinary apogee. Through decades of industrial
decline, finance was the prop and stay of the economy, and as Eliot
constructed the London of his poem, the City was the resistless magnet,
drawing the laboring crowds on buses and underground trains. The streets
of the district--Cannon Street, Lower Thames Street--give the poem its
determinate geography.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 The enervated citizens of Hampstead go on Monday to the City; in "The
 Fire Sermon" the abandoned "Thames maiden" from Highbury has a father
 with an "anxious business" "somewhere in the city" (<I>TWL</I>, 51,
 6, 5). The specter of "brick and stone and steel," rhyming with "bound
 upon the wheel" (<I>TWL</I>, 37, 7, 9), is the poetic precipitate of a
 half-century of unprecedented power for finance capital on its ancient
 Roman ground.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 In the years after the war, the City brought in new workers--clerks,
 managers, typists--at a prodigious rate. The call of the high-shouldered
 banks with their imperial reach enticed the citizens of London much like
 the erotic scent wafting through the postwar streets. The falling towers
 in the last part of <I>The Waste Land</I> totter within the determinate
 context of banking brick, commercial stone, and financial steel.

In a plaintive letter, Eliot had groaned in the face of the titan:
"So very few of one's acquaintance realize what it means to have sold
. . . all of one's days,--except at most a month a year--and old age--to
a huge impersonal thing like a Bank" (<I>LOTSE</I>, 374). The echo of
"Tradition and the Individual Talent"--with its "Impersonal theory

<B></B>

 of poetry" calling for a "continual self-sacrifice, a continual
 extinction of personality"--is surprising and unmistakable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The poet-critic who had enshrined the demands of impersonality, the
 submission to a grand tradition, sighs here beneath the weight of this
 "thing," the impersonal Bank that swallows the individual employee. The
 echo and the asymmetry can be taken as a trace of the politics that
 most deeply animate <I>The Waste Land</I>, and that will serve as
 a last point here, to be approached through one final marker of the
 inflationary crisis.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is the inflation of discourse, of text, forced out by the machinery
of journalism. During a very few years there had appeared new organs of
literary and critical writing, new organs or new editors of old organs:
among many others <I>The Athenaeum</I> of J. Middleton Murry, a new
<I>Art and Letters</I>, <I>The Dial</I> under Scofield Thayer, Eliot's own
<I>Criterion</I>, and most notably for Eliot, the <I>London Mercury</I>
of J. C. Squire. The <I>Mercury</I> becomes the ponderous exemplar of
the journalistic apparatus that keeps churning out text. Squire, says a
grudging Eliot, is "the cleverest journalist in London," whose influence
"controls or affects the literary contents and criticism of five or
six periodicals already" (<I>LOTSE</I>, 358). And while he takes solace
from the fact that "the <I>Mercury</I> has no standing among intelligent
people," that it is socially looked down upon . . . ," Eliot sweats oil
and tar at the thought of the culturally crowded London as a sharply
divided field, where the waves of "semi-education" overwhelm the apostles
of subtlety. In the first number of the <I>London Mercury</I>, Squire
had taken unnerving aim at the young experimentalists, who had conducted
"an orgy of undirected ab-normality," and he will continue a campaign
against poetry that has mastered the "trick of incomprehensibility."

by agents, a postwar network of dispersed powers that press and caress,
entangle and abandon.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The voice of eerie calm in the final lines of the poem--"I sat upon
the shore/ Fishing, with the arid plain behind me" (<I>TWL</I>, 146,
423-24)--tries to imagine a place outside the overstimulated city,
city of inflated desire and bloated currency. But this is not a voice that
can sustain itself. When it dissolves, breaking into the last antic string
of quotations, it confirms the poem's most determined strategy as that of
wrapping exposed subjectivities in the thick robes of culture. Particular
selves, named or not, remain caught within the politics of intimacy;
they have nowhere to go, and no rhetoric of their own strong enough to
repair their loss; they can be nothing but poor subjects. In place of
their poverty, the poem chooses the wealth of culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>The Waste Land</I> is not a poem of exile, no matter how far it
strays from London, but a poem that stays at home in the library. Its
most radical event is to change the terms of understanding: to turn from
politics and economics to culture, from big banks to the long literary
tradition. If politics has become unreal, then where better to look if
not to the authentic unreality of the literary past? The poem's web of
reference appears as nothing less than an alternative civil society:
the quotations are citizens in an ideal community. Where the human
"characters" in the poem collide and disperse, suffering the emergencies
of modernity, the fragments from Shakespeare and Spenser, Baudelaire
and Bradley, meet and mingle. They can be shored against the ruins, in
part because their glory is cheap at the price, stubbornly resistant to
the inflation of other commodities. More substantially, they create a
universe of discourse, reaching from English to Sanskrit, as wide as the
universe of finance. It may have been a struggle in postwar London to
afford a flat, to command a desire, or to publish writing that offended
J. C. Squire's idea of the beautiful, but the quoted past is affordable
and available. The heavy monuments of culture turn out to be quick
and mobile as well as radiant. The weak currency of postwar modernity
is challenged by the gold standard of poetic tradition--in place of
banknotes, footnotes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A waste land is dry and barren, but it is also an open space, the
space cleared in the fifth part of the poem which offers a desert and
a culture, a dry land and a moistly fertile tradition. At the last the
poem devastates the urban vortex of sex, money and J. C. Squire, and it
compensates with Dante, Tennyson, Kyd. It enacts a depletion of social
life and a saturation of cultural life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Is this right, or is this left? You can turn it as you please for another
one hundred years. But for those of us who believe that, in Squire's
time and our own, dire threats come from the attempt to regulate the
morality of literature and to police the freedom of experiment, <I>The
Waste Land</I> remains not a defeatism but a defiance.

Leonard Diepeveen discusses Eliot's management of his reputation through
the active construction of an audience responsive to his forms of
difficulty. Diepeveen reconstructs Eliot's tactic of creating "a small,
qualified audience of good readers for modern writing. They form part
of a small group who are willing to undergo the hard work and training
required for reading modern writing, which is difficult, but necessarily
so. The purpose of this narrowing down is not first of all to exclude
readers (although it certainly does do that), for the maligned audience
is not present. Rather, it is to encourage a small group of readers in
a tendency that was encouraged by the sorts of magazines they read: to
imagine themselves as part of a professional elite, as included in the

The disorienting political geography of Eliot's postwar world is captured
well by Cook, who unfolds the suggestions within the analogy between

In his analysis of City banking between 1890 and 1914, Youssef Cassis
describes the "concentration within the financial sector of the British
economy, due as much to the formation of giant banking and insurance
companies as to overlaps of directorships and multiple family ties
between the heads of companies large and small." He goes on to offer
this relevant portrait of the "modernist" banker:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The English banker at the heart of the financial centre of the world
finally bore little resemblance to the "big capitalist" of the imperialist
era, in whose hands both banking capital and industrial capital were
concentrated. He appears, on the contrary, to have been very much a
gentleman, half businessman, half man of independent means, who at
the limit devoted no more time to his bank than an aristocrat to the
management of his estate, their comparable lifestyles perhaps explaining
their social rapprochement. (<I>City Bankers, 1890-1914</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his 1923 essay entitled "Survey of New Tendencies in the Art of
St. Petersburg," the art historian and critic Nikolai Punin laid out the
terms and premises which have subsequently dominated critical writing
about the Russian avant-garde.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Punin's immediate dilemma was to find a descriptive vocabulary that would
 span the divide of the 1917 revolution, terminology that could connect
 the pre- and post-revolutionary avant-gardes. The term "Futurist" was
 to be rejected, he opined, because of its inherently mythologizing
 character; so also was the term "leftists" (<I>levye</I>), for "if
 by that we understand an approximate orientation to revolutionary
 materialism--this too is a myth." Instead, Punin urged, the core of
 the avant-garde experience in Russia was to be found elsewhere: its
 origins were to be firmly located in the evolution of French Cubism,
 or what he called "roughly speaking, the form of Braque-Picasso," while
 its subsequent development was to be traced in the adaptations made by
 Russian avant-garde artists, adaptations which had culminated in what
 he termed the two different "paths out" (<I>vykhody</I>) of Cubism's
 narrow concern with mimetic representation, paths which had been
 blazed by Malevich and Tatlin--yielding the distinctive and mutually
 antagonistic theories of Suprematism and the Culture of Materials.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Punin, in short, had penned a classical modernist treatment of early
 avant-garde experimentation, and its repercussions can still be felt
 today.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like the famous frontispiece that first adorned Alfred Barr's classic
study of <I>Cubism and Abstract Art</I> in 1936, a diagrammatic map of
modernist art in which every movement stemmed

<B></B>

from the parent stock of Cubism, Punin's revisionary account of Russian
modernism has become an indelible part of art history, its assumptions
taken for granted.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 To this day it continues to provide the basis for formalist histories of
 Russian modernism, accounts that reduce the pre-revolutionary avant-garde
 practices to so many anticipations of either Malevich or Tatlin, and
 that evaluate the art of the Russian avant-garde, whether identified as
 Cubist, Futurist, Cubo-Futurist, or Suprematist, in implicit opposition
 to another term that is often left unmentioned but remains no less
 potent, "Socialist Realism." Likewise, exhibitions which adhere to
 Punin's account of early Russian modernism, such as the recent show on
 "The Great Utopia: the Russian And Soviet Avant-Garde, 1915-1922,"
 recognize the heterogeneity and competitiveness that characterized the
 visual culture of Russia in the 1920s, yet fail to offer a more critical
 account of how such apparent diversity thrived.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 What has been lost sight of might seem obvious, but it is no less
 important for that. Punin's account of Russian modernism was not
 a neutral description, but a polemical contribution to recent
 debate about contemporary art, and while his emphasis on form may
 have legitimately reflected the concerns of some artists in 1923
 (Tatlin's, if not Malevich's), his historical genealogy would
 have simply mystified others. Indeed, to those who had directly
 experienced the artistic debates of 1913 and 1914, the terms that
 Punin discussed--chief among them, "leftists" ((<I>levye</I>) and
 "avant-garde" (<I>peredovoi</I>)--had typically been paired with
 epithets such as "rebellious" (<I>buinaia</I>) or "militant youth"
 (<I>boevaia molodezh'</I>), included in phrases which suggested social
 dimensions whose resonance simply vanished in Punin's account. To them,
 as to many scholars today, it may well have seemed that Punin had done
 little to explain the real continuities in the cultural practices of
 a generation which, within only a few years, experienced the collapse
 of the Romanov dynasty and the rise of the Soviet state.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To address the kinds of continuity that bind together the pre- and
post-revolutionary avant-gardes in Russia, it may be necessary to
turn away from the basic dichotomy between form and content which
is presupposed by Punin's account, to stop looking, in other words,
for evolutionary continuity either in formal developments or in some
putatively proto-revolutionary content that would span the period from,
say, 1910 to 1923, and instead to consider the sites and staging venues
in which debate about art, whether before or after the revolution, took
place. For a more critical and probing examination of the reception
context that shaped contemporary debate about art in this period may
also help us achieve a better understanding of the strange, even bizarre
political functions that artworks, and perhaps more importantly, debate
about art could assume during the pre-revolutionary years, functions
that may also be the most significant point of continuity with the
post-revolutionary years. Perhaps nowhere can we better trace some of
the distinctive features of that early reception context than in the
debate on art which was organized by Mikhail Larionov on 23 March, 1913,
a part of his effort to promote the group exhibition of which he was also
a part, named "The Target" (<I>Mishen'</I>). For at the center of that

<B></B>

debate are not only the two artists whom Malevich and Tatlin acknowledged
as their most important precursors, Natal'ia Goncharova and Mikhail
Larionov, but also Il'ia Zdanevich, a re who, though still
underappreciated, also played a key role in initiating a new program of
artist and audience interaction.

It may not be entirely an accident that a series of troubling
and troublesome encounters between the avant-garde and its various
audiences took place during the years 1912-1913. Certainly the years
immediately preceding these, the period that runs from 1907 through the
election of the fourth and last Duma in 1912, were ones that witnessed
unprecedented political debates, developments that included the real
beginnings of an organized workers' movement that was opposed to the
Tsarist regime, as well as a seemingly endless series of political
fractions now splitting and now realigning with one another at a
vertiginous pace.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
Art movements and groups might almost have been imitating their political
counterparts. In late 1911 "the extreme left wing" of the "Jack of
Diamonds" group seceded to organize the "Donkey's Tail" exhibition, led
by Mikhail Larionov.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Larionov, it has been reported, named the show after a
 mock-presentation perpetrated by an art critic at the 1905 <I>Salon
 des ind&eacute;pendents</I>; the waggish critic had supposedly created
 a painting by tying a brush to a donkey's tail, a prank which had
 inadvertently had a beneficent result, since ultimately it prompted
 a new and more fruitful dialogue between critics, artists, and the
 contemporary public.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
(See <A HREF="6.3sharp_1.html"> 1</A>.) In any case, it would
be Larionov who would play a leading role in organizing the critical
series of exhibitions and debates

<B></B>

that occurred during the period 1912 to 1914, extending from his crucial
role in the first "Jack of Diamonds" exhibition and his decision to
break with it (spring, 1911) to his organization of "The Donkey's Tail"
exhibition (April, 1912), to the mounting of "The Target" exhibition
(March, 1913), to his final experiences with the "No. 4" exhibition
(March, 1914), the latter so named to signal its place in Larionov's
own development.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
But it is especially in the second and third members of this sequence,
the "Donkey's Tail" and "Target" exhibitions, that Larionov first
responded to a perceptible shift in artist/audience relations, and, at
the same time, further accentuated that shift through a novel strategy
of provocation. That strategy, in turn, can help us make better sense of
the genuine continuity that binds together pre- and post-revolutionary
practice in the Russian avant-garde, continuity that is to be discerned
not in an ongoing exploration of the function of flatness within
the picture-plane, but in a probing engagement with the conditions of
rhetorical and representational empowerment. And that engagement, in its
turn, was inseparable from another and newer institutional structure which
came to accompany the more traditional exhibition--the public debate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To assess the achievement of Larionov and the Russian avant-garde,
however, requires that we engage in the difficult task of identifying the
audience with which he was engaged. It is no easy matter. To specify the
social backgrounds and interests of pre-revolutionary Russian audiences
for art is a hazardous affair, in large part because nearly all the
contemporary descriptions of the public which frequented exhibitions
and debates are mediated, written to serve the factional politics
of artistic groupings or to meet the demands of a largely partisan
press. Yet these genuine limitations in the historical sources are also
counterbalanced by the sheer abundance of audience descriptions, which
come from critics, artists, and writers, and which, taken together,
suggest certain unmistakable shifts in the ways that particular audience
constituencies were perceived across time. The indicators of class
and gender that crop up in such accounts can give an approximate if
inconclusive sense of actual audience make-up, and, just as important,
can help us gauge what was at stake for artists in the representation
of particular audience sectors.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All the evidence points to a motley constituency. Despite the relatively
high cost of admission to exhibitions (prices ranged from fifty kopeks
to five rubles), there was plainly a discernible level of worker
participation. We know, for example, that a group of workers visited
Goncharova's studio in 1913, and that the penny newspaper <I>Moskovskaia
kopeika</I> published reviews of avant-garde exhibitions, including an
account of the "Target" debate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Students typically purchased tickets at the lowest rate, which supports
 claims in the contemporary press that they constituted a substantial
 part of the avant-garde audience.

SRC="button/6.3sharp_2b.gif"></A>

Women were also a notable presence at exhibitions and the accompanying
debates. Their prominence within avant-garde cultural communities was
part of a wider demographic shift in the urban population, one often
commented on during the first decades of the twentieth century by writers
and critics such as Andrei Belyi

<B></B>

(Boris Bugaev), who detected a distinct change in the audience to
be seen at poetry readings in the wake of the 1905 revolution. The
change corresponds to what more recent historians have described as a
rejuvenation of the urban population, a vast migration to the metropolis
on the part of young people of both sexes, from peasants seeking factory
work to the <I>raznochintsy</I> or descendents of government bureaucrats,
lawyers, doctors, and lower echelons of the bourgeoisie.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
Rural and provincial youth were drawn to Moscow and St. Petersburg to
advance their education and careers, a trend in which artists themselves
also participated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
For women and Jewish artists especially, the early years of the twentieth
century witnessed a perceptible growth in preparatory channels in the arts
which provided alternatives to the traditional Academy, private studios
such as Elizaveta Zvantseva's in St. Petersburg, or Fedor Rerberg's and
Il'ia Mashkov's in Moscow.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
But it was the women from the provincial intelligentsia, the
<I>damy iz mysliashikh</I>, who especially attracted attention,
dominating the lecture halls of 1913 in greater numbers than the
young men, often overwhelming the invisible "middle bourgeoisie"
who so often seem to constitute the "public" that is disparaged in
avant-garde manifestos or parodied in the contemporary press (<A
HREF="6.3sharp_2.html"> 2</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Reconred by youth and gender, the new Muscovite audience lost much
 of its former class specificity, becoming increasingly amorphous and
 ill-defined, its social status an ambiguous reflection of the avant-garde
 community itself. To a certain extent, the debates that accompanied
 exhibitions became an occasion for both groups to engage in a public
 process of self-definition and self-determination, an occasion that
 may have been seized upon with especial eagerness by the audience. One
 anonymous critic, surveying the debates that took place in the spring
 of 1913, dubbed them "the eternal sphinx, the thousand-eyed monster, the
 many-headed chaos . . . What is [the public] looking for so diligently,
 so greedily, and [why do they] fill auditoriums in such great numbers?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is in the systematic promotion of avant-garde art through organized
debates that we encounter a troublesome conjuncture of social reality
and public representation. Because the debates proved so popular in
1912 and 1913, they were often dismissed as a form of mass culture. In
Russia, as elsewhere in western Europe, such events were viewed by art
critics and other supporters of traditional high culture as inferior,
commercialized, and self-serving--an unsavory collaboration between
audience and sponsor. At times they were represented as "feminine"
events, gendered in the sense that has become commonplace through the
work of Andreas Huyssen, who has shown how emerging mass media and their
new audiences in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries were
assimilated to pejorative constructions of femininity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
Yet this process was not purely rhetorical in nature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
Laura Engelstein, in her recent study of popular culture in Russia, has
demonstrated the degree to which the gendered criticisms of boulevard
literature were a response to expanded female readership.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
And a similar interchange between social reality and rhetorical
representation prevailed in the avant-garde debates of 1912-1913
in Moscow. Female spectators reinforced the gains made by women artists
(particularly Natal'ia Goncharova) and other public res, such as
Nadezhda Dobychina, who owned a prominent art gallery in St. Petersburg,
and Klavdiia Mikhailova, who owned another in Moscow. By 1913,
the year of the "Target" debate, critics were increasingly prone to
depict the cultural events in which women participated as essentially
inferior. Artists, in turn, would respond to this double gendering of
the debate forum by modifying their self-image and the terms of their
engagement with audiences.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the audience for the exhibitions and debates of 1912-1914 was
ambiguous and uncertain in its composition, so too was the social and
institutional space in which the debates took place. Though journalists
often charged that the debates were highly profitable for artists, their
very existence registered a much broader failure on the part of the
avant-garde, its inability to establish itself within a secure system
of patronage. Free-market mechanisms, at the same time, were plainly
inadequate to meet either the growing hunger for art on the part of an
expanding public or to cope with the apparent over-production by artists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Neither Moscow nor St. Petersburg could accommodate the increasing
 demand for exhibitions. Catalogues and manifestos required expensive
 and, for the most part, unavailable financial backing. The owners of
 lecture halls, moreover, sometimes imposed class and ethnic restrictions
 on the artist-lessees who rented them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
In effect, the lack of an adequate institutional infrastructure for the
arts created a reciprocal need for dialogue that would increasingly be
filled by the public debates: they were the only venue that assured
artists and audiences relatively direct and unmediated access to one
other. For while it is true that the proposed programs were screened by
censors and the actual debates evaluated by art critics, the performances
themselves remained open to improvisation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
And hence it was to be precisely here, in the improvisational dynamics
provided by the debate, that the Russian avant-garde would discover its
most fruitful forms of social and artistic practice.

The "Jack of Diamonds" debate, which took place on 12 February, 1912,
in Moscow in the large auditorium of the Polytechnic Museum (located
near the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture), was
the first avant-garde debate to generate a significant record of public
response. The sequence of lectures and audience reactions was widely
reported in the press, even in St. Petersburg.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 (The impending rift that would divide Larionov and Goncharova from
 the rest of the group was also given extensive press coverage.) As a
 result of the "Jack's" success in 1912, debates were deemed so necessary
 to the public promotion of art that subsequently the openings of most
 avant-garde exhibitions were scheduled so that they could be synchronized
 with a debate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Debates orchestrated and provided an outlet for adversarial exchanges
between artist and critic, artist and viewer. Typically, an event
would open with a series of lectures or propositions expounded by
the organizers, to which "opponents" responded, having been solicited
earlier by the sponsors or "chair." The audience might interject to
support, counter, or redirect speech at any time, and all parties
participated responsively. The anonymous critic cited earlier provides
a detailed account of these dynamics as they appeared in the debate
that was organized for the second "Jack of Diamonds" exhibition on 24
February, 1913.

The account shows that by 1913 the debate was turning into something of a
spectacle. But it was also providing audience members with opportunities
for active participation, shifting agency away from artists and critics
and toward an increasingly demanding audience. During the course of
the 1913 season of lectures, viewers were transformed from relatively
passive observers into active participants in the conflict

<B></B>

between artists and their debating respondents, and between artists and
the Tsarist authorities. Only a month later, at the "Target debate,"
members of the audience would begin to reclaim the prerogative of speech.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not only were audiences becoming deeply involved in the debates,
they were also becoming actively engaged in the issues under
discussion. Goncharova's 1912 diary provides a characteristic put-down
of the receptivity evinced by the average viewer of art; and yet between
the lines one can also see just how assertive viewers were becoming:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In general, music is an art form which the people can understand and which
they confuse less with life. In painting, sculpture, and architecture,
the public are like savages [<I>dikari</I>] and if they are not savages,
then they are very limited philistines [<I>meshchane</I>].
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Viewers, in other words, are actively transgressing the traditional
boundary between life and art, actively demanding that visual art
be an extension of their experience in ordinary life--a view that
was also propounded by members of the avant-garde itself, as when
Larionov distinguished between one audience that was hopelessly inept
and petit-bourgeois (<I>meschane</I>, the same term that was used by
Goncharova) and another that constituted his ideal public, one made up
of sign painters and the like (<I>maliary</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though both these characterizations tend to skirt, rather than address the
dilemma of how to appeal to a socially and politically diverse viewing
public, Larionov's statements are clearly calculated to accommodate
potential viewers, especially those least prejudiced by traditional
concepts of art and beauty. Over and over, his writings seek to persuade
audiences that they share a common interest with him in opposing official
art, while the contemporary exhibitions that he organizes demonstrate
his and Goncharova's view of the heterogeneity of Russian culture as it
has entered the twentieth century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
As a speaker and impresario, Larionov strives to convince viewers of
the necessity of cultural pluralism; while as a painter, Goncharova
provides the models for emulation. By 1913 her oeuvre has demonstrated
that national identity is no longer reducible to one tradition, ethnicity,
or class, as individual paintings refer the viewer now to French and
Italian modernism, now to the broadsheet, now to religious icons, now to
urban shop signs. Her eclecticism renders Russia's cultural and political
disintegration materially apparent to even the least sophisticated of
her viewers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Larionov's intention to reshape the conditions that marked the reception
of new art are already discernible in the names that he gave to his
exhibitions. Consider the "Jack of Diamonds" exhibition. At its most
obvious level, it cited the well-known playing card, and as such it
appeared on the society's stationery, posters, and other publications,
usage which Gleb Pospelov has traced in detail.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
But more covertly, it also alluded to the manner in which political
prisoners were graphically marked with an inverted square patch that
was popularly called "the ace of diamonds" (<I>bubnovyi tuz</I>), so
suggesting that the artist was also such an outcast. Since Larionov and
his colleagues

<B></B>

had in fact been dismissed from the Moscow School in April 1910, they were
further using the card/insignia to conflate their transgressions as art
students with political offenses to the state. And by adopting an everyday
object drawn from the realm of public signs, Larionov hinted at the extent
of his desire that debate about contemporary art and aesthetics be a truly
public issue. But the tension between public accessibility and artistic
invention, or between his adopting an everyday sign and his infusing
it with hermetic undertones or significance, would remain unresolved
throughout Larionov's subsequent attempts at promoting further debate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Throughout the period 1911-1914, Larionov sought to reinforce the
public dialogue that had been generated by means of the first "Jack
of Diamonds" exhibition. But instead of organizing formally as a group
and soliciting major critics for reviews, Larionov provided ever more
intense and direct public access to new art and its ideas through press
interviews, debates, and the publication of manifestos. When the majority
of the "Jack of Diamonds" artists voted to form a society in the autumn
of 1911, Larionov, Goncharova, and a few others decamped. In a series
of press interviews promoting the rival "Donkey's Tail" exhibition,
Larionov announced that his future exhibitions would no longer be
named in a predictable manner, nor would the exhibitors guarantee the
security of a constant platform. Press and public were to be set adrift,
deprived of "name recognition." He then went on to damn the ensemble of
prejudice, viewing habits, and expectations that deaden communication
in the exhibition space, revealing his preoccupation with a subject
that was also being taken up by his contemporary Viktor Shklovsky, who
viewed "the fossilization of the word" (<I>okamenenie slova</I>) as a
precondition for a poetics of estrangement.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Larionov, such freedom was to be achieved by evading as many of
the conditions for official legitimation as possible, and his refusal
to join the "Jack of Diamonds" society was informed by his awareness
of the bureaucratic procedures through which the Tsarist regime
managed and controlled the arts. The formal registration of a society
(<I>obshchestvo</I>) guaranteed the continued state regulation of the
cultural sphere. More insidiously, organizing as a society all but
required the complicity of the artist, since every step, from filing a
statement of intent (the society's program) and

<B></B>

statutes, had to be approved by the city governor's
(<I>gradonachal'nik</I>) office.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Still, though Larionov might deprive the state of procedural authority
 in organizing exhibitions, he could not bypass other forms of censorship
 that came with presenting art to the public: he, like anyone else, was
 required to submit advance copies of texts to be read at debates to
 the city governor's office, and all exhibitions had to be reviewed and
 approved by censors prior to opening. Due to the religious content of
 some exhibitions, on occasion the Holy Synod became involved on behalf
 of the state. Goncharova's first retrospective, held in St. Petersburg
 in March-April 1914, became a test case for avant-garde art,
 with some twenty-two religious paintings, which had initially passed
 the typographic censor, formally banned by the Spiritual Censorship
 Committee of the Holy Synod. Later the ban was removed and the paintings
 readmitted to the exhibition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Prior to the opening of the "Donkey's Tail" exhibition, paintings with
 religious subject matter were removed (including those later banned in
 1914), and, in addition, the city governor insisted that the name of
 the exhibition be abbreviated or changed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Thus, as one press reviewer pointed out, the "Donkey's Tail" became
 known officially as <I>O.Kh.</I> <I>(Oslinyi khvost</I>) "although it
 will still be understood as the Donkey's Tail."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 No doubt Larionov was well aware of these limitations when he publicized
 the exhibition titles that followed. The "Target" was vague enough to
 escape scrutiny, and as for "No. 4" (the name of Larionov's last group
 exhibition in Moscow)--who could object to a number? Larionov's tactics
 gain coherence when we consider them together. By exposing the devices of
 government censorship he heightened the viewer's sensitivity to police
 interference and other forms of government control as a precondition
 for the reception of his art.

In describing his reasons for naming the "Target" exhibition (also in
advance of the opening), Larionov again raised the stakes for audience
engagement (<A HREF="6.3sharp_3.html"> 3</A>). In one press
interview he asked his audience to recognize their mutual interests:
artist and viewer must approach each other on the same level. But this
time Larionov qualified the terms of their dialogue based on the prior
reception of the "Donkey's Tail," positioning the viewer as an opponent:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
This year we have called ourselves the "Target." Last year's name, the
"Donkey's Tail," was a provocation to the crowd. The "Target" is also a
provocation. It symbolizes the relation of the masses to us. Supercilious
laughter and curses fly at us as at a target, and those who can't face
us (raise themselves, <I>podniatsia</I>) can't look at our aims through
our eyes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The caricature ( 3) both anticipates and illustrates Larionov's
statement, and together the two demonstrate the potential for conflict
in his public address. For while Larionov's refusal to form a "society"
promises chaos as a counterweight to the state bureaucracy, his interview
affirms another kind of order. If not in the exhibition space, then in
the course of the debate itself, he reinforces his position as speaker
and agent who replaces dialogue with monologue. The caricature compresses
both moments and roles, Larionov's role at the center of the speech act,
and its consequence--the artist as target. The audience appears here as
an instrument of oppression,

<B></B>

like the unsympathetic critic who hurls abuse at the artist, or the
provocateur of factory and street.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To Larionov's apparent surprise, the "Target" debate did indeed
fulfill his prophetic announcements. The evening's theme was "The East,
Nationality, and the West." Zdanevich was to lecture on Italian Futurism,
Aleksandr Shevchenko on "Nationalism versus Western Epigonism," and
Larionov on Rayism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 During Il'ia Zdanevich's lecture on Futurism, in which he brandished a
 worn-out, lacquered house-slipper against the backdrop of a projected
 image of the Venus de Milo (declaring the slipper more beautiful
 than the statue), members of the audience shouted: "Get the slipper
 out--to hell with the slipper--<I>Kommivoiadzher</I>!" In the course
 of the respondent's rebuttal, Larionov approached the podium and cut
 off the speaker, which produced loud cries, boos, feet-stamping in the
 audience. Mikhail Bonch-Tomashevskii (playwright and official sponsor
 of the debate) tried to intervene, but Larionov stopped him as well by
 gesturing and poking with his umbrella. Finally, reacting to this, the
 audience attacked Larionov. A crowd climbed up onto the stage to defend
 the respondent's right to speak. They cursed, threw chairs, glasses,
 and carafes of water at several of the participants and tore down the
 projection screen. Terrified, Larionov responded by throwing the podium
 and chairs back at the audience. Silence fell when the police entered to
 stop the fracas. But the final word was Goncharova's; as Larionov and
 the others were led into the back room, she announced to the audience:
 "You, sirs and madams, are a herd of sheep!"

including these fragments of speech.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Most of the details regarding how much destruction occurred are recorded
 by Zdanevich himself in a long letter to his mother. His impression of
 the violence, keeping score of who did what to whom, clearly marks a
 turning point in the audience's orientation to the artist, as he writes

<B></B>

still in some shock: "Such passion and abuse I have never before heard
or seen. An amazingly stormy thing is the Moscow public."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The police closed the debate and filed a protocol on the participants
requiring that they appear in civil court for sentencing. Larionov was
tried on 17 October, 1913, found guilty, and fined under article 38 for
disruption of the peace, assault, and battery--crimes the prosecutor
ascribed to "hooliganism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 The artist explained in a press interview, as he would claim in civil
 court, that the audience had started the violence (a student had almost
 knocked him out). Similarly, Goncharova acknowledged that the "Target"
 signaled a problem in their mode of public address: she wrote in her
 artistic credo composed soon after the event that the forum of the
 debate is now useless and declared, "We must address the streets--the
 popular masses directly."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Records of the event in the press indicate that the artists underestimated
the level of hostility toward new art among their public. Perhaps they
misread the audience's mood or political sympathies: it is conceivable
that students opposed to liberal politics and art had arranged to pack
the hall (which seated 1,000), and it was to counteract these activities
that Goncharova may have wished to broaden audiences in order to include
the more politically diverse street population, but such artist/viewer
dynamics were really unsettling for quite different reasons. Here, viewers
participated by mimicking the exchange between artist and opponent on
stage: they acted on their own authority <I>as speaking subjects</I> to
oppose that of the artist-speaker. The

<B></B>

debate forum was appealing precisely for this potentially ambiguous
outcome. The format provided options for viewers to imagine themselves
as both speaker and addressee, depending upon their position and
interests. It sensitized viewers to the politics of agency, of
subjectivity and recognition of the other as mutually defining and
capable of structuring speech itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The debate had proved more than an ideal medium for interaction; it
 provided viewers with the possibility of restaging to their advantage
 the choices made in everyday life. Viewers might oppose state-sanctioned
 culture by identifying with the artist (as Larionov hoped they would)
 or if the viewer felt that Larionov had usurped the state's authority
 (or their own position as speaker) he/she could reclaim speech from the
 organizer. Whatever the participant's choice, the threat to the state
 and its interests lay in this debate's reversals of agency.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Larionov may well have redirected the viewer's interests to the immediate
concerns of the day rather than to the debate's ostensible themes. But
in his press announcement, as in his performance, Larionov orchestrated a
condition of spectatorship in which the viewers' interests are identified
with his own. He silenced the respondent, Alekseevskii, who in turn
refused to let Zdanevich respond to his comments. In reclaiming speech,
the audience reproduced Larionov's tactics: the group that jumped on
the stage had every intention of forcibly stopping Larionov's activity
as chair.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The shift in agency from artist to audience (and closure of speech) was
not an isolated occurrence at the "Target" debate. Just a week later,
Zdanevich wrote to Larionov to complain of his frustration in advertising
his next lecture on Futurism in St. Petersburg.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Inside the lecture hall his Futurist debate posters were defaced and
 torn up repeatedly (like those calling striking workers or the United
 Nobility to meet). Although the posters were placed behind protective
 glass, the glass was shattered and the posters removed. As a last resort,
 the announcements were put behind metal grilles. At both the "Target"
 debate and Zdanevich's lecture on Futurism, efforts to control the event
 anticipated and then mimicked the forms of official intervention. But
 if command of the podium finally precludes dialogue, what does this
 struggle for self-determination reveal about its cast of participants
 and their choices?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The pre-revolutionary era typically is not described as totalitarian,
yet censorship and political disempowerment under the system known as
the Third of June had extreme and specific consequences for culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 With overt forms of political activity possible only at tremendous risk
 after 1906, cultural events, particularly avant-garde performances,
 functioned as a parallel discourse of authority and resistance. Following
 each wave of revolt from 1905 through 1917, members of the intelligentsia
 emphasized the impact of political oppression and police brutality on
 all forms of social expression in Russia. Reflecting on the events
 of 1905 and the subsequent reactionary backlash, Sergei Bulgakov
 (in <I>Vekhi</I>, <I>Signposts)</I> denounced the role played by the
 Ministry of the Interior and police in the culture of the student youth,
 the very classes from which the avant-garde and their audiences emerged:
 "on the one hand it cripples them by depriving them of the possibility
 of useful work,

<B></B>

while on the other it helps cultivate in them a special spiritual hauteur,
a certified heroism, so to speak."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Zdanevich's somewhat exaggerated claims resonate with political
 overtones in light of Bulgakov's argument: he informed his mother
 that the police had taken his name, adding, "I think they will
 imprison Larionov." Although Zdanevich thrills to the retelling of
 his speech and of the audience's response, he anticipates official
 retribution. To Larionov he writes anxiously about his St. Petersburg
 lecture on Futurism: "A few students informed the police-superintendent
 that they will take me to civil court for being in breach of article 135
 (you have to sit for five months) for assaulting them in the manifesto
 to St. Petersburg."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These conditions for performance may explain the guardedness of
Goncharova's few statements on the debate: when questioned by the
prosecutor in court about who caused the violence, for example, she
admitted, "I did have to pick up broken glass, but I did not notice
anyone throwing anything."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 If artists sometimes miscalculated the intensity of audience
 participation, viewers knew exactly what was at stake. By wreaking
 havoc, they brought in the police who recorded accounts of the incident
 in a <I>protokol</I>, which would be used to prosecute those responsible
 for the debacle. In the world of art, at least in part because this was
 impossible in the world of politics, the audience could act on their
 moral-ideological commitments and provoke official recourse. Although
 avant-garde performances may have served a range of rhetorical and
 representational aims, they had real consequences for audience and
 artist alike.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The reversals of speech at the "Target" debate pose a problem of the newly
"feminized" sphere of popular culture described in the first pages of this
essay. How are we to understand feminine subjectivity in the context of
events that also repressed speech--the woman in the audience who throws
carafes of water at the debate-organizer? It is certainly possible that
women emulated the rules of speech that limited their access to it as
a way of signaling their participation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 But the issue of gender informs my account in yet another
 respect. Stolypin's Third of June decree also reconfirmed the basis for
 denying women suffrage. Women were probably the largest disenfranchised
 group among the urban population even if--depending on ethnic, cultural,
 and other factors--they experienced very different forms of exclusion. In
 urban Russia, artistic debates and other cultural events were among
 the more visible arenas in which women could express their views as a
 collective group. In 1908 women connected with the suffrage movement
 argued that participation in a wide range of organizations compensated
 to some degree for their exclusion from political franchise, though
 they continued to lobby the Duma for recognition of those rights.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 The "Target" performance suggests that it, too, was a surrogate
 for political action, since it reproduced the process of debate in
 the Duma: artists advanced their cases, then defended themselves
 against hostile opponents. Conflicts arose as much among members
 of the audience as between artist and audience, indicating that the
 debate accommodated various forms of dissent repressed by the state in
 other public venues. Thus, as prominent participants in avant-garde
 culture, if still on the margins, women managed to achieve a type of
 representation and accountability from the artist that was denied them
 elsewhere. Inasmuch as the debate forum reproduced and made apparent

<B></B>

potential reversals in speech, its dynamic was understood as anticipating
changes in society on a much broader scale. Critics who disparaged women's
participation in the debate forum did so because their new prominence
challenged the dominant (subject) position that men occupied in the
public sphere, in the world of art as in politics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By recognizing the presence of women within debate audiences as a
function of their absence from official political discourse, we are
better able to understand the problematic issue of the (a)political
nature of avant-garde art. Larionov's projects did not simply reflect
the politics of culture in Russian daily life, nor did they advance
a specific political agenda. Instead, the debates and exhibitions he
organized made questions of self-representation sensible and necessary
to his public--especially for its female constituents. If the interchange
between artist and viewer became systematized in the years 1912-1914,
the outcome remained unpredictable. But by anticipating the viewer's
interests and imagined position within the debate performance, the artist
managed to effect change within the public sphere, and this, in turn,
suggested to audiences that they might do the same. Avant-garde events
succeeded in mobilizing the spectator's subject-position on a range of
issues by denaturalizing the implicit hierarchy of speech. In this way,
art could be viewed as an analogue or even catalyst to political speech
more narrowly defined.

Larionov derived his program for the next season (1913-1914) from
the "Target" debate performance. These events were attuned even more
directly to the participation of women and went further to challenge
the formation of a pejorative view of femininity through reversals of
agency and gender roles. During the autumn of 1913 Goncharova, Larionov,
and Vladimir Mayakovsky (then an art school student) refashioned their
public personae in the image of their (female) audiences by painting their
faces and cross-dressing in order to provoke passerbys on the street (<A
HREF="6.3sharp_5.html"> 5</A>). This new viewer-mediated activity
extended the dynamic initiated by avant-garde exhibitions, debates, and
their public reception. Like the debates, these street performances

<B></B>

returned to viewers the message of social instability signaled by
their own participation in these events. Face-painting marked both the
feminine elite and the disenfranchised, the carnival barker, prostitute,
or the vanguard artist, thereby giving prominence to class and gender
hierarchies already overturned on the streets and in caf&eacute;s (<A
HREF="6.3sharp_6.html"> 6</A>). Larionov and Bolshakov made a
spectacle of their own marginal social status by sitting with faces
painted at the Filipov Caf&eacute; on Tverskoi Boulevard--a locale
noteworthy for the absence of members of the intelligentsia, and its
preponderance of lackeys, shopkeepers, and prostitutes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Goncharova also inspired caricatures in the press (<A
 HREF="6.3sharp_7.html"> 7</A>). Her unusual, sometimes masculine,
 attire was answered by Larionov's braided hair and his advocacy of
 chest-revealing men's clothing (he declared "masculine beauty must
 be exposed").
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Displays of class and gender difference exposed those markers of
 consensus (or conformity) through which individual and group behavior was
 regulated in late imperial Russia. Each of these events showed artists
 acting as public spokespersons--as they themselves were defined by the
 public--to reclaim the prerogative of representation held by police
 and courts. Seen as a form of speech and model of agency, avant-garde
 <I>&eacute;patisme</I> made the process of self-representation explicit
 to such a degree that it could be appropriated, reclaimed by their
 audiences both female and male. It is this model of appropriated
 authority, drawn from the artist-provocateur of the debate forum and
 the streets, more than any narrowly defined formal innovation or "way
 out of Cubism," that led to the extension of avant-garde projects to
 street and factory following the revolution.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All of which brings us back to Punin. For the kind of reciprocity
which Larionov and Goncharova incorporated into their modes of public
address adds a new dimension of meaning to avant-garde assertions of
autonomy and hence to his discussion of Tatlin and Malevich's work. In
the Russia of 1905-1917, the political background to assertions
of autonomy overwhelm the potentially self-reflexive conditions of
avant-garde practice which we have come to accept as the basis for
western modernism in

<B></B>

the writings of Charles Baudelaire, Walter Benjamin, and more recently,
Peter B&uuml;rger. Critical attacks in the press were meant to dissuade
viewers from attending avant-garde exhibitions and debates. The physical
and ideological strictures imposed on the public presentation of "new"
art verged on active suppression; court appearances and fines were a
serious disincentive to oppositional art and politics. In a regime where,
as one artist put it, "rights are everything," where individual and class
rights were defined through estate and civil service ranking, claims for
autonomy in art alluded to other expressions of independence (or forms
of defiance) to produce the kind of heroism/arrogance based in despair
that Bulgakov attributed specifically to the student intelligentsia.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Larionov's nameless, statuteless, exhibitions and his proclamation in the
 press, "We are free," affirms a need for public recognition of his own
 personal integrity as a corollary to artistic freedom. In his tireless
 self-promotion, in his art and writings, self-sufficiency of form
 supports an underlying concern for the relationship of the individual
 to the official regime. Boundaries between life and art and politics
 elide in the public response to Zdanevich's St. Petersburg lecture
 on Futurism. When someone in the crowd demanded to know Larionov's
 age and Zdanevich responded, "thirty-two," the viewer retorted "and
 he is still free?"--meaning both out of the asylum, and out of prison
 (<I>na svobode</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 This exchange points to extreme moments of provocation, when
 audience challenges to the artist's/state's authority might disperse
 or replace it, and equally, their calls to the police might lead to
 censorship, arrest, and trial. In the spring of 1914, with St. Petersburg
 periodically crippled by strikes, the city governor apparently had reason
 to anticipate one or the other scenario, for he refused to allow the
 usual <I>preniia</I> (debate) to follow Zdanevich's lecture on Futurism.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Likewise, Mayakovsky's public declamations of his lecture "Having Come
Myself" (<I>Prishedshii sam</I>), present the "self-sufficient word"
as an equivalent for self-identity: like his extended metaphors, the
persona/individual "Mayakovsky" is a transgressive re that defies
the limits of verse, page, the courts, and prison. Whether dressed as
a hooligan or garbed in his silk suit (<I>kofta-fata</I>), whether
reciting poetry on the streets or declaiming it in elite cabarets,
Mayakovsky mastered Larionov's strategy of public address. A version of
his poem "Take This!"(<I>Nate</I>!), which he recited at the opening
of the <I>Rozovyi fonar'</I> cabaret, reenacts the "Target" debate's
dynamic. Here, too, after a confrontation, the audience gains the upper
hand: "After the cabaret, the crowd carries its fat body along the dark
alleyway/ You will trample my chest with your dirty galoshes--I spit on
you . . . "
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 As with the "Target" debate, this event was closed by the
 police. According to Benedikt Livshits, when the poem was recited at
 the "Evening of Speech-Creators" Mayakovsky horrified the audience by
 directing each line to individual viewers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 By 1913 Mayakovsky had become the most inscrutable of Muscovites: he
 was a dangerous parody of the youthful, provincial viewers who were
 his public--and he was their idol, their role model.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "Target" debate had realized the kind of self-presentation that
Mayakovsky, Goncharova, and Larionov would later extend extend into
the streets, the relative autonomy of both artist and audience within
a repressive political system. And yet, as forms of provocation,
such avant-garde activities were profoundly ambiguous: they could
furnish occasions for restaging premises of respect and tolerance for
the other--or they could lead to verbal abuse and the suppression of
speech. Prior to the revolution, the artists' ambivalence accommodated
politically polarized and socially diverse audiences. Their goals
were primarily tactical, to create the conditions through which an
engaged public might comprehend and act on their stake in shaping urban
culture. And at least through 1917 their motives were mixed motives,
inspired by the utopian hope that easing and expanding access to art would
unite artist and audience, or speaker and addressee, but also animated
by a more sober, defensive recognition that the lack of patronage and
the marginal social status of the artist required them to sidestep the
bureaucratization of official culture by addressing a wider public through
forums located outside the exhibition halls and commercial galleries. But
speaking to audiences often entailed paradoxical consequences: frequently
it required that one speak on their behalf, that one define or redefine
their plural interests within a singular ideological freamework, one often
conditioned by shifts in art group patronage. Obtaining patronage, after
the revolution as before it, depended on artists' ability to articulate
through their art and performance a viable identity for the Russian
public--one that would be instrumental in effecting social and cultural
change. Post-revolutionary artists, facing the ongoing absence of moneyed
sponsors and continuing the strategies of the prewar period, were even
more motivated to constitute a coherent, unified public from diverse
audiences--to give the revolution a "voice," as Commissar Lunacharsky
famously phrased the initiative.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If we are to look for continuities in Muscovite avant-garde culture
before and after the revolution, the place to begin is in the Moscow
School of Painting,

<B></B>

Sculpture, and Architecture (post-1918, <I>Svobodnye masterskie</I>)
where the legitimacy of leftist fractions was never taken for
granted. Throughout the 1920s, artists of the same generation fought
a war of space and words to win over viewers and state sponsorship,
reproducing the debates and tactics that divided them as students at the
Moscow School in 1910-1914. Some of the most hostile challenges
to post-revolutionary avant-garde theory and practice came from those
who had long opposed the various left fractions. In his 1960s memoirs,
Aleksandr Gerasimov revives his grudge against David Burliuk, Mikhail
Larionov, and others for their control over the juries of the School's
end of year exhibitions where student artists vied for public visibility
before the First World War.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Similarly, Boris Ioganson's reminiscences of School activities dispute
 the hegemony of the pre-revolutionary avant-garde by casting its public
 initiatives as coersive and illegitimate. Repeating pre-revolutionary
 criticism of the left as "false-artists" he declares their prominence in
 1913 illusory, their art, commercially speculative. For most critics,
 in the studio as in the gallery, genuine authority and mastery was
 neutralized by the artist's dependence on western models.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Hence Larionov, Goncharova, and even David Burliuk (none of whom
 had any direct impact on the post-revolutionary debates after their
 emmigration) were invoked as the "false-left" by artists who had to
 maintain a different post-revolutionary, radical authority. In Moscow
 these recent emigr&eacute;s could be denounced as the prosyletizers of
 the "form Braque-Picasso" in order to expose the "new left" (Rodchenko,
 Stepanova, Popova, et. al.) as their heirs.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The avant-garde artist's preeminent role was compromised, however, by
a reliable corollary of his public address. To speak on behalf of the
viewer was to court the that the audience might be provoked to reclaim
the prerogative of self-representation, so facilitating the monopoly
and rationalization of culturally hegemonic interests, whether defined
by state patronage or by that of another elite. This ambiguity defines
modernism in Russia, whether during the last years of Tsarism or the
period of Stalin's ascent, and we can trace its turns in the promise
of access and the dynamics of public performance both before and after
1917. After the revolution avant-garde activities left room for doubt
regarding which of these outcomes might result. Lunacharsky acted on
the assumption that leftist rhetoric in the visual arts played to and
therefore reinforced Bolshevik party interests at a stage when at least
a semblance of political plurality was deemed useful. At stake for
the artist was control over cultural discourse in the public sphere,
in the academy, street, and journals; it is measured by the gradual
erosion of institutions such as the <I>Inkhuk</I> and <I>Ginkhuk</I>
that the pre-evolutionary avant-garde created after the collapse of the
empire. The battle within the <I>Inkhuk</I> in January through March
1921 may have been fought over how one distinguishes "construction" from
"composition," but everyone knew that these debates mediated claims to
power of a different order.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 To some degree the participants in these debates were aware that the
 question of who would be authorized to speak for the public could reduce
 easily to the question of who would be authorized to speak at all. Surely
 this is why the solutions of 1920-1921 were extreme ones, requiring
 artists either to leave the country (as Kandinsky did), or continually

<B></B>

to redefine the purpose of art's work as circumstances within Russia
changed. In the early 1920s the continuity of avant-garde rhetoric--as
much as their practices--became increasingly problematic for Bolshevik
leaders as new bureaucracies emerged, and as national-political
agendas shifted. Acting on their own authority to direct speech within
art institutions, avant-garde artists were censured again for their
"<I>impermissible</I> mixing of questions of life with questions of
the School as an institution"--Sergei Glagol's characterization of the
wrongheadedness of leftist student tactics at the Moscow School in 1910.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Avant-garde provocations were tolerated with occasional negative
consequences for the artist at least through the October revolution and
yet, by 1923, they could not be acknowledged even by Punin. After the
civil war a more devious sleight of hand was played out by those who had
formerly opposed the "left." Competing groups of artists now denied the
avant-garde project its public agitational function in order to support
the official view that "autonomy" (understood as personal integrity)
had been already achieved by the revolution.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 "Leftists" were rapdily transformed into "formalists," a bureaucratic
 coinage that served advocates of empire and autocracy well after the
 revolution, just as well as it had before. A more nuanced study of
 shifts in audience constituencies, and into the politics of private
 versus public life, will continue to break down monolithic views of
 Stalinist "totalitarian" culture and provide further links with the
 late imperial period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 So too, further research into the rhetoric of post-revolutionary
 avant-garde statements and projects will elucidate the extent to which
 the dynamics forged by Larionov were maintained. But the "Target" debate
 and its aftermath indicate how, as patron, the state (or Stalin) gained
 the space to manoeuver and, like the artist, to speak for the audience.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Retracing this process, it is not hard to see how, in the 1930s as in
 the 1910s, the artist again became the target.

Lunacharsky drew a distinction between agitation and propaganda by
emphasizing the role art played: agitation "excites the feelings of
the audience and readers and has a direct influence on their will." He
describes the successes of Leftist rhetoric in terms of the artist's
ability to persuade viewers of their common agenda. Further in the
essay he connects this goal of communication with the development of
the collective will of the masses to "unite everything in a common
act." By 1918 art has already become "the expression of national
ideas and feelings--ideas and feelings that are Revolutionary and
Communist." Anatolii Lunacharsky, "Revolution and Art" (Revoliutsiia

Boris Groys, <I>The Total Art of Stalinism: Avant-Garde, Aesthetic
Dictatorship, and Beyond,</I> trans. Charles Rougle (Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1992). That Stalin finally usurps authorship of the
avant-garde project seems acceptable to me, although the avant-garde's
system of aesthetics was not as coherent as Groys makes it out to be. In
reducing a heterogeneous pre-revolutionary avant-garde to the goals
and creative visions of Malevich/Tatlin/Rodchenko, Groys misrepresents
its complexity and contradictions. Stalin's sleight of hand is better
understood as a function of the cultural politics of the 1920s that
Groys describes rather than as a quality or program that inheres to the
pre-revolutionary avant-garde itself. For another insightful study into
the shift in authorship (Stalin replacing the artist) that occurs in
the early 1930s see Margarita Tupitsyn, "Szenarien der Autorenschaft,"

In October 1994, I was invited by the Whitney Museum of American Art to
develop a proposal for an exhibition in the Museum's series "Collection
in Context."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The series, which began in June, 1993, with an exhibition on <I>Edward
 Hopper in Paris</I>, has consisted of shows "featuring key works in
 the Whitney Museum's Permanent Collection," with the intention "not to
 isolate the works exhibited, but rather to set them in two different
 but related contexts: first, as products of their original time and
 place; second, in terms of their relevance to contemporary critics and
 today's audiences."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 The exhibitions have been conceived and organized by outside curators,
 scholars, and artists; they are displayed in a single room (about 40
 feet by 23 feet in size) on the first floor of the Museum, typically
 running for about three months each. Other themes of exhibitions in the
 series include <I>Gorky's Betrothals</I>, <I>A Year from the Collection,
 circa 1952</I>, <I>Joseph Cornell: Cosmic Travels</I>, and <I>Breuer's
 Whitney--Anniversary Exhibition</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My invitation encouraged me to develop a proposal that would bring
feminist scholarship to the project. Since my own interests are primarily
in art of the early twentieth century, I decided to focus on women artists
from that period whose work was prominent in the collection when the
Museum opened in November, 1931. It became clear that this would involve
looking at social networks and art circles connected with Gertrude
Vanderbilt Whitney and her assistant (and later the first Director of
the Museum), Juliana Force, and particularly the Whitney Studio Club,
which operated from 1918 to 1928. Eventually--this was rather an extended
process, depending

<B></B>

on visits to New York and finding time between other commitments--I
submitted a proposal in January, 1996, suggesting an exhibition of
the work of some of these women artists--sixteen works, by fourteen
artists. After another delay (and a change of curator at the Whitney), I
arranged to go to New York and look at the works themselves. (So far, I
had only been able to look at reproductions at the Museum. All the work
I was interested in--and this itself is part of the story--had long been
in storage in the Whitney's warehouse in downtown Manhattan.) This visit
to look at the paintings, which I did in the company of the Curator
of the Permanent Collection, proved to be more or less decisive. In
short, our joint assessment seemed to be that the work simply did not
merit exhibition. I postponed the decision for a few months, but more
or less abandoned any idea of doing this show--at least at the Whitney
Museum--by early 1997.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The story of the non-materialization of the exhibition is, I think, an
interesting one, and one that raises many questions. The point is that in
retrospect (and actually very soon after these events) I began to question
this ostensibly "aesthetic" judgement. On a couple of occasions I showed
slides of the work in the context of talks I gave on the subject, and
each time at least some of those present expressed real interest in the
images and encouraged me to pursue the idea of an exhibition. I started
to ask myself what was involved in the assessment of these paintings as
uninteresting or second-rate. It occurred to me, too, that the conditions
under which we had viewed the works were far from ideal--having them
taken from storage and propped on the floor by a couple of the warehouse
employees, all the time aware that each request meant more work for them
(though they were certainly willing and helpful, and I'm sure this was
a normal part of their everyday job). As a novice curator (I had only
organized one other exhibition), I was also aware that I was deferring
to some extent to the judgment of the Whitney curator who was with me.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Looking back on it, I realized that my disappointment in the work
 was--at least amongst other things--very much a product of my own
 aesthetic (modernist) prejudices, which coincided with, and were
 strongly reinforced by, those of the Whitney (here, in the person of
 the curator). Not long after my visit to New York to view the work, the
 art critic of the <I>New York Times</I> wrote a scathing and sarcastic
 review of the current exhibition in the "Collection in Context series,"
 which showed the work of Raphael Monta&ntilde;ez Ortiz, in which he
 dismissed the academic pretensions of its curator and responded to his
 description of the artist, in the accompanying brochure, as "one of
 the central res in a now-forgotten international movement" with
 the comment "It certainly is."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The last thing I wanted, of course, was a review of an exhibition of
 the "Whitney women" which both denigrated the work and at the same time
 implied that the display of such second-rate work was the consequence
 of misguided feminist revisionism. But the fact that I was already
 predicting such a review was, I now think, a measure not so much of
 my uncertainty in the face of art-world experts, but of my collusion
 in what has been, for the past half-century, the aesthetic orthodoxy
 in the history of art--namely, the elevation of modernist and abstract
 art over realism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 The work that I was interested in, and which I proposed including in
 the small exhibition,

<B></B>

was realist painting, in the relatively progressive style of the Ashcan
School but not at all influenced by the more avant-garde developments
(cubism, fauvism, Futurism) already well established in Europe and
visible in the work of other New York artists as early as 1910.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 It became clear that my project, which started out as the rather
 unexciting one of feminist retrieval (reclaiming women artists "hidden
 from history"), might not be about gender at all, since the post-war
 modernist orthodoxy marginalized realist work by men in just the
 same way.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 In this essay, I relate the progress of my research and thought as it
 developed, and in particular the ways in which the question of gender
 was superseded first by sociological questions of patronage, networks,
 and social influence, and then by the broader issue of the historical
 development of key institutions and their aesthetic ideologies. Finally,
 inspired by the recent work of feminist scholars of modernism and
 modernity, I came to see that this was, after all, very much a feminist
 project, though not in the way I had at first envisaged. If we can
 characterize feminist revisionism (rediscovering women artists and
 incorporating them into the canon) as 1970s feminism, then I would say
 (at the risk of equally broad generalization) that the Whitney project
 became one of 1990s feminism--the analysis of gender construction as
 it operates in the field of modern art and its institutions.

The Whitney Museum of American Art opened in November 1931. Its founding
collection consisted of nearly 700 works of art, about 200 of them
acquired since January 1930 when plans for the Museum were officially
announced.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 All of these works had been in the collections of Gertrude Vanderbilt
 Whitney, the Museum's founder, and Juliana Force, her assistant since
 1907 and the Museum's first Director (1931-1948), and most had been
 acquired in the context of the three institutions which had preceded
 and resulted in the opening of the Museum in 1931--the Whitney Studio
 (1914-1918), the Whitney Studio Club (1918-1928), and the
 Whitney Studio Galleries (1928-1930). The first of these, the
 Whitney Studio, was founded by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney (who had
 herself been working as a sculptor in a studio in Greenwich Village since
 1907), initially as a place to organize an art exhibition for the benefit
 of war relief (<I>ROES</I>, 111). For the next four years, Whitney and
 Force organized exhibitions at the Whitney Studio, wide-ranging in
 their scope, but emphasizing the work of young American artists. In
 1918, they found new premises (a brownstone on West Fourth Street),
 which they opened as the Whitney Studio Club, with Juliana Force as
 its director. The new Club combined exhibition space with recreational
 rooms and a library, and it continued an active exhibition program for
 the next ten years. It was disbanded in 1928, having grown too large,
 and was replaced by the Whitney Studio Galleries, with the narrower
 aim of exhibiting and selling work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 This in turn was closed in 1930, once the decision was made to found
 a permanent Museum.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The catalogue of the collection, published at the Museum's opening in
1931, includes about 500 paintings (oil and watercolor), 115 pieces
of sculpture, and "drawings, etchings, lithographs and works in other
mediums, to the number of seven hundred," all, of course, the work of
American artists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Some of the names listed 

<B></B>

are familiar today, including some "Ashcan" painters and other realists
associated with the Art Students' League (George Bellows, William
Glackens, Robert Henri, Ernest Lawson, George Luks, Reginald Marsh,
Kenneth Hayes Miller, John Sloan, Arthur Davies and Maurice Prendergast)
and one or two American modernists (Stuart Davis, and one work each by
Marsden Hartley and Georgia O'Keeffe). There is one Edward Hopper, and
a few works by Precisionist artists Charles Sheeler, Elsie Driggs, and
Charles Demuth. Most striking is the fact that many of the most prominent
names in the catalogue (that is, the artists with several works in the
collection) are not well known--Arnold Blanch, Lucile Blanch, Ernest
Fiene, Emil Ganso, Anne Goldthwaite, Leon Hartl, Joseph Pollet, Paul
Rohland, Katherine Schmidt, Niles Spencer, and a few others. These are
the names, though, that appear with great frequency in the records of
exhibitions held at the Whitney Studio, the Whitney Studio Club and the
Whitney Studio Galleries in the sixteen years leading up to the founding
of the Museum.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In other words, they are the names of the artists supported by Whitney
 and Force during that period, whose work was often bought at their
 Whitney exhibitions, and who were, for the most part, active participants
 in the Club and regular members of the social networks in which Juliana
 Force in particular operated. They were connected with one another
 through their artistic training (in many cases, at the Art Students'
 League) and through social contact and, in some cases, marriage. (The
 artists Peggy Bacon and Alexander Brook were married to each other, as
 were Katherine Schmidt and Yasuo Kuniyoshi, all of them central players
 in the Whitney enterprise.) Many of them had summer homes in the art
 colony in Woodstock, in up-state New York, particularly in the period
 beginning in the early 1920s; Juliana Force herself was a frequent
 visitor there (<I>ROES</I>, 230).
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 What they also had in common was a commitment to a contemporary realist
 aesthetic, learned in many cases from their teachers at the Art Students'
 League (Henri, Sloan, and Miller).

I had begun research for this project by identifying the women artists
in the Museum's collection who were active in the years leading up to
the founding of the Museum in 1931. Since I was using the Museum's card
index, which only includes works currently owned by the Museum, this
did not give me access to those few women artists whose work has since
been de-accessioned--these I discovered later, in looking at the 1931
catalogue and at other records.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 I also decided to limit my focus to works made in the period, but also
 <I>acquired</I> then (that is, in 1931 or soon after), since my interest
 was in the events and practices of the Whitney institutions at the time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 So, for example, a work by the artist Florine Stettheimer, though
 painted in 1931, was not included because it was not acquired by the
 Museum until 1973.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 I was also well aware that Juliana Force engaged in a program of
 rather energetic "corrective buying" immediately before the opening
 of the Museum. The inclusion of one work by Georgia O'Keeffe (<I>Skunk
 Cabbage</I>, 1922), bought by Force in 1931 and followed by the purchase
 of two more O'Keeffes the next year and a fourth in 1933, has to be seen
 in a context in which the prospect of a permanent museum of American
 art, something very different from a private collection or a studio club,

<B></B>

forced the recognition of important gaps in the collection and of the
necessity to do something about this (<I>ROES</I>, 303-4).
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Avis Berman, a historian of the Whitney Museum and of Juliana Force's
 role in its development, records the results of Force's hectic
 "shopping trips" over a period of a couple of years, and of her
 acquisitions. Particularly interesting was the accommodation reached
 with Alfred Stieglitz and the American modernist artists associated with
 his gallery--O'Keeffe, Marin, Hartley, Dove. The absence of friendly
 relations between Whitney and Stieglitz over the years had long been
 clear (Stieglitz had opened his first gallery for modern American art,
 The Photo-Secessionist Gallery, or 291, in 1905), as had the radically
 different aesthetic commitments of the two institutions and their
 associated artists. But in 1931 Juliana Force was making a serious
 attempt to rectify imbalances in the Whitney's collection, which meant
 the purchase of more avant-garde, European-influenced work. Nevertheless,
 this last-minute corrective buying, though obviously important in the
 formation of the Museum, should not obscure either the dominant tendency
 in the Whitney circle or the particular sociology of artistic production
 in the pre-1931 period; nor, in the end, did it make a great deal of
 difference to the continuing practices of the Museum, once founded.

I compiled a list of twenty-four women artists, active in the Whitney
circle in the period before the opening of the Museum. Seventeen of these
women had work included in the catalogue at the opening of the Museum in
1931. Interestingly, too, eleven of the twenty-five were also included
in the 1949 Whitney exhibition which served as a memorial to Juliana
Force (who had died the previous year) and which still manifested a
predominantly realist aesthetic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 (See <A NAME="app" HREF="#appendix">Appendix</A>.) Most of these artists had an active exhibition
 record with the various incarnations of the Whitney Studio. They
 were represented regularly in group shows, and several of them had
 one-person shows--in some cases, more than once. Molly Luce, Dorothea
 Schwarcz, Rosella Hartman (<A HREF="6.3wolff_1.html"> 1</A>),
 and Georgina Klitgaard each had exhibitions of their work. Katherine
 Schmidt (<A HREF="6.3wolff_2.html"> 2</A>), Lucile Blanch (<A
 HREF="6.3wolff_3.html"> 3</A>), Caroline Rohland, and Dorothy
 Varian (<A HREF="6.3wolff_4.html"> 4</A>) had two one-person
 shows; and Nan Watson (<A HREF="6.3wolff_5.html"> 5</A>)
 had four one-person shows. Peggy Bacon, who exhibited her prints
 and drawings regularly at other New York galleries in the 1920s and
 1930s, was included frequently in the Whitney Studio Club exhibitions
 (<A HREF="6.3wolff_6.html"> 6</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 It is clear that women artists were able to thrive in the context of the
 Whitney Studio Club. According to Berman, women accounted for between
 30 and 35 percent of works exhibited in the Whitney exhibitions and
 the Whitney and Force collections. She quotes Juliana Force's nephew,
 who stresses his aunt's firm belief in the equality of women: "She
 believed in applying the same standards to men and women alike. She
 would never use the once-familiar 'aviatrix' any more than she would
 say 'painteress.' Years later, as a museum director, she refused
 to hold special exhibits for women artists on the grounds that this
 was condescending to women" (<I>ROES</I>, 134). (This is not to say,
 however, that the usual processes of gender selectivity were not in
 play at the time, including in the critical response to the Whitney's
 activities. The art critic, Henry McBride, reviewing the opening
 exhibition of the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1931, does

<B></B>

not mention a single woman artist by name, but makes a point of listing
twelve male artists who are, for him, the stars of the show.)

If the relative success of women artists in the Whitney circle is
apparent, then so is the (relatively) gender-neutral decline of their
reputations in later years. Soon after the 1949 Memorial Exhibition at the
Whitney, in which several of them were still exhibiting work, the museum
became far more receptive to European-influenced modern art, including
abstraction. The international success of Abstract Expressionism in the
1950s rendered it imperative that <I>the</I> Museum of American Art play
an active part in exhibiting and acquiring the work. Under the next two
Directors after Force's death in 1948--Herman More (1948-1958)
and Lloyd Goodrich (1958-1968)--the Whitney Museum's aesthetic
was radically transformed. More wrote, in the foreword of the 1950
Annual Exhibition catalogue: "If modern art in its many forms, such as
expressionism, abstraction, and surrealism, predominates in the show, it
is because it is the leading movement in art today, and has influenced
the greatest number of younger artists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 In 1954, the Museum moved from its original location in adjacent
 townhouses in Greenwich Village to a building on West 54th Street, near
 the Museum of Modern Art (and in fact owned by the

<B></B>

Museum of Modern Art).
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 The display of works in the context of a more "modern" building
 coincided with the move towards a conception of "modern art" which
 was defined by the Museum of Modern Art (and originally by its first
 Director, Alfred Barr) and already more or less established as the
 art-historical orthodoxy in America and Western Europe. The narrative
 of this story, elaborated in Barr's famous diagram in the 1936 Museum
 of Modern Art Catalogue, <I>Cubism and Abstract Art</I>, and developed
 by his successors (critics and curators in New York), traces a line
 of development from Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, to Cubism,
 Surrealism and, eventually, Abstract Expressionism (and, thus, from
 Paris to New York).
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Among the obvious consequences of the acceptance of this narrative is the
 marginalization of realism in the twentieth century. After the second
 World War, the Museum of Modern Art story was not only the dominant
 one; it was, at least in educated circles in the art world, the only
 story. The Whitney's belated subscription to this version of the canon,
 and to the aesthetic which upheld it, had the practical corollary of
 consigning a good deal of the work of the Whitney Studio Club members
 to storage. This reassessment affected the work of men as well as women
 artists. Paintings by Whitney Studio Club artists Alexander Brook,
 Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Guy P&egrave;ne du Bois (<A HREF="6.3wolff_7.html">7</A>) suffered the same

<B></B>

fate, with the ascendancy of modernism over realism in the post-war
Whitney Museum.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the two decades before the founding of the Whitney Museum, it
was still possible to pursue and promote an aesthetic other than the
Euro-modernist version. Certainly modernism was already much in evidence
in New York during the years of the Whitney Studio and the Whitney
Studio Club. Stieglitz's gallery, after all had been founded in 1905,
and remained an important exhibition space for modernist painting and
photography. The 1913 Armory Show had introduced European avant-garde
movements--notably cubism and fauvism--to American audiences, and had also
included work by American modernists (Marin, Hartley, Morgan Russell,
Davis, and others). In 1920, Katharine Dreier and Marcel Duchamp had
founded the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme, "America's first museum of
modern art," which showed European and American modernist art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 In 1927, A. E. Gallatin's Gallery of Living Art opened at New York
 University, showing Gallatin's own collection of modern art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 And the Museum of Modern Art was itself founded in 1929, based on the
 private collections of European modern art of Lillie Bliss and Mary
 Sullivan, and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller's collection of American folk
 and modern art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Several galleries and

<B></B>

dealers in New York exhibited modernist art (the Daniel Gallery, the
Montross Gallery, the Modern Gallery, Kraushaar's and Wildenstein's
among others).
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Collectors like John Quinn and Duncan Phillips were buying European and
 American modernist works in the first decades of the century. At the
 same time, it was entirely possible in this period for a non-modernist
 aesthetic to flourish alongside these developments. Gertrude Vanderbilt
 Whitney's taste was for early twentieth-century American realism, of a
 type that was in fact considered progressive in its time. She bought
 four of the seven paintings sold at the ground-breaking 1908 Macbeth
 Gallery exhibition of The Eight--the so-called "Ashcan" painters of
 realist urban scenes (Henri, Luks, Sloan and others) who were showing
 work very different from, and opposed to, the prevailing academic
 traditions. At the Whitney Studio and the Studio Club, she and Juliana
 Force continued to exhibit the work of such artists, as well as the
 younger artists who had studied with them. Their taste, then, though not
 avant-garde, was forward-looking in terms of then current established
 aesthetic conventions. Their hostility to modernism, too, should not be
 exaggerated. (Berman suggests that the Whitney Studio Clib is better seen
 as anti-Stieglitz, rather than anti-modern, <I>ROES</I>, 223). Whitney
 herself was involved in planning for the radical 1913 Armory Show. She
 supported the photographer Edward Steichen in the rather peculiar court
 case in 1926-27, in which he attempted to convince the U.S. Customs
 that Brancusi's ultra-modernist sculpture, <I>Bird in Space</I>, was
 in fact art, and therefore exempt from import duty; Whitney took over
 the appeal and met all Steichen's costs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The Whitney Studio Club also exhibited and supported some modernist
 artists, including Stuart Davis and Oscar Bluemner, and sponsored
 individual modernist shows (for example, Mario de Zayas's important
 Picasso exhibition at the Whitney Studio Club in 1923). But the overall
 tendency is clear, and all the more so in the light of those concurrent
 developments in the New York art world. As Adam Weinberg says, "In a
 cursory examination of the Whitney's exhibition program, publications,
 and acquisitions from the founding of the Whitney Studio Club in 1918
 until Juliana Force's death in 1948, the record does substantiate an
 overwhelming emphasis on realist artists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the Whitney Studio Club, the high visibility of women artists, and
their success in terms of exhibition and sales, has to be seen as the
product of a complex social network of friendships, patronage, and
personal relationships.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Both the access to Force and Whitney (and thus to exhibition and
 sales) and the shared aesthetic were related aspects of these close
 interactions. Several of the artists were founder members of the
 Whitney Studio Club (Schmidt, Varian, Watson, Bacon, Dwight; Isabel
 Bishop joined in 1920). The Woodstock connection, already referred
 to, was an important structural feature in the interplay of social and
 professional relations, as was the shared history of training at the
 Art Students' League (where Schmidt, Bacon, Varian, Luce and Bishop
 had studied, as well as Yasuo Kuniyoshi and Alexander Brook).
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Mabel Dwight worked as secretary-receptionist for Force at the Whitney
 Studio Club in its early days; Katherine Schmidt ran the Club's evening
 sketch class for two years; and Alexander Brook (the husband of Peggy
 Bacon) acted as Force's

<B></B>

assistant from 1923 until 1927 (<I>ROES</I>, 157, 195-96, 239). The
artist Nan Watson (who had four one-person shows, and who had the fourth
largest number of works in the collection when the Museum opened in
1931--a total of eight) was the wife of the critic, Forbes Watson, who
not only maintained close connections with the Whitney circle but was
also Juliana Force's lover for twelve years, from 1919.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 A sociology of cultural production and reception in the Whitney circle
 would certainly focus on the patterns of influence and decision
 which emerged from these and other connections, as well as on the
 particular relations between the Whitney artists and the many other
 New York art institutions (galleries, critics, schools) against which
 they were defined. It is likely, though, that what now seems the rather
 unprofessional (though perhaps not so unusual) set of art-world relations
 in which the Whitney artists operated provided the very conditions in
 which women could succeed on the same terms as men.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The ascendancy and post-war consolidation of the "Museum of Modern Art
narrative" had the effect of producing an impressive collective amnesia
in American visual culture. The history of early American art has been,
for the past fifty years, the story of the emergence and eventual success
of the American avant-garde. The more comprehensive surveys of American
art do include discussion of American Impressionism and the "Ashcan"
painters, though artists in the Whitney circle are rarely considered.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Even in these accounts, though, the realist painters of the "Ashcan"
 group are often treated as a necessary, but quickly surpassed, stage on
 the way to modernism. This statement, from a catalogue introduction to
 a 1997 exhibition of the work of The Eight (the exhibitors in the 1908
 exhibition) is a typical account of this relationship:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
By breaking away from and rebelling against the narrow confines
of traditional art typically displayed at the National Academy of
Design, Henri and his seven colleagues effectively opened the door for
more innovation in painting in the United States. By exhibiting more
experimental, progressive work to a wide public audience, The Eight
helped created an environment more willing and able to accept the shocking
trends which would affront the American art community at the Armory Show
in 1913. The Eight's exhibition helped build an effective bridge between
the art  of the nineteenth century and the Modernism of the twentieth.

With the exception of general survey books on American art, until recently
most publications dealing with the early twentieth century have focused
on American modernism--the Armory Show and its consequences, the Stieglitz
artists, and the varieties of American modernism in the 1910s and 1920s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 (The 1930s return to realism, for example in work associated with
 the Works Projects Administration--an agency of the U. S. government
 created in 1935 to provide jobs, especially in public works--and with
 regionalism, is another matter. But even this work, impossible to ignore
 or write out of American art history, is invariably treated as a sub
 plot--perhaps even an embarrassing one--to the main story).

The Whitney Museum itself was so radically transformed in the years after
Juliana Force's death that in 1960 a group of realist artists wrote to
the Director (then Lloyd Goodrich) about the lack of representational
art in the Museum's recent annual exhibition, pointing out that of
the 145 paintings included "102 were non-objective, 17 abstract and 17
semi-abstract, leaving only 9 paintings in which the image had not receded
or disappeared, whereas in former exhibitions the Whitney Museum showed
a much larger cross section of style and method in work in progress."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 As Adam Weinberg reports, Goodrich's reply admitted that "the abstract
 trend is dominant, particularly among the younger generation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Although Weinberg is concerned to stress the Whitney's long-standing
 openness to both realist and modernist (including abstract) art, the
 context of his essay is evidence of the Museum's postwar collusion
 in the privileging of modernism. It appears in a catalogue for a 1997
 exhibition at the Whitney, the third in a series called <I>Views from
 Abroad</I>, in which museum directors from other countries have been
 invited to curate work from the Whitney's Permanent Collection. This
 particular show was organized by Nicholas Serota and Sandy Nairne of the
 Tate Gallery in London and, as the <I>New Yorker</I> put it at the time,
 "This is American art viewed through eyes used to looking at Francis
 Bacon and Lucien Freud."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The curators entitled the exhibition "American Realities," and a
 major part of its project was to restore the rative tradition to
 visibility. Reflecting on the fact that the Tate had earlier displayed
 an exhibition of the work of American artists which had been organized by
 the Museum of Modern Art, Serota explains his interest in its omissions:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The exhibition played a small but influential part in transforming the
European assessment of American art from provincial and peripheral
to revolutionary, highly influential, and central to developments
worldwide. But this perception clearly obscured the existence of an
earlier, prewar cosmopolitanism, which manifested different forms of
radical modern ration . . . This led us on a track of the "real" for
"Views from Abroad." Admittedly using the term in an elastic way, we have
explored the idea of bringing particular, sometimes neglected, works to
critical attention and reviving a broader view of modernism which does
not regard an interest in the re as being, by definition, antimodern.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>

Included in the exhibition, therefore, was work by du Bois, Sloan, Soyer,
Bishop, Luks, Marsh, and Driggs, alongside the more usual selection
of works by early modernists Dove, Hartley, O'Keeffe, and Avery, and
postwar modernists Pollock, Rothko, Kline, and Diebenkorn.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 The exhibition was itself, I believe, an indication of an interesting
 development in museum practice and associated art-critical discourses
 (and, not incidentally, art market sales) in the past couple of years,
 namely the beginning of a reevaluation of the realist and rative
 tradition.

<B></B>

where in the art world, has remained one founded in the story of
modernism and its postwar successors. There is some evidence of a
certain nervousness about the revival of the realist tradition, as two
minor anecdotes about my own Whitney proposal demonstrate. The first
was the suggestion made to me by the Whitney's curator that, although
an exhibition of the work of these women artists might not work for the
museum, I might propose it to the curator of a museum outside Manhattan.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 And the second was the rather surprising discovery that a year after my
 fateful (fatal) visit to New York to view the paintings, the Whitney
 did in fact mount a version of the show I was proposing, with the
 two differences that this was an exhibition only of works on paper by
 those women artists, and that it took place at the Whitney's branch in
 Champion, Connecticut.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 It seemed that the work was good enough for the provinces, but it could
 not (yet) be risked in New York City.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My inquiries into the invisibility of the "Whitney women" had quickly
made clear to me that this was not, after all, the feminist project
of rediscovering women artists who had been marginalized either in
relation to the conditions of cultural production or by the normal
practices of art-historical discourse--the project of the recovery of a
"hidden heritage."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 These artists worked on equal terms with men, and apparently with more or
 less equivalent success and visibility at the time. Their disappearance,
 both from the Whitney's own display and from official histories of
 American art in general, was not a matter of gender prejudice either,
 but rather a consequence of the resolution of competing aesthetic
 narratives, a resolution which sidelined the work of male realist artists
 in (almost) the same measure as that of women. In the end, the exhibition
 I proposed to the Whitney was not a specifically feminist project, but
 one whose conceptual underpinning had much more to do with foregrounding
 a sociology of cultural production--the relevance and centrality of
 social relations and networks in the production and reception of
 art. As I have said, the decision not to take this further was an
 aesthetic one, based on an assessment of whether the paintings were
 worth exhibiting. At the time, I tried to think about this assessment
 in the light of what we have learned from feminist criticism over the
 past couple of decades, in an attempt to identify any deeper prejudices
 which might be gender-related. Feminist art historians have demonstrated
 the ways in which aesthetic hierarchies are clearly gender-based, with
 work associated with women (still life and flower painting, for example)
 invariably being considered "decorative" or "lesser arts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Critical work in feminist aesthetics has alerted us to certain
 androcentric tendencies in Western philosophy of art (for example,
 the gendering of the opposition of the beautiful and the sublime, and
 the inseparability of the practical and the personal--including gender
 identity--from the aesthetic for the spectator of a work of art).
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 But there was no obvious difference in content or style between the
 work of the Whitney women and the paintings of Alexander Brook and Yasuo
 Kuniyoshi, nor did there seem to be any reason to suppose that questions
 of gender came into the appreciation or judgment of the works. The
 belated recognition that this was, after all, a feminist project followed
 instead from my subsequent doubts (and self-doubt) about the privileging
 of modernism over realism. The point is that the discourse of

<B></B>

modernism <I>is itself a masculinist discourse</I>. This means that the
marginalization of realism, though ostensibly an aesthetic move, is at
the same time fundamentally gendered. In this perspective, it does not
matter that some of the work thus denigrated happened to be made by men;
it is still gendered "feminine" by a discourse which produces modernism
as masculine. In the rest of this essay, I shall consider this question
of "the gender of modernism" as a way of returning to the Whitney women
and the problem of assessing their work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The recognition that modernism in the visual arts has always had
strong masculinist (and often misogynistic) tendencies is by now
well established. In an article first published in 1973, Carol Duncan
identified a preoccupation with virility in avant-garde painting in
the early twentieth century, an obsession which she relates to the
contemporary anxieties about the emancipation of women and their increased
participation in the public world of work and politics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 And much of Griselda Pollock's work has been concerned with addressing
 the question of "why the territory of modernism so often is a way of
 dealing with masculine sexuality and its sign, the bodies of women--why
 the nude, the brothel, the bar?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 In another context, Andreas Huyssen has explored the nineteenth-century
 discourses which produced modernism as male, in this case in opposition
 to a mass culture which was gendered female.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 These gendered discourses of early modernism were then definitively
 reinforced by the post-war narrative of twentieth-century art
 history, seen from the vantage-point of the international success and
 prominence of the New York School. As Ann Gibson has recently shown,
 the invisibility of women and minority artists among the Abstract
 Expressionists (and there were plenty of these who were active in
 the late 1940s and early 1950s) is the necessary by-product of the
 universalizing ideology of this movement and its associated critics.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
This universalism was delivered by men who aspired to be artistic
heroes. This claim, to which sympathetic contemporary viewers readily
responded and which subsequent historians have made specific, was not
seen as the movement's implicit story about itself, that is, as literary,
but simply as wondrous fact. . . . This notion established grounds for
the distinction that, in segregated America, only white heterosexual
males could attain: generating a universal product that could speak for
everyone. Women, African Americans, and avowed homosexuals could not do
that because their audiences would not accept their work as universal.

Michael Leja explains the andocentric nature of Abstract Expressionism in
terms of the type of subjectivity produced by its discourses, one founded
on a new image of "self" (the Modern Man subject, as he calls it) which
deployed notions of the "primitive" and the unconscious and which was
"profoundly gendered."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 The point then, as he explains, is

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
not to document the exclusion of women from Abstract Expressionism, but
rather to examine the processes and mechanisms by which that exclusion was
effected then and now. What made Abstract Expressionism so inhospitable
to artists who were

in Abstract Expressionist art.

The exclusion of women, then is a structural and discursive operation,
integral to the production and maintenance of a particular conception

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The re-writing of early twentieth-century American art from the point
of view of the 1950s--the project that I have suggested was involved
in the transformation of the Whitney's history--can now be seen as more
than a matter of aesthetic revision. The privileging of modernism in the
earlier period, in the production of a specific lineage for the New York
School, was also an exercise in engendering visual culture. In other
words, the marginalization of certain kinds of realist and rative
painting is the marginalization of the "feminine," a process which does
not necessarily have much to do with the question of whether the work
involved is by women or by men. This retroactive strategy has been able to
take up and restate those gender discourses around early modernism, with
their own tendency to equate the modern with the masculine. Although,
as Rita Felski has argued, the gender of modernity and of modernism
was relatively open-ended in the early twentieth century, so that the
androcentric discourses could still be contested and countered, and a
feminine/feminist "modernism" proposed, there is plenty of evidence of
what was to become the dominant narrative, in which the realist/feminine
was denigrated in relation to the modernist/masculine. This is clear in
the case of the contemporaneous establishment of the Whitney Museum and
the Museum of Modern Art. In an important and highly original study of the
contrasting display strategies of the two museums and their precursors in
the period 1913 to 1939, Evelyn Hankins has demonstrated the ascendancy
of the "modern" approach (the museum as white cube) in relation to the
"decorative" (moderne), the latter, characteristic of the Whitney's
displays, associated in contemporary criticism and discourse with the
feminine. In particular, the exhibition of works in the "domestic" setting
of the brownstones of the Whitney Studio Club and the Museum itself in
its early years, and the employment of Beaux-Arts architects and designers
to renovate the buildings, was in stark contrast to the Museum of Modern
Art, and it enabled a reading of the Whitney as a feminine space.

The invisibility of the Whitney artists in most histories of
twentieth-century American art is after all a feminist issue, inasmuch
as the denigration of realism has depended on a fundamentally gendered
discursive strategy. I want to conclude by considering the implications
of this for the current revival of interest in realist art, which I
referred to earlier. The critical challenge to "the Museum of Modern Art
story," for example in the 1997 "American Realities" exhibition at the
Whitney which reintegrated rative art into the history of American
art, is necessarily also a process of deconstructing the dominant gender
hierarchies of modernism and realism. And yet it is striking that there
were no women artists from the Whitney Studio Club included among the
realists in that show, with the exception of Isabel Bishop and Elsie
Driggs (<A HREF="6.3wolff_8.html"> 8</A>), neither of whom was quite typical of the Whitney artists
and their work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 (The same is true of the blockbuster Whitney exhibition, The American

<B></B>

Century, which opened as I was completing work on this essay).
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 It could be that this brings us back to the vexed question of "quality"
 (and hence full circle to my dilemma when confronted with the paintings).
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 But at the very least it suggests that we look carefully at both the
 aesthetic and the gender implications of the revival of realism in the
 late twentieth century, a revival which may, after all, still turn out
 to be on modernism's terms.

This is not entirely true. Though these artists are certainly not as
well known as, say, Arthur Dove or Marsden Hartley, their modernist
contemporaries, who have remained in favor throughout the century, it is
more likely that their work will be on display in exhibitions of American
art than that of their female counterparts. And, with regard to the WMAA's
adoption of the Museum of Modern Art aesthetic, Bruce Lineker stresses
the continuing attachment to its earlier realist tendencies: "For six
decades of American art, the surveys documented the Whitney Museum's
consistent support of the Realist tradition. One can also trace in the
exhibition program the emergence of abstraction in the 1930s and 1940s,
it's [sic] extraordinary success in Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s,
and abstraction's subsequent induction into the mainstream vocabulary
of American art. However, even when critical attention overwhelmingly
shifted toward abstraction, the program retained its original dedication
to realism" <I>(The Annual &amp; Biennial Exhibition Record of the

This approach is well established among sociologists of culture, who
have long insisted on the importance of understanding artistic success
and canon-formation in terms of social relations of cultural production
and institutions--patrons, dealers, critics, museums, art schools,
art-critical discourses, and so on, which facilitate and enable (and,
of course, sometimes obstruct) such success. With regard to gender,
feminists have also answered Linda Nochlin's question, "Why have there
been no great women artists?" by focusing on the social relations and
institutions which exclude, or permit, women's participation in the making
of art. Nochlin's 1971 essay of this title is reprinted in Thomas B. Hess
and Elizabeth C. Baker, eds. <I>Art and Sexual Politics</I> (New York:

gives prominent place is given to a line from a review of the book by
the art historian, Svetlana Alpers, who says: "Until I read this book
I had never heard of [McBride], but his collected reviews make for
good reading." It says something, of course, about the fate of early
twentieth-century art and art criticism that such a sentence stands as
a compliment. See "The Henry McBride Series in Modernism and Modernity
from Yale University," publisher's catalogue (New Haven: Yale University
Press, n. d. [but 1999]), 3.

Bishop and Driggs are the only women realists here, and, of the group
of twenty-four artists I have been considering, they are the only women
whose work has continued to be shown, perhaps with the exception of
Marguerite Zorach.

Other examples of this new attempt to reinstate realism as serious art
include the Whitney's 1995 Florine Stettheimer retrospective and 1998
Edward Hopper retrospective; a major exhibition at the National Museum
of American Art in Washington D. C. in 1995, <I>Metropolitan Lives:
The Ashcan Artists and Their New York</I>; an exhibition of the work of
Peggy Bacon at the Kraushaar Galleries, New York, from December 1995; an
exhibition of the work of Lucille Corcos at the Susan Teller Gallery, New
York, in Fall 1997. And--no doubt a more trivial example--the selection
of American realist art to hang on the walls of the home of an extremely
rich young couple (played by Mel Gibson and Rene Russo) in the movie
<I>Ransom</I>; see Avis Berman, "In the Script, the Art Says 'They're

Bishop has always maintained a certain status in histories of American
art, largely because of her importance as a member of the Fourteenth
Street School of urban realist painters. Driggs' 1927 painting,
<I>Pittsburgh</I>, which has remained on view in the WMAA's permanent
exhibition, is unlike the work of her Whitney Studio Club contemporaries
in its more modernist, Precisionist, style.

A disconcerting little aside in a recent article about the Whitney Museum
of Modern Art in the late 1990s refers to the uncritical buying policies
of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, "who, lore has it, would sometimes
purchase a second-rate picture in an artist's show, knowing that the
best work would find another buyer" (Arthur Lubow, "The Curse of the
Whitney," <I>New York Times Magazine</I>, 11 April 1999, 58). See also
note 33, above.
