      These four formerly unpublished war pieces by Mary Borden (1886–1968) were not included in the comprehensive published edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Forbidden Zone</span> . The three poems, “Escape,” “There is a Monster in the Valley,” “Take Me Away From My Wounded Men,” and the “Prefatory Note” (an earlier version of Borden’s published preface) are housed at the Mary Borden Collection at Boston University’s Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center. Although at times uneven, the vivid, sensuous love poetry best represented by “Escape” sheds a different light on Mary Borden’s published accounts of gender and the nurse’s war experience; and poems such as “There is a Monster in the Valley” expand on her important use of mechanized imagery.
    </p>
<p>
      Borden’s most significant literary achievement was undoubtedly her semi-autobiographical World War I collection of essays, stories and poetry, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Forbidden Zone</span>. A Vassar-educated Chicago heiress – she was British by marriage – Borden was in turn an active socialite, generous philanthropist, courageous nurse and prolific writer. During World War I, she left her family in London to equip and direct a field hospital on the front lines in France. Borden performed similar services during World War II, running a hospital behind the Maginot Line and, later, in the Middle East. In recognition of her wartime contributions, Borden would be awarded the French Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre with palm. Concurrently, as Lady Spears, wife of a British politician and diplomat, Borden traveled the world, entertaining numerous foreign dignitaries and social luminaries. Throughout these activities, she pursued a parallel vocation as a writer; over a literary career spanning nearly a half century, Borden produced a wide variety of literature including poetry, short stories, war  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> sketches, social essays, romance novels, religious narratives, original and adapted plays and film scripts, a marriage treatise and a full-length autobiography.
    </p>
<p>
      Declared “Whitmanesque” by some, critics seemed unsure how to approach or analyze <span style="font-style:italic;">The Forbidden Zone</span>. “Her <span style="font-style:italic;">Forbidden Zone</span> miscellany,” wrote Lawrence Woodhouse in <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span>, “swims in the ether of fervid, felt imagination as well as wallows like a troglodyte in modern warfare reality – a rare combination and a rather blasting one” (15 Jun. 1930). Today, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Forbidden Zone</span> is viewed as a significant modernist World War I text and Borden is widely acknowledged for her heroic personal efforts as well as her literary achievement.
    </p>
<p>
      Borden’s “Prefatory Note” reveals personal sentiments omitted from the published preface. In this version Borden acknowledges that the War has left “a profound and terrible impression” upon her. Equally notable, Borden’s published dedication “to the Poilus [soldiers]” does not appear here; rather she offers the collection to those men and women “who have never heard for themselves the voice of the War,” an inclusive and hopeful gesture meant to enhance their understanding of the war’s horrors.
    </p>
<p>
      Of Borden’s newly uncovered works, “Escape” and “Take Me Away From My Wounded Men” represent the most marked divergence from material published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Forbidden Zone</span>. Both love poems were omitted from the published text which emphasizes rather the gulf created by World War I between men and women on the front and at home. In “Escape,” Borden addresses an unnamed lover, a military officer, imploring him; “Steal an hour away from France and come with me.” The poem’s final sentiment— Leave your men and let them die in the mud – / Who will tell? / I so long to have you mine –/ I would pay – / I would drink with my own lips all the blood that would stain you if you came”—deftly mingles erotic innuendo with that ubiquitous metaphor of injury and death, “blood,” in a sexualization of the War unseen before in Borden’s poetry.
    </p>
<p>
      “Take Me Away From My Wounded Men” is a highly personal examination of the nurse’s war fatigue. Like “Escape,” the poem pleads for an hour away, but here the narrator begs for her own salvation, not that of another. Overwhelmed and tormented from nursing the injured soldiers, “Their wounds gape at me – / Their stumps menace me,” she implores her unnamed savior; “Make me clean . . . / . . . Give me rest . . . / . . . Give me strength. / And give me joy.” She asks for one hour of respite, “Then let me go back to my wounded men.” Like the soldiers in her sketch “Conspiracy,” whose cycle of recuperation and reassignment to the front is “arranged,” Borden situates herself as one more expendable commodity of the war machine.
    </p>
<p>
      The poem “There is a Monster in the Valley,” in which Borden presents the mechanical and technological aspects of modern warfare, expands upon imagery found in several of her other pieces, such as “Bombardment,” The Regiment” and “The Hill.” Juxtaposing guns, tanks and airplanes with valleys, hills and sky, she urges the reader to “Look – Listen,” experiencing through multiple senses the manner in which the machines of war are destroying man and nature. In Borden’s rendering, the apparatus of war subsumes the natural world, becoming the ambiguous “creature,” the evil “snake,” the ominous “Monster in the Valley.”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
