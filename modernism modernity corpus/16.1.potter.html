<div id="body">
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche, in <span style="font-style:italic;">On the Genealogy of Morals</span>, writing of the relation between the ascetic ideal and modern science, claimed that the word "science" in the mouths of modern scientists was obscene:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>these trumpeters of reality are bad musicians, it is clear from the sound they make that their voices do <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> rise up from the depths, that the abyss of the scientific conscience—for today the scientific conscience is an abyss—does <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> speak through them, that the word "science" in the mouths of such trumpeters is simply an obscenity, an abuse, an example of impudence.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The word he uses is <span style="font-style:italic;">unzücht</span>; here it is translated as obscene, but it can also mean indecent, a word with more social or class connotations. Science, for Nietzsche, is obscene for two main reasons: first, because modern scientists are abusing the language of science; and second, because Nietzsche foregrounds the mouth in his extended musical metaphor. The mouth is thus visualized as more than a mouthpiece for language. It is also a body part whose physical nature shapes, moistens, warms, and potentially contaminates its words. In Nietzsche's work, the assertion of knowledge is tied to the physical nature of the will. The ascetic ideal, by trying to cancel out the body, has both "ruined" "health and taste" and created a set of "monstrous" cultural ideals.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> While the ascetic ideal has made the healthy body obscene, then, Nietzsche uses images of repressed and unhealthy bodies to concretize the moral hypocrisy of late-nineteenth-century culture. Foul bodies, disgusting smells; they are everywhere in Nietzsche's writing. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The word obscene is from the Latin <span style="font-style:italic;">obscenus</span> meaning ill-omened; but over time it has come to mean that which is off-stage. There are always important reasons for sidelining certain areas of representation. Ideas of obscenity depend on labeling and circumscribing particular kinds of language or representation. Nietzsche alters where we locate obscenity, but not the circumscribing logic that informs its assignation. The obscene is a kind of last resort, a limit beyond which a writer will not go; the reasons for the assertion of this limit are always revealing.</p>
<p>It is partly from the desire to test conventional limits that obscenity plays such a central role in modernist writing. Like Nietzsche, modernist writers use obscene images because they want to reveal, and sometimes revel in, the uncomfortable limits of representation. Alternatively, there is a desire to attack a combination of an unhealthily repressed attitude to the body and hypocritical cultural norms, a theme present in novels from the late nineteenth century on. From Emile Zola's <span style="font-style:italic;">L'oeuvre (The Masterpiece</span> [1886]), through to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> , it is the sentimental cant of the moral majority that is labeled as obscene, not the explicit references to naked bodies or sexual interaction. These writers attempt to overturn dominant cultural and legal understandings of obscenity. Thus, the rise of literary realism coincided with the rise in legal prosecutions of literary obscenity.</p>
<p>The literary inclusion of sexualized flesh in realist novels meant that prosecutions for obscenity in Britain and America rose exponentially from the 1870s through to the 1933 <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> trial in the U.S. and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> trial in Britain in 1960. At the same time, this literary drive coincided with a new kind of desire to stamp out sex in literature. What became known as the New Puritanism in America, and "comstockery" by those on the other side of the argument, was run by the virulent Anthony Comstock who boasted two years before his death in 1915, "In the forty-one years I have been [in New York] I have convicted persons enough to fill a passenger train of 61 coaches . . . I have destroyed 160 tons of obscene literature."<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Much of what he destroyed seems innocuous now: the mere mention of prostitution, for example, was enough to send a book to the pulping machine.</p>
<p>Modernist and avant-garde writing, with its more deliberate flouting of moral conventions and exploration of sex and the language of sex, ratcheted up this confrontational dynamic. The period of modernist writing is framed by an embattled context of legal censorship. This legal censorship is clearest in the famous <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> trials in 1921 and 1933 and the banning of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span> in 1915, as well as Lawrence's difficulties in getting <span style="font-style:italic;">Women in Love</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> published. However, there were less institutionalized, but sometimes just as powerful, forms of censorship which worked to control the dissemination of modernist writing: printers, publishers, customs officers, postmen, editors, journalists, managers of circulating libraries, typists, husbands of typists, daughters of lawyers, daughters in general, and even other modernist writers all played their part in the censorship process.</p>
<p>The controllers of the big circulating book libraries, such as Smith's and Boot's, exercised considerable influence over the circulation and publication of fiction in Britain. As late as 1937, Boot's circulating library refused a book of Wyndham Lewis's called <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">False Bottoms</span> because the title was too vulgar. The hard-up Lewis dutifully changed the title to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Revenge for Love</span>. But the modes of censorship went far beyond these large companies. A London based printer, for instance, famously refused to set the manuscript of Joyce's <span style="font-style:italic;">Dubliners</span>, helping to delay the already protracted history of the book's publication.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> In 1924, an Irish printer refused to set the Irish journal <span style="font-style:italic;">To-Morrow</span>, because of two pieces of writing which were devoted to the subject of rape, one of which was Yeats's "Leda and the Swan."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> This high-handed behavior was a result of the fact that printers were legally responsible for the writing they set; this legal responsibility created, to the displeasure of modernist writers such as Joyce and Pound, the power of unknown printers to control the moral coordinates of modern literature. Although typists were not inhibited by any legal responsibility, they too had qualms in transcribing literature they considered obscene. Nellie Morrison, a friend of D. H. Lawrence, who, with some misgivings, asked her to type up the manuscript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span>, only managed to get as far as the fifth chapter before she declared herself unable to continue. "It is too indecent" she breathlessly announced.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Up to nine typists refused to deal with Joyce's "Circe"; indeed, on one occasion, it was a typist's husband who interfered—when a British Embassy official found his wife typing up a section of "Circe," he famously threw it into the fire.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Perhaps the most pernicious form of censorship, however, was the obscure threat of prosecution which publishers either feared or appealed to when turning down or altering a manuscript. This meant that the censor as a target was hard to pin down. It was not a person or single piece of the law which could be brought on stage and openly challenged. The res of Anthony Comstock and his successor John Sumner came closest to performing this role in the United States; and in Britain the key hate res were James Douglas and the Home Secretary Sir William Joynson-Hicks (known as "Jix"), who was Home Secretary from 1924 to 1929. However, in reality, these individuals were only part of a wide and complex structure of censorship.</p>
<p>The system that Comstock had helped to put in place, in which customs officials with no specific training should decide on whether a piece of writing was obscene, was by its very nature haphazard and subject to ungovernable individual decisions. Censorship was to change in the early twentieth century, but these shifts must be traced in the individual decisions that were made, which were manifestations of wider cultural changes. In the face of this network of control, writers quickly realized that it was essential to take control of the editorship of publishing houses and journals. No wonder, also, that the moral protest against the censorship of obscenity became a theme in modernist texts.</p>
<p>But, perhaps more intriguing than the rational-moral protest against censorship, is the way that a number of writers explore and stretch the meaning of literary obscenity, putting the obscene at the heart of their aesthetic projects. If the directness of literary naturalism and realism had led to trouble with the vice squad, then, my proposition is that modernist writers adopt the concerns of realism, only to twist them in a new direction. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Returning to Nietzsche's obscene trumpeters, decayed mouths, for example, make notable appearances in modernist writing. T. S. Eliot, in his 1915 prose piece, "Hysteria," provides an extended description of a female mouth that threatens to engulf and inhale a man. He had a sustained interest in rotting orifices. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> "The Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit" in "What the Thunder Said" echoes back to Lil's famously decayed teeth in "A Game of Chess." While the I, we're told, doesn't "mince" her words, Lil, with her putrefied mouth, would not be able to. Eliot's connection of female infertility and rotting mouths is one among a number of moments in his writing when he manipulates disgust in order to undermine established ideas of aesthetic taste.</p>
<p>Joyce, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dubliners</span> story "An Encounter," also connects a corrupted orifice with bad morals: the creepy man who jerks off in the field has "great gaps in his mouth between his yellow teeth."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> No wonder, then, that the boy of the story "disliked the words in his mouth." The boy's dislike is focused on the specific sexual words the man repeats to himself; but, by implication, the man's language is saturated with the contours of his putrid mouth more generally.</p>
<p>This focus on mouths is more than simply an insight into early-twentieth-century dental hygiene. It involves an interest both in how the individual body frames words and in the sensual properties of language. Just as Nietzsche insists on recognizing the perspectival nature of knowledge, so words, in modernist texts, tend to be written through, not over, character. The subject, armed with all his or her physical characteristics, in this instance bad breath, tends to be in the words of modernist literature. The foregrounding of the subjectively sensual nature of language splinters writing apart into distinct styles which are infected with healthy or decaying bodies, as well as the accents of class, racial, or sexual difference.</p>
<p>This focus on the physical self underscores Nietzsche's reliance on a dichotomy of health and illness, which in his writing might be seen to displace the dominant moral oppositions of late-nineteenth-century culture. The designation of books which are "for all the world" as "foul-smelling" because "the smell of small people clings to them," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Beyond Good and Evil</span>, deliberately asserts a visceral, rather than rational, response to something.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Here, bad odor contaminates the object, injecting a vivid sensuality into the image of overuse. The desire to transfer the focus of writing from moral argument to visceral response informs modernist writing more generally. In "An Encounter" disgust still seems framed by a moral argument; the connection of the man's rotten mouth and rotten morals is closely enforced. In other texts, the manipulation of disgust moves the literary or interpretative register beyond moral reason; and this is to place the obscene, and thoughts on the nature of the obscene, at the heart of modernist writing. The more explicit meditations on the nature of obscenity in modernist texts, then, involve a testing of human boundaries in which the mind's relation to the body is implicitly questioned.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Women in Love</span>, Gerald, after the rabbit Bismarck tears open the flesh on Gudrun's arm, stares at the bloodied rip and is prompted to thoughts on the obscene: "The long, shallow red rip seemed torn across his own brain, tearing the surface of his ultimate <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  consciousness, letting through the forever unconscious, unthinkable red ether of the beyond, the obscene beyond." Gerald's glimpse of what lies under Gudrun's skin opens up an uneasy view of an obscene interior. As the passage goes on, Gerald's look inside Gudrun creates an obscene kind of knowledge. An "obscene smile," we are told, flits over Gerald's face, while Gudrun's face "relaxed into a smile of obscene recognition."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> This muted sexual interaction, with its synthesis of sexual violence and unconscious recognition, creates a genuinely disturbing image of human desire. While modernist writing often takes us into the self Lawrence here visualizes a bloody interior, disturbing in its organic unreadability. It sets the scene for their murderous and failed relationship. When Gudrun finally rejects Gerald, we are told that she has finished with the world of healthy men and embraced an "obscene" egoism: "There was only the inner, individual darkness, sensation within the ego, the obscene religious mystery of ultimate reduction . . . ."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Here, again, the obscene interior is unreadable, this time in a spiritual rather than organic sense. The implication is that if we look too far into ourselves, we will destroy something central to our humanity. But Lawrence also stands outside the obscene and comments on it here, seeing it as that which is and should be, precisely, unreadable. On another occasion, Lawrence spelled out his belief that there should be limits on the literary journey into the self: "What was there in the cave: Alas that we ever looked! Nothing but a huge slimy serpent of sex, and heaps of excrement, and a myriad repulsive little horrors spawned between sex and excrement."<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Lawrence vigorously asserts a barrier to representation, insisting that the obscene interior is that which cannot, and should not, be put into language.</p>
<p>The scene with Gudrun, Gerald, and the rabbit is genuinely disturbing; it seems to implicate the reader in the obscene. Obscenity, and both the assertion and the disruption of representational limits which it involves, is part of what it means to be human. Selfhood is unimaginable without a sense of the obscene, the things or bodily functions that we banish in order to maintain a sense of self. George Bataille makes such a universalist claim in <span style="font-style:italic;">Eroticism</span> . In the introductory section to the book, where he is setting out his understanding of eroticism in relation to selfhood he says the following: "Bodies open out to a state of continuity through secret channels that give us a feeling of obscenity. Obscenity is our name for the uneasiness which upsets the physical state associated with self-possession, with the possession of a recognised and stable individuality."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> By continuity, Bataille refers to his central claim that humans are discontinuous beings but that certain basic human experiences such as death, nakedness, and sex disrupt this self-sufficiency. Bataille wants to explore, rather than expel, the "secret channels" of obscenity, the uneasiness that disarranges stable individuality. His claim that self-possession collapses in face of the obscene helpfully provides a way of considering the radical aesthetic possibilities of literary obscenities.</p>
<p>Obscene modernism, then, is at its most obscene when it disarranges human frontiers, calling into question the mind's relation to the body. In this sense, it is not the case that modernist writing was obscene, and is no longer so. Modern readers may locate modernist obscenity in different places, but the ability of these texts to shock or to disrupt remains. This article argues from a slightly different angle to existing books <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  on modernism and censorship by Adam Parkes, Florence Dore, and Celia Marshik. These books helpfully reveal the conflict between modernist writers and "Vice Crusaders," and show how the eventual liberalization of the law on obscene literature after the war corresponded to a freeing up of cultural attitudes to sexuality and in particular homosexuality.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> I want to suggest, however, that explorations of the obscene in modernist writing take us into unresolved and ongoing questions about aesthetic boundaries; about where and how to place and police them.</p>
<p>Take the re of Gerty MacDowell in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>. She is the classic "young person" whom the law against obscenity was designed to protect. Since Lord Campbell's Obscene Publications Act of 1857, and the subsequent interpretation of this law by Lord Chief Justice Cockburn in 1867, known as the Hicklin ruling, the test of obscenity had rested on the following famous rule: "whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> There were three kinds of readerships "whose minds" were seen to be most "open to immoral influences": the young, women, and the working class. These susceptible readers, the Vice Crusaders and lawyers argued, needed to be protected from the corrupting influence of obscene literature.</p>
<p>Gerty appears in "Nausicaa" as a sentimental subject, prone to blush charmingly at the mention of the body's functions, and, in her moral judgements as a young female, offering an unerringly accurate correspondence with the moral coordinates of the Society for the Suppression of Vice. In the "Circe" section of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, she reappears as a slobbering, ogling, and disgusting re, who has dreamed her encounter with Bloom. Here, not only does Joyce make Gerty obscene, he also presents us with the other side of the sentimental legal subject, whose tender sensibilities presided over the legal censorship of modernist literature.</p>
<p>Perhaps Joyce's more radical literary departure, however, was to move beyond this Gertyish opposition of the sentimental and the obscene. And this is why when <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> first appeared even Joyce's most artistically advanced contemporaries found it difficult to interpret its obscene material. Virginia Woolf confessed that the book "raised a blush even upon such a cheek as mine," Lawrence condemned Penelope as "the dirtiest, most indecent, obscene thing ever written," while Arnold Bennett argued that "Ulysses is not pornographic, but it is more indecent, obscene, scatological and licentious that the majority of professedly pornographic books." Ezra Pound's condemnation of Joyce's "arsethetic" is a more engaged, if no less critical, condemnation of Joyce's combination of art and arses.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>These comments help us recapture something of the bemusement of Joyce's contemporaries in the face of the obscenities in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>. While the Vice Crusaders and lawyers debated whether this text was pornography or literature, Joyce's fellow writers also found themselves worrying about semantics. The desire to pile up adjective after adjective in the reactions detailed above tells us much about the anxiety about how to define this new kind of writing: is it, in the end, obscene, scatological, indecent, licentious, dirty? If it is all or any of these things, can it still be literature? Of one thing <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  all were agreed: through these elements Joyce had created an oddly hybrid literary object. It was clear to his fellow writers that <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> was literature; but the category of literature would need to change in order to accommodate this new kind of text.</p>
<p>Pound, for one, was worried about stretching the category of literature to include the obscenities in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>. He believed that Joyce had pushed his writing beyond the realism of his earlier works into gratuitous obscenity. In the interchanges between Pound and Joyce on this question obscenity becomes a term that signifies that which is in excess, as though Joyce is reveling in obscene language for the sake of it. According to Pound, as Joyce's language descends into dirt it becomes more divorced from its referent. Pound suggests that, rather than being the culmination of a realist drive to capture the world in all its guises, Joyce's obscenity is language at its most self-referential. He was right to see the obscenity in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> as different to that in previous works by Joyce, and to see it as connected to something other than its realism. From the "Nausicaa" section on, the use of obscene language rises exponentially. As the writing becomes more focused on linguistic and stylistic artifice, it becomes more obscene. When Molly states, "that's what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damned well fucked too up to my neck nearly" something new enters the literary object: the colloquial meets the obscene.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Bataille captures the revolutionary energy of those images or bits of language that create a feeling of genuine disquiet in the reader. Joyce's radical move, along with other modernist writers, was to extend this disquiet to the very texture of language, casting obscene slang into the language of literature, and challenging the idea that literature could be sealed from the language of the streets.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Offensive Modernism</h1>
<p>Modernism as a term is, of course, impossible to pin down simply. Yet, we might take as one of its salient characteristics a desire to offend, something Peter Gay argues in his recent book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism: The Lure of Heresy</span>.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Perhaps the obscenities in modernism, then, should be seen as simply part of a more general iconoclasm. I want to suggest, however, that a scrutiny of the specifics of the representation and policing of the obscene opens up something different to a general logic of heresy. It was because of their experience of the censor that these writers got caught up in tangled concerns about the materialist networks of censorship and distribution which policed the dissemination of texts. It involved them in historical understandings of legal and philosophical discussions about freedom of speech. It also prompted writers to engage in a series of discussions about aesthetic boundaries. The debates between Pound and Joyce about the aesthetic status of shit, shitting, and toilets, is surely one of the more bizarre yet fascinating episodes in the history of modern literature. These messy encounters altered the relationship these writers had with more abstract ideas of art, authority, tradition, or the state.</p>
<p>In the rest of this article I focus on an aesthetic question which synthesizes a number of these concerns: where do we place the boundary separating literature and pornography? "Pornography" is originally from the Greek meaning "writing about prostitutes." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Despite the fact that the "Circe" section of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> is quite literally about harlots, his contemporaries were keen to dissociate <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> from pornography: "<span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> is not pornographic," as Bennet declared. Lawrence, while employing a series of related words, studiously avoided using the word pornography. These responses betray a clear anxiety about the relationship between <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> and pornography.</p>
<p>More generally, there is an anxiety about the taint of the pornographic in modernist writing. Alisson Pease argues that modernist writers incorporated "pornographic tropes and images" into their works, and that this altered understandings of the aesthetic. The distinction between "aesthetics and pornography," which had been put in place in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries "collapsed in the twentieth century."<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> I want to suggest, however, that something slightly different happens: that the categories of pornography and obscenity are pushed apart in the early twentieth century and that an aesthetic interest in the latter often goes hand-in-hand with a denigration of the former.</p>
<p>As late as 1929, D. H. Lawrence insisted that despite his lifelong struggle with the censor and interest in exploring ideas of obscenity, he would happily curtail the rights of pornographers to publish.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Earlier, in 1914, Wyndham Lewis declared in <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> that pornography was the "great enemy of progress." On another occasion in the same year, he distinguished between different kinds of sexualized writing: "I have always found pornography extremely boring and regarded it as the hallmark of the second-rate. As for Phallic aesthetics, I have no quarrel with them, only I don't happen to participate myself, that is all: though much preferring the naked and clean thing to the boudoir suggestiveness and Yellow Book Gallicisms."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Lewis is careful to distinguish aesthetic explorations of sex, whether in the form of "phallic aesthetics" or "boudoir suggestiveness" from pornography, a distinction he repeats in his novels. There are also notable discussions in modernist literature of what constitutes pornography, in which art is specifically opposed to the pornographic. In a dispute about aesthetics in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span>, for example, Stephen uses pornography as an instance of the "improper" arts which excite kinetic, rather than aesthetic, emotions. Lynch's "fleshy" response to a naked statue is a bodily "reflex" which has nothing to do with beauty or aesthetics.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In particular, however, pornography publishers make notable appearances in modernist texts. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>  Conrad represents the pornographer, "agent provocateur," Verloc, who sells both pornographic and revolutionary tracts. The connections of pornographic and revolutionary publishing date back to the early nineteenth century, but Conrad links the disreputable wares of the pornography trade with ineffectual and solipsistic anarchistic passion.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Lewis, in the character of the publisher Ratner, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Apes of God</span> , also presents us with the sordid financial transactions of the pornography trade. Ratner contemplates a man looking at one of his books. The man "was weighing its pornographic promise against his big cheque in his pocket." Ratner responds by pointing the man to the pornographic parts: "he guides the customer with a sleuth-like index to the satisfying spots one by one.—The cheque changes hands."<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Lewis captures the sordidness of the pornography trade by <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  synthesizing ideas of sexual and financial satisfaction. It is remarkable, however, that alongside this denigration of pornography, Lewis repeatedly refers to the obscene as a way of staging ideas about aesthetic boundaries. In his novels, he depicts obscene dwarfs, puppets, and babies, part of a repertoire of obscene-grotesque imagery which works to reveal repressed desires or human misrecognitions.</p>
<p>In the rest of this article I consider this focus on pornography as a trade and its significance for our understanding of modernist obscenity. At the same time, I offer an engagement with Lawrence Rainey's influential account of the production of modernist texts as luxury, as investible commodities.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Trade in Salacious Books</h1>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>He made his living, and in the process convinced himself that he was serving the arts, by printing limited and expensive editions of the more scabrous specimens of the native and foreign literatures.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Aldous Huxley, in his depiction of Cuthbert Arkwright in his 1928 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Point Counter Point</span>, represents an important type of the modernist period: the publisher of limited and expensive editions of obscene literature who also fancies that he serves the "arts." Arkwright is presented neither as a straightforward pornographer nor as a publisher entirely free of the taint of the pornographic. He is caught, it seems, between competing interests. He needs to make his living, but he also has a different desire, which is to convince himself that he is interested in that thing which stands outside commercial interests: "art." We are led to believe that he is deluded in this second need. Or, perhaps, that he is wrong in his faith about art's resistance to commodification. Yet this belief is, nevertheless, an important strand in his sense of self.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Institutions of Modernism</span>, Lawrence Rainey discusses in detail the dynamics of production, commodification, and notions about "art" which are here represented by Huxley. Rainey argues that Sylvia Beach, as well as Joyce and Pound, published <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> as an expensive limited edition through a careful manipulation of the mechanisms of marketing, distribution, and price. In the process, the modernist text was produced as a special, investible commodity beyond the reach of the ordinary reader. In particular, Rainey considers the significance of the use of subscription lists, rather than more conventional methods of distribution, to disseminate the book. He argues that the "private edition" was a technical term with a "recent" meaning: a "ploy" to "evade the laws on obscenity that prevailed in both the United States and England." He goes on: "Instead of distributing the volume through normal retail outlets, Heinemann, or, in the case of Beach, Shakespeare and Company, announced that it was available only 'by subscription' directly from the publisher. In this way, it could argue that the book was not for sale in the public realm, hence could not be charged with harming public morals." Rainey argues that these methods of distribution created a "social space where aesthetic value became confused with speculation, collecting, investment, and dealing, a space in which modernism and commodity culture were not implacable enemies but <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  fraternal rivals."<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Within the logic of Rainey's argument, Arkwright's claim to serve the arts is a disingenuous one.</p>
<p>I want to pick up on the point about subscription lists and the private edition, and consider a different history to the one sketched by Rainey, a history which leads to some rather different conclusions. The distribution of obscene or pornographic texts by means of private subscription lists predates the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> by decades. Modernist publishers and writers adopted these techniques for the same reason that pornographers did; to avoid the customs officials. Yet they were often acutely aware of the proximity of modernist texts to the pornography trade, an association all the more disturbing because it was in place at both a legal and a publishing level. A fraught intellectual battle resulted, in which modernist writers attempted to claim a different "social space" to the one described by Rainey, one where aesthetic value was connected not with speculation, but with freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Pornography was a lucrative trade. Salacious texts could command impressive prices, especially if they were produced in limited editions. The most famous of these was the eleven-volume <span style="font-style:italic;">My Secret Life</span> , which was produced in a print run of only ten copies. It was supposedly created in Amsterdam and then smuggled back into Britain through subscription lists to avoid the postal authorities. The extremely rare <span style="font-style:italic;">My Secret Life</span> came at a price of between £40 and £100. <span style="font-style:italic;">Frank and I</span>, a text produced in 1902, was advertised at the cost of £5 or $25, a dual pricing policy which suggests the internationalism of the pornography trade. If we consider that Rainey makes much of the fact that Ulysses sold for £7.7s in 1922, we can begin to see just how expensive this high-class pornography was.</p>
<p>There was also a lucrative market for pornographic journals. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pearl: A journal of Facetiae and Voluptuous Reading</span>, for example, was issued monthly for 18 months between 1879 and 1880. A complete set of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pearl</span> was available in a limited edition of 150 at the price of £25. Other examples include <span style="font-style:italic;">The Boudoir</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cremorne</span> , which sold in limited editions of 300 for half a guinea and a guinea respectively.</p>
<p>All of these books and journals were produced for a distinctly middle- and upper-class audience. The Special <span style="font-style:italic;">Pearl</span> Christmas number of 1879 was called "Swivia; or, the Briefless Barrister," indicating one possible kind of professional audience for the journal.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> This expensive luxury pornography was text-based, and included "voluptuous" stories and poems about sex and flagellation. The methods of textual dissemination used by the pornography trade were also similar to those discussed by Rainey. The opening editorial of the first edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Pearl</span>, for example, hoped that the "hypocritical swine" who might be inclined to "trample" the journal "underfoot" would instead "become subscribers on the quiet."</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Pearl</span> was published privately in London under the ironic "Society of Vice" imprint. The editorial joke about turning possible prosecutors into "quiet" subscribers picks up on the established nineteenth-century conventions of expensive pornography distribution, in which pornographers avoided the police by targeting lists of private subscribers through the mail. The techniques of production and distribution perfected <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  by pornography producers in the late nineteenth century relied on a fine balance between scarcity and price. Expensive journals and books commanded exorbitant prices because they were luxuriously produced, limited in number, and represented a considerable risk on the part of the publishers and distributors.</p>
<p>Huxley's Arkwright, with his claim that he is not simply a pornographer, is typical of a certain kind of publisher who features on the publishing landscape throughout the nineteenth century and up until the Second World War. The publisher John Camden Hotten, for example, who died in 1873, published respectable books of history, anthropology, and poetry, alongside more explicitly pornographic books such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Female Flagellants in the Modest and Incontinent World</span> .<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> At the end of the period in which modernist writing was produced, Jack Kahane's Obelisk Press, which he ran from 1931 to 1939, published volumes of poetry such as Joyce's <span style="font-style:italic;">Poemes Penyeach</span>  and obscene literary books such as Henry Miller's <span style="font-style:italic;">Tropic of Cancer</span>  alongside more straightforward salacious tomes such as Kahane's own <span style="font-style:italic;">Amour—French for Love</span> , which he brought out under the name Cecil Barr. There are significant differences, however, between the publishing ventures of these two men. While Hotten was happy to have different kinds of writing on his list, the books themselves were fairly obviously distinct from one another; he seems to have classified them as either pornography or books of political history, for example. What is notable about Kahane's publication list is both its impressive literary credentials (it includes works by Joyce, Lawrence, Miller, James Hanley, Radclyffe Hall, Anaïs Nin, and Lawrence Durrell), and the fact that these books were both literary and, in a legal sense, obscene. This shift began in the 1880s and 1890s, when publishers such as Vizetelly were prosecuted for bringing out obscene books by literary writers such as Zola. From this point on, there was often an unspoken legal view that books could be classified as both obscene and literary. It was not until 1933, when Judge Woolsey declared that a book could not be both a work of art and obscene, that the two terms were legally separated again.</p>
<p>Two different publishers of the 1890s capture some of the competing interests at stake here. First, there was the London publisher Leonard Smithers, whom Wilde fondly described as "the most learned erotomaniac in Europe."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Smithers began his career as a publisher of straightforward pornography, but from 1895 went on to produce luxury editions of risqué works by Wilde, Beardsley, Dowson, Symons, and others. By producing the books as luxury editions, Smithers imitated the longer standing practice of pornography publication, in which limited, expensive editions of erotica were sold to a high-class readership.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Smithers was not the only publisher who adopted techniques from the pornography trade in order to bring out the legally suspect texts of fin de siècle aestheticism. John Lane, for example, published limited editions of the doubtful <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span> (1894–97) and later <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> (1914–15), under the Bodley Head imprint, by specifically nurturing a network of private investors. As Peter McDoland puts it, "Capitalizing on the prestige of the 'limited edition,' the 'beautiful book,' and the appeal of the risqué, [Lane] commodified and popularized 1890s aestheticism."<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The second publisher was Paul Ferdinando, who changed his name to Charles Carrington, and emigrated from London to Paris in 1895 in order to set up his illegal publishing operation. Carrington, from his shops in the Faubourg Montmartre and rue de Chateaudun produced salacious books such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Raped on the Railway: A True Story of a Lady Who Was First Ravished and then Chastised upon the Scotch Express</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Sweet Seventeen: The True Story of a Daughter's Awful Whipping and Its Delightful if Direful Consequences</span>  as well as pseudo-medical books, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Flagellation in France from a medical and historical standpoint</span> . He also brought out new editions of obscene or suspect literary works such as his <span style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs of Fanny Hill: a new and genuine edition from the original text</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Picture of Dorian Gray</span>  which Methuen were reluctant to keep in print after Wilde's trial in 1895.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> He would then ship these books back to England via mail order lists. Over the years and up until his death in 1922 Carrington devised ingenious methods of avoiding Customs Officers. When he realized that the Post Office had begun to confiscate his mail, he organized a series of postal drops or middlemen to fool the authorities. He was also a canny salesman. He created advertising brochures aimed at upper-middle-class British and American buyers who wanted both intellectually stimulating and erotic limited edition books.</p>
<p>Carrington was not the only publisher to move operations to France at this time. In face of the attempt by police to crack down on pornography publishers in the 1880s and 1890s, others such as Edward Avery, Harry Sidney Nichols, and William Lazenby (who published <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pearl</span>) followed suit. Many of the publishers or sellers of modernist and avant-garde texts, such as Robert McAlmon, Sylvia Beach, Nancy Cunard, and Jack Kahane, partly gravitated to Paris for similar reasons. It was easier to produce and circulate obscene texts from Paris because the French authorities were not interested in prosecuting publishers of English-language material which was being transported off French soil, despite pleas from the British police for them to do so. French publishers of erotica, in turn, moved their own operations to Brussels in order to avoid French censorship laws. Despite the international trade in pornography and obscene literature, the authorities failed to find ways to prosecute across national borders. Paris became the publishing centre of Anglo-American modernism partly because it was free of the British and American censors.</p>
<p>There were, however, significant differences between different kinds of publishers of obscenity from the 1890s. Despite the fact that Smithers had originally been a publisher of more straightforward pornography, his desire to publish the work of Wilde, Symons, and others was not simply commercial. In fact, his commitment to making beautifully bound and illustrated books was to bankrupt him in 1900, and he went on to die in poverty in 1907. Carrington's interests, on the other hand, seem to have been more simply financial. He produced obscene literary works because he saw that there was a lucrative market for them.</p>
<p>In some ways Smithers and Carrington represent the different interests at work in a number of publishing ventures in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s. On the one hand, publishers on both sides of the Atlantic were keen to produce "obscene" modernist <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  texts because they saw that there was a lucrative market for them. Further, it became clear towards the end of the 1910s that a public brush with the law afforded enviable amounts of publicity for a book, something that publishers as diverse as the Paris based Kahane and the New York based Horace Liveright, were quick to capitalize upon. On the other hand, publishers and writers often found themselves unwittingly caught up in censorship battles. In some cases, writers would seek out alternative lines of distribution which, ironically, had associations with the very illicit trade that they were in other respects keen to avoid.</p>
<p>D. H. Lawrence's London edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span>, for example, was initially ushered into print by the respectable publishing company, Methuen. When the book was seized by the authorities in 1915, much was made of the fact that this "mass of obscenity" would find its way into respectable homes because it was clothed in the Methuen imprint.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Methuen, scared of the bad publicity that would attach to their name were keen to capitulate to the authorities and hush up the affair. When the suppression of the book was debated in the House of Commons, Sir J. Simon stated that "so far from resisting the proceedings they said they [Methuen] thought it right that the order should be issued."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Lawrence responded to the censorship by trying to enlist support from influential friends such as Cynthia Asquith, Dollie Radford, and Edward Marsh.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> In a series of letters written immediately after the seizure of his book, he declares that he would "move a body of people" to support him (<span style="font-style:italic;">L2</span>, 430). He seems to have hoped that Cynthia Asquith would be able to persuade her father-in-law, the Prime Minister, to intervene on his behalf. Methuen had a hand in trying, in turn, to prevent gestures of support. When Clive Bell wanted to write a defense of Lawrence, Methuen discouraged him from doing so. The firm also persuaded Pinker, Lawrence's agent, not to take legal action to reverse the Magistrate's order against <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span>.</p>
<p>In a bid to get help, Lawrence joined the Incorporated Society of Authors, Play-wrights and Composers, which aimed to protect literary property, on 11 November 1915 and wrote hopefully of a letter of protest to be sent to the papers signed by Walter de la Mare, E. M. Forster, John Middleton Murry, J. D. Beresford, Hugh Walpole, and Gilbert Cannan (<span style="font-style:italic;">L2</span>, 435). His hopes were ill-founded. The letter was never circulated and the Society of Authors decided on 7 December that "after hearing the opinion of the solicitors in regard to the legal aspect, the Committee came to the conclusion that in the present circumstances they could not take any useful action on the general principles involved."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Lawrence's immediate response to this combination of factors, the authoritarianism of the law, the submissiveness of Methuen, and the reluctance on the part of the Society of Authors or writers in general to support him, was to consider setting up his own publishing venture, to be called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow Books and Music</span>, with the composer Philip Heseltine. It was Murry who had initially aired the idea of a publishing scheme in which authors would be publishers towards the end of 1915.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Lawrence appears to have taken up the idea and made it his own by early 1916. He first wrote of setting up his own "private publishing concern, by subscription," in three letters written on 11 February 1916: one to Catherine Carswell, one to John Middleton Murry and Katherine <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Mansfield, and one to Bertrand Russell. He wrote excitedly to Carswell: "We could begin with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span>, which is likely to give a start, publish at 7/6. Then we can go on with the next as we like. The thing is to be a crusade, to gather the sincere people into one reading circle, and to give them every living book that is born" (<span style="font-style:italic;">L2</span>, 532).</p>
<p>Lawrence's idea that the publishing company would also constitute a "reading circle" reveals much about his hopes for the venture. It seems to have been a publishing equivalent of his plans at the time to move to Florida with a like-minded bunch of artists. This explains the tenor of his attempts to persuade influential res to join the company before it launched itself onto the market. He wrote to Russell: "When we have a sufficient number of names to justify us, we could begin" (<span style="font-style:italic;">L2</span>, 534). Three days later he contacted Lady Ottoline Morrell and Dollie Radford, clearly with the hope of securing both financial and intellectual support.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> In the end, Lawrence and his co-organizer Heseltine wrote and circulated 700 copies of an advertisement which proposed that authors would be able to publish their own books as private editions. Support was to be in the form of a signature. The advertisement concludes, "All who wish to support the scheme should sign the accompanying form, and send it at once to the secretary" (<span style="font-style:italic;">L2</span>, 542).</p>
<p>The plan to distribute the new publications by means of private subscription lists was an obvious ploy to avoid the censor. Lawrence also wanted to secure, through a signature, the support he had singularly failed to get in his immediate battle against the legal authorities. Something other than commerce was at stake for Lawrence in his publishing scheme: he seems to have hoped that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow Books and Music</span> would constitute a cultural space of independent thought and freedom of speech, outside the jurisdiction of the British authorities. Ironic, then, that Lawrence was tempted to turn for help in this project to a Paris based publisher of dubious standing. In a letter to his agent Pinker from Cornwall, on 1 March 1916 he states: "Some friends of mine want to publish <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span> here by subscription. I suppose it could be done in conjunction with Paul Ferdinando. I also know nothing of him, but he has a nice and brigand-like name" (<span style="font-style:italic;">L2</span>, 561). In his desire to evade the censor, Lawrence found himself seeking out the pornography publisher, Paul Ferdinando, and embracing the very channels of distribution long perfected by the pornography trade. By so doing, and seemingly in ignorance, Lawrence risked marking his book as pornographic and confirming the judgement of the court, which legally declared <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span> as "pornographic" as the other books on Carrington's list.</p>
<p>Lawrence's publishing venture did not meet with much success (only thirty people responded to the advertisement), but after the war private presses such as the one imagined by Lawrence were to spring up in Paris and London and become central to the production and circulation of modernist writing. Something similar to Lawrence's hope for a cultural space of free expression was also at the heart of some of these ventures: something other than commerce, in other words, was staked in the signatures which attached themselves to subscription lists for banned books, all the more acutely felt because of the entrenched cultural association of private presses, subscription lists, and expensive editions with pornography, an association which was to extend well into the 1920s. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>After <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span> was banned in Britain and fearing problems with the censor, Lawrence's American publisher Benjamin Huebsch deliberately avoided issuing the novel as a limited edition because of the pornographic associations of limited editions. He adhered to this logic well into the 1920s. Sherwood Anderson wrote to Huebsch in 1922 to suggest publishing his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Many Marriages</span> in a limited edition because Anderson feared U.S. censors might ban the book. The conservative Huebsch objected to Anderson's plan because "to issue a book in that manner is to stamp it as pornography." Publishers who specialize in such limited editions "sell books with a wink and a leer." Even if the book in question is a work of art, publishers of limited editions handle it with "slimy fingers" and aim their appeals to "the furtive-eyed erotomaniac."<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> In 1928, Radclyffe Hall too was worried when Jonathan Cape wanted to issue <span style="font-style:italic;">The Well of Loneliness</span> in a limited edition of 1,250 copies, priced at 25 shillings. Hall was shocked because this was three times the average cost of a novel and suggested "under-the-counter sales to the prurient."<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Joyce, however, responded to the censorship of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, and the subsequent decision by Huebsch that he would be unable to publish the book unexpurgated, by seeking out a private press reliant on subscription lists: Sylvia Beach's Shakespeare and Company Bookshop.</p>
<p>If Rainey sees Beach's use of subscription lists as part of an attempt to create <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> as a special, luxury commodity, he downplays the fact that such means of dissemination had a long and complex history. It is only in retrospect that the distinctions between <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> and pornographic texts, and the literary market and the pornography trade, are straightforward. It did not look so clear-cut to some lawyers, judges, Vice Crusaders, publishers, customs officials, typists, husbands of typists, daughters of lawyers, or others at the time.</p>
<p>By downplaying this aspect of the story, we also underestimate the significance of the "something" other in Lawrence's dreams of a free publishing space, or the fictional Arkwright's claim that he serves something called "Art." The "something" other was defined by a structural logic in which censorship actively curtailed freedom of expression. The tangled and contested battle for literary freedom that resulted from the clash between texts such as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> and the law involved the attempt to defend "art" from accusations of obscenity. In this, the "something" other was specifically independent of the commercial trade in books. Are we to discount altogether the spirit of André Gide's statement, for example, that when he went into the Shakespeare and Company bookshop to place his order for <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, he wanted to support "the cause of freedom of expression"?</p>
<p>There was an anxiety about pornography among some modernist writers as I stated earlier in this article, not only because writers were accused of creating pornography by the legal authorities, but because there was an uncomfortable proximity between the mechanisms manipulated by publishers of banned modernist books and the pornography trade. All the more reason, then, for writers to claim for their works an artistic status free of the legally enshrined idea of the corruptible young female reader. Gide's signature is a gesture of defiance; one which joined the many signatures on petitions opposing censorship in the 1910s and 1920s. Arguments against censorship often ended up claiming a vigorous difference between pornography and art in order to extricate <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  texts such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> from the messy implications of these connections. These arguments were important: the ban on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> was lifted in 1933 because Judge Woolsey made the groundbreaking legal ruling that art and pornography were mutually exclusive terms. In his considered view, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> was art.</p>
<p>The obscene is a term which is taken up and played with in ever more fascinating ways in texts by Lawrence, Pound, Lewis, Joyce, Barnes, Huxley, Miller, and others; the pornographic became a word often used by modernist writers to refer to a particular kind of commercial trade in books. The attempt by writers to disentangle these complex and related words is important to the history of modernism.</p>
