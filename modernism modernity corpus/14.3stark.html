<p id="lead">Because the work of art can never coincide with its subject, because it is always belated with respect to what it represents, any attempt to determine its authenticity as a function of its adequacy to its subject will fail. As several of the papers in this cluster of essays suggest, the question of authenticity must therefore be addressed on different grounds—variously described here in terms of "a kind of authenticity grounded in the fake" (Lynes), of a claim that it is "only within the realm of the artificial that the category of the authentic has any meaning" (Shumway), of paintings whose meaning resides in their non-referentiality (Rothman), of what Wilde calls "the truth of masks" (Riquelme). The poem, painting, or musical performance becomes authentic at the moment that it is adequate to its own nonmimetic nature, at the moment it owns up to its inauthenticity.  </p>

<p>But what does it mean to be authentically inauthentic, to be a real counterfeit? If modernism entails the imperative to convey something whose significance lies in what Baudelaire calls "sa qualité essentielle de présent," then modernism confronts the question of authenticity with particular clarity. The modern is defined fundamentally in opposition to the past, that is, as that which distinguishes what is modern from what precedes it.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  The attempt to convey the particularity of the modern, its very presentness, is then bound to fail, for the act of representation itself relegates the present to the past and can at best appear as a repetition of a lost present.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Modernism thus emerges, as Vincent Sherry reminds us in his seminar contribution, as a series of radical Nows, a tradition of the new, in which authenticity is 

<b></b>

  associated not with efforts to keep the present present, but rather with transience itself. The authentic is defined by its own destruction. </p>

<p>It is perhaps not surprising, then, that Walter Benjamin finds one of the earliest theorizations of modernist aesthetics in images of suicide in Baudelaire's writing, namely in the essay "On the Heroism of Modern Life" from the <i>Salon of 1846</i>. Baudelaire's references to suicide follow a series of claims that announce the advent of modernism. "It is true that the great tradition is lost, and the new tradition has not yet been created . . . . Absolute eternal beauty does not exist, or at best is a mere abstraction drawn superficially from the surface of several kinds of beauty. The element of particularity of each form of beauty comes from the passions, and just as we have our particular passions, so we have our beauty."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Modernity, then, spells the end of an ideal of timelessness. Modern beauty, the beauty that modernist art seeks to convey, inheres in the particularity of the moment; whatever seems to transcend or survive the moment is nothing but an illusion, an abstraction. To illustrate his argument, Baudelaire turns to images of suicide: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Except for Hercules on Mount Oeta, Cato of Utica, and Cleopatra, whose suicides are not <i>modern</i> suicides, what other suicides do you see in classical painting? In all the lives of antiquity . . . you will not find the suicide of Jean-Jacques, or even the strange and marvelous suicide of Raphaël de Valentin

[the protagonist of Balzac's <i>La peau de chagrin</i>].</p>

<p class="continued">In a footnote, Baudelaire explains these examples: "The first kills himself because the burning of his robe becomes intolerable; the second because he can no longer aid the cause of liberty; and that voluptuous queen because she has lost her throne and her lover; but none of them destroys themselves in order to change their skin in view of metempsychosis" (<i>OC</i>, 2:494). Hercules, Cato, and Cleopatra die, that is, in order to preserve and perpetuate their own self-images. In these deaths, self-determination and fate, action and reaction, converge such that how they are interpreted cannot but coincide with their intentions. Thus while particular renderings of the deaths of these ancient heroes may appear superficially different, every image of the classical suicide demonstrates the perfect correspondence of image and manner of death. Classical suicide affirms the validity of an idealized image, and as such becomes the very image of classicism. Against such classical idealization, modern suicide marks a radical transformation. Committed "in view of metempsychosis," that is, of a transmigration of the soul whose destination is undetermined, it breaks with the past of the self and commits itself to a radically unknown and unknowable future. As such, modern suicide is not available to the artist as a mere subject of representation or emblem of modern life. Rather than give adequate form to an idea or era, modern suicide appears as a disruption. It takes place in the gap between what was and what has yet to be. One 

<b></b>

 who commits modern suicide acts not in order to confirm an existing identity but in order to become an unpredictable other. The question of whether his action affirms or denies an authentic intention or self-image becomes moot. This disruption identifies the modern suicide with modernism more generally, to the extent that modernism dwells in what Baudelaire identifies as the break between the "grand tradition" and the as-yet-unestablished new one. Modern suicide provides the very image of modernism.  </p>

<p>What does it mean for the artist to seek what is authentic in his art in an image of suicide? Whereas modern suicide in Baudelaire's text opposes the "mere abstraction" of timelessness, associated with a defunct classicism, Benjamin locates the force of modern suicide in its resistance to modern life itself: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The resistance which modernity offers to the natural productive élan of a person is out of proportion to his strength. It is understandable if a person grows tired and takes refuge in death. Modernity must appear under the sign of suicide, the seal of which is affixed beneath a heroic will that makes no concessions to a mentality hostile to it. This suicide is not a resignation but a heroic passion.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Modernity (<i>die Moderne</i>) colonizes the person and her specific life force and assimilates her to an abstraction, to a world of perpetual alienation.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Suicide in this light appears as a mere reaction to modernity's overwhelming power, the sign of its complete victory. It becomes a symptom, a cry for help to which the only appropriate response is to seek to prevent suicide (politically, medically, etc.). Understood as a symptom, however, suicide appears fundamentally as a mistake, in that it cannot achieve its own aims, such that the effort to prevent suicide itself becomes complicit with modernity's victory over individual agency. Modernity is thus imagined as a totalizing force that leaves no space for resistance. </p>

<p>The turn in Benjamin's argument that identifies suicide as "not a resignation but a heroic passion" suggests, on the other hand, that the sign of suicide may not merely ratify modern alienation, but may instead provide access to an experience or reality situated on the very threshold of modernity. The "seal" of suicide indicates the vantage point from which the difference between the modern and something external to the modern could be witnessed and where therefore the specificity of the modern, which is otherwise erased by modernity's abstracting power, could be grasped. To be fully modern, in this analysis, is to be dead. Suicide thus reveals the specificity of modernity to the modern artist—or more radically put, it makes modern art possible—because it creates the death that is modernity and does not merely succumb to it as something already accomplished.  </p>

<p>The complex alliance between the artist and the suicide suggested by the image of the seal does not survive Benjamin's subsequent efforts to identify concrete instances of modern suicide. In place of Baudelaire's admittedly strange examples, which Benjamin

<b></b>

  calls "meager," he substitutes res such as a Parisian printer who committed suicide in the wake of a failed attempt to organize a labor union, an Englishman who committed suicide out of financial despair and whose death became the subject of a popular lithograph, and another worker who hanged himself on Eugène Sue's doorstep.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  "Someone like Baudelaire," he speculates, "could very well have viewed suicide as the only heroic act that remained for the <i>multitudes maladives</i> of the cities in reactionary times" (<i>CB</i>, 82). What makes modern suicide modern is not the form it assumes but instead the social and political identity of those who commit suicide. But this recourse to social history severs the bond between modern suicide and the image of the artist implied by Baudelaire's references to his literary precursors Balzac and Rousseau (who was still in the mid-nineteenth century rumored to have taken his own life). An exploration of Baudelaire's particular examples is not possible here; they are not "meager" but extremely rich.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  I therefore instead turn for illustration to a short text by Baudelaire that develops this connection between suicide and modernism. </p>

<p>Baudelaire's "The Rope," a prose poem dedicated to Eduoard Manet and based on an event in Manet's life,<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  begins with a description of a world permeated by inauthenticity. Structured as a tale told by a painter to an anonymous friend, the poem describes a series of events that destroy the painter's faith in the adequacy of appearances to meaning and therefore in the existence of absolute and eternal truths. After a young boy whom he has employed as a model and servant kills himself in the painter's studio, the boy's mother begs the painter to give her the rope her son used to hang himself. Upon receiving a number of similar requests, the painter comes to suspect the mother of commercial motives. In one variant of the text, the friend, who is otherwise a silent auditor, concludes the story with a calculation of how much she stood to gain: "one meter of hangman's rope [corde de pendu] at one hundred francs per ten centimeters . . . that makes one thousand francs, or one <i>réel</i>, an effective consolation for that poor mother" (<i>OC</i>, 1:1339). The painter once thought of maternal love as the very cornerstone and guarantee of reality: "If there exists a single self-evident, simple, never-changing phenomenon . . . it is maternal love" (<i>OC</i>, 1:328). Now even this seeming absolute erodes, as the mother is suspected of exchanging the reality of her son's death for a <i>réel</i>, for a false, fungible reality.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  A singular event and a singular relationship become generic, interchangeable, inauthentic. </p>

<p>In terms that echo Marx's definition of commodity fetishism as "a definite social relation between men that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things," and that anticipate later characterizations of modernity as a space permeated by deception, as in Roger Rothman's discussion of Simmel and Bergson in his seminar contribution, the painter articulates the overall lesson of his tale in the opening lines of his monologue:<b></b> </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"Illusions," my friend told me, "are perhaps as innumerable as the relationships of men among themselves, or between men and things. And when the illusion disappears, that is to say when we see beings or things as they exist outside ourselves, we experience a bizarre feeling, composed half of regret for the vanished phantom, half of pleasant surprise before the new, before the real fact."</p>

	<div class="attrib">
[le fait réel]<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Whereas the mother's alleged complicity in the regime of inauthenticity appears to the painter as symptomatic, he assigns himself a diagnostic intelligence that stands at the threshold of the world of illusions, able to witness the moment when illusion is exposed as such, that is, when the overwhelming inauthenticity of modern life is revealed. Reality, which he once identified with the self-evident and never changing, now appears only at the moment when that very illusion disappears, such that whatever appears to be real—whatever assumes a self-evident and never-changing face—is by definition illusion. Modern reality, then, does not exist as a stable object—when the regret and the surprise wear off, will the "real fact" not be absorbed back into the network of illusions?—but rather as an act, a deed, which is another meaning of <i>fait</i>. The painter's own authenticity—his status as a modern artist and the authenticity of his work, which is the very tale he tells—thus hinges on his ability to transmit the event of the suicide in a way that resists the regime of illusion, in a way that does justice to its eventfulness.  </p>

<p>The painter's possible failure in this enterprise is suggested by the terms in which his relationship to the boy is described. Whereas the painter sees himself as endowed with a faculty of observation that "makes life more living and more meaningful than it is to others," he treated the boy as a generic being, whom he "transformed now into a little bohemian, now into an angel, now into mythological Love," and whom he made wear "the vagabond's violin, the Crown of Thorns and the Nails of the Passion, and Eros's Torch" (<i>OC</i>, 1:329). The objectification of which he accuses the boy's mother replicates—or indeed, may be a projection of—his own treatment of the boy. Although wary of others who fetishize the rope at the expense of acknowledging the humanity of the boy, the painter himself demonstrates, as Christopher Prendergast suggests, an "unambiguous complicity in the reduction of the boy (whether in life or death) to an object of exchange."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  In this light, the boy's suicide resonates with Benjamin's efforts to see suicide as a form of resistance to modern alienation, as a radical form of labor strike.  </p>

<p>The dire alternative suggested by this reading—compliance or death—is complicated, however, as the painter discovers the boy's corpse, whose eyes, "wide open with a terrifying fixity, at first created in me the illusion that he was alive [me causèrent d'abord l'illusion de la vie]" (<i>OC</i>, 1:329). On one level, this image advances the idea of suicide-as-protest by challenging the artist's previous claim to "make life more living." Rather than reveal the meaning of what he sees, this practice here leads the artist into error as he mistakes death for life. But the reversal of the illusion-generating gaze also res the suicide as an appropriation of the means of artistic production. Hanging from a nail in the door of an armoire, in the place where in a painter's studio one might expect a mirror or perhaps a painting, the corpse, in a more literal translation, "caused me [the painter] to become an illusion of life." The corpse's gaze transforms the painter 

<b></b>

 into an image—except that instead of an idealizing gaze that "makes life more living," this gaze sees life as itself an illusion, the mask of death.  </p>

<p>The boy's suicide thus produces a new way of perceiving reality. Reality is now associated not with what is living but what is dead, such that the artist's authority as an artist now inheres in his ability to see through the illusion of life and to perceive his own death. This seems to take place in the following scene, which suggests an image of parturition as the painter cradles the boy's whole body in one arm while with the other he "cuts the cord" (<i>OC</i>, 1:330). Michel Butor has associated the boy in "La corde" with "the budding poet, the poet who has not yet created himself.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  One might add to Butor's suggestion that the lethal cord cutting into the child's neck more specifically suggests an image of stillbirth, in which the painter finds an image of his own dead self, where this death is the necessary condition of artistic authority.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Indeed, this transformation of the dead child into the re of the artist recalls Baudelaire's association of modern suicide with metempsychosis, as if the suicide's soul has effectively transmigrated into the painter's body, allowing the painter to bear intimate and authentic witness to the other's deed. </p>

<p>By the same token, however, the image of stillbirth threatens to become yet another idealization, annulling the specificity of the event of the boy's suicide as it converts this event into a preration of the artist's birth as an artist. As the story of the boy's death finally becomes a form of currency between himself and his friend, a tale to be exchanged, it becomes unclear whether the painter can avoid replicating the sort of commodification of which he and his friend accuse the mother. This reading acquires particular poignancy in light of the fact that Baudelaire normally sold his prose poems by the line.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  "The Rope," like the rope, is something that can be cut into pieces, bought and sold, in a market in which one line is worth as much as any other.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Baudelaire  plays on this idea when he characterizes his collection of prose poems as a whole to his publisher as having "neither head nor tail, because everything in it is, to the contrary, both head and tail at the same time." He continues: "Consider, I beg you, what admirable advantages [<i>commodités</i>] this combination offers to us all: to you, to me, and to the reader. We can cut where we wish, I my daydreams, you the manuscript, the reader his reading" (<i>OC</i>, 1:275). The <i>petits poèmes en prose</i> are "commodités" precisely because they can be "cut." Indeed, the fact that Baudelaire cut part of the poem (the lines quoted above in which the listener calculates the value of the rope) in order to publish it three separate times in two different versions suggests the financial advantages of this method.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  "The Rope" thus does not merely stand outside and comment upon the commodification of reality, but rather has this commodification as its condition of possibility.  </p>

<p>Yet the fact that the poem seemingly renounces the potential financial benefits of including the suppressed paragraph in the final version suggests that it also circulates in another economy, one that does not base a poem's value on its length. The poem is created by the event of this cutting, in and through its own self-mutilation. As such, it is like the boy, who emerges from the deathlike state of objectification through suicide. But if the poem creates itself by cutting itself up for sale, the analogy between the poem 

<b></b>

 and the boy might then suggest a reading of the boy's suicide that the painter never seems to consider, namely that the boy's act could be neither a reaction to the unlivable conditions of modernity nor a protest against the regime of illusions, but instead an act, like the poem, that invites its own commodification, in which the boy creates the rope's value through his suicide just as Baudelaire creates "The Rope"'s value through cutting it. One might even speculate (though this would be pure speculation, an attempt to earn interest without any investment of evidence) that the child commits an act of filial love, that his love returns to the mother the love she gave him, now salvaged from the painter's cynicism, in the troubling form of the gift of the rope. Cutting himself, the <i>fils</i> (son) becomes the <i>fil</i> (thread, cord), which preserves his identity only in the form of the cut. If this is the case, then the modernism of both the suicide and the poem—their status as authentically modern events, events that bear witness to the particularity of the modern—would inhere not in the ways they resist a modernity external to them, nor in the ways they react constitute symptoms to such a modernity. Their modernist authenticity would inhere instead in the dizzying logic of self-destruction, wherein to be authentically modern means to destroy the possibility of being authentic. The sale of the rope—its circulation not only in a marketplace of fetishized commodities but also in a cultural marketplace—would not then destroy something that otherwise would have remained authentic. Instead, it would suggest that authenticity is the price one pays for being modern. The consolation of the rope—and the consolation of modernism—is the confidence they place in the value of the very authenticity they destroy. </p>

The same is the case for concepts of modernism. Nonetheless, in a critical survey of concepts of modernism, Astradur Eysteinsson finds that "the self-conscious break with tradition must, I think, be seen as the hallmark of modernism, the one feature capable of lending the concept a critical coherence most of us can agree on, however we may choose to approach and interpret it." <i>The Concept of Modernism</i> (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1990), 52. </p>

Diverging accounts of the incident place it in Manet's studio at 4 rue Lavoisier, which he occupied until May 1859, or at 58 rue de la Victoire, where he worked from May 1859 until the summer of 1860. See Robert Kopp's notes to his edition of Charles Baudelaire, <i>Petits poèmes en prose</i> (Paris: Gallimard, 1973), 302–5. Tellingly, biographies of Manet often treat "La corde" as a source, claiming that the events in Manet's life took place as described in "La corde" (see, for instance, Beth Brombert, <i>Edouard Manet: Rebel in a Frock Coat</i> [Boston: Little, Brown, 1996]), while discussions of "La corde" often assume that Manet is the speaker. For a discussion of the discrepancies between Manet and the character of the painter in "La corde," see J. A.

Pierre Daix's account of the incident agrees that Baudelaire has exaggerated Manet's detachment, but points out that the poem accurately depicts the social divide between Manet and his models (<i>La vie de peintre d'Edouard Manet</i> [Paris: Fayard, 1983], 61). </p>
