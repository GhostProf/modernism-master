<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">E. J. Hobsbawm opens his book <I>Nations and Nationalism since 1780</I>
with an anecdote about "an intergalactic historian" who lands after a
nuclear war and, going through the archives, concludes that "the last
two centuries of the human history of planet Earth are incomprehensible
without some understanding of the term 'nation' and the vocabulary derived
from it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 I take Hobsbawm's appeal to this not otherwise very
entertaining anecdote as an illustration of how contradictory the general
understanding of nationalism has become. If he has to ascend into outer
space in search of an observer who will look at nations and nationalism
with an alien eye, it is presumably because everyone on earth during
these two centuries has been so much <I>inside</I> them, incapable of
breaking free from their categories and assumptions. So ubiquitous and
deep-rooted is the nation, Hobsbawm implies, that no perspective that
is truly alien to it could be discovered any closer to home.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The central argument of <I>Nations and Nationalism,</I> however,
would seem to suggest just the opposite. Appearances to the contrary,
nationalism is in fact no longer nearly as important as it once was,
Hobsbawm argues, for--to speak schematically--the globalization
of multinational capitalism in the postmodern era has undermined
it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Nationhood can now be bestowed on even the tiniest,
unlikeliest claimants, in much the same way that (as Wlad Godzich has
remarked)
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 the status of "culture" can suddenly be shared
equally between the "high" and the "low," because neither term is crucial
any longer to the projects of capitalist development. It would seem to
follow, then, that a skeptical, distanced view of nationalism, something
like Hobsbawm's own Olympian perspective--a perspective for which the
"intergalactic historian" is a rather transparent disguise--would be
common to a great many observers all over the planet. (Empirically,
this seems indeed to be very much the case.) But if so, then why
does the extra-nationalist perspective have to be incarnated by an
extraterrestrial? Why does Hobsbawm imply on the one hand that nearly
everyone stands outside nationalism, and on the other that nearly no
one does?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this paradox can be reformulated as a riddle--who is it that represents
nearly everyone and nearly no one?--then its answer may lie unexpectedly
near to hand: in that re of modernity whose self-appointed mission
has been to speak for the many, but whose social situation has been that
of a privileged few. Taking our cue from the suspicious redundancy of
the space-traveling researcher, that is, we can perhaps read Hobsbawm's
hesitation between a ubiquitous and a nonexistent supra-nationalist
perspective as a report on the structural contradictions of the
metropolitan intellectual. Intellectuals, Hobsbawm seems to suggest,
must be and yet cannot be, cannot be and yet must be, cosmopolitans.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Dreyfus Affair, which is often cited as the origin of the term
<I>intellectual,</I> exposed the category's immediate vulnerability to
charges both of class pride and privilege vis-&agrave;-vis "ordinary
people" and of treason to the fatherland. The latter charge has more
frequently been reversed since the era of national liberation struggles
and decolonization: while cosmopolitan intellectuals are still accused of
serving their own self-interest, they are now accused not of betraying
their nation, but of serving their nation, and the West, all too
well. But intellectuals themselves are often the first to make both
of these accusations--and this fact offers striking evidence of their
contradictory relation to nationalism. For where do such accusations
originate if not in an implicit claim to cosmopolitan <I>detachment</I>
from the nation?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Linked both to social hierarchy and to the guilty history of Eurocentric
universalizing, cosmopolitanism has been out of fashion. Metropolitan
intellectuals, feeling themselves newly accountable to a public sphere
stretching beyond the NATO alliance, have urged themselves to rediscover
their own particularity and their situatedness with respect to gender,
race, class, and, of course, nation. It has been widely assumed,
accordingly, that a truly supranationalist or even supra-national
viewpoint--the extent of the difference remains controversial--can
exist

<B></B>

 only as science fiction, a disembodied fantasy of quasi-divine
ubiquity and omniscience. Yet at the same time, I would argue, this
state of intergalactic alienation remains inscribed in the protocols of
even the most multicultural discourse. In part, this is a paradoxical but
necessary result of the same sense of accountability to a newly expanded,
less Eurocentric public opinion. According to metropolitan intellectuals,
Eurocentric universalizing discourse has been an unconscious way of
"speaking as," that is, speaking from within our best defended perimeters
of belonging. This is precisely why a <I>conscious</I> way of "speaking
as," a mode of address that anticipates and recognizes the diversity of
readers and colleagues, demands a degree of self-alienation. Despite
all the lip service paid to the humble acceptance of location and all
the sarcasm lavished on fantasies of disembodied mobility, therefore,
the fantasy or convention of geographical self-distancing is one that
academics and other intellectuals implicitly identify with and act out,
on a daily basis, through the whole range of their routine choices
of viewpoint and attitude, comparison and evaluation. To be sure,
genuine changes in the politics of scholarship have occurred since the
age of Matthew Arnold and Max Weber. It is clear that nationalism is
often a deep (and sometimes a necessary) inspiration for intellectual
work; if Julien Benda thought intellectuals were distinctively and
constitutively supranational, Weber described them as "predestined to
propagate the 'national idea.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Yet the abstraction of the
self from the nation remains a fantasy or convention without which the
form and even the content of intellectual life as we know it would
be unrecognizable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 In our heart of hearts, do we really
believe there can be a historian worthy of the name who is <I>not</I>
intergalactic?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unluckily, this is not merely a puzzle for intellectuals themselves. Both
points of this contradiction have become weapons in the continuing
attacks on U.S. teachers and other cultural workers, especially
though not exclusively from the right, that have been called the
"culture wars." The double charge is of course "Third Worldism" on
the one hand, "elitism" on the other. The right has presented its
opponents as traitors to European civilization, a new set of misguided
palefaces rapt with admiration before Third World redskins; it has also
presented them as coddled children of the 1960s, elitists out of touch
with American values, "tenured radicals." There is just enough truth
in each charge to give extra sting when they are consolidated by the
right's paradoxical appropriation of "class" as a weapon against the
left. Both charges are also translatable into a lack of concern for the
national welfare, and both lend themselves to a growing backlash, in
favor of teaching and against research, posed in the seductive terms of
national responsibility and democracy. In the interest of self-defense as
well as self-knowledge, then, intellectuals seem called upon to rethink
their narratives of where they come from and to propose some alternative
account of their undeniable yet perpetually denied cosmopolitanism, an
account that will help them to mediate between the charge of elitism
(one of postmodernism's accusations against modernism) and the charge
of nomadic, touristic delectation of distant cultures (modernism's
corresponding accusation against postmodernism).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once we are alerted to this state of contradiction, we can suddenly
appreciate that a certain amount of intellectual effort has already
gone into trying, however obliquely, to resolve it. For example,
ever-proliferating scholarship about nationalism offers the occasional
slender insight--most often implicit and in passing, yet all the
more valuable therefore--into the history of that which is <I>not</I>
nationalism, the apparently oxymoronic and troublingly reflexive question
of where cosmopolitanism might come from. (I offer two examples at the
end of this essay.) There has also been a more explicit move to salvage
the concept from its associations with class and Western privilege
by demonstrating the existence of a sort of demotic, non-Western or
non-elitist cosmopolitanism. James Clifford has emphasized the traveling
that is always already part of the non-European cultures investigated by
European ethnography; for Clifford, the phrase "different cultures" can
thus be replaced by the phrase "discrepant cosmopol-itanisms."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

Paul Gilroy's <I>The Black Atlantic</I> reveals the hidden circuits of
trans national cultural circulation that have gone into the constituting
of a hybrid, diasporic black identity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 In two interlocking
stories, one about himself as a Hindu anthropologist working among
Muslim peasants in Egypt, the other about the unsuspectedly rich
bonds of commerce and culture that linked India and the Mediterranean
in the prenationalist period of the twelfth century, Amitav Ghosh's
<I>In an Antique Land</I> paints a beautifully bittersweet picture
of a lost cosmopolitanism, a cosmopolitanism that his own travels and
those of contemporary Egyptian workers to and from Iraq cannot quite
reconstitute.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Summing up a distinct tendency, evident in
new journals like <I>Public Culture</I> and <I>Diaspora</I> as well
as the older <I>Transition,</I> the South African critic Benita Parry
writes in the latter, "there is a recognition that the 'global flows' of
transnational cultural traffic have issued in 'public cultures' productive
of an emergent <I>postcolonial</I> cosmopolitanism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Thus
extended both geographically and socially, the term <I>cosmopolitanism</I>
now includes an Indian slave sent by a Jewish merchant to transact
business around the Persian Gulf in the Middle Ages, African servants of
British travellers in the 1800s, African American travellers in modernist
Europe, and European or Caribbean or Asian au pairs in the contemporary
U.S., as well as the more obvious Third World intellectuals operating
out of metropolitan centers, like Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Edward W. Said,
and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To bring together the latter two groups--Third World intellectuals and
au pairs--is to raise, finally, the more restricted question I want
to explore in the remainder of this essay: namely, what to make of
a cosmopolitanism whose agents or participants are non-Western, but
whose movement is toward the "advanced" or "developed" West and can
thus be described as a form of upward mobility. Critics like Parry,
Tim Brennan, Aijaz Ahmad, and Spivak, among others, have wondered with
various degrees of alarm whether Third World fictions and careers
(including careers in the making and reading of fictions) that were
aimed at, and were embraced by, the metropolis could ultimately signify
anything other than an opportunistic affirmation of the metropolis. Spivak
makes a pointed parallel between the current First World enthusiasm for
Third World writers

<B></B>

and the earlier divide-and-conquer strategy of
colonialism, which simultaneously served the interests of the colonial
power and of a native-born "aspiring elite." Do we see here again, she
asks, "the old scenario of empowering a privileged group or a group
susceptible to upward mobility as the authentic inhabitants of the
margin"?
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Any critic writing in the metropolis today seems
obliged to reflect on this as well as on some further questions. Is it
possible that this diagnosis might itself repeat earlier charges against
"rootless cosmopolitanism" (like Rousseau's above)? Does cosmopolitanism
from the margins neatly duplicate that of the center? Does it leave
the metropolitan center precisely as it was? What does it tell us
about the center that it produces both narratives of upward mobility
and impatient critiques of those narratives, including our own? Is it
possible or desirable to produce political criticism that does not refer
to <I>some</I> narrative of upward mobility, feasible progress, personal
and collective development?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The double focus of these questions, referring at once to literary texts
and to critical careers, finds one revealing object of investigation
in the budding pre-Nannygate subgenre I call au pair narrative, as
in Bharati Mukherjee's short story (and novel) entitled "Jasmine" and
Jamaica Kincaid's novel <I>Lucy.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 I propose to begin
investigating the genre, in a preliminary and provisional way, through
the suggestive problematic offered by Spivak's essay "Three Women's
Texts and a Critique of Imperialism." In that essay, Spivak interprets
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s <I>Jane Eyre</I> as a double allegory: an allegory
of the role of empire in the canonical literature of the nineteenth
century, and an allegory of the twentieth-century "bourgeois feminist"
critic. Spivak suggests that Jane's upward mobility, marked by her final
replacement of Bertha/Antoinette as the rightful "Mrs. Rochester," is
achieved only by economically exploiting and symbolically destroying
res who represent Europe's colonial possessions. Jane's mobility,
moreover, has been mobilized in turn by recent feminist readers in the
metropolis, who find in it a legitimizing myth of feminist criticism's
parallel rise to institutional authority, this time at the expense of
postcolonial subjects, especially women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What does this brilliant and influential argument (I have commented on
it at length elsewhere)
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 tell us about au pair narratives,
twentieth-century refunctionings of the <I>Bildungsroman</I> that
have Third World women of color as their protagonists? Like <I>Jane
Eyre,</I> both <I>Lucy</I> and "Jasmine" can be seen as allegories of
upward mobility. In each, the nineteenth-century domestic's move from
the provinces to the capital is transposed into a transnational move
from the periphery to the metropolitan core.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Structurally
or at least geographically, the genre seems therefore to flatter the
metropolis as inevitable destination and saving source of freedom and
happiness. In a sort of female Naipaulism, the personal trajectory from
the Caribbean to the metropolis becomes paradigmatic of a Hegelian passage
from primitive unselfconscious barbarism to universal civilization, thus
relegating those who remain behind to a familiar sort of colonial stasis
and inferiority.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taken to the museum by her employer, Kincaid's Lucy finds an image of
herself in

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
some paintings by a man, a French man, who had gone halfway across the
world to live and had painted pictures of the people he found living
there. He had been a banker living a comfortable life with his wife
and children, but that did not make him happy; eventually he left them
and went to the opposite part of the world, where he was happier. I
don't know if Mariah meant me to, but immediately I identified with the
yearnings of this man; I understood finding the place you are born in
an unbearable prison and wanting something completely different from
what you are familiar with, knowing it represents a haven. (L, 95)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though Lucy does not seem to seek the material comforts that the painter
has fled, her non-European inversion of European escapism looks very
much like the metaphysical and political error that is involved,
Spivak says, in taking "Eurocentric economic migration as moment of
origin." Metropolitan readers may not welcome a genre that literally
advises the entire population of the Third World to emigrate, but
they are seldom averse to hearing that the Third World is a prison
and the First World a haven. The warm reception of the genre among
metro-politan readers (if not among academic critics) must therefore
be greeted with some misgiving. As Spivak warns, "the struggle of the
marginal in metropolitan space cannot be made the unexamined referent
for all postcoloniality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lucy, immediately after identifying with the Gauguin-like painter,
remembers her differences, that is to say, her additional disadvantages:
"I was not a man; I was a young woman from the fringes of the world, and
when I left my home I had wrapped around my shoulders the mantle of a
servant" (<I>L,</I> 95). Yet all of this might also be said, without much
distortion, about Jane Eyre, and at least in Spivak's reading it does not
sufficiently extenuate Jane's complicity with the imperial project. Is
anything altered by Lucy's handicaps--a list from which race is notably
missing--if the trajectory of her narrative nonetheless resembles so
closely the "great expectations" formula of the nineteenth-century
European bourgeoisie? For the metropolitan readership that gratefully
climbs the rising curve of Lucy's story, does it offer anything more than
a suitably displaced opportunity to reexperience that primal thrill? And
for critics in particular, is Kincaid's moral significantly different
from the one Spivak reprimands in <I>Jane Eyre?</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are differences, I think, but they show only because of further
similarities. <I>Lucy</I> and the two "Jasmines" share other narrative
structures with <I>Jane Eyre:</I> notably, the narrative perspective of
the servant/governess in the master's house and the motif of transgressive
trans-class sexuality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Again like <I>Jane Eyre,</I>
these narratives stage their upward mobility around the servant's
erotic energies. They associate those energies with the privilege of
narrative perspective on the one hand, and on the other with a threat
to disrupt the couple formed by master and legal wife. The short story
"Jasmine" ends with the au pair willingly seduced by the paterfamilias
(a professor of biology), while his wife, a

<B></B>

performance artist,
is away on tour. In <I>Lucy,</I> the opening chapter ends with the au
pair telling the husband and wife a dream in which the husband chased
her, naked, through the house, while the wife urged him on. And in the
last chapter, the couple breaks up and, apparently neither as cause nor
as effect, the protagonist departs, though the husband's adultery has
not been with her and her own sexual explorations have not been with
him.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here then is a large difference: marriage between master and servant,
which has served to re the reward of the servant's upward striving
at least since <I>Pamela</I>, is apparently no longer on the agenda. By
this means Mukherjee apparently resists (though this is less true in
the novel of the same name) the narrative of a migratory elite's upward
mobility. The last line of the short story runs as follows: "His hand
moved up her throat and forced her lips apart and it felt so good,
so right, that she forgot all the dreariness of her new life and gave
herself up to it" ("J," 135). The ambiguity of "it"--lovemaking as re
for the new life--along with the forcing of the lips and the dreariness
of the life seem to point to a moral: perhaps the moral of the book's
<I>Village Voice</I> reviewer, reprinted as a sentence fragment on the
paperback: "Particularly chilling because the heroine has no idea she's
being exploited." Unconscious exploitation would of course give a twist
to the <I>Pamela/Jane Eyre</I> story of upwardly-mobile eroticism. Here,
one might say, a Third World sunk in ever-deeper impoverishment finds
its re in the cheery immigrant woman whose sexual transgression
with the master can no longer be cashed in for any enduring social
advantage.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet Mukherjee clearly has trouble holding to the allegory of a Third
World class or collectivity that is <I>not</I> rising. The idea of
Jasmine's life as "dreariness" in the last line comes as something
of a surprise. Up to this point she has not seemed to mind her work
at all. In short, Mukherjee seems to be making a last minute effort to
impose a moral on her story, a moral that the story defies. Many readers
(not only those who have political doubts about her) will recognize that,
like her heroine, Mukherjee is clearly more than half in love with the
heady new Americanness of Jasmine's life. For example, Jasmine likes it
that in Ann Arbor men do the cooking, that her employers encourage her
to take courses at the University of Michigan and to be "more selfish"
("J," 131), that a mother's helper isn't like a servant, but "seemed
to be as good as anyone" ("J," 128). Mukherjee and Kincaid both seem
to buy into the American dream of self-invention from nothing. "I was
inventing myself" (<I>L,</I> 135), Lucy says, and while making love at
the end of the story, Jasmine thinks of herself as "a bright, pretty
girl with no visa, no papers, no birth certificate. Nothing other than
what she wanted to invent and tell" ("J," 135).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are we thus left, after all, with an allegory not of seductive
exploitation but of celebratory Americanization? Perhaps the options
need not be so symmetrical. It would be provincial of American readers
to recognize a disparity between American dreams and American realities
in these stories, yet to see nothing else here <I>but</I> American
reality--as if the reversals of the social order Jasmine knows are
of no significance except as an affirmation of American values; as
if nothing

<B></B>

about Jasmine's new life could possibly be preferred
over her old one by her own, non-American criteria. And it would be
provincial not to see that adding race to Bront&euml;'s class and gender
terms is bound to produce (as Bront&euml; herself already produced)
more complex relations between characters and collectivities than a
zero-sum allegory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 It is clear that these texts prolong and
appropriate the <I>Jane Eyre</I> allegory; it is not clear that, in so
doing, they are obliged to accept the zero-sum linearity of the social
ladder, with its implication that my rise is necessarily your fall.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the novel <I>Jasmine,</I> published one year later, the au pair
protagonist--this time an immigrant from India rather than from the
Caribbean--again falls in love with her employer, or rather with "what
he represented to me, a professor who served biscuits to a servant"
(<I>J</I>, 148). Unlike her namesake, she is given narrative room to end
up successfully (if not yet legally) displacing the first, white, legal
wife. Yet it is unclear how much the displacement really signifies. The
wife has initiated all this by seeking her own happiness with someone
else. And for Jasmine, bonding with her former employer seems to mean
responding less to him then to "the promise of America." Like the heroes
of such modernist <I>Bildungsromane</I> as <I>Sons and Lovers</I> and
<I>A Portrait of the Artist,</I> she reaches a conclusion, "greedy with
wants and reckless from hope" (<I>J,</I> 213-14), that is less a union
than a fresh departure.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Keeping closer than the short story to the <I>Jane Eyre</I> materials,
the novel even includes, in the series of men it offers its au pair
heroine, an older, prosperous, and allegorically crippled husband. But
this Jasmine leaves behind her cripple, a banker shot and paralyzed by an
angry client, along with his prosperity, which is shown to be complicit
with the bankruptcies and suicides of surrounding farmers. Indeed, she
makes this decision soon after his child (again, as in <I>Jane Eyre,</I>
foreign and adopted, and like Jasmine a refugee from the explicit but
unexplained horrors of Third World violence) also decides to leave. "The
world is divided," she says, "between those who stay and those who leave"
(<I>J,</I> 203). Is Mukherjee saying that the only way up is to leave,
and the only way to stay is to be crippled? I cannot entirely disagree
with those who read her in this way, but to do so is to miss other
and more interesting things that she is also saying. Crucially, she
is displacing the <I>Jane Eyre</I> narrative's emphasis from an upward
to a <I>lateral</I> move. Her biscuit-serving professor and his (also
adopted) daughter belong, no less than the banker, to the class of those
who can afford to pay for personal rather than institutional childcare. In
choosing them, the former au pair is not making any visible or significant
sacrifice of economic privileges or life possibilities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

Allowing Jasmine to move within one social level rather than between
levels, Mukherjee displaces the narrative interest onto a choice between
modes of being: between, specifically, a mode of staying that, like
the banker's, slowly chokes those who are similarly forced to stay on
their land, and a mode of mobility, not profitable but pleasurable, that
is committed to no positive or alternative values, only to not being or
doing or submitting to <I>that.</I> Leaving, which occupies the concluding
space of marriage, identifies the ending as a

<B></B>

choice between being
a victim and being a victimizer while it also evades that choice; Jasmine
could as easily be the latter as the former, it suggests bravely, but it's
better to be neither. If Mukherjee's answer is mobility, in other words,
it is not necessarily <I>upward</I> mobility, except in the sense that
"upward" might refer to moral rather than social hierarchy. If opting
between different middle-class attitudes toward social injustice is not
opting out of social injustice, neither is it the luxury of perpetual
cosmopolitan tourism or the frivolity of free erotic choice without
social consequences.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same evasion or reinterpretation of upward mobility informs the
ending of the short story "Jasmine." The story's concluding ambiguity is
not technically subtle, but its very willedness--rough, unprepared for,
tacked on abruptly at the end--might be said to foreground the question
of will, especially Jasmine's own will and the value the reader will
place on it. This Jasmine, even more than the novel's, is presented as
smart, active, ambitious, choosing her fate--and choosing to make love
with her employer. Can consensual sex be interpreted, like money, as
the object of a zero-sum calculation? Placed in a uniquely determining
position, can sex function effectively as the stakes in a race, class,
or gender allegory? The heavy weight that Mukherjee drops onto Jasmine's
consenting consciousness in the moment of sexual relation transforms that
consciousness (or unconsciousness), like Pamela's, into a crucial space
of interpretive ambiguity, a battleground where conflicting allegories
collide. At this moment, is she an unconscious representative of her race
or class? A conscious representative of her sex?
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Neither of
the above? By ending in an ambiguous instant of silencing and pleasure,
stopping short before the social consequences of the lovemaking can
appear--a decision reflected in the generic difference between short story
and novel--Mukherjee opens up the possibility of an allegory that would
aim neither at marriage and displacement of the lawful wife (sex as gain),
nor at exploitation (sex as loss), but at some other conclusion, including
the pure provisionality of pleasure seized for its own sake in and despite
hierarchical power. Given the booming transnational sex trade, it is a
morally risky business, but Mukherjee does not preclude the option that
sex may not in itself mean <I>anything</I>--that it can be a possession or
a gift; can belong to an economy of scarcity or an economy of abundance;
can be an act of hostility toward the wife, or irrelevant to her; can
be an allegory of class, or of gender, or of neither.

 She
suggests that in striking off athwart the <I>Jane Eyre</I> structure of
marriage-as-social-microcosm, this text does not <I>fail</I> to achieve
<I>Jane Eyre'</I>s social ambitions or its allegorical centrality, but
rather <I>succeeds</I> as one allegory of a society of multiple subject
positions where there <I>is</I> no such center. It poses as a question,
in other words, the zero-sum model according to which there can only be
one (male) master, and one master's wife.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here it is instructive to compare the place of sex and marriage in
<I>Lucy</I> with their role in the preceding story. Lucy does not sleep
with her
employer, although as I said, much of the <I>Jane Eyre</I> structure is
still intact: above all, the breakup of the master/wife couple coinciding
with the erotic and professional rise of "the

<B></B>

young girl who watches
over the children" (<I>L,</I> 7). The parallel seems deliberate. "In my
own mind," Lucy says, "I called myself other names: Emily, Charlotte,
Jane. They were the names of the authoresses whose books I loved"
(<I>L,</I> 149). Like Jane Eyre, Lucy reacts strongly against people
who are physically beautiful; she plays out some of the same opposition
of birth and merit that makes <I>Jane Eyre,</I> among other things,
a reading of the French Revolution. Sex, unlike beauty, can be aligned
with merit, and Lucy takes a serious interest in it. It signifies various
things for her: an achievement wrested from a bleak place, a rebuke to
her mother's morals, a proof of her independence: "life as a slut was
quite enjoyable, thank you very much" (<I>L,</I> 128). It is an object
of competition: a girl who has had an experience that might be described
as "sexual abuse" makes her jealous; she wishes it had happened to her
(<I>L,</I> 105). But for Lucy sex is precisely <I>not</I> a way to rise
to the social achievement marked by upwardly mobile marriage. Marriage,
like sex between master and servant, does not interest her; wanting not
to be married is one of her most conscious motives.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Though
she records and presides over the breakup of her employers' marriage, and
though she unloads much of her anger on the wife, Lucy shows no conscious
desire to replace her in the arms of her too-handsome husband. One might
say that for her, too, sex is lateral rather than vertical. In not needing
or wanting sex from the married couple she serves, in not bonding with
them in a trans-class marriage plot, Lucy retains the negative, critical
side of that plot while taking her own story off on a tangent.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generalizing a bit recklessly, one might make this a sort of postmodern
allegory--an allegory of a decentered society in which one woman's rise
is <I>not</I> necessarily another's woman's fall, and in which the
multiplicity of subject positions suggests that significant movement
may be neither rise nor fall. I add that it is possible, in comparison
to <I>Jane Eyre,</I> to see the broken and incomplete marriages, the
inconclusive and lateral sex of these texts, as very much a step up, or
at least a step in the right direction. A reviewer of Kincaid in <I>The
Nation</I> remarked that much of the unease she seemed to inspire
in readers came from the "protagonist's failure to accede to white
people--i.e. power--as a determining factor in her life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

Such remarks remind us that the exhaustive closure of zero-sum allegory,
even if that allegory captures in microcosm a struggle with white power,
can serve as a sort of consolation prize to that power, a backhanded
means of insisting on its illusory centrality.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this sense, Kincaid's strongest revision of the <I>Jane Eyre</I>
story is her commentary on the theme of the Other Woman versus the
Lawful Wife. Brimming with anger, Lucy aims much of it at the First World
middle-class feminist who cannot understand her and drives her wild with
rage when she brags not so subtly of having "Indian blood." "How do you
get to be the sort of victor," Lucy asks herself, "who can claim to be the
vanquished also?" (<I>L,</I> 41). It is this anger, I have suggested, that
finds an indirect expression in the smashing of the marriage, which Lucy
catches, marks, and joins in an unforgettable moment with her camera: as
if unaware of what is going on, she tells the

<B></B>

miserable, quarreling
couple on the couch, "Say cheese!" (<I>L,</I> 118). But for all this, the
contrast with <I>Jane Eyre</I> is striking. The wary, hesitant friendship
between the two women survives the breakup of the household, as it also
survives the wife's sense of betrayal when Lucy breaks her contract and
leaves. Some of the inconclusiveness of sex and marriage in <I>Lucy</I>
is there perhaps because the real story has shifted to the women. The
struggle is not over occupying the male position, that is, but over their
own vexed and difficult solidarity. The upward mobility of the Third World
au pair may not require the displacement of, or eternal antagonism to, the
First World upper-class feminist and/or professional woman. The wife may
be something like a class enemy to Lucy, but is her gender ally at the
same time. Because there is no one central contradiction in society, no
one linear path of historical development, the logic that links multiple
actors must be complex.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this seems an unnecessarily roundabout way of repeating the platitude
that class is not primary, not the single ultimately determining
instance, it does not mean, of course, that class can be ignored. If
sex has become lateral, it is in part because the class a writer like
Mukherjee represents has indeed made a lateral move. Her particular
diaspora, from the Indian subcontinent, is largely middle and upper-middle
class, arriving in the U.S. with well developed, saleable skills and/or
a certain capital.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 In a sense, then, Mukherjee is doing
nothing but projecting her particular class experience onto the au pair
narrative. At the same time, laterality is a fact of the postmodern social
formation that no left-wing analysis can afford to ignore, a fact recently
characterized by the controversial term <I>post-Fordism</I> to designate
the dominant or emergent regime of economic accumulation. Even critics
of this term seem to accept a new flexibility in assigning the workforce
to its tasks, a widespread use of temporary and part-time labor, and a
blurring of the line between conceiving and executing tasks and between
skilled and unskilled labor--in short, a shift away from Fordism's "rigid
division of labor" and "extreme fragmentation of tasks."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Not
that this so-called "flexible specialization" represents a utopian impulse
bent on ending poverty, unemployment, and social contradiction; it is
simply a non-negotiable condition under which social contradictions will
be played out, or fought out, in the near future. As a result, the au pair
version of the <I>Jane Eyre</I> plot may be less eccentric than it seems.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Domestic service remains one of the major sources of employment for
women displaced by the international division of labor and traveling from
country to city, whether across national borders or not. Yet, as all of
these texts take the trouble to note, the au pair, like the governess
before her, cannot simply be labelled a domestic servant. The term comes
from <I>pair,</I> meaning equal, as in equality of exchange of currencies
between countries. Strictly speaking, according to Larousse, to be "au
pair dans une maison" (the noun form is a spinoff) means "&ecirc;tre
log&eacute; et nourri sans appointements, en &eacute;change de certains
services."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 The experience of travel, with its implicit
promise of cultural capital, is bartered against nonwage domestic
services. This not only keeps the care of children, and

<B></B>

the women
who provide it, protected from the risks and opportunities of the wage
economy; it also keeps them apart, at least potentially, from class
difference.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The protagonist of Mukherjee's short story is
the daughter of a doctor. Like Mukherjee herself, she can be seen as
seeking to reproduce her class position, rather than seeking to rise
out of it, in the hostile territory where Third World middle class can
all too easily become First World lower class.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, it is understood that this work will be temporary, a brief
stage in the life of a woman who might well go on to pay, or already be
paying, another woman to take care of her own children.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 The
class indeterminacy of the au pair, who can be an educated, relatively
privileged re or on the contrary a domestic servant forced to do the
dirtiest, most isolating, and most poorly remunerated job, is in a sense
no more than the multiple logic of a time when gender and race identities
cannot be reduced to class terms, when the so-called new social movements
that do not define themselves in national terms have been globalized,
when a certain social indeterminacy has therefore been generalized by the
international division of labor. In the ending of <I>The Country and the
City,</I> which might be described from one angle as a meditation on the
geography of the <I>Bildungsroman,</I> Raymond Williams tries to extend
his previous argument into the larger world of the British Empire and
the global neocolonialism that has followed it--to do, that is, what the
au pair narrative does with <I>Jane Eyre.</I> The country, he says, is
now the Third World, while both the city and the country that Williams
has been discussing--British city and British country--suddenly become
the imperial "city" to that country.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The difficulty is the
"suddenly." In fact, this new division goes back through much of the
history the book has traversed. The British country has been part of a
global city, that is, for two or three centuries. To see the country/city
opposition in the context of the international division of labor is
thus to relativize it dramatically. And the same is also true for the
categories of class, race, and gender that the <I>Bildungsroman</I>
and the au pair narrative graft onto the geography of country and
city. Relative to the massively exploited Indian textile workers whose
industries were closed down before English textiles replaced them, the
British working class is not simply a working class. And the reverse
is also true: in the international division of labor, native elites are
not simply elites.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Freely adapting a well-known saying, Spivak has occasionally described
the imperative behind her work as follows: "Promise them anything, but
give them the international division of labor." It is a very artful
line: the flippant allusion to perfume quietly undercuts the appeal
to an ultimate foundation that the international division of labor
might otherwise seem to be making. And this stylish undercutting is
not frivolous. For the point of invoking the international division of
labor is precisely and concisely to insist, without a laborious trotting
out of additional social categories of the injured and excluded, that
even the gravest social injustices are never completely reducible to
a simple class allegory. As a transnational re, the literary au
pair stands in for global capitalism's systematic destabilization of
local class divisions, which is by no means the effacing of

<B></B>

those
divisions. And this is perhaps how to understand the au pair's distinctive
class indeterminacy. The industrious artisans of the 1820s and 1830s
could stand at once for those above and those below them in the social
hierarchy, for the factory owner as well as the factory operative; thus
they did the work of political representation--which is never reducible
to the reflection of any specific constituency--while both running its
risks and exercising its powers. The au pair of the 1980s and 1990s runs
no less visible risks, among them the risk of being read as a postcolonial
fetish that magically obliterates the domestic injuries of class. But
attention must also be paid to the potential powers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is above all those left behind on the periphery who oblige us
to distrust the exemplary value of the au pair's tale. One cannot
straightforwardly conclude that a story of the displacement of the white
First World wife is actually aimed at displacing people of color who have
not left home. To be sure, making a new life in the metropolis cannot be
the story of the postcolonial subject as such, as Spivak points out. But
once we agree that there <I>is</I> no such single paradigmatic story, it
may become easier to see that, through the mediations and displacements
that all reading presumes, the au pair narrative does in fact possess
allegorical, generalizing powers that need not be ruthlessly curbed or
renounced. The trope of one-way travel need not mean, after all, that
nation and race are merely skins to be shed in the interest of quicker
acculturation. If race can stand for that which should not be left
behind, it is also that which Lucy brings with her and makes her mission
to communicate, especially to her feminist employer. As a genre, the au
pair narrative seems devoted on the one hand to spurning uplift or worldly
success in strictly economic terms, on the other to finding expression
for explosive, even unconscious anger. Offering a story of resistance to
assimilation as much as a story of assimilation, the genre simultaneously
questions racial difference (as a metropolitan obstacle to be overcome),
insists on racial difference (as a historically sedimented experience),
and, as much as either of these, reinscribes and even reinvents racial
difference within the new, shifting social landscape of the metropolis,
a landscape populated by Irish nannies and Vietnamese refugees and white
middle-class feminists who have no predetermined place in pre-migratory
binary categories. These reinscriptions and reinventions, with their
newly discovered hostilities and tentative internationalist solidarities,
would be enough to give the genre a real claim to represent an alternative
upward mobility, an imagination of unrealized social progress.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an essay called "Whose Nation?" historian Linda Colley argues that
in the period from 1780 to 1830 the British state did not encourage
nationalism, as one might have expected, but actually tended to
resist it. It did so, at a time when the word <I>patriot</I> meant
a dangerous subversive, because nationalism was seen as a cover for
dangerous self-assertion and upward mobility on the part of the lower
classes. "For many social conservatives," Colley writes, "placing a
premium on service to the nation was opening the door dangerously wide
to a meritocracy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 It follows from Colley's argument
that, conversely, a more democratic state might

<B></B>

well be more
nationalistic, and this is precisely what one finds in Disraeli's
Crystal Palace speech of 1872, a speech that is often credited with first
uncovering England's imperial mission. England would "have to decide,"
Disraeli said, "between national and cosmopolitan principles. The issue
is not a mean one. It is whether you will be content to be a comfortable
England...or whether you will be a great country--an Imperial country--a
country where your sons, when they rise, rise to paramount positions,
and obtain not merely the esteem of their countrymen, but command the
respect of the world."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Through the rising sons, nationalism
offers the working and middle classes a field for upward mobility. More
surprisingly, the elitist cosmopolitanism that Disraeli sets against
them is a source of resistance to imperialism itself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These liberal mid-century cosmopolitans, not so distant ancestors
of Hobsbawm's intergalactic historian, are far from an imitable
ideal. The same evolutionary assumptions that qualified their support
for nationalism--nations were, in Hobsbawm's paraphrase, "a second-best
to world unity" (<I>NN,</I> 31)--also provided the very prototypes of
academic racism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Yet Hobsbawm is right, I think, not to
dismiss them out of hand. For one precedent they set is the resist-ance to
democratization and mass politics--Disraeli's mobilizing of mass support,
in the name of race and nation, for imperial rivalry--in the name of a
larger and higher notion of democracy. Cosmopolitan intellectuals refused
to be paralyzingly accountable to a national public opinion geared up for
imperialism, yet they were no less accountable to the wider though merely
potential public of imperialism's victims. If they refused Disraeli's
appeal to upward mobility, they did so not by refusing upward mobility
as such, but rather by offering another version of the story, a story
of upward mobility with another, more populous collective subject.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hidden away within the laziness of democratic pieties, as we know, are
all the strenuous problems of minorities and majorities, of contradictory
loyalties to multiple and overlapping social units and identities. It
would clear the air somewhat if, instead of the usual breast-beating,
there were a corresponding recognition that elitism is inevitably as
various, fissured, and problematic as the versions of democracy to
which it is contrasted. Most obviously, the intellectual who refuses
the effort to become a national voice may thereby become a member of
a smaller, "elite" collectivity--say, a professional one--and at the
same time may be claiming or seeking democratic participation in a
much larger collectivity that stretches beyond the nation. The modes
of belonging and participation are unlikely to be identical on these
different scales--but this is all the more reason not to bring to bear
on them a single standard of political judgment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fate of the nineteenth-century story of upward mobility as it is
reappro-priated and refunctioned by Third World writers would seem
to demand the same sort of discrimination. If, like cosmopolitanism,
terms like <I>progress</I> and <I>modernity</I> lend themselves to
metropolitan self-flattery, it would be more metropolitan self-flattery
to believe that this one usage always and everywhere defines their
political meaning. Those who urgently need to "change their lives"

<B></B>

do not speak lightly of progress, even if they rightly distrust
the universalized inevitabilist gradualism that has been its frequent
ideological form. While it presents itself as metropolitan self-critique,
the unreflective scorn for modernity among Western intellectuals actually
functions as metropolitan self-aggran-dizement. Like a certain left-wing
anti-professionalism, aimed obliquely at the new place made for themselves
in the academy by women and people of color, this apparent self-critique
denigrates precisely that which, in the metropolis, is now being desired
and demanded by intellectuals on the periphery. This is kicking away the
ladder one has climbed oneself; it ensures that the necessarily higher
ground from which the critique emanates remains in metropolitan hands
and defines the metropolis's continuing superiority.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps conferring the honorific of cosmopolitan on the au pair can
be interpreted as the same kind of self-legitimizing move on the
part of today's transnational intellectuals that Spivak diagnosed
in establishment feminism's use of <I>Jane Eyre</I>--the professors
serve the biscuits to the servants and eat them too, as it were. But
if so, isn't it equally likely that metropolitan purposes are served
by making Spivak's point, and my own? No reference to the purposes
of the metropolis as a whole can resolve disputes within it. A wider
political standard is needed--and that, I would argue, is just what
would-be cosmopolitan critics can legitimately take from the parallel
offered them by Mukherjee and Kincaid. For critics, as for au pairs,
the crossing of national boundaries is less a step up in the world than
a destabilization of the world. One aspect of that destabilization
is an imperfect yet peremptory match between new privileges and new
responsibilities. Critics, like au pairs, bring the international
division of labor into the intimacy of metropolitan space, and thus become
vehicles for anger and con-frontation as well as possible participants
in the fashioning of fragile new trans-national solidarities. Both the
anger and the solidarity are indispensable steps in the transnational
stretching of criticism's public accountability, its acknowledge-ment
that the public sphere in which it must now participate extends beyond
the circle of its past interlocutors--in short, its cosmopolitanism
in the most positive sense. From this perspective, the metropolitan
anger that has greeted academic criticism's transnational extension of
interests is perhaps a sign that some work of representation is in fact
being done. Among its other referents, then, upward mobility is perhaps
also a narrative re for the surplus value added by this work, a
value that has its own impersonal but ultimately progressive trajectory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Edward Said's negotiation between the metropolis and Third World
intellectuals in <I>Culture and Imperialism</I> offers a useful
concluding paradigm. Said's metropolis is newly but now ineluctably
self-divided. As a result of "adversarial internationalization in an age
of continued imperial structures," opposition has arisen in the modern
metropolis, an opposition that emerges out of the precarious coalition
of personal mobility and impersonal representativeness: "anti-imperialist
intellectual and scholarly work done by writers from the peripheries who
have immigrated to or are visiting the metropolis is usually an extension
into the metropolis of large-scale mass movements."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 In
one of his many provocations

<B></B>

 to the established protocols of
scholarly disillusionment, Said allows what he calls "the voyage in,"
the story of how these visitors and immigrants have both integrated
themselves into and transformed metropolitan culture, to supply an
unexpectedly and incongruously cheerful undertone to the book. The
collective <I>Bildungsroman</I> of Third World intellectuals who have
come to live and work in the metropolis, repeating in transnational
terms the country-to-city journey of the nineteenth-century novel,
also works its way into Said's innovative treatment of the novel
of disillusionment. In an indirect reply to Franco Moretti's darkly
Lukacsian view of the genre, Said appreciatively displays Third World
reversals of <I>Heart of Darkness,</I> like Tayeb Salih's <I>Season of
Migration to the North.</I> Moretti sees the genre dying a modernist
death when European men, losing faith in their own projects, have tired
of it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Said's insistence on its continuing vitality in the
hands of Third World men and women would appear on the contrary to express
the intelligent optimism of a stratum or category that is still rising,
energetic, confident of its powers. Or if optimism seems too strong,
call it by the neologism coined by another great Palestininan writer:
"pessoptimism."

Rough or violent sex, also a motif in <I>Lucy,</I> in both texts
seems to play dangerously with the ambiguity as to whether such violence
inescapably calls down upon it an allegory of political domination.

The amount of allegorical "give" in a narrative like <I>Jane
Eyre</I> is already a difficult question in nineteenth-century Britain:
Jane is of course both a re for the middle class and a re for
women, and this duplicity is not definitively resolvable into the re
of Jane-as-middle-class-woman. If middle-class feminism can take it
over, so for example can middle-class radicalism in general, which is
of course the dominant form in the university.

Here the surprisingly pertinent parallel would be Jane Eyre's

This might be related to the history of monogamy as an
Orientalist trope, basic to Western civilization's self-definition or
differentiation--as indeed it is in <I>Jane Eyre</I> itself. It is of
course a strange trope, given how far from monogamous Western society
is or ever was.

Cynthia Enloe, in the final chapter of <I>Bananas, Beaches,
and Bases</I> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989), is
extremely insightful on the relation between the history of feminism and
the history of domestic work, as well as on the correspondence between
racial difference and the hierarchy of childcare workers. According
to her scheme, white professional nannies who do no housework are on
top; on the bottom are women of color who "are available for household
chores as well" and who "are not thought of as professionals." Racially
heterogeneous but more often white, au pairs, who see their work "as a
short-term job, a way to travel and learn another language before moving
on to more serious commitments,  are in the middle, and thus partake
symbolically in both upper and lower social worlds.

It has been argued that feminism itself could come into
existence in the West only because middle-class women in the First
World, unlike middle-class women in the Third World, did <I>not</I> have
access to affordable domestic servants. Thus the relation between Third
World au pair and First World feminist professional becomes even more
complexly allegorical, and it becomes even less clear that the move to
the metropolis is simply a move up. See Martha Gimenez, "The Dialectics
of Waged and Unwaged Work," in <I>Work without Wages: Domestic Labor
and Self-Employment within Capitalism</I> ed. Jane L. Collins and Martha
Gimenez (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990), 25-46.

The quotient of allegorical play or "give" in this narrative,
which lends itself to the diverging imaginative agendas of readerships
or constituencies that are not composed of Third World au pairs, is
not the same as literariness itself, but like literariness it has a
history. One can speculate that this quotient may have shifted along with
post-Fordism's regime of flexible accumulation or flexible specialization,
which is often taken to distinguish a characteristically postmodern from
a modernist sense of identity. According to this reasoning, modernism's
Fordist refashioning of the producer/consumer self would have given way to
less control over a more multiple selfhood, more free to be different and
yet also less able to touch or influence the veiled, dispersed forces that
continue to constrain it. In this sense, the au pair narrative could be
said to offer itself to the hopes and desires of more types of readers,
while it also offers each of them less of a vicarious victory: while it
persistently equivocates, that is, between the suggestion of an upward
movement and the suggestion of a merely lateral movement. How much can
be won, what indeed is "winning" about, from the moment when there is
no center to occupy?
