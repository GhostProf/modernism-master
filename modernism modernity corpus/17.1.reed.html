<div id="body">
<p>In 1962 Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg ended a seven-year relationship. While together, they had exhibited a cerebral wit and an openness to popular culture that distinguished them from other young New York artists. They were in such sympathy that Johns recalls making pieces later sold under Rauschenberg's name.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Now their artistic developments diverged almost immediately. In September 1962 Johns's ex visited Andy Warhol's studio. Warhol had just begun employing silk screen. This efficient means of transferring photographic images to canvas made a deep impression on Rauschenberg. By October, he was also using the process. Down to the present day, he has remained fascinated by the superimposition of mechanically- or chemically-reproduced images flush with the plane of their support.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Johns visited Warhol's studio in November. Johns, Warhol recalled, "didn't look too thrilled."<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> He later claimed that Johns disliked his art because he was too "swish."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Johns, though, almost certainly found Warhol's silk screens unexciting for aesthetic reasons, too. He had already embarked on a new project that eschewed photography, mechanization, and cool irony. From 1962 to 1963, he produced a series of pieces that meditate on the life and verse of the modernist poet Hart Crane (1899–1932): the paintings <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage, Diver, Land's End</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope (Hart Crane)</span>; the drawings <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Untitled (Periscope)</span>; and the lithograph <span style="font-style:italic;">Hatteras</span>. These artworks are defiantly hand-made. All but <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, the earliest, feature handprints, apparently the result of pressing his own hand directly onto the works' surfaces. They all employ many of the painterly techniques identified with 1940s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and 50s Abstract Expressionism: vigorous visible brushwork, an indifference to spills and smears, and a thick uneven layering of paint. Early critics such as Alan Solomon marveled at the tumultuous emotion expressed in the Crane series,<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> and Johns himself awkwardly drew attention to it in a 1963 interview: "It seems to me that the effect of the more recent work is that it is more related to feeling or emotion or … (pause) … Let's say emotional or erotic content."<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Much recent writing posits a connection between Johns's break up and his decision to look to Crane for inspiration.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> Jill Johnston has made the most convincing case. She cites circumstantial evidence that suggests Johns saw the torments of his personal life mirrored in Crane's. In the same year Johns painted <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, his first Crane homage, he also turned thirty-two, the age at which the poet jumped to his death from the cruise liner <span style="font-style:italic;">Orizaba</span>.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> She also points to elements of the Crane paintings, such as the upthrust hand in <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> and the inverted central re in <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>, which suggest identification between the unhappy artist and the suicidal poet.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> Johns, she concludes, "appears to be crying for help" even as he seeks "solace and fellowship" by "[c]ommuning with Crane."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Despair alone, however, cannot explain the Crane series. Johns could have chosen many means of expressing angst. Why Hart Crane? And why, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>, memorialize the poet in oil, with noticeably Abstract Expressionist handling of paint? In the 1950s, in works such <span style="font-style:italic;">False Start, Painting with Two Balls</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Thermometer</span>, Johns had satirized prevailing assumptions among New York School artists, especially their unreflective equation between bold gestures, thick applications of paint, machismo, and authenticity. Why would he resurrect many of these discredited techniques not to mock but to honor a writer famous for splashy excess?</p>
<p>These are not idle questions. Johns's flags, targets, and beer cans feature prominently in accounts of postmodernism's emergence, pre-histories of Pop Art, and tales of conceptualism's rise. He typically comes across as a stern philosophical thinker scornful of sentimentality and mysticism. While many feminist and queer reassessments since Moira Roth's "The Aesthetic of Indifference"  have challenged this image, they have not entirely unseated it.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> The tendency has been to "deploy a mixture of biographical and iconographic analysis" and reveal that his artworks are "confessional texts which speak of their maker's gay subjectivity in hidden or coded language." The aim has been to make "gay subjects belatedly present, both to the contemporary viewer of the works of art in question, as well as within the disciplinary narratives of the art historical record."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Critics have not yet pondered whether Johns's inquiries into queer affect undermine instead of supplement disciplinary narratives. Nor have they asked what reasons other than sexuality might motivate his interest in Crane. Johns, this article shows, turns to Crane at a critical juncture, when his analysis of isolated icons and symbols was giving way to a broader investigation into language's rhetorical capacities. The poet helps him rethink artistic agency at a time when rivals such as Warhol and Rauschenberg were beginning to espouse mechanistic conceptions of artistic production. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Booking</h1>
<p>A straightforwardly biographical explanation for Johns's attraction to Crane is plausible. After his suicide in 1932, Crane became a mythic re in U.S. gay culture, particularly among urban homosexual literati. This pre-Stonewall oral culture may be impossible to reconstruct accurately, but in the 1950s and 60s, a young gay artist like Johns could have learned about and come to identify with Crane without ever having read a single line of his verse.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Similarly, for educated gay viewers, a painting titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope (Hart Crane)</span> would have had "queer significance" despite its lack of obvious homoerotic content.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>While true, <span style="font-style:italic;">sans</span> elaboration such a scenario underestimates the demands that Johns places on himself and his viewers. He was part of a mid-century group of res that, in reaction to modernist dictates about the purity and autonomy of each art form, began exploring intersections and exchanges between the arts. In the 1950s, venues such as Black Mountain College, the Club in New York, and San Francisco's North Beach encouraged a lively congress of poets, musicians, painters, dancers, and sculptors. Characteristic of the era were multimedia works such as Allan Kaprow's Happenings, Jack Kerouac's jazz-accompanied poetry, and Larry Rivers's and Frank O'Hara's collaborative lithograph piece <span style="font-style:italic;">Stones</span>. Johns himself, along with Rauschenberg, designed sets and costumes for Merce Cunningham's dances.</p>
<p>In such a setting, the vocabularies and concepts developed to apply to particular art forms no longer seem fixed or inevitable. "Many of us," Johns recalls, "felt that ideas in one medium could trigger ideas in another medium—and that media could be mixed new ways."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> He has particularly favored the borderlands between the visual arts and the arts of the written word for his own intermedia forays. Michael Crichton declares Johns a man with an "omnivorous taste for literature," and Deborah Solomon reports that "he reads everything from Wittgenstein to dime store novels."<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> His interviews further demonstrate his surprisingly broad literacy. In addition to numerous remarks about Samuel Beckett, Hart Crane, and Frank O'Hara, he also mentions John Ashbery, Ted Berrigan, Paul Celan, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Herman Melville, James Merrill, E.A. Robinson, Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens, and Anne Waldman.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> The frequent appearance of poets in this list is no accident. As Johns has stated, "I've always been attracted to poetry," and "I don't go very long without reading poetry."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Johns's fascination with literature is less an avocation than an integral part of his own artistic production. Not only has he collaborated with writers in such pieces as <span style="font-style:italic;">Skin with O'Hara Poem</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Foirades / Fizzles</span> (produced jointly with Beckett), he has also responded to authors in a variety of creative ways in work entirely his own. In his published sketchbooks, for instance, he muses on statements by Baudelaire, Blake, and Flaubert while contemplating potential projects.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Johns's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Seasons</span> represent one such literary-visual crossover taken to completion. The idea for the series came to Johns when he was asked to contribute to a special volume of Wallace Stevens's poems.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> There are many other comparable examples throughout Johns's body of work. <span style="font-style:italic;">Ventriloquism</span> contains an obscured image of Melville's Moby Dick taken from an  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> engraving.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Screen Painting 3</span> incorporates the title page of Ted Berrigan's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sonnets</span>. <span style="font-style:italic;">Céline</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Tennyson</span> announce themselves as homages in their very titles.</p>
<p>Given the extent of Johns's literacy and given his repeated explorations of literary material, one cannot simply assert a vague affinity between the artist and a poet. He considers the interface between writing and painting to be a worthy object of sustained inquiry. As he puts it, "I don't think we need to worry about forging links between painting and poetry … here we are, it's done!"<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> To be true to Johns's art, critics must take account of his hybrid, self-aware, visual and textual aesthetic. Coming to grips with Crane series of 1962–63 requires knowledge of where and how it fits into the evolution of that aesthetic.</p>
<p>During the years immediately previous, 1955–61, Johns had concentrated on depicting (or incorporating into his paintings) familiar, man-made objects such as targets, flags, coat hangers, and light bulbs. He wants viewers to speculate about what uses these objects might serve in these strange new contexts. These displacements violate the autonomy prized by many mid-century art critics. A work such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Flag</span>, for example, insists upon being read as a political statement in addition to an aesthetic one (even if, as some have argued, that statement is the adoption of a studiously apolitical pose). The arch-modernist, Clement Greenberg, accused Johns of a category error, the introduction of "literary" qualities into painting, a purely optical art.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Hal Foster offers a more contemporary way of stating this same point: Johns's early work functions "textually." Instead of striving to create a striking image, he investigates how signs, symbols, and icons operate and circulate in society.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Johns's inquiry into how isolated objects signify gradually led him to ponder higher orders of signification as well. In the same years that he was turning out famous pieces such as <span style="font-style:italic;">White Flag</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Green Target</span> , he also started to think about the complex semiotic problems posed by written language. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Tango</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span>  he began a lifelong habit of stenciling words onto canvases. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Gray Alphabets</span>  he filled the surface of a painting with letters. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Alley Oop</span>  he collaged a comic strip onto cardboard. Perhaps emblematic of this early phase in Johns's career is <span style="font-style:italic;">Book</span> , an open hard back that has been attached, spine down, to a piece of wood. The exposed pages are coated by red encaustic. Through the wax one can make out lines of letters but few individual words. Central to this piece is the pun red / read. Can one "read" a painting? Or does one just observe its colors? What relation exists between an application of "red" paint and the "reading" that we impose on such a choice?</p>
<p>Crucially, it is the rhyme of read / red that links the artist's act of creation and a viewer's act of interpretation. Artist and audience are brought together by an artful use of language. As Johns says, "you can come to see something through language that you couldn't have come to see through looking."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Moreover, <span style="font-style:italic;">Book</span> explicitly targets speakers of English. In Russian, for instance, "red"—<span style="font-style:italic;">krasnoe</span>—and "read"—<span style="font-style:italic;">chital</span>—have nothing in common. <span style="font-style:italic;">Book</span> moves into the untranslatable realm of verse. It is easy to forget that Johns was just twenty-five years old when he painted his first <span style="font-style:italic;">Flag</span>. Afterwards, he progressed from relatively simple (for him!) symbolic games toward the convoluted linguistic play found in modern poetry. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In 1961, Jasper Johns painted his first work to engage a specific poem intertextually, <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings—Frank O'Hara</span> [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>]. Several excellent readings of this painting are available; in the present context, a few observations will suffice.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span> is a two-panel work with two hinges in its center. Although invisible in reproduction, in person a viewer can make out the words "DEAD MAN." Heavily overpainted, they appear twice in the lower-right-hand corner, the second smaller occurrence superimposed over the first, as if the phrase were in motion toward or away. These words are puzzling. Why would Johns associate death with his friend O'Hara five years before he died in a freak accident?</p>
<p>As with <span style="font-style:italic;">Book</span>, one must look "outside" the artwork for answers to the questions that it poses. Here, rather than rely on a simple pun suggested by his materials, Johns's title directs us to a much more complex, prior use of language, O'Hara's poem "In Memory of My Feelings." On one level, the phrase "DEAD MAN" is simply an indicator of the poem's contents. Just as Johns dutifully paints the canvas blue to reflect lines such as "I'm too blue" and "her eyes … blue like mine," so too he could find there a welter of references to mortality: "murder," "kill," "death," "died," and "dead." Twice O'Hara even speaks of himself as dead or dying.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>The lyric, though, is intricate and long. Johns's decision to focus a viewer's attention on mortality stems from an intimate appreciation of both the poem and the poet. Enthusiastically at home in frenetic mid-century Manhattan, O'Hara felt an intense aversion to stasis. One stops changing, he believed, only when one stops breathing. "In Memory of My Feelings" is O'Hara's most extended meditation on this principle. A poet, he explains, faces the nearly impossible task of tracking the Heraclitean flux of a self in time. If he or she is to be true that the flux, no image, no phrase, no idea can reach full articulation. Each becomes "dead," so to speak, in the very instant of formulating it and hence must be discarded. The particular "self," too, to which it was to refer, has already ceased to exist. He concedes that there remains a living if indefinite "self" that continues to occupy the very instant of creation—a self that, serpent-like, sheds its former, "dead" selves, which, in their continuing deposition, testifies to the ongoing "aliveness" of its creator. It is impossible, alas, to capture or depict meaningfully this essential self in a completed poem. Once a poet finishes a lyric, it by necessity enshrines no more than a series of dead selves with no necessary connection to the moving, mercurial "I" that is the poet's essence.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Johns's "DEAD MAN," then, suggests a perceptive reading of O'Hara's poetics. But—insofar as O'Hara is teaching a lesson about identity and creativity in general—perhaps one should read "DEAD MAN" as referring to Johns, too? That is, he could very well be borrowing O'Hara's reformulation of the lyric "I" to test one possible relation between himself and his art. By painting "DEAD MAN," then painting over it, painting it again, and then painting over it yet again, he dramatizes his own progressive cycles of "death" and "resurrection" in the act of creation. One "self" dies, to be replaced by another, only to die in turn. His art thus reflects his thoughts or attitudes at a particular moment, but with the passing of that moment, there is no meaningful way to recapture fully what those thoughts were. Those feelings, and that self, are now "dead," and therefore no longer part of "me." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p>O'Hara's "I" seems to have offered Johns a conceptual alternative to the prevailing understanding of the relation between painter and painting circa 1961. He gained leverage against what he saw as Abstract Expressionism's belief in a link between a dynamic application of paint and authentic self-expression. In 1973 he stated,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Abstract Expressionism was so lively—personal identity and painting were more or less the same, and I tried to operate the same way. But I found I couldn't do anything that would be identical with my feelings. So I worked in such a way that I could say that it's not me.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">However "lively" the drama of self-exposure may be, "personal identity" cannot find its wholly legible cognate in a "painting."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> A stable, constant "personal identity" is a fiction stemming from a misunderstanding of temporality. Traces of many irretrievable "identities" (and "feelings") accrue on a canvas while "painting" it. In his poem, O'Hara speaks of the "scene of my selves."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> For Johns, the painting itself is that scene—with the caveat that the selves it records are "dead." He can, therefore, say regarding his work that "it's not [the present-tense] me" without denying his role in making the painting ("it's not me" does not contradict the fact that "it was me," or, more precisely, "many of me"). He remains an active agent without declaring himself a Jackson Pollock-like action painter.</p>
<p>One must not confuse his desire to be able to say that a work "is not me" with a desire to exclude emotional content. Johns has always been willing to attribute affective  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> force to individual artworks, whether a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci or a ballet by 27 Merce Cunningham.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span> is a patently melancholy work. The predominant colors—blue and gray—convey sadness, and the mostly-bare patch in the upper-left hand corner suggests incompletion, or loss. He does not exclude feelings <span style="font-style:italic;">per se</span> from the province of art; he asserts that the affect conveyed by a given work might or might not bear a relation to emotions that he himself is experiencing at the present moment or that he felt at a time in the past. In short, he holds that no artwork allows us transparent access to its creator's inner life. Such a tenet, though, does not preclude the existence of an inner life. Drawing on O'Hara, Johns could grant "my feelings" a place in his art without subscribing to naïve ideas about self-expression.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Rite of Passage</h1>
<p>In 1962, the year after <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span>, Johns painted his first Crane work, <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>. The similarities between the two paintings are striking. <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, like the 1961 piece, takes a single poem, Crane's "Passage," as its intertext. Again like its precursor, <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> applies techniques and references found in its intertext after translating them into visual equivalents. It, too, probes the relation of creator, thing created, and "the scene of my selves." Johns, in fact, explicitly cues a viewer to think of the two canvases as related. One of the most prominent elements in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> has been borrowed from the O'Hara homage. In the latter painting, a fork and a spoon dangle from a wire in the left-hand panel. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, about a third of the way from the top, Johns suspends a fork horizontally. Below it he has painted a <span style="font-style:italic;">trompe l'oeil</span> shadow of the fork as well as of the chain and the wire that hold it in place.</p>
<p>The remainder of the painting revisits other motifs used in previous works. Like <span style="font-style:italic;">Out the Window</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Sea</span> , it consists of three horizontal regions, labeled, from top to bottom, "RED," "YELLOW," and "BLUE." As Johns's earlier titles indicate, he associates this format with landscape painting. Specifically, he seems to have in mind Mark Rothko's famous 1950s three-rectangle compositions, so evocative of dreamscapes or psychological interiors. He indicates depth, however, not through Rothko-like coloration—he has spread encaustic over the canvas without matching pigments to the stenciled color words—but through another device, one familiar from <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span>. A second, smaller word "BLUE" has been stenciled over the first, suggesting motion into or out of an illusionistic distance. The top panel in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> recycles another Johns favorite of the early 1960s: a ruler, pinned to the canvas's left side, which appears to have been used to smear the paint beneath it in an arc. On the smear he has written the word "SCRAPE," and, nearby, a curved directional arrow points toward the ruler's current position. The ruler seems to have been interrupted in its course by another object, the horizontally-suspended fork. Consequently, this ruler, labeled "RULER," completes only a quarter-circle. Just outside this partial circle one can observe the imprint of an iron in the wax, over the top of which Johns has written "IRON." A second partial circle, identical in shape to the first, appears in ghostly outline in the bottom left-hand corner. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>As should be evident, <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> is a much more heterogeneous painting than <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span>. Johns assembles a number of elements that bear the connotative burden of their earlier uses in his <span style="font-style:italic;">oeuvre</span>. For instance, "Passage" opens at a seashore: "Where the cedar leaf divides the sky / I heard the sea."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> Accordingly, Johns draws on <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Sea</span> to provide his own "seaside" motif, the bands labeled red, yellow, and blue. This principle of metonymic substitution extends to technique as well as imagery. For example, "Passage" mentions an iron – "Why are you back here, smiling an iron coffin?"<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup>—so Johns, already having tried leaving impressions in wax in such 1961 works as <span style="font-style:italic;">Painting Bitten by a Man, No</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Liar</span>, melts an iron's shape onto his canvas.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, however, does not aim to illustrate "Passage" through a rigorous, one-to-one correspondence between its elements and the events and things that Crane describes. Rather, "Passage" becomes an occasion for Johns to try out his nascent visual "vocabulary" within a "plot" only loosely suggested by the poem's contents. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> and "Passage" alike, the governing narrative convention is the quest romance. Crane's "Passage" portrays a speaker moving phantasmagorically through a shifting landscape (hills, a ravine, alleys, perhaps an orchard or field) buffeted by the forces of nature (a burning sun, rain, wind, the "spear" of an evening). The speaker confronts his opposite and antagonist, a "thief," and they engage in a ritualized exchange of words. The thief closes a book stolen from the speaker, and the sands of Egypt "trough" them.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> One is left uncertain whether they have been magically transported, suddenly slain, or metaphorically submerged in the sands of time.</p>
<p>In short, the journey in "Passage" is an arcane, archetypal one upon which a critic can build any number of equally valid interpretations.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Crane revisits the allegorical romance form of Edmund Spenser's <span style="font-style:italic;">Faërie Queene</span> but denies a reader the certitude of a stable allegorical frame. He undoubtedly learned this disorienting strategy from one of his favorite poets, Arthur Rimbaud, whose <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Illuminations</span> stand behind not only "Passage" but also "Repose of Rivers," "Possessions," and "Voyages." These lyrics describe vivid elusive landscapes that recall those anatomized by Marjorie Perloff in her work on the French symbolist:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Rimbaud's cityscape is … a phantasmagoria. Like a stage-set, it makes use of stylized backdrops: now a scene of craters and copper palm trees, now platforms in the midst of whirlpools, now a Baghdad boulevard. It is the landscape of fairytale, of calculated artifice.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Crane, like Rimbaud, recounts journeys that ought to carry deep meaning but refuse to do so straightforwardly. They ensure that the poet-visionary, as a latter-day questerknight, shares marvels too lofty, strange, and evanescent to yield up their significance to mundane logic.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, Johns labors to create a similarly charged, evasive narrative. He creates a "passage" of energies that takes place in a downward motion across the field of his painting. The sharp nose of the iron nudges the ruler's quarter circle; the ruler collides with the fork; the fork casts a shadow; and a second "shadow," of the quarter circle,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> appears at the canvas's bottom edge. The written words "SCRAPE," "RULER" and "IRON" hint at players and motivations that may lie behind this domino-like vector of force. One with "iron" will, or a master of "irony," puts the "ruler" of the land into a "scrape," thereby toppling him. The ruler's fall casts long "shadows" into the surrounding territory or down the years.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> Johns tests new artistic territory, the placing of multiple, indeterminate, but already familiar signs in a pattern suggestive of an occulted storyline. Moreover, he uses a poem as model for how one might assemble such an artwork. He relies upon the symbolist inflection of the venerable romance quest to solve a particular artistic problem identified by conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth: how to arrive at "language forms" in which to organize one's "'private' codes" given modern art's "freedom from morphological constrictions."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Crane's revision of the romance narrative provides Johns a "morphology" for his painting, that is, rules for how to combine the elements in his growing artistic "vocabulary" in order to convey the desired effect.</p>
<p>Understood in this way, <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> is not simply a "complexly displaced homosexual autobiography."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> A biographical reading of the painting arrives at one possible storyline generated by an allegorical framework that could just as readily generate two, three, or a hundred others.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> Johns even anticipates that his audience might assume that his work's inspiration is biographical, and he indicates that such a premise places undue weight on an artwork's antecedent conditions. One of the "passages" at issue in the painting is between artist, artwork, and viewer. In clarifying this relationship, Johns builds on the idea of the "death of the artist" already advanced in <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span>. The impression of an iron is serves to comment both on his source text and on his self-conception as an artist. Crane writes,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Touching an opening laurel, I found<br>A thief beneath, my stolen book in hand.</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>"Why are you back here—smiling an iron coffin?"<br>"To argue with the laurel," I replied:<br>"Am justified in transience, fleeing<br>Under the constant wonder of your eyes—."<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">A "laurel," a symbol of public acclaim for a writer, attracts the speaker's notice after the first phase of his archetypal journey. This "opening laurel" does not portend a triumph, however. The speaker discovers a "thief" has "stolen" his "book." This confrontation could be an allegory for the experience of publication. Once in the public sphere, once in competition for the "laurel" of success, a poet's work passes beyond his control. It enters the grasp ("in hand") of his readers, who have usurped his place (perhaps suggesting the fall of the "RULER" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>). Crane offers one means of redressing this imbalance. The poet can attempt "argue with the laurel," or make known his own interpretation of his art and vocation. Crane's speaker, like O'Hara, insists that he is "justified in transience." In other words, he has the right to evade his readers' demands, to flee before their eyes and become someone new, write something  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> new—thereby achieving the freedom of the "improved infancy" that the poem's opening lines promise.</p>
<p>In this context, the "iron coffin" that the speaker smiles seems intended as a threat. He has caught the reader / thief in the act of stealing his words, and he now will forcibly put things right. After <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span>, however, Johns would have been predisposed to read more into the thief's line about the iron coffin. It becomes an effective bit of dramatic iron-y, so to speak. The speaker, as an alter ego of the poet, smiles an "iron coffin," because he is, after a fashion, dead. He is one of O'Hara's "ruses," a husk of what Crane once was for a brief time, Crane-the-Prophet-Poet as incarnated during the writing of "Passage."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> From this point of view, being "justified in transience" is not to achieve an "improved infancy." Or, rather, it might mean that for the artist, as he or she moves on from work to work. Any completed work, however, and therefore any authorial alter ego therein, is a "dead," sloughed off shell. In effect, the poem is a "coffin" that entombs a possible, momentary, or partial poetic "self."</p>
<p>Johns's decision to sear the encaustic of his canvas with an iron provides a macabre variant on an Abstract Expressionist technique commonly used to assert the living presence, not the "death," of the artist. The indexical traces of an artist's hand—brushstrokes, skin imprints, spills—in paintings such as Pollock's <span style="font-style:italic;">Autumn Rhythm</span> and de Kooning's <span style="font-style:italic;">Gotham News</span> imply a harmonious unity between creator and thing created. A hot iron, however, is something that children from day one are told not to touch. The impression of an iron expresses Johns's violent repudiation of his artwork, which in turn becomes an "iron coffin" that "seals" away what is no longer alive to the artist and what is no longer wanted. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> the iron's imprint fittingly stands at the beginning of the chain reaction that leads down the canvas. An initial gesture of disavowal, or repression, takes place prior to, and in essence licenses, the narrative that follows. The "death" of the artist is thus a prerequisite for the creation of the kind of "language forms" that Johns's canvases propose. Biography might give one access to the prior circumstances that give rise to a particular artwork, but it also remains external to the resulting sign system.</p>
<p>By the time that he completed his first Crane painting, Johns had arrived at a sophisticated understanding of lyric poetry and its possible uses as an analog for a visual artwork. He came to treat a poem as an ordered set of signs on which one can draw in solving semiotic problems in other media. Moreover, he develops a thesis about the "death of the artist" that preres the death of the author <span style="font-style:italic;">topos</span> common in later French poststructuralist theory. After <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, he would long continue mining the theme of <span style="font-style:italic;">memento mori</span> in relation to the artistic process, all the way from the skull impression in <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrive / Depart</span> (1963–64) to the skulls and spinal cords of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tantric Detail</span> series (1980–81).</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Dive In</h1>
<p>Johns's second Crane painting, <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> , measures seven and a half by fourteen feet two inches [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>]. Its mural-like size, unrivaled in Johns's previous work,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> seems calculated to call to mind such powerful 1950s works as de Kooning's <span style="font-style:italic;">Excavation</span>, Kline's <span style="font-style:italic;">Painting Number Two</span>, and Pollock's <span style="font-style:italic;">Lucifer</span>. Moreover, in contrast to the predominantly gray or dark blue paintings of 1961–62, <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> is a showcase for color: reds, oranges, yellows, greens, blues, and purples, in addition to whites, grays, and blacks. The oil paint has been applied in the manner almost invariably described as "de Kooningesque" by Johns's critics. That is, the large, irregular patches of color feature broad slashing brushstrokes, overpainting, drips, and variations in hue and thickness—traits stereotypically identified with the New York School of the 1940s and 50s. Significantly, in contrast to earlier paintings such as <span style="font-style:italic;">False Start</span> , these echoes of his predecessors are not satirical. <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s scale does not come across as a mocking comment on his forbears, nor do the "de Kooningesque" portions of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> read as through-and-through inauthentic. <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s relatively sympathetic treatment of this legacy deserves attention. In <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span> Johns turned to a poet for leverage against Abstract Expressionism's doctrine of self-exposure. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> he learns from Crane to reject a straightforward, indexical link between his painting's surface and his own hand. <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> seems to ask whether Crane and the Abstract Expressionist legacy might have more in common than Johns had first supposed.</p>

<p>To unpack what this affiliation might imply, one must first look carefully at the painting itself. The scale of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> is only one aspect of a very unusual work. Its five-panel, serial form, with wide variations in style from part to part, has no obvious precedent in Johns's pre-1962 <span style="font-style:italic;">oeuvre</span>, nor in U.S. art more generally. The proximate source for <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s formal strategy seems to be the poetry of Crane, whom Johns has repeatedly cited as the painting's inspiration.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s use of sequential panels suggestively recalls Crane's attempt in his volume <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>  to move beyond the composition of compartmentalized lyrics (such as "Passage") toward an "epic" mode based on the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> tradition of the poem cycle. In a letter to his patron Otto Kahn, Crane describes <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> in terms that Johns would have appreciated:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[E]ach section of the entire poem has represented its own unique problem of form, not alone in relation to the materials embodied within its separate confines, but also in relation to the other parts, <span style="font-style:italic;">in series</span>, of the major design of the entire poem. Each is a separate canvas, as it were, yet none yields its entire significance when seen apart from the others.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Separate yet conjoined canvases; a conjunctive disjunction; a form allowing for maximal attention to each portion of a larger work as it is made, without denying the significance of the eventual aggregate. One could argue that Johns, having mastered the art of creating discrete, self-sufficient works—such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Flag, Target with Four Faces</span>, and, more recently, <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>—discovered in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> a model of how to combine a talent for small-scale creations with the production of grander, "epic" art. Insofar as Abstract Expressionist canvases such as Newman's <span style="font-style:italic;">Cathedra</span> and Pollock's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mural</span> had set the contemporary standard for "epic" achievement in the visual arts, Crane's plan might have seemed an ideal means for Johns to match the ambition of his predecessors without producing an overly derivative work.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> Johns accordingly rejects Pollock's alloverness and the "large shapes" of Rothko, Gottlieb, and Newman as means to achieving a lofty style.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> He does not wish to inflate so much as to accumulate. <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>, like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>, relies on accretion and juxtaposition as its principles of construction. The first panel features a semi-circle of bright colors that have been smeared onto the canvas by a paint stick pinned to its edge. The second panel consists of a vertical tonal scale that ranges from black through violet gray to white and back into gray. The third and fourth present four handprints and two footprints symmetrically arrayed above a tape measure. The fifth panel displays several stenciled words—RED, BLUE, YELL[OW]—as well as a fork, knife, and spoon suspended in vertical position by a taut, horizontal wire. Here Johns brings together assemblage, expressionist brushstrokes, and geometric abstraction. He recycles old motifs such as color names, measuring instruments, skin impressions, and the cutlery from <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory of My Feelings</span> in a jumble that, like the miscellany of objects in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, seems as enigmatic as revelatory. Yet one cannot even say that the painting is consistent in its principle of discontinuity. The final three panels are covered by a single field of colors that vary from red to blue to yellow as one moves diagonally from the lower left to the upper right. Just as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> pieces together lyrics of varying degrees of interrelation more through a mixture of fiat and recurrent motifs than internal necessity, so too Johns asserts cohesion through an uneasy blend of brute seriality and a selective blurring of boundaries.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>The connection between <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> goes well beyond such structural homologies, however. Key to their dialogue is the eponymous re of the Diver. In the painting's third and fourth panels, two footprints appear at the top of the work. Below them, two sets of handprints are linked vertically by strips of scraped paper. Barely visible beneath layers of brightly colored paint are graphite directional markers that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> indicate, first, that the upper set of hands should be imagined as moving downwards and, second, that the lower hands move apart, outwards, and upwards, tracing mirror-image arcs. If one envisions these movements sequentially, they suggest someone taking a swan dive. Falling head-first, a diver stretches out his arms to meet the water, and, having broken the surface, he pulls his arms out and back up so as to plunge as deeply as possible. A viewer who knows that <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> belongs to the 1962–63 Crane series would correctly associate the painting's central re with the poet himself, who did, after all, die after leaping off a cruise ship into the Caribbean. But anyone who also knows <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> well would quickly appreciate that there is more to the story. In "To Brooklyn Bridge," on the very first page of Crane's book, the action is interrupted by a sudden suicidal gesture: "A bedlamite speeds to [the bridge's] parapets, / Tilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning" in full view of "the speechless caravan" below. Strangely, Crane does not tell what happens next. He writes instead that a "jest falls" from the crowd, that is, someone tells a joke, and, immediately afterwards, "Down Wall, from girder into street, leaks noon."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> These repeated, metaphoric movements downwards tease a reader with a desire to know whether the bedlamite himself has likewise traveled in that direction. Only at the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>, after many pages' suspense, after covering thousands of miles and hundreds of years of U.S. history and at last returning to Brooklyn Bridge, does someone at last hit the water. This time it is the poem's speaker who is immersed and, fearing drowning, prays to God, "O Thou whose radiance doth inherit me," to "hold thy floating singer late!"<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> In between leap and splash the effect is rather like watching Bill Viola's video piece <span style="font-style:italic;">The Reflecting Pool</span> (1977–79), in which a man is caught mid-cannonball and left hanging above a body of water that continues roiling and reflecting the changing seasons. One could say that Crane's poem cycle as a whole occurs in the marvelously prolonged instant between beginning and completing an ecstatic leap.</p>
<p>As we have seen, in early Rimbaud-inspired lyrics such as "Passage," Crane constructs "fairytale" landscapes of pure artifice. Later, however, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>, he begins to think about how such gloriously escapist episodes relate to the rest of everyday life. People, after all, do not imaginatively inhabit poetic landscapes in perpetuity. They enter and leave them <span style="font-style:italic;">ad libitum</span>. Or, to use the terms suggested by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>, they leap—and then experience giddy motion until they land. As a metaphor for readers' interactions with a text, this is, it must be admitted, a peculiar one. By deliberating prolonging a fall for hundreds of pages, is Crane foolishly delaying the inevitable? Is he being heroic? By calling the jumper a "bedlamite," is he making a value judgment about the irrationality of a reader's willingness to "dive" into a book-length poem? Is he commenting on the insanity of his own project, his attempt to dilate a momentary joy (wheee!) until it attains epic sublimity? Regardless, by framing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> with a life-imperiling leap, Crane creates a parentheses that calls attention to a distinction between time "before" the text, time's passage "inside" the text, and the "after" external to it. Does the jump into a poem give a reader access to a different, special temporality—the order of eternity, in which Atlantis never sinks and floating singers never drown—or does a poem's contents unfold within the order of human causality, in which bedlamites have past histories and swimmers in the open sea can sink for well and good? <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In other words, Crane's increasing awareness of art's temporality leads him to call into question the division between the spaces of art and life. Intentionally or not, he also thereby provokes his readers to wonder about the interpenetration of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> and his own biography. The romantic myth of the poet who dies young was literalized in his case, but his poetry, in its attempts to grapple with the boundaries between the literary and extra-literary, lends the time and manner of his demise a thematic importance unequaled in other similar cases. The tragic early deaths of, say, Pushkin and Marlowe do not dominate discussions of their individual works to the same degree as Crane's supposed death wish governs debate of his. Mortality, and the poet's own death, become inescapably central to Crane's mature revision of romantic poetics. He "does not so much distinguish as superimpose the positions of the visionary and the suicide—as if these two positions, for all appearances, were simply identical."<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>Johns elucidates how the Diver, caught in his descent, becomes the precondition of Crane's epic. He perceives that this one image, present on the periphery of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>—in its proem and in its conclusion, as well as in the life of its author—is, in fact, its keystone. In turn, by making the Diver spatially and conceptually central to his painting, Johns asks that his viewers read his painting over and against his modernist precursor's masterpiece. Like Crane, he suspends us between the factual reach of artists and an eternal Eden that exceeds their grasp. The intimations of transcendence present in the rainbow-like arc or the ladder-like tone scale provide a spiritual or psychological "depth" to <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> that exist in tension with reminders of the canvas's flatness (the handprints) and obdurate materiality (the measuring tape). Perhaps tension is the wrong word. The coexistence of contraries does not produce conflict or a dialectic. The strange "superimpositions" and suspensions in Crane's verse prere Johns's ability to permit a wide assortment of tendencies, techniques, and ideas to find place within an artwork.</p>
<p>In the end, one can say that Johns shares Crane's romantic faith in the role of art to a surprising degree. They agree that the artist's quest for the ineffable may be quixotic or suicidal but it still yields value, in the concrete artifact if nothing else: arcs, bridges, and circles inscribed and defended as form wrested from chaos. But such forms are not prized in their purity. Just as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>—digressive, uneven, episodic—fails to achieve the kind of perfect spherical form prized by modernists such as W.B. Yeats, so too <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> and its antecedents such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Device Circle</span> pointedly reject the abstract, geometric self-sufficiency of Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich. The art of Crane and Johns remains open to, and reproduces structurally, entropy, confusion, dispersion and all the forces that render utopian the dream of perfect order in the here and now.</p>
<p>By exposing his artwork to the external world—to randomness, to written texts, to a writer's life—Johns militates against the pure autonomy of art that the high modernists esteemed so highly. Painters such as Pollock, de Kooning, and Rothko may have believed in spontaneity and the utility of accident, but, as Alwynne Mackie's <span style="font-style:italic;">Art / Talk</span> makes clear, such moments were subordinated to the aim of creating an artwork that functions as a single unit, that is, a unique, holistic symbol that produces meaning independent of any extrinsic agent, sign-system, or body of knowledge.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> does not rest content with this decontextualized symbolism. Symbols it has in abundance—the Diver, the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ladder, the rainbow—but they are subordinated to a larger, curiously linguistic frame. The painting's five panels, advancing left to right, resemble the placement of words on a page. Johns also indicates that ending on a fifth panel is arbitrary. The edge of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> lops off the last two letters of what one assumes should be the word "YELLOW," given the nearby "BLUE" and "RED." All that is left is "YELL"—the word protests its own truncation! A viewer imagines an absent, sixth panel, which would complete the word, and if there could be a sixth, why not a seventh … <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> trails off like a sentence ending in ellipses.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s serial, paratactic form recalls Theodor Adorno's discussion in <span style="font-style:italic;">Aesthetic Theory</span> about visual art that approaches the condition of "language":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Works of art approximate a language of things by virtue of the inner organization of their disparate moments, i.e. through their own language <span style="font-style:italic;">qua</span> art works. The more they undergo syntactical articulation, the more language-like they do become … Traditional aesthetics completely ignores this, prejudging the relation of whole and parts in favour of the whole.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">By adopting the additive principle that he discovers in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span>, Johns defies "traditional aesthetics" and the fuzzy organic symbolism to which it often gave rise in 1940s and 50s New York. He arrives at what Adorno calls "wordless syntax," a means of expressing "linguisticality" within the visual arts.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> Symbols and icons become only a subset of many devices available for a painter to combine within the "language" that governs the "syntactical articulation" of an artwork. Hence <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s seeming unconcern about mixing heady symbolism with reminders of the canvas's materiality: the disparate elements can follow one another like words in a sentence. Johns creates a monumental painting whose themes include transcendental longing, fear of death, and joy in the act of creation—New York School favorites all—without having to perpetuate Abstract Expressionist dictates about how such subject matter should be rendered in paint. Crane teaches Johns how to take up where his predecessors left off.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Land Ho</h1>
<p>Johns appears to have been satisfied with the serial form of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>. He would use it frequently in coming years in such landmark works as <span style="font-style:italic;">Harlem Light, Wall Piece</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Untitled</span> . He does not appear to have been as content with the questions about transcendence that <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> raises. He seems to have been unsure whether it was an adequate response to Abstract Expressionist mystic symbolism to demote it to the status of one painterly device among many. Does such a strategy unpack or only suppress art's traditional role of constructing symbols referring to gods, ghosts, the unconscious, and a host of other intangibles?</p>
<p>As if to play fair, in 1963 Johns produced two further works inspired by Crane, the paintings <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope (Hart Crane)</span>, which set aside <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s sentence-like form in favor of a more conventional, one-panel design. In these canvases, Johns grapples with art's transcendental capacities by reviving an issue that Clement Greenberg  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> had tried to relegate to the dustbin of history: the use of illusionistic devices intended to deceive the eye. Johns wonders whether such devices permit a viewer to pass "through" the flat surface of the picture plane and enter into an immaterial space, possibly language, the past, or another world. As he comments in his notebooks, "What seems literal can twist or be twisted into something else—as rigidly literal works tend to become transcendental."<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span>, the first-executed of the 1963 works, announces Johns's desire to restate <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s concerns within the compositional field of his earlier Crane-inspired work, <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]. On one hand, <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> resembles an abridged, night-time version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>. The paint stick attached to the upper right edge of the canvas has, like its counterpart in <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>, smeared a rainbow-spectrum—although black paint overlays and darkens it. One of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>'s directional arrows also remains, pointing downwards on top of an applied piece of paper. A handprint, like that of the Diver, stretches upward at the end of another strip of paper. Johns has used red, yellow, blue, orange, green, and white oil paint in various places in the background, but the predominant colors are gray and black, more closely echoing the first panel of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> in coloration and brushwork than that earlier painting's vivid hues in the third through fifth panels. These citations from <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> are placed against a backdrop borrowed from <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>. The RED / YELLOW / BLUE horizontal bands recur, as do small details, such as the twofold appearance of the word "BLUE," the second instance occurring smaller and directly on top of the first.</p>
<p>Appropriately, then, <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> combines the elegiac impulses of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> with <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>'s intimations of action in a landscape. The 1963 painting depicts a scene that bears a strong resemblance to Crane's suicide, as described in Philip Horton's <span style="font-style:italic;">Hart Crane: The Life of an American Poet</span> , a book that Johns is known to have owned:<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Crane walked quickly to the stern of the ship, and … [he] vaulted over the rail into the boiling wake. The alarm was general and immediate. There was a clangor of bells as the ship's engines ground into reverse; life preservers were thrown overboard; a lifeboat was lowered. Some claim they saw an arm raised from above the water.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The implied allegorical narrative in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, which remains resolutely ambiguous, here gives way to a very traditional subject matter, an elegy for a drowning man. Crane waves to his would-be rescuers, or strains toward the setting sun, even as he sinks below the waves.</p>
<p>Unlike <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage, Land's End</span> does not refer by name to a specific poem or line in Crane's <span style="font-style:italic;">oeuvre</span>, but Johns could have chosen few titles more redolent of Crane's sensibility. The seashore is one of Crane's <span style="font-style:italic;">idées fixes</span>, showing up in such diverse lyrics as "O Carib Isle!," "Voyages" I, "Repose of Rivers," "The Air Plant," and "The Bathers." The seashore is a profoundly important liminal space for Crane. To one side stands the mundane world of agriculture, office work, and domestic life. On the other side looms the ocean, Crane's symbol for the sublime, infinite flux of the inhuman. Like a bedlamite hanging from a bridge, a man on a beach occupies a dangerous in-between position but attains proximity to the eternal. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>The beach is also the place where the living can encounter the no longer living, those who have lapsed back into chaos. "Cape Hatteras" and "At Melville's Tomb," both taking place on the seashore, are Crane's greatest elegies. To justify this choice of location in "At Melville's Tomb," Crane goes so far as to imply that Melville drowned at sea—something patently false, since Melville is buried next to his wife Elizabeth Shaw in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. One could, therefore, argue that, in sympathy with Crane's worldview, Johns positions his viewers at "land's end" so that we, too, may occupy Crane's threshold space and, presumably, so that we may enter into what "Cape Hatteras" calls a "junction elegiac."<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>Johns painted <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope (Hart Crane)</span>, another elegy, soon after <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span>. <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> is identical in size to <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> and similar in composition. It, too, uses the tripartite canvas division of <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span>, although Johns restricts his pallet almost exclusively  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to grays, blue grays, and black. The rainbow-like "device circle" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> is, therefore, replaced by a fan-shaped gray scale, with its outer edge white and inner core black.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> The second crucial distinction between the paintings involves the placement of the ghostly arm. Instead of having it thrust upward in the center of the canvas, Johns has superimposed it over the device-circle's paint stick. Perhaps a viewer is to picture a swimmer's arm captured mid-stroke. Unlike <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span>, where the absence of a body makes illusionistic sense—it would naturally be below the sea's surface—here a body's absence seems slightly disorienting, as if Johns has taken to an extreme the kind of cropping to which Degas subjects his ballet dancers.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope (Hart Crane)</span> takes its title from an early portion of Crane's poem "Cape Hatteras." Crane begins the poem by situating the Cape within immensities of geologic time and interplanetary space. He then begins to consider humanity's ability to perceive such sublimity:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>[T]ime clears<br>Our lenses, lifts a focus, resurrects<br>A periscope to glimpse what joys or pain<br>Our eyes can share or answer—then deflects<br>Us, shunting to a labyrinth submersed<br>Where each sees only his dim past reversed …</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>But that star-glistered salver of infinity,<br>The circle, blind crucible of endless space,<br>Is sluiced by motion,—subjugated never.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Crane contrasts the intermittence of revelation and the constancy of "infinity." The first part of the passage is a witty play on 1 Corinthians 13:12, "For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face." Crane imagines the "dark glass" of perception in the fallen world (the "labyrinth submersed") as a "lens" receiving an occasional polish and the proper setting for us to "glimpse" celestial truth before again sinking back into the murk. Caught in this cycle, humanity can only parody the "endless," perfect circular movement of the heavens. <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> reproduces, after a fashion, what "Cape Hatteras" describes.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> In an ocean-like setting, a hand is poised midway between travel up or down. The scraped semi-circle indicates that it has tracked the entire course before, perhaps many times.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope (Hart Crane)</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> retreat from the elusive allegorical mode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> and the paratactic seriality of <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>. Their formal novelty lies elsewhere, in their complex handling of pictorial space. <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> contains several indications of downward movement, such as the directional arrow and the stenciling of several letters ("Y," "E," "W," and "U") in inverted or tilted fashion as "echoes" below their "original" position. These are counterbalanced by the upward-thrusting arm and hand. In addition, the word "RED" has a mirror-image to its right, suggesting oblique motion. In contrast to these vectors of force in the painting, which remain on the surface, "BLUE" and "RED" have second, smaller color words superimposed atop them, suggesting either recession or procession. <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> displays a similarly busy surface. The letters "B,"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "L," "U," and "E" are jumbled in heap below and to the left of "BLUE." A "Y" and "E" 39 appear oblique left of "YELLOW." "R," "E," and "D" have each been reflected across a vertical or horizontal axis and then strung along a diagonal toward the upper-right of "RED." <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span>, then, emphasizes centrifugal motion (left, down, upwards) and rotation in a third dimension. In both these paintings, Johns opposes active motion within the picture plane to a forward-and-back movement through it.</p>
<p>In "Jasper Johns" , Rosalind Krauss criticizes <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> in terms also applicable to <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span>. <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span>, she observes, offers a "mock-vista" that "wrenches open the painting to deep views into traditional pictorial space" instead of exhibiting a modernist "control of the surface."<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> She worries that Johns, by violating Greenbergian principles, has relinquished his leading role in the avant-garde. She singles out his use of handprints for particular criticism because they produce an "illusionistic, spatial reading":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>By playing on the built-in ambiguity of the hand outline which can be read either as seen from the inside or the outside, the print image works here as though it emanated from a misty, luminous space inside the canvas, calling to mind the vague, but decidedly spatial quality of an x-ray photograph of a limb.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The two readings of the "hand outline" that Krauss presents—first, the artist's hand remains "outside" the canvas and, second, the hand should be seen as "emanating" from its "inside"—are not mutually exclusive. As we know, the raised hand in <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> stands for Crane's. We are to imagine him reaching up out of the ocean in the moments before he sinks. But, as the record of a paint-coated hand pressed to the canvas, the hand also indexically stands for Johns's own. The one handprint thus ambivalently signifies two hands. <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span>, one would presume, operates similarly. The hand on the end of the paint stick is, in some sense, both Crane's and Johns's, its identity depending on what kind of sign, icon, or index one chooses to read inscribed there. Or, just possibly, one is to imagine two hands approaching the surface of each canvas from different directions and, perhaps, touching. The seam between two sign-systems could become a point of contact. Johns's picture plane would then take on the role of Crane's beach as the boundary marker between living and dead, the present and the past.</p>
<p>To justify this claim will require some backtracking. Hands happen to have been one of Crane's favorite images, ring prominently in more than twenty five of his poems. In lyrics such as "Episode of Hands," "Bridge of Estador," "Voyages," and "Harbor Dawn," hands are intensely eroticized. Examples include the famous line "Permit me voyage, love, into your hands" as well as the more frankly sexual "your hands within my hands are deeds; / my tongue upon your throat—singing."<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> For Crane, hands are also signs of agency. Frequently, they become a metonymy for a writer: for Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, Edgar Allan Poe, and Erasmus.<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> They are also a sign of natural or divine potency. Crane refers to the "hands" of the sea, the frost, the years, and autumn.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> And he refers to God in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge</span> as "Hand of Fire."<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> Finally, hands link living and dead. In "My Grandmother's Love Letters," Crane, playing Orpheus, aspires "to lead my grandmother by the hand / Through much of what she would not understand" back to the living world.<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The greatest "hand moment" in his verse occurs at the end of "Cape Hatteras," the poem which furnishes the titles for <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> and the lithograph <span style="font-style:italic;">Hatteras</span>. Crane portrays himself going off hand in hand with Walt Whitman. In this one image, Crane attempts to combine the erotic, writerly, and supernatural connotations present in his other hand-references:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Afoot again, and onward without halt, —<br>Not soon, nor suddenly,—no, never to let go<br>    My hand<br>     in yours,<br>        Walt Whitman —<br>          so —<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The dead and the living poets come together in equality and amity. "Cape Hatteras," which dwells throughout on the horrors committed in the U.S. Civil War and in World War I, finds some compensation for these tragedies in this blissful act of communion. Not all the departed are gone forever, Crane teaches. The poetic imagination can resurrect the dead, after a fashion. The "Easters of speeding light" which "Cape Hatteras" foretells are made possible through rative language.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup></p>
<p>Like Crane in "Cape Hatteras," Johns in <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> grants his dead hero an imaginary hand so that, through the medium of art, they can make contact. Unlike Crane, however, Johns cannot present this congress as joyous. He recognizes that Crane fudges an important distinction in "Cape Hatteras"—between the speaker and the author. Perhaps an alter ego of Crane can attain communion with Whitman, but Crane himself can only do so at a remove, through a misleading identification with this "dead," fictive projection of himself. <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> highlights this unbridgeable gap between actual and virtual artists. As <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> shows, Johns thinks of the artwork as a coffin containing a dead self or selves. While the end of "Cape Hatteras" might depict poetry as a refuge from "time's realm," Johns cannot imagine himself gaining access to such a space while still "alive." In <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> the two hands, the artist's and the poet's, can come together only via a parodic re-enactment of the close of "Cape Hatteras." The painting undertakes a three-fold elegy: for Crane, for a communion that can never be, and for a self that, entombed, might experience what the living artist cannot.</p>
<p>The pessimism of <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> might have motivated Johns to paint <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> almost immediately afterwards. The few differences between the canvases seem intended as correctives to the conclusions reached in the first one. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span>, the hand is not captured in the <span style="font-style:italic;">ave atque vale</span> pose of one drowning. The emphasis is no longer on stasis—the achieved artwork and its entombment of an impossible moment. Instead, the hand is portrayed as moving, seeking, and, in the process, creating an arc. As with <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span>, Johns and Crane alike consider that in itself an achievement, a means of holding the bounds against chaos. Moreover, if one imagines both Crane's and Johns's hands present simultaneously, they are likely to be pictured as moving in tandem. No longer two suicides, they are two artists engaged in coordinated action in their respective media. This innovation has the force of a conceptual breakthrough. The process of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> creating a work of art does not depend on identification between virtual or past artists and one living in the present tense. The "living" Johns does not need privileged access to the interior lives of those "former" artists. He can always learn from what "dead" selves accomplished, even if he can no longer be them, and he can learn from other dead artists, even if he cannot attain the ecstasy of union with them. These assorted incarnations of the artist can be conceived of as participating in a common mission unbounded by temporal or subjective limitations.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> seems a remarkably optimistic follow-up to <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span>. The burden shifts from the "iron"-clad suppression of self that <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> suggests toward a less identity-obsessed formulation of an artist's relation to an artwork. If <span style="font-style:italic;">Land's End</span> concludes that the transcendence that art offers is real but sadly inaccessible, <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> shifts the inquiry back to process, namely, how to make a painting that points beyond the picture plane to indicate absent people, things, or concepts. Hands take center stage as signs of agency and shared effort. The 1963 lithograph <span style="font-style:italic;">Hatteras</span>, a follow-up to <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span>, dramatizes this new attitude. It inflates <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span>'s "device circle" until it fills half the work. A handprint appears squarely in the middle.</p>
<p>After <span style="font-style:italic;">Periscope</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Hatteras</span>, the 1962–63 Crane series came to an end. His next major work, <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrive / Depart</span> (1963–64), was deliberately transitional. A handprint in the upper-right corner and a skull impression in the lower-right recall the Crane series. But it also contains elements, such as brightly colored, Hans Hofmann-like rectangles, that point toward a new phase in his career, toward such 1964 pieces as <span style="font-style:italic;">Watchman</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">According to What</span>. Johns seems to have found the answers that he was looking for during his most sustained foray into lyric poetry.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">All That Glitters</h1>
<p>In the fall of 1962, three of New York's most innovative artists, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Andy Warhol chose to redefine artistic agency in reaction to what they perceived as Abstract Expressionist excess. One path—that of Rauschenberg and Warhol—has dominated the way critics have written about the era. Johns's path represents a second option, one whose full importance has yet to be recognized. As Kirk Varnedoe writes, "histories of postwar American art" typically "freeze Johns's flame" around 1960, consigning him to "a lustrous but straitjacketed historical role as progenitor and man of transition for all that followed—the fuse-lighter of a different future." By omitting Johns's further development as an artist, "potted histories of postwar art" have falsely tidied up their narratives, making it seem as if there were only one possible direction in which the art world could evolve.<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup></p>
<p>After 1962 Rauschenberg and Warhol espouse an antihumanist position that has retrospectively come to be identified with Pop and other 1960s avant-garde movements. They deemphasized the shaping hand of the artist and instead draw attention to the self as a weak ego, inevitably shaped by social, economic, and other forces. The disturbing omnipresence of media images in U.S. life became their chief subject matter, not the imagination's autonomy. They lost interest in media that leave unpredictable,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> indexical traces of the body of the person making an artwork. Silk screen was an ideal "hands-off" medium conveying impersonality and routinization. Working chiefly with mechanically-reproduced photographs, Rauschenberg and Warhol helped to usher in the parodic and simulacral sensibility anatomized by Fredric Jameson in <span style="font-style:italic;">Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism</span>.<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup></p>
<p>And Johns? Like the other two painters, he rejects the "expressive fallacy," the belief that flinging paint on canvas expresses authentic, tumultuous emotion.<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> Unlike them, he did not pursue this critique by switching to a flat, mechanical medium or by rejecting painterly gestures. He made the "death" of the unitary ego subtending the expressive fallacy an occasion for thinking through new ways of understanding an artist's relation to his creations. The "hand" of the artist became a "pressing" issue requiring investigation in a "hands-on" fashion. Moreover, whereas Rauschenberg and Warhol took the image as primary, Johns had long suspected that language was paramount. Rauschenberg's and Warhol's canvases are like screens against which pictures are mutely projected. In contrast, Johns's paintings, from <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Diver</span> onwards, are sentence-like collocations of objects demanding to be "read" and meditated upon. Johns looked to poetry, not the movies or television, for his inspiration, and, by way of Crane, he was able mount a defense of traits supposedly spurned in the "cool" 1960s: affect, illusion, transcendence, monumentality, and handicraft.</p>
<p>In 1962, on the eve of Pop's explosive entrée into the New York art world, Johns dissented. He laid down a course for himself that employed certain but not all aspects of painterly high modernism. One could label this decision backwards-looking. Why, though, become embroiled in arguments over "late," "neo-," and "post-"? Why not speak of networks of affinity across time and place? Not revolutions, not movements, but a cooperative project that spans the twentieth century—as well as, it now appears, the twenty first. In 1997, Johns began <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge Suite</span>, a new series that employs a formal vocabulary derived largely from Crane's "To Brooklyn Bridge." The subject of Johns and Crane will soon require another study.</p>
