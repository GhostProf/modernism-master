<p id="lead">The relation of classicism to fascist ideology and visual culture in Mussolini's Italy and Nazi Germany is well studied in the field of art history, but the existence of a similar convergence in France during the 1930s has yet to be examined. To date, study of French fascist aesthetics in art history has largely focused on the art criticism of fascist apologists such as Waldemar George and Lucien Rebatet, neither of whom developed a theory of classicism (Affron, 171–204 and Cone, <i>French Modernisms</i>, 63–80). Moreover interwar classicism in the visual arts in France is commonly divorced from any native form of fascism, with assertions that classicists like sculptors Charles Despiau (1874–1946) and Aristide Maillol (1861–1944) were only sympathetic to fascism by virtue of their friendship with such prominent Nazis as the sculptor Arno Breker, who promoted their work during the Nazi occupation of France (1940–44) (Cone, <i>Artists under Vichy, </i>154–169). </p>

<p>I will counter these received assumptions by examining the role played by the prominent French literary critic Thierry Maulnier (1909–1988) in formulating what I would call a Nietzschean notion of fascist visual culture for a French audience. Maulnier argued that Friedrich Nietzsche's pronouncements in <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>  concerning the salutary union of Apollonian and Dionysian impulses in art would lead to the establishment of a fascist new order, based on classical precepts native to France (Carroll 222–247). To date, art historians have associated such Nietzschean classicism with the feeling of pathos, eroticism, melancholy, and nostalgia evoked by the art of 

<b></b>

 such avant-gardists as Giorgio de Chirico, André Masson, and Pablo Picasso (Cowling, "Introduction," 26–28). Maulnier and his colleagues radically redefined Nietzschean classicism to promote an alternative aesthetic, exemplified by the art of sculptors Despiau and Maillol, and the architect Auguste Perret (1874–1954). Maulnier's complex integration of the work of these native-born artists into his theory of French fascism will be the subject of this essay. </p>

<p>Shortly after founding the journal <i>Combat</i> in January, 1936, Maulnier made a radical claim: the origins of European fascism resided in the alliance, in Paris before the First World War, between the followers of Charles Maurras and Georges Sorel. Maurras was the founder of the Royalist movement Action française; Sorel, by contrast, was a self-proclaimed leftist who had called for the violent overthrow of the French Republic by radical syndicalists. In late 1911, their followers had joined forces in founding the Cercle Proudhon (1912–1914), which Maulnier praised as the first movement in Europe to espouse an anti-parliamentary version of national socialism. Maulnier bestowed a fascist pedigree on the Cercle in a February 1936 essay, titled "Les Deux violences" (Two Violences), in which he referred <i>Combat</i>'s readers to a contiguous article by the Sorelian Pierre Andreu as proof. Andreu's text, titled "Fascisme 1913," described the Cercle Proudhon's founders—syndicalist Edouard Berth, and Sorelian Royalists Henri Lagrange and Georges Valois—as having combined "nationalism and socialism [into] the nebula of a kind of Fascism."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Andreu then outlined the aesthetic implications of his thesis. Drawing on Edouard Berth's national socialist treatise of 1914, <i>Les Méfaits des Intellectuels (The Misdeeds of Intellectuals)</i>, he argued that this pre-war movement successfully melded the classical "beauty" and Apollonian spirit promoted by Charles Maurras with the Dionysian notion of the revolutionary "sublime" as defined by Georges Sorel. In this way, Sorelian violence took on "a spirit of order and discipline." Andreu lamented that the Cercle Proudhon's regenerative merger between the radical left and right was artificially cut short by World War I, and Maulnier in "Two Violences" upheld that view. In response, Maulnier called for the resuscitation of the spirit of the Cercle Proudhon, in hopes that the alliance between bourgeois and proletarian revolutionaries could be turned against an emerging enemy: the anti-fascist Popular Front, established in 1934 by French Socialists, Communists, Radical Republicans, and their allies in the syndicalist labor movement. Headed by the socialist Léon Blum, this coalition would govern France from May 1936 to April 1938.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Between January 1936 and July, 1939, Maulnier, Andreu and the art critic Pierre Loisy launched their pro-fascist campaign against the Popular Front in the pages of <i>Combat </i>and in a short-lived newspaper appropriately titled <i>Insurgé</i>, which lasted from January to October, 1937. Throughout this period <i>Combat</i> held up the Cercle Proudhon as a shining example of the type of revolution they hoped to initiate, namely, one that integrated a theory of culture into a system of values antithetical to those underpinning the French Third Republic (1870–1940).  </p>

<p>Indeed I would argue that Maulnier's cultural politics were the product of his unique interpretation of Georges Sorel's legacy, which the Combat group allied to French fascism and their doctrine of classical violence.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The latter discourse was developed by Maulnier and fellow <i>Combat </i>contributor Jean Loisy, who, in conjunction with others, 

<b></b>

 took aim at the 1937 Paris World's Fair, originally conceived in 1932 and scheduled to open on May 1, 1937.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Extending outward from the Champ de Mars, the fairgrounds stretched across the Seine to the newly constructed Palais de Chaillot, which replaced the old Palais du Trocadéro, and lined the river banks from the Place de la Concorde to the Ile de Cygnes. The most prominent foreign pavilions, including those of the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and Fascist Italy—all appearing in a June 1937 photograph of a regatta on the Seine [<a href="#1">re 1</a>]—were clustered in front of the newly reconstructed Palais de Chaillot, while a series of pavilions representing France's regions was situated to the west of the Eiffel Tower. Under Blum's newly elected government, the Fair's construction met with repeated strikes, which delayed the Fair's opening to May 14, 1937; as we shall see, the Combat group seized this issue as evidence of the decline of France under Blum's leadership. In addition they took aim at the Marxist conception of Proletarian culture and Socialist Realism espoused by the Communist-led artists' league known as the "Association of Revolutionary Artists and Writers," whose representatives had endorsed the Popular Front. Art policy under Blum's government was deemed to be decadent by virtue of its promotion of "pompierism," whether in the guise of abstract art, state-sanctioned academic painting, or Socialist Realist aesthetics. Pompier was a derogatory term developed by 19th-century critics to describe overblown paintings by artists affiliated with the École des Beaux-Arts; the <i>Combat</i> group extended the original meaning to include artists and critics whose art and art criticism fulfilled the mandate of political organizations allied to the Third Republic. The writers for <i>Combat </i>linked their fascist revolt to the classicizing aesthetics of sculptors Maillol and Despiau, and the architect Perret, whom they lauded as the harbingers of a national renewal. The classicism of these artists attested to the fact that the revolutionary sublime could once again give birth to a spirit of order and discipline if a proper balance was achieved between aesthetic innovation and respect for tradition and métier. The latter discourse was also deployed against the French Surrealists, whose Communist sympathies were roundly condemned by Maulnier and his allies. Maulnier's distillation of this ideological agenda to its cultural essence was essential to what David Carroll, Mary Ann Witt, and Zeev Sternhell have termed a "spiritualistic" or "aesthetic" fascism, one that gave primacy to art, ethics, and a theory of revolution rather than the muddy actualities of the Fascist regimes then in power.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The fascist valences informing this cultural program cannot be properly understood without first analyzing the writings of Sorel's principal apologist, Thierry Maulnier. Having outlined this ideological trajectory, I will then turn to its aesthetic implications. The<i> Combat</i> group's critique of art policy under the Popular Front demonstrates the degree to which their ideology defined the terms of discourse operative in their writings on culture. This is especially evident in their promotion of classicism as a palingenetic alternative not only to the 'decadence' of Popular Front aesthetics, but to competing versions of fascism promoted at the Paris World's Fair. Rather than publicly endorsing Mario Sironi's monumental mosaic "Fascist Work" then on display in Marcello Piacentini and Cesare Valle's Italian Fascist pavilion [<a href="#2">re 2</a>], or the virile masculinity of the oversized sculptural nudes by Josef Thorak flanking the entrance to Albert Speer's Nazi pavilion [<a href="#3">re 3</a>], <i>Combat</i> forged a new and unique definition of

<p>Maulnier's endorsement of Sorel is clearly stated in an article of February 1936 titled "Le Socialisme antidémocratique de Georges Sorel" (The Anti-democratic Socialism of Georges Sorel), published in the royalist <i>La Revue universelle</i>. In that essay Maulnier described Sorel as a "philosopher-prophet" whose book <i>Reflections on Violence</i>  had profoundly influenced "the leaders of three great revolutions on which the future of Europe depends, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler"(370–74). The violence propagated by Sorel was not the "romantic violence" exemplified by "the taste for riot and spilled blood," rather it was founded on "the principles of a rigorous doctrine" that marshaled "intellectual courage [to oppose] 'the established order'" . Maulnier also endorsed Sorel's comparison, in his <i>Reflections on Violence</i>, of the ethical violence of French syndicalists to the military discipline and heroism of the citizen-soldiers of Homeric 

<b></b>

 Greece. He then cited such violence as indicative of the fusion of Apollonian beauty and Dionysian sublimity as defined by the Cercle Proudhon. Maulnier, in emulation of Sorel and the Cercle Proudhon, lauded the concept of tragic heroism developed in Nietzsche's <i>Birth of Tragedy</i> as the spiritual attitude to be instilled in contemporary revolutionaries.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Sorel, Maulnier argued, had already witnessed the dissipation of such ethical violence before World War One when the syndicalist movement abandoned its revolutionary tactics in favor of a reformist alliance with parliamentary socialists led by Jean Jaurès. Sorel had then turned his attention to the only antidemocratic movement left in France, the Action française, and reportedly pinned his socialist hopes during World War One on radical leftists outside of France, namely Lenin and Mussolini (373–74).<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>   </p>

<p>It is at this point that Maulnier took up Sorel's mantle, claiming that his mentor's untimely death in 1922 meant that he did not witness the decline of Soviet Communism into a degenerate condition reminiscent of Jaurès's parliamentary socialists. "Sorel did not live long enough to see communism follow the path opened by French socialism, sink into political schemes, and, obedient to the instructions of this same new Russia in which Sorel placed his aspirations, enter into the Popular Front for the defense of democracy" . While Maulnier was prepared to dismiss French Communism and the Soviet Union on Sorel's behalf, he lionized the Italian Fascist Benito Mussolini, identifying Il Duce as the only postwar leader who remained true to Sorel's doctrine. Mussolini, we are told, was every bit Lenin's equal in his initial endorsement of Sorelian violence but he had surpassed Lenin by creating the "national and syndicalist society of which Sorel had dreamed." According to Maulnier, Mussolini's reconciliation of classes in the name of fascism closely resembled the national syndicalism promoted by the Cercle Proudhon. "Maurrassian analysis," stated Maulnier, would show the French how to separate "the idea of nationalism from that of bourgeois social conservatism" while "Sorelian analysis" would disentangle "the idea of social revolution from democratic progress" .  </p>

<p>Maulnier also paid homage to Cercle Proudhon adherent, Edouard Berth in a book-length study of Friedrich Nietzsche published in 1935, and in his 1936 volume devoted to the seventeenth-century playwright Jean Racine. In these texts, Maulnier reiterated Berth's thesis in <i>The Misdeeds of Intellectuals</i> by defining the classical spirit as a synthesis of Dionysian energy and Apollonian restraint (Berth 329). As David Carroll has demonstrated, Maulnier argued that "the Nietzschean notion of a pure and extreme aesthetics of force can be realized as a maximum of intensity or violence only within the constraints of classical form–the Dionysian realizing itself fully only through the Apollonian" (Carroll 228).<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Maulnier traced the French roots of classical violence back to the era of Louis XIV, and beyond that to Ancient Greece in the age of Aeschylus and Homer. Thus Racine's classicism arguably prered that of the Cercle Proudhon, which in turn had given birth to French fascism following World War One. By returning to the origins of Greek classicism, Racine, like Nietzsche, had reportedly rediscovered the violence and sublimity native to a creativity whose aesthetic corollary was Greek tragedy (Carroll 226–27, Witt 145–48).<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  On this basis, Maulnier declared 

<b></b>

 Racine's classicism to be antithetical to the "abstract, rational and arid classicism" supposedly endorsed by defenders of the Third Republic. Maulnier wanted to vanquish the "legend of an Apollonian France" by promoting that of Racinian France, arguing that true classicism was born when "the greatest vital fervor [élan vital] coincides with the triumph of formal perfection" (cited in Carroll, 230).<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>   </p>

<p>By drawing attention to the prophetic aspects of Sorel's and Berth's thought, Maulnier set the stage for <i>Combat</i>'s Sorelian critique of the Popular Front government of Léon Blum, whose election in May 1936 precipitated a firestorm among the radical right. Between Blum's electoral victory on May 5 and the installment of his government on June 6, France had been riven by strikes, including factory occupations, and one of Blum's first acts as Premier was to bring together syndicalist leaders and prominent industrialists to sign an accord, known as the Matignon Agreements. The Agreements, whose signing occurred in June 1936, were a model of reformist politics: in return for ending the strikes, workers would be guaranteed a forty-hour week, an increase in wages, and two weeks paid holiday. <sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  This economic truce won the support of the syndicalists and their Communist allies; Maulnier by contrast accused Blum of thwarting a revolution, albeit from the marginal standpoint of the Sorelian right. In a July 1936 <i>Combat </i>article titled "La Fin d'un 'Ordre,'" (The End of an 'Order') Maulnier argued that the Matignon Agreements signaled "the Decomposition of the syndicalist movement" which "had entered into the service of the plutocratic state, manipulated by politicians, corrupted, as Sorel predicted, by parliamentary democracy" (unpag.). Maulnier's Sorelian battle cry was reiterated in the pages of <i>Insurgé </i>the following year. In an April 1937 article titled "Les deux trahisons" (The Two Treasons) he railed against the alliance between the French Communist Party—formed in 1921—and the Parliamentary Socialists, comparing the Popular Front to the wartime <i>sacred union</i> "denounced by Sorel" (1–2).  </p>

<p>Concurrently, the French syndicalists spearheaded a series of strikes on the site of the upcoming Paris World Fair, with the result that construction had fallen five months behind schedule by December 1936. In an effort to rally workers to the government's cause, Blum visited the work site in early February 1937, publicly declaring that "the failure of the Popular Front would be a triumph for fascism. A delay in the exhibition would be its victory" (cited in Peer 34). Maulnier immediately reacted by publishing an article in<i> Insurgé</i> titled, "Syndicalisme? OUI, Démocratie? NON" (1,3). Maulnier argued that the striking workers had been manipulated by the syndicalist leadership into undermining the national interest and betraying their revolutionary mission as defined by Georges Sorel. Instead of combating democracy, the syndicalists had risen to defend the Popular Front, even as it instituted work stoppages in hopes of winning further economic concessions. <i>Insurgé </i>further mocked Blum's government by pairing Maulnier's polemic with an article titled "Paris déré" (Paris Disred) which consisted of photographs comparable to those reproduced in the journal <i>L'Illustration</i> of the unfinished buildings littering the fairgrounds [<a href="#4">re 4</a>] .<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  In April 1937, <i>Insurgé </i>accused Léon Blum of making the World's Fair "into a project of the Popular Front" which "systematically pushed French people, belonging to any party other than his own, away from something which should have been the work of France" (Richard 1).

<p>It is with these issues in mind that we can now turn to the <i>Combat</i> group's writings on culture, for I would argue that their theory of 'classical violence' not only aestheticized their politics, it politicized their theory of art. The art and architecture promoted by Maulnier and his colleagues took on mythic value as a harbinger of the fascist revolution. Over the course of 1936, Maulnier and his close ally Jean Loisy published a series of essays on the relation of aesthetics to tradition which were the building blocks for their full-scale critique of the cultural policies of the Soviet Union and the Popular Front, as manifest in the 1937 World's Fair.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  In defining an aesthetic corollary to their palingenetic ideology, the <i>Combat </i>group sought to reconcile adherence to tradition with artistic innovation: this resulted in praise for the classicizing aesthetics of sculptors Charles Despiau and Aristide Maillol, and of architect Auguste Perret. By contrast, <i>Combat</i>'s ideological enemies in the art world were attacked for failing to achieve the proper balance between tradition and innovation: this latter group included the full gamut of Communist Party and Popular Front 'pompiers,' from Abstractionists, to Surrealists, to Socialist Realists. The left-wing artists' penchant for stylistic 'extremes'—whether abstract or academic—was evidence of their societal factionalism, which privileged one class, the proletariat, over all others. In addition, the writers for <i>Combat </i>accused the artistic allies of Socialist Realism and of the Popular Front of being opportunists who forfeited freedom of expression in the name of stylistic conventions that signified their party loyalty and class allegiances. By contrast <i>Combat</i>'s aesthetic program purportedly 

<b></b>

 reconciled creative freedom with tradition to regenerate French culture for all classes, just as it reconciled Sorelian sublimity with Maurrassian order and discipline to bring about a national revolution. By this sleight of hand Maulnier and his allies claimed to defend freedom of expression even while they circumscribed 'creativity' within the classicizing confines of a nascent fascism.  </p>

<p>Maulnier set the stage for this campaign in an article titled "Les Essais: Inspiration et métier" (Essays: Inspiration and Craft) which appeared in the April 1936 issue of <i>Revue universelle</i>. He argued that the truly creative artist could not help but respect tradition because the creative impulse itself entailed a desire for order, as manifest in the venerable rules governing an artist's particular métier (110–11). Classicism in the arts, asserted Maulnier, constituted "a will to impose regularity on the chaos of sensations and images" that gave birth to "style." Maulnier then pitted this classicizing impulse against its Romantic counterpart, as exemplified by the Surrealists. The Surrealists reportedly gave free rein to the senses, thus converting the artist into the "docile victim" of a sensory onslaught—both internal and external—that stretched "aesthetic creation to the limits of lunacy." This "cult of inspiration" untethered from all desire for order, converted the artist into "a sort of somnambulist" whose expressive powers were reduced to what the Surrealist called "automatic writing" (112–13). On this basis, Maulnier accused the Surrealists of separating inspiration from craft, creativity from tradition, and in so doing precipitating a complete break with the art of the past .  </p>

<p>By contrast Maulnier claimed that the sculpture of Aristide Maillol [<a href="#5">re 5</a>] paid homage to the classical tradition by modernizing it. In an October 1936 <i>Combat </i>essay titled "Les Conservateurs," Maulnier categorically rejected tradition "if one means by tradition the fear of change, the cult of history, a singular focus on the art of the past." "In the history of healthy civilizations," Maulnier asserted, "tradition only expresses the continuity of life, it demands to be, without cease, surpassed" (unpag.). In his essay "A Bas la culture bourgeoise!," published in the October 1936 issue of <i>Combat</i>, Maulnier condemned the Marxist doctrine of "proletarian culture" on similar grounds, arguing that the Communists broke the palingenetic link between the classical past and contemporary civilization. By designating the proletariat the sole arbiters of culture, the Communists wanted to make the least educated and most disenfranchised group the catalyst for an artistic renaissance. In a reductive fashion, French Communists had dismissed France's "classical writers," such as Racine, as bourgeois, when in fact classicism should be regarded as the heritage of all French people rather than that of a single class. Classicism successfully united "tradition" and "revolution" in the arts, just as the classical spirit succeeded in uniting revolutionary factions among the bourgeoisie and proletariat in the sphere of politics. By contrast the cultural and political policies of the Soviet Union and Popular Front only resulted in artistic "decadence" and class sectarianism. "Classical violence" alone could aestheticize politics and politicize aesthetics for the benefit of the French nation as a whole. </p>

<p>Over the course of 1937, the <i>Combat</i> group joined Maulnier in promoting Maillol [<a href="#6">re 6</a>] and the sculptor Charles Despiau [<a href="#7">re 7</a>] as the chief defenders of French

classicism. In his May 1937 assessment of the World's Fair published in<i> Insurgé</i>, Maulnier instructed visitors to avoid the pavilions cluttering the Champ de Mars; instead they were told to visit Parisian churches, the Louvre, and to study "the admirable works of Despiau and Maillol."("Cherchez ailleurs l'Exposition" 1). The following month, <i>Insurgé </i>published an effusive review of the sculpture of Despiau and Maillol then on display at the "Masters of Independent Art" exhibition in the Petit Palais, which was organized by the city of Paris to coincide with the World's Fair (Aurellian 5).<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  <i>Insurgé</i> identified these two artists as the unrivaled "masters" of contemporary sculpture, who were the torchbearers of a French tradition going back to "the stone cutters of Chartres or Reims" as well as the classicists "of our Seventeenth Century." These endorsements lent a fascist valence to a more general critical discourse that identified Despiau and Maillol as quintessential French "traditionalists," whose sculpture was regularly celebrated as the latest link in an unbroken line going back to classical antiquity. </p>

<p>Charles Despiau had first risen to prominence during the 1920s when he began receiving commissions for Classical res, culminating in a five-metre high statue of Apollo designed for the terrace of the Museum of Modern Art at the 1937 World's Fair [<a href="#8">re 8</a>].<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Writing in 1922, the critic Roger Marx could proclaim Despiau "the enemy of romanticism" whose sculpture was governed by "calm rhythms and stable 

<b></b>

 lines" circumscribed "within a form that is pure and geometric" (cited in Elliott 100). Maillol in turn constantly referred to his Mediterranean and Catalan roots to highlight the "natural" links between archaic Greece and his native region in southern France. Maillol began propagating this self-image during his 1908 trip to Greece by carefully documenting such revelatory moments as his encounter with pediment sculpture from the Temple of Zeus in Olympia [<a href="#9">re 9</a>] .<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  To Maillol's mind this lineage accounted for his predilection for casting contemporary Catalan models in the guise of classicizing monumental nudes with titles like "Three Nymphs" of 1938 [<a href="#0">re 10</a>]. <i>Combat</i> further embellished the Maillol legend in an article by Claude Orland devoted to the sculptor in the November 1937 issue of the journal (Orland, unpag.). Having identified Despiau and Maillol as "the only true geniuses of contemporary art," Orland lauded Maillol for having followed Maurras in steeping himself in classical culture, as evidenced by his woodcuts for the writings of Homer then on display at the Petit Palais.</p>

<p>The <i>Combat</i> group's praise of Maillol as a modern 'classic' arguably found affirmation in Maillol's own aesthetic precepts. According to Maulnier, true classicism, by subjecting Dionysian energy to the discipline of Apollonian order, could create an art

 that reconciled sensual particularity with the classical ideal, and wedded the artistic imagination to the same aesthetic principles that guided the Ancient Greeks. This definition fit well with Maillol's own aims, for his preferred models were the peasant women of his native region, whose features he then generalized into timeless emblems of the classical (Green, 267–82). For instance, in developing his "Three Nymphs," Maillol worked from a single model, whose features were de-particularized and used as a template for all three res in the sculptural group. The overall effect is as if one were looking at three different views of a single woman, a clear allusion to the classical motif of the Three Graces. Indeed this obvious reference accounts for the fact that the work was mistitled "Three Graces" when an unfinished plaster version was exhibited at the "Exposition des Maîtres de l'Art Indépendant" in 1937. As with so many of Maillol's works, "Three Nymphs" was developed over an extended period of time, undergoing repeated transformations over the eight-year period from 1930 to 1938 (Cowling, "The Three Nymphs" 156). Contemporary critics described this process of constant refinement as indicative of Maillol's classical method, for, as Maurice Denis stated in his 1925 monograph on Maillol, "the ideal in art is condensation" and Aristide Maillol, in taking up "the same themes and the same models incessantly . . . perfects 

<b></b>

 them; he polishes them; he brings them ever closer to his ideal" (cited in Cowling, "The Three Nymphs" 156). Dionysian fervor therefore yielded to Apollonian form as Maillol distilled images of timeless, classical beauty out of sensual particulars, exemplified by contemporary Catalan women native to southern France.</p>

<p>The third member of <i>Combat</i>'s classical entourage was Auguste Perret. Unlike Despiau and Maillol, Perret actually interacted with the <i>Combat</i> group: first by speaking at a conference devoted to "Tradition and Revolution" organized by <i>Combat</i> in June 1936; then by lecturing at a January 1937 <i>Combat</i>-sponsored conference devoted to "The Upholding of Spirituality in Art."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  In January 1937, <i>Insurgé</i> launched its first issue with an illustrated article by Jean Loisy titled "The 1937 Exposition: Paris will not have an Acropolis" devoted to the Republic's rejection in 1934 of Perret's plans for the Palais de Chaillot, designed to replace the old Trocadéro [<a href="#1">re 11</a>] . Perret's architectural project was monumental: composed of four terraced museum buildings surrounding a vast open courtyard with a panoramic view overlooking the Seine and the Champ de Mars, the structure was crowned by an open-air colonnade, conceived of as a sculpture museum. This classicizing structure was to be built out of reinforced concrete, 

<b></b>

 the "signature" material that served to define Perret as an architectural pioneer. Perret's initial plan for this Parisian "Acropolis" included the sculpture by Despiau and Maillol as the traditionalist complement to his own aesthetic precepts. One can imagine the appeal this project had for the <i>Combat</i> group: Despiau, Maillol, and Perret were all aesthetic innovators steeped in the classical tradition, and the rejection of Perret's design purportedly testified to the Third Republic's cultural decadence.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> </p>

<p>It was Jean Loisy who first assimilated Perret's architectural aims into <i>Combat</i>'s agenda in his seminal essay "L'Art dans la société contemporaine" (Art in Contemporary Society) published in September 1936. Describing Perret as having embarked "on the heroic struggle to integrate modern discoveries into the classical tradition" Loisy quoted the architects' June 1936 pronouncements to the <i>Combat</i> group on that "noble ideal," style. According to Loisy, Perret's allegiance to architecture's "permanent laws" in the face of changing historical circumstances aligned him with the "traditionalists" while his desire to experiment with new materials made him a "revolutionary" (Loisy, unpag.). Perret's architecture therefore reportedly mirrored the <i>Combat</i> group's own epic struggle to resuscitate French society, for the classical violence that served to define the fascist attitude also governed the artistic imagination. Thus traditional and revolutionary impulses, as defined by Maulnier, were conjoined in a single endeavor, not only to transform art, but to remodel French society in the mold of <i>Combat</i>'s fascist vision. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT2" href="#REF2">2</a>. "Sans doute quand on se réfère à cette époque, a écrit Drieu La Rochelle, on s'aperçoit que quelques éléments de l'atmosphère fasciste étaient réunis en France vers 1913, avant qu'ils le fussent ailleurs. Il y avait des jeunes gens, sortis des diverses classes de la société, qui étaient animés par l'amour de l'heroïsme et la violence et qui rêvaïent de combattre ce qu'ils appelaient le mal sur deux fronts: capitalisme et socialisme parlementaire, et prendre leur bien des deux côtés. Il y avait, je crois à Lyon, des gens qui s'intitulaieint socialistes-royalistes, ou quelque chose d'approchant. Déjà le mariage du nationalisme et du socialisme était projeté. Qui, en France, aux alentours de l'Action française et de Péguy, il y avait la nébuleuse d'une sorte de fascisme." Undoubtedly, when one refers 

<b></b>

 back to that period, wrote Drieu La Rochelle, one sees that certain elements of a fascist atmosphere came together in France around 1913, before they emerged elsewhere. They were young people from various classes of society who were animated by the love of heroism and of violence and who dreamed of combating what they called the evil on two fronts: capitalism and parliamentary socialism, and who were similarly disposed towards both. There were, I believe, people in Lyon who called themselves socialist-royalists, or something like that. A marriage of nationalism and socialism was already being envisaged. Yes, in France, among the groups surrounding the Action française and Péguy, there was already the nebula of a sort of fascism. Drieu La Rochelle, quoted in Pierre Andreu, "Fascisme 1913," <i>Combat</i> (January 1936). Thierry Maulnier endorsed Andreu's text in his essay "Les Deux Violences," <i>Combat</i> (February 1936). Zeev Sternhell has drawn attention to this text as well as other interwar testimonials claiming to locate the origins of national socialism in the avant-guerre confluence of the left and right exemplified by the Cercle Proudhon.

<p id="lead">As the 20<sup>th</sup> century drew to a close, the shadow of fascism nevertheless lingered on. In 2001, Silvio Berlusconi, the Prime Minister of Italy, attempted to rehabilitate the neo-fascist National Alliance (one of whose leaders is Mussolini's granddaughter) by bringing it into the government and then declaring: "fascism never killed anyone" (Stille X). Subsequently, in 2005 <i>Duce, mio padre</i> (My Father Il Duce), the memoir of Mussolini's son Romano became a best-selling book that allowed the author to make many favorable remarks about <i>Il Duce</i> on national television, most frequently on channels owned by Berlusconi himself. This alarming development, which seems to have subsided somewhat as a result of the Italian elections in 2006 that Berlusconi lost, occurred in the context of a scholarly debate that has refocused on the complex relationship of fascism to modernism, as well as to post-modernism, along with a concerted rethinking of each of these three terms.  </p>

<p>Just as Horst Bredekamp disclosed that the modernist art critic Walter Benjamin had a rather surprising long term admiration for the political theory of Carl Schmitt, a key Nazi apologist from the 1930s onward , so Mark Antliff also concluded in an essay of 2002 that "The terms fascism and modern art used to seem comfortably opposed to each other, but the last two decades of scholarship in history, art history, and literature have radically revised that postwar complacency" . Furthermore, the conventional wisdom about the strictly antagonistic relation of modernism in the arts to fascism is as much in need of critical revision, as is the standard post-1945 assumption about the relation of fascism to an economic modernization predicated in turn 



 on industrial capitalism. Indeed, Zygmut Bauman's insightful study on <i>Modernity and the Holocaust</i>  has shown compellingly enough that even the irrational genocide of the Nazi holocaust was untenable without the systematic rationalization, the Taylorization as it were, of impersonal involvement by its functionaries, which alone allowed mass murder on this scale to be "humanly" possible. Along related lines, Paul Jaskot's important book, <i>The Architecture of Oppression: The SS, Forced Labor, and the Nazi Monumental Building Economy</i> , clearly documented the extreme form to which the Nazis used the technocratic standardization of labor relations and accountancy, both of which were grounded in the instrumental division of labor known as Taylorism, a celebrated invention of capitalist modernization at its most efficient.  </p>

<p>Moreover, major historians like Richard Evans and Thomas O. Paxton, as for example in the latter's <i>Anatomy of Fascism</i> , have shown a related phenomenon. Despite the anti-modernization and anti-capitalist rhetoric of every fascist movement, something else obtained historically speaking, since "whenever fascist parties acquired power [ . . . ] they did nothing to carry out these anti-capitalist threats" . To the contrary, a decisive moment both for the German National Socialists (with its "Night of the Long Knives" in 1934) and the Italian Fascists (with its "March on Rome" in 1922) entailed the purging of precisely those radical members of their respective movements who were most implacable in their opposition to capital or to any fascist business alliances with the traditional elites (Evans, 20ff).  </p>

<p>Given these patterns within fascist movements of embracing forms of economic modernization, along with ambivalence towards—but <i>no</i> mere rejection of—various modernisms in art and architecture, a key question obviously reemerged in the scholarly literature. Can we arrive at a unitary definition of fascism for all of these ultra-rightwing movements, even though they clearly diverge from each other as a consequence of their claims to regionalist particularism and national exceptionalism?  </p>

<p>It was this set of coordinates—along with the disturbing Carl Schmitt-like recourse to "decisionism" by the current Bush Administration as it "justifies" its ultra-militarism and uncompromising nationalism—that convinced us to organize the Conference "Modernism—Fascism—Postmodernism." It was held at the University of New Mexico in September 2006, at which the following five papers were given and discussed (along with two dozen other papers). Since he had achieved international attention in the 1990s with his book entitled <i>The Nature of Fascism,</i> the British historian Roger Griffin was a fairly obvious choice as plenary speaker for the conference. By shifting the focus on fascism to words from deeds (unlike, say, Jaskot, Paxton, and Evans who emphasized deeds over words), Griffin attempted to give conceptual unity ideologically to the various movements termed "fascist" by providing a sweeping definition of what all of these groups seemed to share in the realm of ideals, in spite of their manifest differences otherwise.  </p>

<p>Griffin argued that "Fascism is a genus of political ideology whose mythic core in its various permutations is a palingenetic form of populist ultra-nationalism" . This new theory about "generic fascism" emerged from the growing awareness of many scholars that we need to grasp as central to all fascist movements their alluring rhetoric centered 

<b></b>

 on inaugurating a national or ethnic rebirth through the wholesale transformation of existing society. According to this historical perspective, rather than being imposed only through brute coercion by groups like the SS or cynical manipulation by ideologues like Goebbels, it was the creation of a "national, ethnic-based myth" that fueled the relative popularity and cohesion of each fascist movement. In addition, the obvious usage of mass politics and the mass cultural industry by various fascist movements marks them off from the traditional formations of rightwing parties with their pre-modern values and elitist practices. As such, the modern skills of fascist movements to mobilize sectors of the popular classes after 1919—when the term was coined by Mussolini—was based on an unprecedented reconration of mass politics in relation to Western modernity, even as the fascist themselves claimed paradoxically to transcend politics. This purported "transcendence" happened through what Umberto Eco has incisively renamed ur-fascism's "cult of tradition," which was misremembered by means of a reinvented or "modernized" past . </p>

<p>When we bring our attention to the theories behind fascism, as Griffin does, rather than to whether or nor the theories were ever practiced, we are immediately reminded to revisit the much debated role of theorists like Martin Heidegger or Carl Schmitt in either preparing the way for fascism or in validating it when it arrived. In fact, a recent book by Claudia Koonz, <i>Nazi Conscience</i> , makes a commanding case for both contentions. Similarly, the debate involving Heidegger also revolves around such things as his claim that German was, along with Classical Greek, "superior" to all other languages for revealing philosophical truths. This often heated polemic still has many points of irresolution and few easy points of contention, as summarized poignantly by Terry Eagleton, "This is not to suggest that Heidegger's philosophy as a whole is no more than a rationale for fascism; it <i>is</i> to suggest that it provided one imaginary solution to the crisis of modern history as fascism provided another and that the two shared a number of points in common" .  </p>

<p>An attendant contemporary issue that deserves equal attention involves the ascendancy within both post-modernism and post-structuralism of Heidegger's "anti-humanism." Such illiberal opposition to humanism <i>tout court</i> unquestionably operated in tandem with the Nazis's pathological hatred of humanism, the Enlightenment, and Marxism, as evident in Heidegger's 1933 public address on the "Self-Assertion of the German University," when he spoke as <i>both</i> Chancellor of Freiburg University and as an official of the Nazi Party (of which he remained a "member in good standing" from 1933 to 1945). In that chillingly anti-humanist and anti-Enlightenment public lecture, Heidegger sternly denounced academic free speech and democratic values, while favoring forced labor and compulsory military service for his students (29–39).  </p>

<p>It thus would be disingenuous to conclude that the unrelenting "anti-humanism" of many French structuralists and post-structuralists from Louis Althusser and Claude Lévi-Strauss through Jacques Derrida is simply unrelated to that of fascism, even as these same thinkers are deeply in the debt of Heidegger, <i>whose anti-humanism was definitely linked to that of the Nazis</i>. Indeed, it was probably this retroactive recognition of post-structuralism's unwanted Heideggerian blindspots that caused Michel 

<b></b>

 Foucault, in one of his last essays, to agree with Jürgen Habermas, when rejecting the current "blackmail of being either for or against the Enlightenment" or humanism, as if no further constructive engagement with either were possible (43 </p>

<p>Indeed, Derrida also declared in one of his later interviews that, as he came to equate deconstruction with social justice, he also learned "to distrust a certain kind of spirit in Heidegger, and to <i>defend</i> spirit, a certain kind of spirit or spectre, in Marx" . Here, as elsewhere, alarm bells have been sounded about certain quasi-fascist tendencies within postmodernism (though we must recall Hal Foster's insistence in his introduction to <i>The Anti-Aesthetic</i> that postmodernism embraces several contradictory trends, some of which are regressive, while others are not). This justified sense of concern about postmodernism was addressed in a compelling way during the conference by several scholars, including Florentine Strzelczyk explicates in the paper below how Hollywood's inverted romance with the Nazis 'its beloved villains,' constitutes yet another sinister chapter in the post-war tale of "fascinating fascism" previously exposed by Susan Sontag in her well-known essay by that name. At issue here is the disturbing inclination of postmodern irony to unwittingly underwrite the very phenomenon of fascism it subjects to only half-hearted critique. In this regard, the conference participants certainly agreed with Harry Harootunian's position that we urgently need to "take fascism seriously" at a time when the "familiar signs of fascism have begun to appear with greater regularity" amidst the tragicomic buffoonery of the Bush Era . </p>

<p>If postmodernisms now generate contradictory positions concerning fascism's future, not just their past, then much the same can be said about the paradoxical relation of various modernisms to actually existing "generic fascism" from the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. A key aim of the conference—and of some of these papers—was precisely to illuminate the complex relation of modernisms to fascisms by means of something other than the brittle binaries of past scholarship, with its rigid division between the two sets of terms. The papers of Gregory Maertz, Roger Griffin, Mark Antliff, and Claudio Fogu all address the few important points of intersection linking some strains of modernism with almost all strains of fascism. In his cold-war story of a Nazi art collection that finally "came in from the cold" via the Bitburg controversy of the Reagan Administration, Maertz demonstrates something new based on previously unknown paintings in Nazi collections. There existed a surprising gap in the Third Reich between the official public ceremonial art that showcased the neo-classicism of Arno Breker (who represented Germany at the Venice Biennale in 1938) or Josef Thorak (whose work adorned public headquarters) <i>and</i> the unofficial modernist paintings collected by at least some of the Nazi faithful. Although Berthold Hinz has done a fine job of discussing the official art of the Nazis in <i>Art of the Third Reich</i>, much remains to be learned about the more subjective images for private consumption. These images represent a few tendencies of modernist painting that clearly survived in the heyday of the Nazis, despite our previous assumptions that all types of modernism were banned in this period. </p>

<p>Which types of modernist art survived? Based on the preliminary findings of Maertz, there are two basic strains of <i>organic</i> modernism, often linked to rural settings, and 

<b></b>

 fundamentally at odds with the many inorganic, constructivist strains of modernism that were anti-fascist. These two basic types of fascist modernism are Post-Impressionist landscapes of pre-modern topics, on the one hand, and early Expressionist views with "primordial" overtones connected to Emil Nolde, on the other. But, there is no evidence as yet of Nazi patronage for the type of Expressionism grounded in the non-organic angularity and gritty urbanism of Ludwig Kirchner (whose public censorship and public humiliation led to the artist's suicide in 1938) or the constructivism of Russian vanguard artists like Tatlin, Rodchenko or El Lissitzky. Thus, Maertz's cachet of new primary sources broadens our sense of how Nazi aesthetics could be linked to rural variants of early modernism, even as it sharpens our sense of all the other types of internationalist, urban-inflected modernism with which the fascist sensibility was fundamentally at odds. </p>

<p>In an unduly optimistic reading of this new material, Roger Griffin tries in his paper to accomplish for modernism what many feel he did for fascism, namely, provide a unitary definition of all types of modernisms. Yet, Griffin's definition of "all modernisms" in fact covers only a small minority of these movements, such as the agrarian Expressionism of a Nolde or the Post-Impressionism of an André Derain. His "unitary" framework simply does not encompass most modernist movements in Europe, much less those from outside the West. Though a stimulating point of departure, Griffin's definition needs to be complemented by a discussion of the emergence of modernism in a dialogic relation and/or struggle with anti-colonial movements, which often set the terms for artistic discourse across international lines. Kobena Mercer and Partha Mitter, among many others, have mapped compellingly the anti-colonial and anti-nationalist nature of many of these modernist movements caught between Europe, on the one hand, and Asia, Africa, and Latin America, on the other. This kind of recent research questions any type of Eurocentric definition of modernism and instead constructively refocuses the debate on multiple forms of "cosmopolitan modernisms." As has been demonstrated elsewhere, the very term "modernism" does not enjoy any purely European provenance.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Elective affinities might unify different varieties of fascism, but elective antagonisms define precisely the disunified plurality of movements known as international modernisms for which nationalism, militarism, colonialism, and sexism were the enemy. Although superficially linked by modernist techniques, a solemn photomontage of Hitler by Leni Rienfenstahl, with its insistence on centering the iconic photo of the "hero," uses an entirely different pictorial logic than a photomontage by John Heartfield, for whom modernist collage meant a decentering and anti-hierarchical image articulating a patent visual absurdity. Little in this set of utterly contradictory modernist images attests to any form of "generic fascism," and nothing in this stark contrast of nationalist versus anti-nationalist modernisms allows us to rely on a unified definition of "modernism" to render them non-contradictory with each other, either as languages or as ideological stances. </p>

<p>What then permitted Futurism's <i>antipassatismo</i> to have national credibility in fascist Italy precisely when the official cult of tradition was ascendant, even though the modern culture industry was gaining momentum? The answer is provided below in Claudio 

<b></b>

 Fogu's thesis about the fascist duality of "<i>Imperium</i> and <i>Emporium</i>." He demonstrates how Futurism first navigated between two competing types of bellicose provincialisms – <i>Romanità</i> (Romanness) and <i>Mediterraneità </i>(Mediterranean-ness)—and then sailed straight from imperial conquest to neo-colonial consumerism, both of which were sanctioned on the subterranean level by the state capitalism underpinning Italian fascism. In pulling off this nimble interpretative twist concerning how "historic" public ritual was intertwined with commodity fetishism through the modern tourist industry, Fogu also reminds us of a crucial observation by Lutz Koepnick that previously appeared in the pages of  : </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[we] can no longer take for granted the fact that popular attitudes towards the Third Reich coincided with what we see in the historical images of cheering crowds, images dexterously designed and mass circulated by Goebbels's mass media. [ . . . ] large sections of the population led a <i>double life</i>: delivering vows of political loyalty in public rituals and pursuing apolitical leisure activities in the niches of private life. Contrary to the regime's rhetoric of political coordination and total mobilization, the Third Reich not only promised new career opportunities but also new tactics of diversion and commodity consumption. Apart from short periods of political euphoria, the allure of racing cars, radios, Coca-Cola [ . . . ] and Hollywood-style comedies—rather than the choreography of Riefenstahl spectacles—provided the stuff dreams were made of.</p>

<p>Yet in the <i>Kulturkampf</i> within fascisms between types of neo-classicisms and new modernisms, much more was at issue than just the ascendancy of a language tied self-consciously to commodity production or to tradition. The diverse modernisms stimulated by technological innovations in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, were, as Perry Anderson observed in his ground-breaking essay "Modernity and Revolution," preconditioned by "abstraction of techniques and artifacts from the social relations of production that generated them. In no case was capitalism as such ever exalted by any brand of 'modernism'" . The same can of course be stated about all brands of classicism that were championed respectively as the "official" styles for key government buildings under fascism, whether one has in mind the plans of Albert Speer or his Italian counterparts. What then made a type of classicism the most appropriate architectural language in every country for fascism's singularly public face? </p>

<p>In his essay on "Classical Violence" within French fascist art theory, Mark Antliff addresses this question by discussing two new interpretative shifts that will force us to change directions yet again in our analysis of fascisms and modernisms. First, he discloses the heretofore overlooked convergence between fascist aesthetic theory in France and the classicizing sculpture of Charles Despiau and Aristide Maillol, in turn mediated by a particular reading of Nietzsche. Second, his title signifies the deeply sublimated character of classical art in opposition to the much more de-sublimated artworks produced by most variants of modernism. As such, Antliff's article dovetails with the timely recent work of O.K. Werckmeister and Stephen Eisenman. To quote from Eisenman's new book, <i>The Abu Ghraib Effect</i>: 

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[A] key element of the classical tradition in art that extends back more than 2,500 years, at least to the Age of Athens [ . . . ] is an element seen in the equipoise of the animals led to slaughter on the Pan-Antheniac frieze, in the cruelty of the Battle of the Gods and Giants on the Pergamon Alter [ . . . ] That feature of the Western classical tradition is specifically the motif of tortured people and tormented animals who appear to sanction their own abuse [ . . . ] It is the mark of reification in extremis because it represents the body as something willingly alienated by the victim (even to the point of death) for the sake of the pleasure and aggrandize-ment of the oppressor. This mythic motif constitutes an unacknowledged basis of the unity of the classical tradition.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Here then stands revealed the sublimated violence that made a certain usage of classicism ideal for all fascist movements. Only classicism's idealization of the body could allow depictions of war in which the body was not mutilated in the most visually disgusting manner. Only classicism could show "heroic deaths" without the sickening dismemberment that accompanies all conquests of other humans or animals. Only classicism could use compositional symmetry to enshrine jarring social hierarchies and inequities of that type that fascist theories of racism blatantly celebrate. Finally, as a visual language, classicism is about centering (here an analogue to fascist stability), not the decentering pictorial logic of virtually all modernisms—whether one has in. mind Berlin Dada, Russian Constructivism, or French Surrealism.  </p>

<p id="lead">"In the golden years of rationalist architecture, Mediterranean-ness became our polar star" (Carlo Belli, cited in Danesi, 25). Thus architectural and art critic Belli recalled in 1976 the key role that the idea of <i>mediterraneità </i>(Mediterranean-ness) had come to play for both avant-garde Italian artists and rationalist architects in the early 1930s. Whether identified with a modern sense of the "<i>classic</i>" intended as an art of "intimacy cum narrative depth"—which accommodated equally the abstractism of Milanese painters, the "scuola Romana" of Giuseppe Capogrossi, Emanuele Cavalli e Corrado Cagli, and "les Italiens de Paris" united around Giorgio De Chirico—or with the "solar-ness" of Italian-rationalist architecture, Mediterranean-ness became the most effective line of defense in the Italian-modernist town (Vescovo 24). It allowed Italian modernists under Fascism to unify around a common discursive strategy in order to simultaneously distinguish themselves from their Northern European rivals, and to fence off the increasingly worrisome accusations of <i>esterofilia</i> (love of everything foreign) levied against them by the ever more vocal proponents of an official fascist style responding to the idea of <i>romanità </i>(ancient Roman-ness) (Benzi 30).  </p>

<p>Already between 1928 and 1929, Italian emigré painters in Paris, from the ex-futurist Gino Severini to the <i>sui generis novecentisti</i> Massimo Campigli and Filippo De Pisis, gathered around De Chirico, father of the most intuitively Mediterranean style in painting (metafisica), to combine "magical realism" and "abstract classicism" in order to create a Mediterranean alternative to the Surrealist "appeals to the unconscious, unexplored lands, and elementary forces"(Benzi 31).Similarly, in 1931, 



 the rationalist architects known as <i>Gruppo 7</i> began their polemic against the "cold rationalism" and "socialistic" tendencies of Bauhaus architecture, opposing to it the "solar" and "spontaneous" rationalism of Southern Italian and Greek islands architecture (Danesi 25). Pointing to the geographical consistency of the connection between sun, Mediterranean sea, and white walls-architecture, and linking it to the diachronic consistency of climate and natural landscape across the Mediterranean area, the adherents to the most foreign-inspired modernist trend—rationalist architecture—could thus construct, <i>a posteriori</i>, a most convenient national-natural foundation for their daring architectural choices. Modern architecture was projected to be a natural outgrowth <i>of</i> Mediterranean climate and that had always been there in the combination of solar whiteness and <i>sezione aurea</i> (Golden section), characterizing even the so-called spontaneous architecture of Mediterranean islands. But was <i>mediterraneità </i>anything more than a politically convenient strategy for carving a vital space for the avant-garde under Fascism, while at the same time continuing to feed the cultural mill of <i>Italian-ness</i>? Did, for example, Malaparte-Libera's architectural masterpiece in Capri, or the <i>villa Oro</i> (Golden villa) by Luigi Cosenza in Naples, share substantial traits with both the centuries-old spontaneous architecture of the Corricella harbor in the island of Procida and the "marine landscapes" that became a statistically relevant reality of Italian-modernist painting in the second half of the 1930s? (Vescovo 20). </p>

<p> To these questions, Belli's friend Edoardo Persico responded throughout the 1930s from the pages of the influential journal <i>Casabella</i> with a resounding "no." For Persico the idea of <i>mediterraneità </i>was as vague, rhetorical, and banal as its more official and conservative counterparts such as <i>romanità, latinità, italianità. </i>Worse still, a serious brand of Latin-Mediterranean modernist architecture existed, but not in Italy. It was, of course, Le Corbusier's (Danesi 25). Surely Persico's opinion was just one. But even if one were to connect more architectural and artistic dots than he was prepared to recognize as avant-garde, would the <i>mediterraneità </i>of Italian rationalism and metafisica amount to much more than a certain suggestion of the naturalness of the classic, an idea of natural purity distilled from the sea and bathed in light, an abstract genealogy without the burden of history? Where, in other words, was the "modern" element in this Mediterranean-ness? This question was never addressed by Persico, nor by champions of Mediterranean-ness such as Rava and Belli, nor has it been pursued by later historians, maybe because the answer lies elsewhere from where <i>mediterraneità </i>was discursively constructed or opposed in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Maybe—this is the suggestion this paper will make—<i> mediterraneità</i> had been an improbable part of the avant-garde, least likely to elaborate a Mediterranean imaginary: Marinetti's Futurism. </p>

<p>At first sight nothing could be conceived as more antithetical to <i>mediterraneità </i>than a movement with its center in the northern cities of Milan and Paris, one made of <i>modernolatria</i> (idolatry of modernity) and using the destruction of all forms of <i>passatismo </i>(past-ism) as its battle-cries for over three decades of cultural activity. Yet, we could begin by noting that Futurism's undisputed leader, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, was born in the quintessentially Mediterranean city of Alexandria, Egypt, that he once 

<b></b>

 affirmed that he felt more "Neapolitan" than Italian, that he spent long periods of time on the island of Capri, in front of Naples, and that the first futurist manifesto was published in Naples four days before it appeared in <i>Le ro</i>. Coupled with the capillary dissemination that Futurism achieved in Southern Italy in the interwar period, these facts about Marinetti's biography have led scholars such as Claudia Salaris to propose that, in time, the Mediterranean came to constitute the counter-polarity to the "idolatry of modernity" and "destructive tendencies" characteristic of early futurism, thereby allowing the movement to acquire a more "solar" (or sun-inspired) and "constructive" character in the 1920s and '30s .<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  For Salaris, then, Futurism came to share the same passion for the solar oriented that united the modernist chorus singing the praises of <i>mediterraneità </i>under Fascism. </p>

<p>This article wishes to expand upon Solaris's pioneering work by highlighting some key contributions by Southern Italian futurists to the development of the movement before and during fascism, by reframing such polarities as those of a Northern-destructive avant-garde phase in the 1910s and a Southern-constructive one in the 1920s and '30s. I wish to propose, first, that instead of invoking successive spatial-temporal phases, we should think of this polarity as constitutive and as internal to a Mediterranean imaginary that Futurism developed from its inception and nourished until its very end. This is attested to by the founding of the journal <i>Mediterraneo futurista</i> as late as 1938. Second, I want to show that this polarity should not be identified with culturalized nature as in the customary opposition of a solar-constructive South over and against a cold-destructive North. Instead it should be thought of as a transration of the Latin notions of <i>emporium</i> and <i>imperium</i>. </p>

<p>Rather than referring to something essentially or naturally Mediterranean, these terms denoted the Mediterranean as a quintessentially urban space, and simultaneously connoted it as a civilization characterized by exchange- and impact-driven modes of encounter with the other.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Originally, the Latin <i>Emporium </i>translated the Greek term <i>emporion</i>, which was the general term designating colonial trading posts that Greek city-states had established along the Mediterranean coasts. In Roman times, however, <i>emporium</i> expanded to designate new trading towns built not only along the Mediterranean coast, but also on the banks of rivers that connected the Mediterranean to the interior lands of the Empire. <i>Emporium</i> also comprised larger cities established for the specific purpose of trading. It thus captured the idea that the cultural continuity in Greco-Roman civilization was centered on a metaphorical trans-regional expansion of medi-terranean-ness—literally 'in between lands'—rather than just designating a purely maritime space of exploration and settlement. In this way, <i>emporium</i> came to signify the centrality of exchange and the in-between-ness of land and sea in the Roman Empire. In fact, in Roman times, the term '<i>mediterraneaum</i>' was used only as an adjective to indicate 'being in the middle of lands' while the sea we call the Mediterranean was instead called <i>mare magnum, mare nostrum, mare internum, </i>or <i>mare intestium</i>.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Similarly, the idea of Roman <i>imperium</i> had expanded from a temporary military title in Republican Rome to become the idea that Rome ruled the Mediterranean space more by the attraction it exercised over conquered people to become culturally Roman, than by brute coercion.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Futurism, of course, did not seek to conquer lands or establish trading posts, nor did it claim any Roman ancestry, but its cultural politics oscillate between the imaginary poles of <i>emporium </i>and <i>imperium</i>, precisely because these notions not only restore a certain historical depth to the futurist imaginary; these two terms also suggest that a deep level of resonance between futurist and fascist imaginaries was in place from the beginning of the movement prior to involvement in the Great War. The search for an <i>imperium</i> expanding over the cultural field of the avant-garde can thus be seen as connecting Futurist "rhetorics of virility"—to use Barbara Spackman's fortunate phrase —with <i>modernolatria</i> (idolatry of the machine-age) and the love of war, "the world's sole hygiene." The latter slogan used by Marinetti and company identified the futurists not only with a three-pronged cultural struggle against all forms of <i>passatismo</i> (passeism), but also with the Italian right to seek Great Nation status by building a Mediterranean Empire after Mussolini's ascent to power (Gentile 47). On the other hand, the futurist drive towards <i>emporium</i> is eloquently exemplified by the unique projection of this movement towards breaking down all barriers and opening up exchange between avant-garde aesthetics and mass media communication, as well as between high art and commercial-art expressions under Fascism. Yet, what is most remarkable and least obvious is that the very formation of this imaginary polarity between <i>emporium </i>and <i>imperium </i>belongs to the earliest phase of the movement's history, in particular, to the poetic work of Marinetti. </p>

<p>As is well known, the announced birth of Futurism by Marinetti in <i>Mafarka </i> and the founding <i>Manifesto </i>of 1910 remained without a proper poetic theorization or realization, until a series of three manifestos for over two years: the <i>Manifesto tecnico della letteratura futurista </i>(Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature) in 1912, <i>Immaginazione senza fili. Distruzione della sintassi. Parole in libertà </i>(Imagination without Wires. Destruction of Syntax. Words in Freedom) in 1913, and <i>Lo Splendore geometrico e meccanico e la sensibilità numerica </i>(Geometrical and Mechanical Splendor and the Numerical Sensibility) in 1914. These declarations defined for the whole movement the connections between the liberation of poetic language from syntax, and the abolition of the poetic "I" in favor of a poetry dominated by unbridled chains of analogies, along with the sensory charging of the sign with visual, aural and even tactile resonances. Furthermore, in each of these manifestos, Marinetti presented the futurist revolution in poetics as the expression of a dynamism and simultaneity intrinsic to the experience of modernity, and, hence, as the mark of distinction of futurism from all other avant-gardes. Yet, a look at the first and most well known expression of Marinetti's words in freedom, <i>Zang Tumb Tuuum,</i> composed in 1912 and published in 1914, reveals that the connection between futurism, modernity, and the destruction of syntax theorized in Marinetti's manifestos on poetry, owed as much to the imagery of Mediterranean-ness as to that of the machine or of masculine self-generation.  </p>

<p>In <i>Zang Tumb Tuuum</i> futurist poetry is not "BORN" of a phallic self-generation, as in <i>Mafarka</i>, or from a car crash, as in the first manifesto, but during a slow train ride through Southern Italy (Calabria and Sicily) somewhere between the devastating earthquake of Messina and the "petrified lava" of the Etna (<i>Selected Poems</i> 57–59). 

<b></b>

 In this key respect, <i>Zang Tumb Tuuum </i>recorded an evolution of Marinetti's poetic that can best be seen by looking at Marinetti's early texts such as "La Conquête des Étoiles" (The Conquest of the Stars<i>, </i>1902) and "Destruction" (Destruction<i>, </i>1903), and comparing them to his last pre-words-in-freedom text, "Le Monoplan du Pape" (The Pope's Monoplane<i>,</i> 1912). While in the first composition the poet invokes "the Sovereign Sea" (<i>Selected Poems</i> 13) and in the second the "Almighty Sea" (<i>Selected Poems</i> 21) to deliver his poetic language from its enslavement "to the ideal," the free verses of "The Pope's Monoplane" allow him to encounter from on high "the Dark African wind" and engage—for over twenty pages—in an imaginary duel with the Sicilian Volcano Etna while flying, to quote Marinetti: "Over Sicily, the New Heart of Italy" (<i>Selected Poems</i>, 48).  </p>

<p>At the level of imagery, then, <i>Zang Tumb Tuuum</i> was both continuous with Marinetti's pre-futurist work and registered an evolution in the Futurist imaginary that had been long in the making, that was no longer centered on the sea but on the volcano as the principal cipher of Mediterranean-ness and key poetic analog of futurist poetics. In fact, within a year from the publication of <i>Zang Tumb Tuuum</i>, Marinetti would make the analogy even more clear by speaking of Futurism as "that great mass of incandescent metals that we have extracted with our bare hands from the depths of a volcano" (<i>Teoria e invenzione</i> 267). Entering the futurist universe in 1912, the image of the volcano thus came to iconize the<i> imperium </i>pole of futurist Mediterranean-ness and flourished well into the 1920s as evident in Marinetti's 1927 play "Prigionieri e vulcani" ("Prisoners and Volcanoes") and the 1929 futurist journal <i>Vulcani</i>. In the process, however, the geographical center of futurist imaginary gradually shifted from the Sicilian Etna to the Neapolitan Vesuvius, as graphically testified by the words-in-freedom portraits of Marinetti and the Neapolitan poet, Francesco Cangiullo, published by Marietta Angelini in the Neapolitan review <i>Vela Latina</i> in 1918 [<a href="#1">res 1</a> &amp; 2]. Aside from identifying Marinetti as a "Vesuvian brain," this double portrait captured the deeper process of "Neapolitanization"—to cite Ardenigo Soffici's polemical definition—that Futurism and its leader had undergone during the war-years.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  </p>

<p>This is not the place for a discussion of the recurrent tensions between Northern and Southern futurists, and the recurring distinction between <i>marinettismo</i> and <i>futurismo</i> resulting from splintering factions in the movement. But, we should not hesitate to recognize that Soffici's disparaging comment contained an undeniable kernel of truth. Between 1912 and 1916 the friendship, patronage, and collaboration between Marinetti and the young Neapolitan poet Francesco Cangiullo had grown beyond all proportions and the understanding of most futurists.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In fact, numerous references to Cangiullo appear in key manifestos by Marinetti, such as the "Manifesto del teatro di varietà" ("Manifesto of the Variety Theatre," 1913), the "Manifesto della recitazione sinottica e dinamica" ("Manifesto of Synoptic and Dynamic Recitation," 1916), and the "Manifesto del teatro della sorpresa" ("Manifesto of the Theatre of Surprise," 1924). These statements chart Marinetti's genuine and strategic turn away from reconnecting words in freedom to the <i>lyrical </i>and the <i>poetic </i>as advocated by Soffici, and mark his move instead towards the "contamination" of futurist poetics with forms of popular culture absorbed primarily from Southern Italy.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>Marinetti visited Naples for the first time in 1908, but it was not until 1910 that he encountered there the younger poet Francesco Cangiullo.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  As we shall see in a moment, the gravitation of Futurism from <i>imperium </i>towards <i>emporium</i> owed much to the friendship between Marinetti and Cangiullo and the impact of the latter on his <i>maestro </i>as well as the whole movement. At first, though, this friendship also meant for Marinetti a personal involvement with Naples that led him to visit the island of Capri in 1914, and later to choose it for his honeymoon site with Benedetta.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The encounter with Capri produced its most direct poetic effects in the development of Marinetti's erotic novels, a genre that would comprise not only the many narrations of Marinetti's conquests of women in <i>Come si seducono le donne</i> (<i>How to Seduce Women</i>) of 1916, <i>L'alcova d'acciaio </i>(<i>The Steel Alcove</i>) of 1921, and <i>Scatole d'amore in conserva</i> (<i>Love in Tin Cans</i>) of 1927, but also<i> L'isola dei baci </i>(<i>The Island of Kisses</i>), an "erotic-social" novel, written with Bruno Corra in 1918. This novel takes place entirely in Capri, but, rather than focusing on Marinetti's conquests, it stages a confrontation between the futurist poet and the homosexual members of the "Pink Congress." In the text, Pink Congress is identified with all the typical crimes of <i>passatismo</i>: from the pacifist condemnation of war, to the call for full financing of archeological digs, to the "establishment of Schools of Slowness, Indecision, and Delicacy in order to heal humanity from the pest of Speed".  </p>

<p>Surely the novel's antigay sarcasm demonstrates the perfect harmony between futurist rhetorics of virility and the Mediterranean imaginary that Futurism was forging 

<b></b>

 during the war years. But, more to the point, the novel staged the Pink Congress in the "mellifluous" and "picturesque" waters of the blue grotto, while identifying the poet, "wearing his grey-green uniform" with the island's "volcanic rocks" that reminded him of the war theatre of the "Carso" . In so doing, <i>L'isola dei baci</i> effectively reified the evolution of futurist poetics described above into a polarization between past-loving sea and futurist lava. The analogical chain of associations linking Futurism to volcanoes, to Vesuvius, to volcanic rocks, and to the manly seduction of women, thus found its war-like completion in the image of Capri-Carso. It would therefore be but a small step for Marinetti to describe the island in a perfect <i>imperium </i>style as a "geological and plastic summary of our peninsula and race," and as "a piece of that volcanic peer that once connected Europe to Africa"  in a 1922 keynote address at a conference held in Capri. While capping the metaphorical expansion of a futurist <i>imperium</i> by identifying futurists with the whole Italian race, this image anticipated Mussolini's famous description of the Italian peninsula, on the eve of the Ethiopian campaign, as a natural aircraft carrier projected towards the Northern shores of Mediterranean Africa. And yet, it is in this same 1922 text that we can also capture the traces of a futurist imaginary seeking to counterbalance its own drive toward <i>imperium </i>with a more open attitude of <i>emporium</i>, that is, one featuring an active engagement with and transration of popular forms of Mediterranean culture. </p>

<p>Having developed the analogical chain of Capri-Italy-Futurism by identifying the island's rocks as "Italian," that is, "rebellious, lyrical, and revolutionary like futurist art," Marinetti proceeded to present the island as a "<i>varietà</i>" (a variety theatre), in which the natural elements (the sun, the rocks, the moon, the sea) "mimicked" futurist paintings, theatre, and poetry (36–40). Far from being merely casual, this image of Capri-<i>varietà </i>gestured explicitly towards the key contribution of Neapolitan Futurism to the transration of the Variety Theatre into a futurist Theatre of Surprise. Marinetti had explicitly praised the variety theatre in a manifesto published in 1913, which began by exalting the Parisian tradition of variety theatres, and explicitly that of the <i>Folies-Bergère,</i> for all the usual futurist reasons: its dynamism, <i>antipassatismo</i>, and anticipation of the futurist sensibility destined to become dominant. In the last part of the manifesto, however, Marinetti had prescribed the need for Futurism to "destroy all logic in variety spectacles" and "abolish the Parisian <i>Revues</i>" by introducing "surprise effect[s]" (88–89). In this way, the "Manifesto del teatro di varietà" had registered the theorization of the principle of <i>la trovata</i> (surprise effect) in Francesco Cangiullo's poetic work of 1912–1913. It also anticipated the application of this effect to the theatre by Cangiullo and Marinetti themselves in the "Manifesto del Teatro della Sorpresa" published just a few months before Marinetti's keynote speech in Capri.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  The composite image of Capri-Futurism-<i>teatro di varietà</i> thus pointed to a new and very different analogic series from that of Futurism-war-Carso projected by <i>L'isola dei baci</i>. It identified Futurism with the absorption of the popular-cultural heritage of the Neapolitan <i>trovata</i>. </p>

<p>In so doing, it also registered the impact of Marinetti's intense collaboration with Cangiullo during and immediately after the war. This collaboration had begun in 

<b></b>

 1910 with Cangiullo's participation in the first futurist soirée in Naples. From that date onwards, Cangiullo had become Marinetti's man in Naples as well as one of the most active animators of the futurist soirées.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Cangiullo's pre-futurist experience as a composer of Neapolitan pop songs, musical motifs for the lively café-chantants of the city, and as a creator of comic sketches for the local variety theatres put him in an ideal position to create an osmotic channel of communication between the "high" art of futurist avant-gardism and the "low" culture of Neapolitan gesticulation, scurrility, and crass humor.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  As a consequence of this role, Cangiullo has remained a somewhat belittled re in the movement, suffering from the negative judgment of temporary futurists such as Soffici, who regarded him as a major danger to Futurism, and as the principal cause for Marinetti's betrayal of the movement.  </p>

<p>To be sure, authoritative scholars such as John White and Willard Bohn have rendered justice more recently to the originality of Cangiullo's contributions to the development of futurist visual poetry, while making his poetic work known to the English-speaking public.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  But although Cangiullo's poetic compositions <i>Piedigrotta </i>, <i>Caffeconcerto: alfabeto a sorpresa</i> (The Surprise Alphabet<i>, </i>1916), and <i>Poesia Pentagrammata</i> (Pentagrammatical Poem, 1918) were important for pushing futurist poetics towards their pictorial and onomatopoeic limits, the historical role played by Cangiullo in the evolution of the whole movement has remained largely unexplored. This oversight may have been caused by the fact that Canguillo's role has not been fully appreciated through synthetically assessing his activities as theatrical playwright, impresario, and theoretician after the war.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In 1921, Cangiullo set up a futurist theatrical company designed to perform a whole new style of futurist theatre, which Cangiullo called <i>Teatro della sorpresa </i>(Theatre of Surprise) and theorized in the homonymous manifesto written with Marinetti in the same year. Among all of the futurist manifestos, this document may be one of the most remarkable for its theoretical insights. Marinetti-Cangiullo began by expanding the scope of the manifesto of Variety Theatre through proposing that the highest value for a work of art was its "surprise value," that is, "the effect of wonder produced by the first viewing of a painting or a fresco." This value, they claimed, was clearly the highest one for both artists and patrons in the past, if "as we all know, so many frescoes and paintings were covered up by new ones because they had lost their surprise value" due to both "ritual" viewing and "reproduction" in different media.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  In this day and age, the authors continued, it has become so difficult to surprise people due to the multiplication of reproductive techniques, that a "theatre of surprise" may be needed simply to reintroduce surprise value in our lives.  </p>

<p>Marinetti and Cangiullo then spelled out the combined three goals of the theatre of surprise as follows: first, to conceive of "surprise" always in a specific relation to the audience encountered; second, to organize the performance in such a way as to produce a concatenation of comical ideas that would draw the audience into the spectacle; and, finally, to extend the surprise effect into the streets of the city. Most importantly, the primary goal of the futurist theatre of surprise was to bring together and to mix popular forms of entertainment, such as "magicians," "illusionists," and "athletes" with 

<b></b>

 all forms of futurist art: from the performance of synthetic theatrical pieces, to the synoptic declamations of poetry, to the exhibition of painting and sculptures, to the distribution among the audience of the "tactile tables" just invented by Marinetti, to the improvisation of "musical dialogues between two pianos," and even to the inclusion of a "theatrical news section on futurist activities" . </p>

<p>Clearly, in the <i>Teatro della Sorpresa</i> we encounter a proper futurist <i>emporium</i>: a warehousing of the popular art form of the Neapolitan <i>varietà</i> that absorbs futurist art-forms and gives them a proper space of commercial exhibition, while at the same time enacting all the prescriptions that Marinetti had wished for in the manifesto of the Variety Theatre, including the gluing of chairs and the selling of ten tickets per seat.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Unfortunately, however, over ten years after its explosion upon the stage of the avant-garde, Futurism was no longer a novelty, and its capacity to surprise was very limited indeed. As the surviving chronicles and other texts about these novel futurist soirées amply testify, the "surprise value" of the theatrical pieces was more often than not ridiculed by both audience and critics.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  To give just an example, the two pieces of which Cangiullo was most proud were entitled "Non c'è un Cane" ("There is Not Even a Dog Here"), and "Luce" ("Light"). In both pieces, the <i>trovata</i> consisted in representing the gap between the literal and the idiomatic value of their titles: in the former, a dog was made to cross the stage from right to left, and then the curtain was dropped. In Italian, however, "<i>there is not even a dog here</i>" means "nobody is there"—the joke-<i>trovata</i> being that in fact a dog was on stage, however briefly! As for "Luce," this was the exclamation that one would sometime hear in a theatre at the beginning of a theatrical performance or film if management forgot to turn off the lights. Cangiullo's piece entailed a completely darkened theatre and, after a good ten minutes, if the audience had not done it yet, a couple of actors in the audience starting to shout "light." As the shouting multiplied over several minutes and reached a climax, suddenly the lights on the stage would be turned on and after a minute the curtain would come down . . . amidst further shouts of the audience asking for their money back. </p>

<p>Whether written by Cangiullo or Marinetti, these surprise pieces amounted to little more than smart plays on idiomatic expressions, and, what's worse, their reproduction in the chronicles of the newspapers destroyed their surprise value altogether. Within a few weeks after the first performance, almost everybody in Italy knew that members of the orchestra would sit among the audience, that a few members of the audience would be sold the same seat in the theatre so as to initiate a rouse, and that at least one seat in the theatre would be spread with glue. Newspapers even reported that the first ten rows of the theatres were always empty because people knew part of the action would take place there, and sought to reinstate the barrier between actors and audience. But, predictably, the value of this form of theatre did not reside for Marinetti and company in its adherence to its manifesto, nor in its ability to truly surprise its audience.  </p>

<p>It was the cultural <i>lowering </i>of the <i>high-sounding</i> Marinetti-Futurism that the audience came to watch. In this form of theatre, it was the audience that played the part of the provocateur, often preventing the actors from finishing their synthetic acts, and, at the end of the spectacle, waiting for them outside to escort them to their hotel, thereby 

<b></b>

 offering a self-conscious and original rendition of the third principle of the theatre of surprise. Rather than breaking the boundaries between actors and audience, the theatre of surprise ended up inverting their places, with the latter, acting according to a script written in the pages of the newspapers. For the Futurists, however, a series of more important consolations were in store. In the first place, thanks to the "surprise" of doubling the prices for the third gallery seats, and offering the best seats at half price, these futurist spectacles did manage to break even and had an impact on the social composition of the audience by democratizing it. Second, unlike the evenings of the 1910s, the theatrical evenings of the surprise theatre were generally attended by an audience that while booing and even coming to blows with the futurists, remained until the end of the spectacle, or beyond. In such a futurist <i>emporium,</i> there would always be something that in the end each spectator would appreciate.  </p>

<p>Cangiullo's <i>Teatro della sorpresa</i> lasted only two years, but remarkably, Marinetti attended every single performance, knowing full well that his presence was the key to electrify the atmosphere. It is not without its sad tinge of irony that at the end of the second tournée, in 1924, Cangiullo would not only leave the company but also publicly dissociate himself from Futurism, because he believed that the movement had exhausted its "surprise value."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  The irony—not lost on Cangiullo who reconnected with Marinetti in the mid-1930s—was that by 1924 the Cangiullian principle of the <i>trovata</i> had made its mark on the whole of Futurism, especially on that part of the movement that was bent on destroying the boundary between high art and mass communication, especially on the Calabrian futurist Enzo Benedetto, who translated Cangiullo's idea into a manifesto entitled "L'arte della reclame" ("The Art of Advertizing"). In "L'Arte della reclame" Benedetto argued that the bourgeois era of the painting had ended and was being replaced by that of the advertising poster. This, however, he considered a much higher form of art than the former, because "while [painting] depended only on the inspiration of the artist," the latter was much harder because "dependant on a commission and the ability of the artist to translate it into a <i>trovata,</i>" a surprise effect . Although no futurist painter ever abandoned completely the easel for the street wall, Benedetto's manifesto on behalf of the advertising poster correctly interpreted the commercial road towards <i>emporium</i> that most futurists had embarked upon in the early 1930s when the avant-garde status and revolutionary zeal of the movement had long been exhausted, even as <i>mediterraneità </i>had become the common discursive denominator for all modernist movements.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  In fact, with the growth of the anti-modernist fascist front in the mid-1930s, <i>mediterraneità </i>had not only become an ideological point of conjunction across the whole fascist-modernist spectrum in Italy, but also its own aesthetic form of expression in what we can properly term "exhibition art." </p>

<p>Fascism of course did not invent the art of designing thematic exhibitions, nor did it develop a specifically "Mediterranean" exhibition-style. But as Marla Stone has documented, in the 1930s Fascism gave more space and attention to the organization of mass cultural exhibitions than any other regime either democratic or totalitarian ever did . In addition, exhibitions came to counterbalance the excessive ritualization of public life in the second half of the decade.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The exhibition of every aspect of 

<b></b>

 the socio-economic workings of the corporate state—from the extraction and use of Italian minerals to the establishment of summer camps for children—represented for the regime much more than a means of propaganda. Fascist exhibitions hardly aimed at solidifying consensus or collective identity, but rather at stimulating an ever-waning enthusiasm by seeking to communicate to the visitor a synaesthetic feeling of absolute <i>distinction</i> directly derived from futurist poetics of virility.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  On the other hand, the extraordinary effort poured by the regime into this area triggered a veritable boom in commercial fairs, or emporia with exhibitions dedicated to every aspect of design and exhibition culture itself. By the mid-1930s, Italian modernist artists and architects spent most or their time and talent designing pavilions, advertising campaigns, and commodities.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  And here, in the commercialized exhibition form <i>per se</i>, the Mediterranean imaginary cultivated by the whole modernist front under Fascism, found the perfect means to bring together <i>imperium </i>and <i>emporium</i>, to recall the words of influential architecture critic Mario Pagano.  </p>

<p>Writing in the special number of his journal, <i>Casabella</i>, dedicated to a comparison between Italian and European exhibition-culture, Pagano—who was anything but an uncritical sponsor of Italian-ness—affirmed that Italian exhibition-art had bypassed all others in Europe because it had accomplished "a futurist synthesis of novecentismo and razionalismo," which consisted in bringing together two apparently contradictory tendencies . On the one hand, under Fascism, exhibitions had been entrusted to the vision of single "architect-painters," who expressed the idea of <i>imperium</i> through the "exaltation of 'pure' values that ignore practical considerations in order to attempt an affirmation of style in the most lyrical sense of the word" . On the other hand, Pagano added, this idea of "style" without adjectives had expressed itself in the commodified <i>emporium</i> field of "advertisement architecture" much better than in the political exhibitions organized by the regime. Thus, writing retrospectively in 1941, Pagano favorably compared the futurist-rationalist experimentations in purely <i>emporium</i> exhibitions such as the <i>Mostra nazionale della moda </i>(National Exhibition of Fashion, 1933) or the <i>Mostra del poster e della pubblicità commerciale </i>(Exhibition of the Poster and the Commercial Advertisement, 1936), to the more compromised and rhetorical collaborations in those exhibitions, such as the <i>Mostra augustea della romanità </i>(Exhibition of Augustus's Rome, 1937) in which the regime had explicitly celebrated its right to <i>imperium</i>. And yet, it was precisely in the last political exhibition, the <i>Mostra delle terre d'oltremare </i>(Exhibition of African Colonies) organized by the regime in Naples in 1940, that we can find the most mature expression of Futurism's Mediterranean imaginary. </p>

<p>The intentions of the fascist Party, which initially commissioned it, the <i>Mostra delle terre d'oltremare </i>(MTO) were to celebrate the fascist Empire, through a display of both historical and symbolic effects that would trace the Italian right to <i>imperium </i>from Roman times to the present. The architectural prominence of the PNF tower and the six pavilions dedicated to the documentation of the Italian expansion in the Mediterranean were an eloquent reminder of these intentions [<a href="#3">re 3</a>]. </p>

<p>But, if one compares the actual space covered by the permanent-symbolic installations—sixty rooms in total—with the one hundred and fifty temporary or semi-permanent 

<b></b>

 installations aimed at documenting the economic activities connected to this expansion throughout Italy and the <i>terre d'oltremare</i> (a euphemism for Italian colonies), the impression one receives is instructive. It becomes apparent that this exhibition was much closer to the <i>Fiere del levante, </i>the commercial fairs held annually in Bari, than to political events such as the Autarchic exhibition of Italian minerals held the year before in Rome.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  In other words, an exhibition that was explicitly aimed at celebrating and legitimizing the Roman origins of fascist <i>imperium</i>, ended up documenting Fascism's debt to the commodity-bound Mediterranean imaginary cultivated by Futurism for over two decades. It was in fact in its overall design that the MTO came to express and consolidate the futurist notion of Mediterranean-ness in the arrangement of an "architettura a sorpresa" (surprise architecture) in which the organizers themselves identified explicitly the guiding criterion of the exhibition's aesthetics.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> </p>

<p>It is surprising how the official architectural style of the regime, <i>stile littorio</i>, which dominated the entrance to the expo, gave way in the surrounding areas to a mixture of architectural styles without precedent in the history of regime exhibitions.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  These ranged from the daring rationalist theater of masses designed by the twenty-six year old Neapolitan architect Giulio De Luca [<a href="#4">re 4</a>] to the orientalist "Marco Polo Tower" designed by Vittorio Calza Bini [<a href="#5">re 5</a>].  </p>

<p>Also surprising were the number of pavilions  dedicated to all aspects of Mediterranean production and consumption that were built behind the symbolic center of the exhibition by another young Neapolitan architect, Stefania Filo Speziale. Among them was the celebrated pavilion dedicated to the electrotechnical industry decorated by futurist master Enrico Prampolini [<a href="#6">re 6</a>]. In addition, there were purely <i>emporium </i>pavilions, such as, the "Torre pubblicitaria" (advertising tower), and the other two towers that contained the exhibition of fashion, and one of tourism. Above all, however,

<p class="continued">

 the surprise effect was captured in the urban planning of the exhibition itself, which envisioned an entertainment park, a zoo with several green areas and houses, and a spectacular <i>funicolare</i>—suspended cable-car—connecting the MTO with the top of Naples' Posillipo hill [<a href="#7">re 7</a>]. </p>

<p>Much more like a theme-park or a modern mall than a thematic exhibition, the whole planning of the MTO was dominated by a concern for the valorization of the tourist potential of the area in which it was built—hence the <i>funicolare</i>, the terrace on top of the PNF tower, and the restaurant-Olympic swimming-pool complex designed by Naples' foremost futurist master, Carlo Cocchia. Alongside the "international" commercial input, however, stood also the discordant desire to offer a <i>una faccia una razza</i> (one face one race) and an <i>Italiani brava gente</i> (Italians, good folks) version of fascist colonization.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Hence there were innumerable ethnic spectacles of African dances and music, and the ever present delegations of imperial subjects in local costume roaming around the exhibition, in order to produce in the visitor a "living experience of the Mediterranean man"—as an advertising pamphlet put it.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The MTO, we might summarize, adapted Marinetti's image of Capri as a geological bridge between Europe and Africa to the whole Italian peninsula, thereby projecting the notion of the fascist Mediterranean as both an extension of the fatherland—one destined to live and die with it—and an hinterland between the real north and the deep African south to which the exhibition dedicated various pavilions. At least, this seems the message we still receive today from the only surviving decoration of the exhibition: Prampolini's plaster mural situated on the north side of Cocchia's restaurant. This work literalized and simultaneously inverted Marinetti's image of Capri as a "piece of that peer that once connected Europe to Africa" by shaping the African continent—represented to the left of the quintessentially Mediterranean image of dancing natives, white and black—as the Capri he had loved and depicted over and over in the 1920s [Compare res <a href="#8">8</a> and <a href="#9">9</a>]. </p>

<p>In identifying Africa with Capri, Prampolini closed the analogic chain of Mediterranean links that Marinetti initiated in his early poetry, at last, identifying <i>imperium </i>with <i>emporium</i>. It would be misleading, though, to read in this picture any conscious or latent anti-imperialist message. And yet, one cannot escape the impression that it not only summarized the Mediterranean imaginary that Futurism cultivated before and during the regime, but also foreshadowed its survival into the postcolonial culture that in the postwar era has constructed Italy as the emporium of Mediterranean-ness.

Fascism and modernism: finding the "big picture"
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p id="lead">

Researchers combing through back numbers of this journal in search of authoritative guidance to the relationship between modernity, modernism, and fascism could be forgiven for occasionally losing their bearings. In one of the earliest issues they will alight upon Emilio Gentile's article tracing the paternity of early Fascism to the campaign for a "modernist nationalism" which was launched in the 1900s by Italian avant-garde artists and intellectuals fanatical about providing the catalyst to a national program of radical modernization.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  They will also come across the eloquent case made by Peter Fritzsche for the thesis that there was a distinctive "Nazi modern," that the Third Reich embodied an extreme, uncompromising form of political modernism, a ruthless bid to realize an alternative vision of modernity whatever the human cost.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  But closer to the present they will encounter Lutz Koepnik's sustained argument that the aesthetics of fascism reflected its aspiration "to subsume everything under the logic of a modern culture industry, hoping to crush the emancipatory substance of modern life through modern technologies themselves" . Yet more disorienting is Jessica Burstein's attempt to show that the recurrence of the "prosthetic body" in the <i>imaginaire </i>of Wyndham Lewis and Ernst Jünger is the fruit of fascism's "prosthetic imagination", which is in turn the product of a "cold modernism" intrinsically violent and destructive (139, 158). 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>This article offers an unapologetically "big" picture of the dynamics of (Western) modernity within which to locate fascism's intimate kinship with a full-blooded modernism that by the inter-war period offered a wide range of variations on the theme of cultural regeneration as a way out of otherwise terminal decadence. Certainly, to rush into the pages of  offering a panoramic view of such difficult and contested terrain would be foolhardy indeed if it were done in defiance, or in simple ignorance, of the sustained postmodernist critique of meta-narratives. It should thus be stressed at the outset that what follows is not to be construed as an attempt to lure unsuspecting readers onto a slippery slope leading inexorably towards a "totalizing" <i>grand récit</i>. True, this essay contains a blatant meta<i>-</i>narrative, but it is a self-consciously <i>reflexive </i>meta-narrative. It avoids the trap of essentialism by renouncing any claim to represent the definitive perspective on fascist modernity. Stripped of such delusions of grandeur it is reduced to the status of Max Weber's "ideal type." Its value is thus to be judged not by its intrinsic truth content, but how <i>useful</i> it is as a heuristic device to make sense of concrete empirical phenomena relating to the topic under discussion.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In order to embark on the construction of a synoptic but non-totalizing narrative of fascism's location within Western modernity it is first necessary to wrest the concept "modernism" from the narrow province of the history of art and of cultural history to which so many have confined it. Thus emancipated, it is free to embrace a wide range of innovative social and political projects extending far beyond the sphere of aesthetics and thought. Fortunately, such a dramatic expansion of the term's semantic scope can build on the success of parallel investigations into aspects of modernity carried out by a number of scholars, notably Modris Eksteins, Walter Adamson, Brandon Taylor, Peter Osborne, Peter Fritzsche, Peter Schleifer, Emilio Gentile, Mark Antliff, and Claudio Fogu. Moreover, my own formulation of a "maximalist" definition of modernism as a <i>reaction</i> (but a non-reactionary, <i>revolutionary</i> reaction) to Western "modernity" is, like theirs, posited on a reading of modernization as a process of disaggregation, fragmentation, and loss of transcendence with respect to premodern societies.  </p>

<p>Such an approach is consistent with canonical analyses of modernity offered by several pioneers of the new disciplines of sociology and social psychology whose diagnoses of contemporary history were themselves shaped by the age of high modernism, and hence by the drive to overcome the perceived forces of societal and spiritual decay. res who come to mind are Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, Friedrich Tönnies, Georg Simmel, Carl Jung, and Sigmund Freud. Their dire warnings about the fate of "the West" in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century have since been substantiated in a more sober analytical discourse by post-war social scientists such as Marshall Berman, David Harvey, Zygmunt Bauman, Frederic Jameson, and Anthony Giddens. Nevertheless, their recourse to evocative phrases such as "the vortex," "catastrophe," the "war on ambivalence," and "the disembedding of time and space" in their analyses of the impact of modernity, and of the concomitant spiritual crisis it provokes, point to a deep affinity with the "cultural pessimism" prevalent under high modernity. In his seminal book <i>The Condition of Postmodernity</i>, for example, David Harvey emphasizes the prescience with which Marx depicted modernization under capitalism as fostering 

<b></b>

 "individualism, alienation, fragmentation, ephemerality, innovation, creative destruction, [ . . . ] a shifting experience of space and time, as well as a crisis-ridden dynamic of social change" .  </p>

<p>There is, then, a high degree of expert consensus, past and present, that Western modernity can be identified—for heuristic purposes—with the breakdown of community, with the erosion of a "healthy" mental, physical, social, or spiritual dimension that endows its inhabitants with a higher, suprapersonal, but not necessarily supra-<i>historical</i>, significance. The nexus of degenerative processes that results, and which inevitably can be conceptualized in many contrasting ways by those who feel their very existence threatened by them, can be summed up for convenience in the single word "decadence." On this basis, modernism can be approached as a countervailing, <i>palingenetic</i><sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  response to this perceived decadence. It proposes panaceas to the "sickness" of the age that in their heterogeneity reflect the highly diverse diagnoses of the cause of the current malaise proposed by a particular current of modernism.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>   </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Epiphanic and programmatic modernism
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The concept of modernism that is emerging from these preliminary observations contains an amoeba-like point of division between two—once again ideal-typically constructed—categories of reaction to the mythic narrative of an accelerating decline or "fall" from a cohesive, supra-personally meaningful world postulated as existing "before modern times." In the first, the avant-garde artist or thinker is primarily concerned with achieving and articulating moments of integrating, "total" insight beyond the atomized perceptions and spiritually desiccated values that constitute the experiential stuff of modern life. These are moments that allow him or her to pierce the veils of illusion that condition "normal" experience, either thanks to a sudden insight into the sublime dimension lurking below (above?) the surface of everyday life, or because of a lightning flash of fearsome lucidity about the yawning void just beneath our feet.  </p>

<p>In this mode of modernism, the heterogeneous rebellion against modernity that it embodies—of which the "revolt against positivism"<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  is only one strand—is thus mainly confined to aesthetic, intellectual, religious, and spiritual quests, articulated in both literature and painting, for ephemeral experiences of "moments of being."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In such "moments," which Marcel Proust described as "privileged"—however much they remain of a this-worldly, monistic variety—the linear, "dead" time of <i>chronos</i> measured by the clock is phenomenologically suspended and replaced by a transcendent temporality explored by Frank Kermode under the heading of <i>kairos</i>. Outstanding instances of this mode of modernism are to be found in the prose works of Franz Kafka, James Joyce, Robert Musil, and Luis Borges, as well as the paintings of Van Gogh and Franz Marc. </p>

<p>A quite different face of modernism manifests itself when the creative <i>élan</i> towards a higher <i>subjectively </i>perceived plane of existence becomes sufficiently intense to break free from the modern "slough of despond" altogether, and mutate into the sustained aspiration to create a new <i>objective</i>, external world, a new future premised on the radical rejection of and opposition to prevailing reality, a new era referred to by Kermode 

<b></b>

 as <i>aevum</i>. It is an aspiration articulated memorably by Friedrich Nietzsche when in the preface to his projected book, <i>The Will to Power</i>, he stressed the far-reaching <i>metapolitical</i>—and ultimately socio-political—goal of his radical philosophical critique of his age:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>For one should make no mistake about the meaning of the title that this gospel of the future wants to bear. "The Will to Power: Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values"—in this formulation a <i>countermovement</i> finds expression, regarding both principle and task; a <i>movement</i> that in some future will take the place of this perfect nihilism—but presupposes it, logically and psychologically, and certainly can come only after and out of it.</p>

<p class="continued">This socially transformative mode of modernism which acts as a "countermovement" to modernity construed as decadence—the central theme of Nietzsche's entire <i>oeuvre</i>—we propose to call "programmatic." It is this revolutionary permutation driven by the quest for an alternative modernity that was the subject of the catalogue to the exhibition on modernist design held in London in the spring of 2006. Its organizer, Christopher Wilk, characterized modernism as "a loose collection of ideas " covering a range of movements and styles in many countries, especially those flourishing in key cities in Germany and Holland, as well as in Paris, Prague, and, later, New York. He goes on: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>All these sites were stages for an espousal of the new and, often an equally vociferous rejection of history and tradition; a utopian desire to create a better world, to reinvent the world from scratch; an almost messianic belief in the power and potential of the machine and industrial technology. [ . . . ] All these principles were frequently combined with social and political beliefs (largely left-leaning) which held that art and design could, and should, transform society.</p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p>Given the axiomatic assumption of modernism's predominantly left-wing orientation articulated by Wilk, it is little wonder that fascist modernism was conspicuously underrepresented in the exhibition he organized when compared to its Bolshevik counterpart. In contrast, my article can be seen as an attempt to persuade cultural and political historians to treat fascism not as an oxymoron to be resolved or an aberration to be explained, but as a full-fledged, internally consistent variant of programmatic modernism. In doing so it aims to counteract the persistent reluctance to recognize in fascism a sustained drive towards an alternative modernity and towards a <i>revolutionary </i>futurity. This reluctance is epitomized in Wilk's allusion to "largely left-leaning" beliefs in the prospect of social transformation. It is a preconception that in the past has misled historians to treat right-wing modernism, or even right-wing modernity,<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  as deviations from the "true" path of human progress and emancipation.  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
The primordial roots of modernism
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Our exposition has so far been able to call on the corroborative evidence offered by a number of expert witnesses. The fresh element we now propose to introduce into the 

<b></b>

 conration of modernism's definitional components, however, is one that appears to have been neglected in most investigations of this subject. This is the universal, archetypally human, and hence profoundly <i>premodern </i>nature of the psychosocial forces driving the modernist rebellion against the status quo, especially when it takes the form of what Nietzsche called "creative destruction."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  By concentrating on this aspect we soon arrive at a concept of modernism directly parallel to the primordialist theories of nationalism that Anthony Smith contrasts with what he terms (somewhat confusingly in the present context) "modernist" ones.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  This approach claims that analyses of the dynamics of modernism will remain incomplete unless they give due weight to the role played by archetypal patterns of human mythopoeia. However historically recent and culture-specific the West's collective experience of contemporary history as a manifestation of decadence may be, the impulse to achieve either a new vision or a new social order so as to ward off the nihilism that is the corollary of this experience is not in the least modern. Instead, it is a psychological reflex or survival instinct "hard-wired" into the psycho-social make-up of <i>Homo sapiens sapiens</i>. </p>

<p>Essential to this necessarily speculative theory concerning the primordial matrix generating modernism is the premise that human reflexivity makes our species uniquely aware of personal mortality and the imminent prospect of death without transcendence. For the social anthropologist Peter Berger, the purpose of all human culture is to create a communal <i>nomos</i>, a sphere of custom- and ritual-based suprapersonal meaning. This is literally <i>vital</i> to provide shelter from the potentially lethal psychological and social consequences if life were to be stripped bare of any sort of artificial screen erected to conceal the brute facts of physiological existence and eventual non-existence. Within this perspective, culture thus reveals itself to be an elaborate <i>trompe l'oeil</i>, an integral component of the socially constructed stage-set on which the drama of all life is lived out at both the macro- and micro-levels of social being.  </p>

<p>Berger's metaphor for the painted scenery so essential to human existence is "the sacred canopy." Just as nature abhors a vacuum, so human beings are subliminally terrified of what he calls (after Emile Durkheim) "anomy," literally the loss of <i>nomos</i>—a totalizing, normative, meaning-giving worldview—that ensues once the world reveals itself to be devoid of suprapersonal value. The sacred canopy thus acts as "a shield against terror" (22, 27), against the horror of anomie, against fear of the void. Once it begins to be damaged or is threatened with being ripped to shreds by "culture-cidal" forces, ancient culture-healing and society-renewing reflexes are automatically set in motion that work to put in place a communal <i>nomos</i> and erect a repaired or <i>new</i> canopy of transcendent meaning.  </p>

<p>One well-documented example of how this largely subliminal reflex operated in premodern societies is the "revitalization movement." When a community entered a collective crisis in which traditional cosmological beliefs, ceremonies, and rites of passage<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  failed to guarantee cultural cohesion, the conditions were created for the emergence of a minority "break-away" movement whose members might eventually provide the nucleus of a new community and a new social order. In the classic triadic rite of passage the initiate moves from a "stable" situation through a <i>liminal </i>phase of 

<b></b>

 <i>predictable </i>transition and disaggregation to reach a new stable life-phase which brings closure to the process of change. In the case of a revitalization movement, however, society enters an open-ended <i>liminoid </i>situation whose resolution demands a new initiative to lead at least a segment of the original community into a newly constituted, newly <i>invented</i> society with a new <i>nomos</i>.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  The history of millenarianism in the Christianized world is teeming with examples of this generic phenomenon.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>   </p>

<p>It was thanks to the revitalization movement that a traditional society in profound crisis, instead of being destroyed or absorbed by a more powerful one, had the possibility of being reconstituted through internal regenerative mechanisms. If the instinctive self-healing mechanisms worked, a segment of humanity emerged once more with an intact shield against anomie provided by a new or significantly modified <i>nomos</i>, a new sacred canopy. Indeed, without repeated episodes of collective palingenesis, human societies and cultures would have been condemned either to total collapse or to total stasis. One recurrent hallmark of successful processes of social rebirth was the emergence of a <i>propheta</i>, a re credited with the supernatural powers of an inspired "charismatic" leader, who enabled his followers to complete the transition to a new order and put a final end to the decline. To do this meant presiding over a phase of "mazeway resynthesis," in other words, the elaboration of a world-view and ritual forged from both traditional and newly improvized, "invented" elements capable of supplying the new <i>nomos </i>of the embryonic community—a process of syncretism known to anthropologists as "ludic recombination."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The relevance of this phenomenon to our characterization of modernism is, I hope, self-evident. By the late 19th century the disenchanting, disembedding, atomizing effects of modernity had resulted in Europeanized societies entering a generalized and deepening nomic crisis, a liminoid condition of indefinite duration experienced reflexively by growing numbers of the Western intelligentsia and cultural avant-garde as "decadence." The result was a deepening mood of "cultural despair,"<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  of <i>fin-de-siècle</i>, of "the end of the age." Those artists predisposed to <i>epiphanic</i> modernism experimented with radical innovations in aesthetic form or content or both to express the anomic, liminoid character of prevailing modernity, only intermittently able to bear witness to the present of a hidden plane of higher reality disclosed in intense but tragically ephemeral "moments of being." Meanwhile, both artists and non-artists reacting to the crisis in the spirit of <i>programmatic</i> modernism carried out personal acts of "ludic recombination" to produce a new "mazeway" (a totalizing vision of redemption) which they hoped would find a wider public resonance and enable at least a spiritually enlightened segment of society to be led into a new social order. In doing so, some would take on the mantel of a latter-day <i>propheta</i>, more familiar as the "charismatic leader".  </p>

A maximalist ideal type of modernism

<p>Such reflections suggest that an ideal type of modernism can be formulated on the following lines: 

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p><i>MODERNISM is a generic term for a vast array of heterogeneous individual and collective initiatives undertaken in Europeanized societies in many spheres of cultural production, social activism, and political militancy from the mid-19</i><sup>th</sup><i> century onwards. Their common denominator lies in the bid to reinstate a sense of transcendent value, meaning, or purpose in order to reverse the Western culture's progressive loss of a homogeneous value system and overarching cosmology </i>(nomos)<i> caused by the secularizing and disembedding forces of modernization. The late 19th-century modernists' rebellion against contemporary modernity was shaped by innate predispositions of the human consciousness and mythopoeic faculty to create culture, to construct utopias, and to find a subjective access to a suprahuman temporality. This faculty is closely bound up with the need to belong to a community united by a shared culture which acts as a refuge from the potentially life-threatening fear of a personal death bereft of any sort of transcendence.  </i></p>
<p><i>	Modernism can assume an exclusively artistic expression, often involving extreme experimentation with new aesthetic forms conceived to express glimpses of a "higher reality" that throw into relief the anomie and spiritual bankruptcy of contemporary history </i>("epiphanic modernism"). <i>Alternatively, it can focus on the creation of a "new world", either through the capacity of art and thought to formulate a vision capable of revolutionizing society as a whole, or through the creation of new ways of living or an entire socio-political culture that will ultimately transform not just art, but humankind itself, or at least a chosen segment of it, under the leadership of a new elite </i><i>.</i><sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup></p>
	<div class="attrib">
	("programmatic modernism")
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->


</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p>It is clear that such a definition potentially embraces a vast range of cultural and social phenomena first conspicuous in Europe's <i>belle époque</i>. In art, the bourgeoning of new aesthetic forms and styles led to the bewildering proliferation from the mid-18th century onwards of "isms" that have become a bane for students of modern art and literature. The more programmatically idealistic of their creators wrote the manifestos that were so characteristic of the period 1880–1939 announcing the birth of a new world begat by the spiritual visions of the poet—those of the Blaue Reiter, Futurists, Expressionists, Surrealists, and Dadaists being particularly notable.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Other major artists as diverse as Richard Wagner, the later Gabriele D'Annunzio, and Pablo Picasso similarly belong in this company given their overriding concern with reversing the perceived spiritual bankruptcy of their time. Modernist impulses towards regenerating society also inform the work of the most creative contemporary architects,<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  town-planners,<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  and designers,<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  as well as the most influential philosophers and radical social theorists of the day, such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Henri Bergson, Georges Sorel, William Morris, Ernst Haeckel, Giovanni Gentile, and Martin Heidegger.  </p>

<p>The modernist aspiration to bring about spiritual regeneration is equally discernible in a wide range of social phenomena rarely associated by cultural historians with modernism, such as occultism, spiritualism, (Haeckelian) monism, the vogue for "Eastern religions," vitalism, Nietzscheanism, Freudianism, Wagnerism, Bergsonianism, and Jungianism, all popular movements or "cults" claiming to offer a remedy to the spiritual malaise of the times.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Nor did the search for a cure necessarily operate through the medium of ideas. The growing popular concern with physical health, with diet, with renewing contact with nature, with hiking, with cultivating a vigorous corporeal existence, with "body culture," was intimately bound up with contemporary currents of aesthetic, cultural, and social modernism. In this context, the late-19th 

<b></b>

 century cults of nudism or muscularity acquired a significance for its most fervent practitioners inseparable from the contemporary revolt against degeneracy occurring in the intellectual, artistic, and scientific spheres.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>   </p>

<p>It was this generalized ethos of artistic, intellectual, scientistic, and of physical, <i>corporeal </i>concern with the stemming the rise of decadence and solving the crisis of the West that fostered the emergence of eugenics. The ascendancy of eugenic paradigms amongst scientific and political elites eventually led to growing state involvement in the spheres of social health and "racial hygiene." The prevailing climate of modernism, when linked to nationalism as the principal site of aesthetic, moral, and cultural renewal also fostered the social and biopolitical campaigns through which a new breed of would-be social engineers in Europe and the US. They set themselves the challenge of improving the stock of the race and introducing preventative measures against dysgenic individuals or racial groups to firewall modern society against decay.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  There are also grounds for seeing the pan-European war-fever triggered by the outbreak of the First World War as the populist manifestation of primordial impulses to sacrifice one's own life in order to save "the world" from decadence.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  This would help explain the readiness with which millions of "civilized" human beings were willing to participate in the simultaneously technocratic and ritual slaughter of the "enemies of civilization/culture" secure in the knowledge they were fulfilling the self-transcendent cause of God and Country. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Political modernism
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>It is against this background that another sphere of human activity rarely associated by historians directly with modernism leaps into view: totalitarian politics. The intimate link between totalizing political goals and the aspirations of artistic and social "programmatic modernists" to create a new society has already been thoroughly documented in case of the Russian Revolution by Richard Stites. His <i>Revolutionary Dreams </i>explores the rush of visionaries of an imminent revolution every sphere of cultural and technological production to play a proactive role in the Bolsheviks' planned metamorphosis of society from its state of advanced decadence under the Tsars to a Brave New Socialist World under the Soviets. The elevation of Russia's greatest modernist poet, Aleksandr Blok, to become chairman of the Bolshoi Theatre and the head of the Petrograd branch of the All-Russian Union of Poets is paradigmatic of the profound collusion between avant-garde artists and the Revolution. This zealous collaboration also extended to broad swathes of the educated and technocratic elite who became zealous protagonists of every kind of social, scientific, and technological modernism.  </p>

<p>A new light is thrown on the modernist dimension of Bolshevism at the level of its ruling elite by Bernice Rosenthal, who has revealed the extraordinary degree to which both the Leninist and Stalinist phases of the revolution were indebted to the Nietzschean imperative to break through the taboos of "Judeo-Christian" (or "bourgeois liberal") morality without remorse in order to construct the Soviet superman who would embody the <i>nomos</i> of the new society. But perhaps even more telling confirmation 

<b></b>

 of the fruitfulness of approaching Bolshevism as a political form of modernism in the "primordialist" terms we have used to define it comes, appropriately enough, not from a political scientist, but from one of inter-war Germany's most celebrated literary modernists, the Expressionists dramatist, Franz Werfel.  </p>

<p>On the eve of Hitler's appointment as Chancellor, the poet felt sufficiently alarmed by the deepening political and <i>spiritual</i> crisis of Germany to give a series of public lectures explaining the dramatic upsurge in revolutionary politics, on both the left and the right, which were later published under the significant title "Between Above and Below." He describes the situation of two brothers, each of whose search for suprapersonal meaning leads them to embrace a different form of "naturalistic nihilism" in political guise, namely Communism and National Socialism. Both of these he sees as "<i>Ersatz </i>religions or, if you prefer, <i>Ersatz</i> for religion" .

Fascism as a form of political modernism
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>A growing number of historians and political scientists propose a theory of generic fascism that, using their own formulation, acknowledges the centrality of its palingenetic thrust towards a new era of health, strength, and vitality in the life of the nation.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  In the light of the theses developed here they can be taken as corroborating—however unwittingly—the heuristic value of approaching fascism, not just as predisposed to accommodate forms of cultural and social modernism, but as constituting a form of <i>political</i> modernism in its own right.  </p>

<p>Further endorsement of the heuristic value of this approach is sometimes to be found in the most unlikely places. One is the highly sophisticated analysis that the neo-Marxist philosopher, Peter Osborne, offers of the "politics of time" under modernity. Having asserted that "fascism is a particularly radical form of conservative revolution," he warns readers not to infer from this that it is to be treated as a regressive form of politics. On the contrary, fascism resolutely affirms "the temporality of the new," and as such is "neither a relic nor an archaism." Instead, its "rigorously futural" assault on the status quo makes it, like Bolshevism, a "<i>form of political modernism</i>" (164–66).  </p>

<p>Once fascism is recognized as containing a thrust towards a new temporality on a par with Bolshevism, a number of the familiar aspects it assumed in what Ernst Nolte called "the fascist epoch" acquire a fresh significance as corroborating the causal explanation (or perhaps "retrodiction") offered by our primordialist theory of modernism. In particular, it becomes clearer what enabled some radically palingenetic variants of 

<b></b>

 illiberal, "organic" nationalism (i.e. fascist movements) to become mass movements in the chaotic aftermath of the First World War. The acute crisis of inter-war Europe created pockets of intensely liminoid social conditions against the background of the generalized crisis of modernity that was patently obvious to the European avant-garde before the Great War, becoming the life-long obsession of such res as Richard Wagner, Friedrich Nietzsche, Henrik Ibsen, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Gabriele D'Annunzio, not to mention countless lesser luminaries of cultural production. In some countries, notably Italy, Germany, and Romania—and to a lesser extent elsewhere—a particular conration of crisis factors opened up the political space necessary for a modern movement of national revitalization to reach the critical mass required for it to win a substantial populist following.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Practically every inter-war fascist movement was led by a <i>propheta</i> re, a would-be or actual charismatic leader, who attempted to weld his most fanatical zealots, even when they constituted only a minute small percentage of the whole population, into the nucleus of a new <i>communitas</i> or national community capable of leading souls out of terminal collapse and into a new era. This involved syncretising—through a process of ludic recombination—ideological and liturgical materials available within the national culture into a new total world-view or <i>nomos </i>(called by the Nazis a <i>Weltanschauung</i>) which diagnosed the current decadence and provided the basis of drastic policies intended to remedy it within a new order.  </p>

<p>From this perspective, it was precisely the extreme syncretism, nebulousness, and contradictoriness characteristic of individual fascist ideologies which appeared to some historians as a "ragbag" or "hotchpotch" of ideas, <sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  that enabled them to become the populist mobilizing myth of a modernist (and not "millenarian") political religion based on the utopia of a total national rebirth. The coexistence within a particular fascism of technocratic or urban utopianism alongside celebrations of rural life and peasant values, or the construction of both ultra-modernist and neoclassical buildings under the same regime did not discredit it in the eyes of "believers," because the conflicting policies they embodied shared an overriding communality of purpose: the rebirth of the nation. It was a nebulous myth which admitted many permutations. Indeed, in the case of the Fascist and Nazi regimes the myth accommodated a welter of different currents or factions of political modernism thanks to the unifying, ecumenical power of the leader cult and the sheer dynamism of historical change stage-managed by the reborn nation through the medium of the new "modernist state." </p>

<p>A recurrent theme of the fascist mazeway (in contrast to the communist one) was the need to draw on the values of an idealized, largely <i>invented</i>, national past to regenerate the future. However, the spirit in which the Fascists drew on the Italians' Roman heritage or the Nazis invoked the Germans' supposedly Aryan past was the one attributed by Osborne to the "conservative revolution," namely a "rigorously futural" momentum towards an alternative modernity. Another aspect of fascism, once adopted as the basis of state power, was that it eagerly enlisted in the war against decadence all available currents of aesthetic, philosophical, and social modernism that were not deemed sources of national or racial decay—and intense disputes inevitably broke out within the ideologues 

<b></b>

 both regimes on such issues. Thus, while the Third Reich officially embraced the body culture movement and eugenics as promoting "health," mainstream Nazism rejected two other outstanding manifestations of modernism, the sexual emancipation movement (also suppressed under Mussolini) and modernist painting (many currents of which prospered under Mussolini), as symptoms of racial and cultural degeneracy. In contrast to Fascism, Nazism also restricted the use of modernist architecture to the sphere of industrial, technological, and social innovation. Yet the marked differences that separated Fascist and Nazi variants of fascism did not prevent most committed fascists in the Europeanized world from recognizing the profound affinity between the two regimes. In contrast to the parafascism of Franco's Spain, Salazar's Portugal, or Dolfuss's Austria,<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  both were committed to laying the foundations of an ultra-nationalist version of the "modernist state", one dedicated to using extensive social engineering—which in the case of the Third Reich included mass sterilization, "euthanasia," and genocide—to lay the foundations of what was to be a healthy historical era stretching out beyond decadence under the perpetual sacred canopy of the revitalized ethnic community. In both cases, too, it is possible to document the vital role in fascism's success played by a <i>primordial</i>, archetypally human fear of anomie unleashed by modern socio-political chaos, and the concomitant craving to access a new temporality that offered a way out from being engulfed by meaningless <i>chronos</i>.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Modernist fascism and the purification of Europe
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The "big picture" of the dynamics of modernism sketched in this article is offered as a new mazeway for reconceptualising and "re-imagining" fascism's labyrinthine relationship with modernity. Unlike the mazeway embodied in the charismatic <i>propheta </i>leading the chosen from a society in a state of inner collapse into a glorious new order, this one has no pretension to be other than a heuristic device, a <i>reflexive</i> meta-narrative aware of its limitations as an ideal-typical construct. </p>

<p>The main inferences to be drawn from the approach outlined in this article are twofold. The first concerns well-documented cases where individual literary, artistic, architectural, or technocratic modernists were not in the least "left-leaning," but rather distinctly "right-leaning" in their response to Bolshevism and fascism in the supercharged mythopoeic climate of inter-war Europe. Our "synoptic interpretation" suggests that the pacts with fascism voluntarily entered into by such individual artists and intellectuals such as Filippo Marinetti, Ezra Pound, Martin Heidegger, and Gottfried Benn should be studied not as an anomalies or aporias to be resolved through strenuous intellectual acrobatics. Instead, they are to be approached as yet more concrete manifestations of the porous membrane separating cultural and political modernism, whether of the right or the left. Similarly, the many instances where fascism co-opted currents of cultural, social, or political modernism or where currents of modernism aligned themselves spontaneously to fascism should be treated as predictable symptoms of what its followers perceived as its rigorously futural temporality. The prospect of participating in national rebirth could prove irresistible to idealists 

<b></b>

 and activists in all walks of life once society as presently constituted seemed doomed to self-destruction.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Second, policies formulated and measures adopted by fascist regimes in every sphere of social engineering should not be considered solely within the interpretive framework of totalitarian oppression, the eradication of both liberal and socialist principles of emancipation, and state terror. They should be scrutinized <i>also</i> for tell-tale signs of the constructivist, regenerative drive of political modernism at work. Even the genocidal destructiveness of Nazism was in the mind of its most convinced followers not the expression of nihilistic barbarism, but of a creative, <i>cathartic</i> destruction, the necessary precondition of, and prelude to, palingenesis. This is even true of the most extreme episode in the history of the Third Reich: its ruthlessly implemented genocidal policies against alleged racial and political enemies. 	 </p>

<p>Thanks to Zygmunt Bauman it has become easier for historians to accept how deeply these policies, far from being symptomatic of the flight from modernity, were in fact the logical product of modernity at its most radical.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  The approach we have outlined here suggests that the many permutations of fascism are also to be studied as the radical and <i>direct</i> consequences of socio-political <i>modernism</i>. The state-sponsored, industrialized extermination of the alleged human embodiments of decadence, the domination of policy by a biopolitical vision of the reborn national community based on eugenics and racial hygiene: these were just some of the poisonous harvest reaped by the fascist "gardening state,"<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  the logical consequence of its political modernism.  </p>

<p>The Nazi permutation of fascism aspired to inaugurate a new age through the dissemination of a new <i>nomos</i> whose ruthless implementation would ensure that the world beyond decadence would not only be brave and new, but <i>sanitized </i>and <i>pure</i>. As a result, many of the functionaries of industrialized mass murder in Auschwitz saw nothing barbaric or regressive in what they were doing. As a Red Cross official told the BBC reporter John Simpson, the henchman of Nazism's radical modernist project felt they had nothing to be ashamed of: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>These men were proud of their work. They were convinced of being engaged in an act of purification. They called Auschwitz the anus of Europe. Europe had to be cleansed. They were responsible for the purification of Europe. If you cannot get your head round that you will understand nothing at all.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Understanding fascism as a form of political modernism, one that, however chilling its consequences in driving the policies of the Third Reich, was never 'cold,' may help the human scientists of our "post-liberal" epoch to get their heads round such a proposition.  </p>

<p id="lead">

The existence of a collection of 9,250 Nazi-era works of art, which was formed by the U.S. Army in 1946–47, has long been suspected by journalists and scholars of fascism and the Third Reich, including Brandon Taylor , Frederic Spotts , and David D'Arcy .<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Mysterious as its origins are, elements of the "German War Art Collection" have been featured in museum exhibitions, discussed in the mass media, and reproduced in books.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  But aside from a few familiar, frequently exhibited objects, such as Hubert Lanzinger's <i>Der Bannenträger</i>  [<i>The Standard Bearer</i>] [<a href="#1">re 1</a>], knowledge of the whereabouts, the full contents, and the provenance of this collection, the largest surviving remnant of Nazi culture, has eluded researchers for over sixty years.  </p>

<p>Legal, commercial, and scholarly interest in the restitution of Holocaust assets has mushroomed in the past decade. As a consequence, scholarship on U.S. handling of German cultural property has focused almost exclusively on restitution rather than on investigating the U.S. Army's official art looting campaign that targeted contemporary German art and functioned for two years in the American zone of occupation.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Perhaps it is because the idea of sanctioned art theft conflicts with the heroic story of the U.S. Army's rescue and restitution of art treasures looted by the Nazis in occupied Europe that scholars have not observed how the same Army personnel that led the restitution effort—Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA) officers—were also responsible for the confiscation of German art. They did so both 

<b></b>

 as a perpetrator—in forming the collection known as the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i> [National Socialist State Property]—and as a facilitator in the formation of the "German War Art Collection" by other Army personnel. Until now little work has been done on the confiscation and sequestration orders that resulted in a sanitized history of 20th-century art from which Nazi Modernist painting was excluded. Impounded and concealed from all but the most determined investigators, the contents of the U.S. Army's collection of Nazi art remained unexamined for 60 years.</p>

<p>Of course, inspecting the Army's collection has been hindered by its complex disposition. Until recently the "German War Art Collection" was housed in three separate institutions—the U.S. Army's Center of Military History (450 objects), the <i>Deutsches Historisches Museum</i> [German Historical Museum] (1626 objects plus the 754 artifacts in the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i>), and the <i>Bayerisches Armeemuseum</i> [Bavarian Army Museum] (7,100).<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Complicating matters further are the access policies of the Nazi art repositories, which, even for well-credentialed researchers, range from the occasionally hospitable to the impossibly Kafkaesque. Attempts at divulging the contents of both collections 

<b></b>

 were also impeded by the disposition of related documents, few of which are housed in the expected and accessible confines of the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration or the <i>Bundesarchiv</i> [German Federal Archives]. Some archives were sealed until fairly recently and others are stored in obscure locations without even the most basic facilities for conducting research. Still others, after their contents were studied and photographed, were moved to an unspecified location. Thus, illuminating the tangled provenance of the "German War Art Collection" and the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i> has required the invention of a forensic methodology applicable to art history.  </p>

<p>Despite these obstacles, in researching my forthcoming book on the "German War Art Collection,"<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  I was able to compile a complete photographic record of the collection's contents (9,250) and 50,000 related documents. The importance of these materials lies in their ability to shatter two of the most enduring myths associated with Nazi Germany and its post-war occupation. The first myth to crumble on contact with the evidence is that official American policy with respect to German cultural properties did not include art looting. The second and most stubborn Nazi-era myth dispelled by my discovery of the "German War Art Collection" is that of the complete ideological incompatibility of the National Socialist aesthetic with Modernist painting. </p>

<p>According to the master narrative of 20th-century German art history, the opening of the <i>Entartete Kunstausstellung</i> [Degenerate Art Exhibition] in July 1937 in Munich's <i>Haus der Deutschen Kunst</i> [House of German Art] rang the death knell of the <i>avant garde</i> in Nazi Germany and the practice of "real art," that is, Modernism, resumed only after the fall of the NS regime. The pages that follow will provide evidence for the startling fact that certain types of Modernist art not only survived in Germany after 1937, but that "Nazi Modernism" was produced under the official patronage of Adolf Hitler and the <i>Oberkommando der Wehrmacht</i> [the German Armed Forces High Command]. That the production of Modernist art could have been sponsored by the very institution responsible for the bloody conquest and brutal occupation of Europe is not inconsistent with the crucial role played by violent imagery and militaristic rhetoric in other strands of Modernism, such as Italian Futurism and British Vorticism. But until now evidence has been lacking or insufficient to support such an apparently counterintuitive concept as "Nazi Modernist" art. </p>

The "German Wartime Art Project" 
</h2>	<!--CLOSE sec-headB-->



<p>After defeating Hitler's armies on the battlefield, the victorious allies were concerned to prevent the revival of National Socialism. Acknowledging this concern, the Potsdam Agreement signed by the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union on 1 August 1945 signaled the intention of the occupying powers "to prevent all Nazi and militaristic activity or propaganda."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  American authorities were alone, however, in officially designating contemporary German artworks as potentially dangerous instruments of a possible Nazi revival. Among the various attempts by the United States to control the cultural legacy of National Socialist Germany, none has influenced the history of German art in 

<b></b>

 the 20th century more but is as little known as the U.S. Army's "German Wartime Art Project." The brainchild of Colonel H.E. Potter, Chief of the Historical Division, the "German Wartime Art Project" came into being as the operations arm of the Historical Division that would implement Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall's directive that German art throughout the American zone should be confiscated and shipped to Washington, D.C.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  In quick succession, additional regulations were issued that gave the nascent "German Wartime Art Project" a free hand. </p><!--_re 2-->

<p>For example, an order issued on 7 November 1945 directed that a collection should be made "of all available paintings, watercolors, engravings, and drawings showing troop activities, views of battlefields, military installations, industrial or home front activities produced by German artists during the war."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In accordance with this order, U.S. Military Government Regulations were revised to stipulate that "all collections of works of art relating or directed to the perpetuation of German militarism or Nazism [were to] be closed permanently and taken into custody."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  To insure that all cultural property subject to seizure was, in fact, secured, the Military Government of Germany, United States zone, published Article I, Law No. 52, which decreed that "all property within the occupied territory owned or controlled directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by [the German Reich] shall be subject to seizure of possession or title."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The Army's definition of "property" included all assets in possession of the German state, the National Socialist party, and prominent supporters of the regime. Thus empowered, the U.S. laid claim to both looted and so-called "aryanized" art properties, as well as propaganda materials and war art. The decision to repatriate artifacts with clear, pre-Nazi titles actually came much later, but not until a firestorm of criticism greeted the decision to ship 200 pictures previously housed in the <i>Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum</i> in Berlin to the United States.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  </p>

<p>It was in this politically charged atmosphere that U.S. Army Air Force Captain Gordon Waverly Gilkey, after failing to be assigned as an MFAA officer or an Army combat artist, arrived in Europe.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  On 8 February 1946 Colonel Potter, who was based in Frankfurt am Main, invited Gilkey to lead the "German Wartime Art Project": "Your letter written 9 January reached me just as the subject of War Art was under special administrative scrutiny; and it is particularly apropos that we have reached a decision to do some further work in collecting documentary paintings of war and current interest. There is an interesting field of work here, and your record shows qualifications well adapted to it."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Consistent with the pared down force levels of the U.S. Army of Occupation, Gilkey was to serve alone, armed solely with the sweeping authority he carried as the bearer of General Marshall's orders. </p>

<p>Designed to function as the occupation Army's counterpart to the Monuments Fine Arts and Archives Branch, which was hastily mobilized in the run-up to the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, the Historical Division had, however, a contrasting mission. While MFAA officers took responsibility for first securing and then repatriating thousands of art treasures looted by the Nazis throughout occupied Europe, the Historical Division was tasked with coordinating the traditionally chaotic grab for war booty by providing for the systematic collection and preservation of trophies of the recently concluded war. In a clear acknowledgment of the inadequacy of American combat art programs, no trophies were deemed as desirable to the U.S. Army as works of art produced by <i>Wehrmacht</i> combat artists. For the Army's stated goal in acquiring German art properties was to adorn the walls of the thousands of offices in the Pentagon, the U.S. War Department's new administration building, which opened in 1943. Along with trophy-quality contemporary German artworks or whose provenance linked them to the National Socialist regime, U.S. Army personnel seized art properties legitimately 

<b></b>

 acquired by pre-Nazi governments. What this means, of course, is that Gilkey and his counterparts in the MFAA were authorized to engage in punitive actions against German institutions as well as individual artists. Not previously known before now is that MFAA personnel not only assisted Gilkey in making his selections for the "German War Art Collection," they also pursued their own confiscatory agenda.</p>

<h2 class="sec-headB">
The "German Wartime Art Project" 
</h2>	<!--CLOSE sec-headB-->



<p>Over a six-month period, from mid-1946 to spring 1947, despite limited staffing and logistical support, Gilkey confiscated approximately 9,250 works of art. His big break came when he discovered the post-war hiding place of Hauptmann Luitpold Adam, artist and former head of the<i> Staffel der bildenen Künstler</i> [Squadron of Visual Artists], a unit of selected artists to record the exploits of the German military. Formed in 1941 on direct orders from Hitler to the Armed Forces High Command, Adams' unit was comprised of 80 artists who embedded with <i>Wehrmacht</i> units throughout occupied Europe and North Africa. The works produced by the Squadron of Visual 

<b></b>

 Artists were intended to hang in museums (military and civilian), soldiers' barracks, dining rooms, and officers' clubs. Following the collapse of the Third Reich, Adam personally evacuated his unit's huge stock of field sketches, watercolors, and graphic works from its headquarters in Potsdam to the Bavarian Forest, where he divided the objects into separate caches and hid them in castles and more humble dwellings scattered throughout the picturesque countryside.  </p>

<p>Under interrogation Adam revealed the locations of the hidden works of art and led Gilkey to three major depots near the towns of Zwiesel, Frauenau, and Rottach-Egern. Adam's cooperation was, however, conditional on Gilkey's promise that the impounding of these objects would be temporary; after being exhibited in Washington, D.C., they would be restituted to the artists. Adam's disappointment in Gilkey's failure to make good on their agreement, which he carried to his death in 1952, is echoed by the many artists or artists' heirs who wrote directly to Gilkey in later years, seeking the promised return of their paintings, sketches, and drawings. Others expressed their surprise and outrage in letters to Max Dirrigl, the acting director of the House of German Art's <i>Abwicklungsstelle </i>[Processing and Settlement Office], or in their <i>Fragenbögen</i> [de-Nazification questionnaires].<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The latter had to be completed by all Germans seeking employment or restitution for war damages from U.S. occupation authorities. </p>

<p>Gilkey's second-most important source for Nazi art was the Munich Central Collecting Point (CCP) for art salvaged in American-occupied Bavaria and western Austria. Housed in the <i>Verwaltungsbau</i> [Party Administration Building], one of the twin buildings designed by Paul Ludwig Troost, the other being the <i>Führerbau</i> [Führer Building], the CCP would also serve as Gilkey's temporary depot until he transferred his collection to Historical Division Headquarters in Frankfurt. Like the 754-piece <i>NS-Reichbesitz</i>, the collection of Nazi art formed between 1945 and 1946 by MFAA officers, the "German War Art Collection" included paintings acquired for collections associated with Hitler, such as the latter's personal collection of contemporary German art, and the collections of the <i>Führerbau</i> and <i>Reichskanzlei</i>. Virtually all of the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i> paintings and dozens of objects in the "German War Art Collection" were originally purchased at the annual Great German Art Exhibitions that took place from 1937 to 1944 in the third Troost-designed building in Munich, the House of German Art.  </p>

<p>In a previously undocumented intervention by non-MFAA personnel in the Central Collecting Point, Gilkey entered the depot armed with General Marshall's orders and made his selections from among the paintings that had been earmarked by the MFAA for inclusion in the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i>.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Salvaged in the cavernous basement of the House of German Art, the art collections associated with representative buildings, and in Hitler's private residence on <i>Prinzregentenplatz</i>, these pictures had been impounded on the basis of their provenance: all were identified as property of the former Reich or leadership res. Gilkey selected portraits of Nazi leaders, architectural paintings, idealized battle scenes, pastoral landscapes, and depictions of historical and mythological subjects that echoed Nazi propaganda. As a result, the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i> contains no leadership portraits, overt propaganda images, or combat scenes. Evidence for the dovetailing of these two operations—the MFAA art restitution program and the 

<b></b>

 Army's official art looting program—was first discovered in the Munich Central Collecting Point Archive at the National Gallery of Art, which contains the registration photographs of paintings that Gilkey had removed from the Central Collecting Point, placed in his custody, and shipped to the United States.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Among the works of art photographed and registered at the Munich Central Collecting Point are four watercolors by Adolf Hitler that were ultimately accessioned to the "German War Art Collection." One of the watercolors was initially set aside by MFAA officer Ernst Breitenbach for return to Heinrich Hoffmann, Hitler's photographer, confidant, and the work's owner of record.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The other three watercolors were at first designated to join the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i>, the body of 754 "non-militaristic" and "non-Nazi" paintings found in the <i>Führerbau</i>, <i>Reichskanzlei, </i>and <i>Haus der Deutschen Kunst</i>, vetted by MFAA and occupation government officials, and then assigned to the legal if not physical custody of the <i>Ministerpresident</i> of Bavaria. However, before the Wiesbaden Collecting Point was closed in 1950, all four watercolors were once again removed from German hands and shipped to Washington, D.C., where they were added to the "German War Art Collection."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Additional confirmation of MFAA complicity in Gilkey's art looting was recently discovered in letters sent by artists seeking the return of embargoed paintings to the <i>Abwicklungsstelle</i> [Processing and Settlement Office] of the House of German Art: in his replies to the queries, Max Dirrigl, chief of the <i>Abwicklungsstelle</i>, indicates that MFAA officers had condoned Gilkey's confiscations because the pictures had met the latter's criteria. One such artist who tried in vain to retrieve her work from the American authorities was Helga Tiemann [<a href="#4">re 4</a>]. </p>

The 1951 Repatriation of the "German War Art Collection" 
</h2>	<!--CLOSE sec-headB-->



<p>On the arrival of Gilkey's collection in Washington in 1947 Army lawyers immediately determined that the Army's official art looting program, which did not start until a year <i>after</i> the German surrender, had contravened Occupation Authority rules and were therefore illegal.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  There were also obvious problems with the provenance of many pictures deemed subject to seizure that lacked <i>Wehrmacht</i> or Propaganda Ministry stamps, stickers, or other links to official Nazi propaganda art programs, suggesting that such objects were private property at the time they were confiscated. In interviews just before his death, Gilkey freely admitted that he had raided the private studios of artists who had served in the Squadron on Visual Artists and seized all works of art that were present, regardless of visible evidence of patronage, theme or style. It is no wonder, then, that for decades afterwards, Gilkey continued to receive queries about the works of art he had acquired in this way.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In fact, angry charges of theft and claims for restitution lodged by German artists had been making their way up the chain of command in both Germany and the United States for two years. German artists even appealed directly to President Truman (and, in later years, to Presidents Eisenhower, Johnson, Nixon, Carter, and Reagan) to release their works of art. On the defensive after the firestorm of outrage that greeted the U.S. Army's extremely risky shipment of the 200 <i>Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum </i>paintings to Washington in order "to protect" them, Army lawyers were acutely sensitive to perceived violations of West Germany's 

<b></b>

 freshly restored sovereignty and the reinstated property rights of her citizens. The Army's solution to the legal and political crisis developing over Gilkey's confiscation of contemporary German art was, unlike the case of the Berlin Old Masters paintings, immediate repatriation. 	</p>

<p>Both projects—the confiscation of contemporary German art and the taking into "protective custody" of the <i>Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum</i> Old Master paintings—had their origins in the early post-war honeymoon phase of the U.S.-Soviet rivalry. Initially, at least, both countries pursued a policy of extracting cultural reparations from Germany. Thus it was in an atmosphere charged with retributionist fervor that the Berlin pictures and the "German War Art Collection" were shipped to the U.S. Only after the former caused a public relations nightmare for the Army in both the U.S. and Germany were more legitimate-sounding rationales invented for the shipment of the masterpieces to the U.S., such as the need to safeguard the pictures in advance of a threatened Soviet invasion of Western Europe. According to this scenario, accessioning the <i>Kaiser-Friedrich Museum</i> pictures would put the National Gallery of Art on a more competitive footing with its chief rival, the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. Despite the undisguised enthusiasm for the transfer of the pictures expressed by such prominent individuals as Senator William Fulbright of Arkansas and Harlan Stone, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and National Gallery of Art board member, John Walker, director 

<b></b>

 of the National Gallery, issued strenuous denials that such a plan was ever in the cards, even as he threw his weight behind the perilous scheme.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Returning the "German War Art Collection" to West Germany was, however, motivated by more than respect for the legal niceties of the post-war order or by fear of being compared to the insatiably acquisitive Soviet occupiers of East Germany. In 1951, as the Korean War reached a bloody stalemate, U.S. Army officials were eager to improve relations with the newly sovereign Federal Republic of Germany and to rehabilitate the post-war incarnation of Adolf Hitler's war machine, whose tanks and troops blocked the Red Army's invasion route into Western Europe. For America's cold warriors, placating West Germany with the repatriation of the "German War Art Collection" took precedence over taking a stand on the issue of restituting Holocaust assets, including the "Linz Collection" of art, formed by Hitler and his agents through thousands of dubious transactions. Destined for the vast museum complex designed by architect Hermann Giesler, the "Linz Collection" was to have transformed Hitler's <i>spiessig</i> hometown into the capital of European culture. Thus with revisionist haste and perhaps unseemly pragmatism, 1,626 works in the "German War Art Collection," slightly less than a quarter of the total number of objects seized by Gilkey, were re-categorized by Army lawyers with bureaucratic ingenuity as "non-military military art" and loaded on a freighter bound for West Germany. </p>

<p>Far from jubilant over this gesture of friendship from their U.S. patrons, the government of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer left the crates containing the German paintings on a pier in Bremerhaven for two years before claiming them. Then in 1953, in an act of supreme but perhaps unintended historical irony, the repatriated objects were shipped south to Munich and deposited in the <i>Verwaltungsbau</i>, site of the former Central Collecting Point, which then temporarily housed the <i>Bayerisches Hauptstaatsarchiv </i>[Bavarian Principal State Archives] before it gave way to the <i>Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte</i> [Central Institute for Art History], which continues to occupy the Nazi Party's former Munich headquarters.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Catalogued in the 1970s, the 1,626 pictures eventually passed to the control of the <i>Bundesvermögensamt</i> [Office for the Custody of Federal Assets]. Until recently the repatriated paintings were housed, with an additional dollop of irony, in a storage facility on the grounds of the <i>Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz</i> [Federal Ministry for Radiation Security] in Berlin-Karlshorst. There the radioactive "non-military military art" was stored alongside the unclaimed remnant of the "Linz Collection." In 2005 the 1,626 objects were transferred to the custody of the German Historical Museum in Berlin where they were reunited with the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i>. </p>

<p>In 1986, after ten years of fraught bilateral negotiations between a succession of German and American administrations, 7,100 objects in the "German War Art Collection" left the United States. This little-known American effort to speed up the process of reconciliation was preceded in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan's ceremonial visit to the German military cemetery in Bitburg, which sparked a major controversy when it 

<b></b>

 was disclosed that <i>Waffen SS</i> as well as regular <i>Wehrmacht</i> soldiers were buried there. Interviews with a Reagan foreign policy expert, who advised the president during this episode, revealed that the restitution of Nazi art and the wreath-laying at Bitburg were related elements in a public relations campaign designed to win Chancellor Helmut Kohl's support for the "Star Wars" missile defense program and the installation of Pershing intermediate range nuclear missiles on West German soil.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> </p>

<p>The process of repatriating the "German War Art Collection" had begun four years earlier. On 12 May 1981 Republican Congressman G. William Whitehurst of Virginia introduced legislation (H.R. 3555) that authorized the return of the Army's collection of Nazi art to West Germany. The original impulse behind Whitehurst's bill was, however, unrelated to any such grand geopolitical motivations. Three years previously, as congressional liaison to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Whitehurst befriended several high-ranking West German naval officers who had presented the case for returning the Army's war trophies, which were moldering in a Richmond, Virginia warehouse, to West Germany, where they could be properly displayed in military history museums and serve a didactic function. Under the influence of his new friends, Whitehurst sponsored an earlier, less ambitious bill that ordered the repatriation of ten naval war paintings by the prominent marine artist Claus Bergen.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  In subsequent press and television interviews, Whitehurst steadfastly maintained that the West Germans were deserving of an even more magnanimous gesture from their old foe and Cold War ally.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<p>Not everyone in official Washington shared Whitehurst's staunchly pro-German attitude. His second and more extensive Nazi art repatriation bill encountered fierce opposition from the U.S. State Department and the newly founded U.S. Holocaust Memorial Commission. A newly established federal agency, the USHMC was chaired by author, human rights activist, and future Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who imperiously demanded that the entire "German War Art Collection" be transferred to his embryonic museum.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Wiesel was so effective in lobbying allies in Congress and the White House that the resulting inter-agency squabbling delayed the return of the Army's Nazi art by five years.  </p>

<p>As a concession to opponents of the now bureaucratically inevitable restitution of the "German War Art Collection," the Secretary of the Army formed a committee with representatives from the U.S. Army, the State Department, and the Smithsonian Institution. Other appointees included an assortment of Capitol Hill functionaries, but no art historians. Chaired by Jacob Javits, the eminent former New York Senator, whose profile as a moderate Jewish Republican was stressed as a positive factor in Army correspondence debating the wisdom of his appointment, the committee was charged with and ultimately screened the 7,500 works of art that remained in the "German War Art Collection" for the presence of obvious National Socialist themes and symbolism. Objects that failed this test would not be going back to Bonn. In the end, 400 paintings and sculptures were set aside as politically dangerous. These objects, along with 50 others deemed to be of superior documentary value, were assigned to permanent U.S. custody.

<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, the political climate in Bonn had changed considerably in the decade since the West German foreign office approached the U.S. State Department in October 1977 about repatriating the rest of the Army's collection of Nazi art.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The airing of <i>Holocaust</i>, the American miniseries, in January 1979, and the publication of excerpts from Josef Goebbel's <i>Tagebücher</i> later that year are credited with triggering a belated enthusiasm among West Germans for initiating the process of <i>Vergangenheitsbewältigung</i> [overcoming the past]. Additional impetus for confronting the Nazi past appeared in 1983 with the election of the first members of the Greens Party to the <i>Bundestag</i>. With German historical consciousness at a post-war high, the arrival of the repatriated Nazi-era paintings in 1986 sparked a vigorous debate concerning the proper disposition of these artifacts. For their part, the Greens favored public display of the returned art over sequestration, arguing that to demonize the artifacts would turn them into icons of a new Nazi mythology.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  But exhibiting the 7,100 repatriated works was never given serious consideration by the conservative Kohl government. Releasing the pictures to the artists who produced the works or to their heirs was also ruled out, even though the West German government had agreed, in its 

<b></b>

 negotiations with the United States, to honor artists' claims for restitution. Ultimately, the decision was made to seclude the repatriated art in the basement of the Bavarian Army Museum in Ingolstadt. It was here that the largest portion of the "German War Art Collection" remained for nearly two decades, pending transfer to the German Historical Museum, where the canvasses were surrounded by weapons and military paraphernalia dating from the Middle Ages to World War II. </p>

The "German War Art Collection" in Washington, D.C. 
</h2>	<!--CLOSE sec-headB-->



<p>The third depot housing the 450 works of art that were held back from the large-scale repatriation in 1986 is located in a satellite branch of the Center of Military History, the chief educational unit of the U.S. Army, in Washington, D.C. In the 

<b></b>

 basement of a modern office building the objects are stored and loans of paintings and sculptures are tracked. The Army, despite eagerly pressing the case for repatriation of the "German War Art Collection" in 1951 and 1986, remains unwavering in its claim to the 450 works of art still in its custody. After rejecting the Department of the Army's Historical Advisory Committee's recommendation in 2001 that the remaining 450 works be returned to Germany, Army leaders tasted vindication in 2004. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to review a lower court's decision that the U.S. Army was not obliged to return the four Hitler watercolors in the "German War Art Collection" to Billy F. Price. In 1989 Price, a Houston businessman and Hitler memorabilia collector, acting on behalf of Heinrich Hoffmann's daughter, the widow of Nazi leader Baldur von Schirach, challenged the Army's claim to the watercolors and sued for millions in restitution. A Texas District Court initially ruled in favor of Price, awarded a multi-million dollar judgment, and ridiculed the Army's rationale for sequestration: the idea that "four architectural paintings could be 'rallying points for a possible revival of Nazism' is incredulous [sic]."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In 2004 Brigadier General John Brown, outgoing head of the Center of Military History, was interviewed about the Army's view of the legal status of Hitler's watercolors and the other objects in the "German War Art Collection." When asked if the Army's custody of these works, which had been determined to be in violation of U.S. and German laws in 1947, could not be construed as a violation of the 1907 Hague Convention 

<b></b>

 and the 1970 UNESCO Treaty on cultural property, he replied, "No. That would only be true if the objects in the "German War Art Collection" were cultural property or art. Our position is that the paintings are not art." General Brown's statement is consistent with the announcement of U.S. Army policy on the status of the "German War Art Collection" nearly fifty years earlier. In a memorandum issued on 13 October 1955 Colonel Howard S. Levine of the Judge Advocate General's Office addresses both the specific legal status of Adolf Wissel's portrait of Dr. Alexander Matting (wartime rector of the Technical University of Hannover), which was seized by Gilkey and was held back from the 1986 repatriation because of the presence of a Nazi Party badge on the subject's lapel, and, more generally, the legality of the U.S. seizure of German cultural property. Levine asserts that "the design and use of the portrait for propagandistic and militaristic purposes destroyed the otherwise cultural and sacrosanct character of such property and rendered it subject to confiscation."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
II. The Objects 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>The huge and multifaceted body of work produced by the Squadron of Visual Artists in a variety of media and employing recognizable Modernist idioms resists easy classification. Contrary to what one might expect given the aesthetic orthodoxy dominating the home front, especially the state-sponsored Great German Art Exhibitions at the House of German Art, German combat artists exercised considerable freedom in representing the experience of combat, the variety of landscapes in which they found themselves, and the diverse human types they saw in the ranks of German soldiers, Allied prisoners, and among the civilian populace. The examples reproduced here [<a href="#3">res 3</a>, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10] suggest the wide range of styles and subject matter displayed in the surviving <i>Wehrmacht </i>paintings, drawings, and prints. While some portray Nazi leaders, prisoners of war, forced laborers, and refugees, the vast majority of the 9,250 objects do not function as conventional propaganda or document scenes of combat or atrocities. If they function as propaganda at all, they do so in the idiom of art and frequently in recognizably Modernist idioms. </p>

<p>A thorough examination of these politically compromised objects reveals that of the 400 non-trophy objects in the custody of the U.S. Army few are the work of combat artists. Instead, the majority of the artifacts held back by the Javits Committee were produced by civilian artists and displayed in the House of German Art; several were in fact purchased for Hitler's private collection. These "civilian" works of art are more overtly National Socialist in iconography and more traditional in style than the paintings produced by artists serving in propaganda units of the <i>Wehrmacht</i>, such as in the Squadron of Visual Artists. Thus, the non-military paintings in the "German War Art Collection" reflect the conservative taste that the Great German Art Exhibitions were intended to disseminate and popularize as an alternative to Classical Modernism or what the Nazis branded "Degenerate Art." In this way they reveal their origins in the same pool of objects selected by the MFAA for the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i>. But other objects retained in Washington, principally the works of art produced by members of 

<b></b>

 the Squadron of Visual Artists, underscore the eclectic nature of Nazi aesthetics and bear the unmistakable features of Expressionism, post-Impressionism, New Objectivity/Verism, and other subgenres of Modernist Realism. In the two repatriated sections of the "German War Art Collection" (numbering 8,726 works), which were produced exclusively by combat artists, the Modernist element is even more pronounced, as our examples from all three repositories demonstrate.</p>

<p>Similar contrasts can be seen in a comparison of the repatriated portion of the "German War Art Collection" and the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i>. That the combat art component in the "German War Art Collection" shares affinities with certain strands of Modernism, while the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i> embodies the aesthetic ideals pronounced by Hitler, Goebbels, and Rosenberg, can be traced to the radically discrepant confiscation procedures followed by Gilkey and his MFAA colleagues. The <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i>, like the civilian art in the remnant of the "German War Art Collection" in Washington, is more conventionally National Socialist in style and iconography because it consists exclusively of paintings purchased by Hitler and other Nazi leaders at the Great German Art Exhibitions. Gilkey, by contrast, cast his net more widely, thus insuring that the Army's Nazi art collection would be more broadly representative of artistic production during the Third Reich than the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i>. Gilkey's chief criterion was that the objects he 

<b></b>

 seized were produced with the support of Nazi patron institutions. He had concluded, falsely, as it happens, that only members of the Nazi Party were eligible to join the <i>Reichskulturkammer</i> [Reich Chamber of Culture], exhibit in the House of German Art, or serve in the Squadron of Visual Artists. As a result, he did not discriminate between works of art produced by combat artists, opportunistic professional artists, or the regime's court artists, and so he confiscated everything he found, regardless of style and iconography—classically modern as well as and <i>Nazi Moderne</i>.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Such methods of selection produced results that are both paradoxical and problematic. They are paradoxical because a high percentage of the "war art" that Gilkey confiscated is neither propagandistic, according to the Army's own legal criteria as applied in 1951 and 1986, nor stereotypically National Socialist in ideological content, iconography, or style. They are problematic because examination of these objects raises fascinating and, for some, troubling questions about how much National Socialism actually imbued the art of the Third Reich.  </p>

<p>Due to overexposure in high-profile exhibitions, the contents of the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz </i>have come to serve a function that was never intended to when MFAA officers in occupied Germany created it out of the works of art left behind in the depot space of the House of German Art—that of a de facto canon of Nazi art. The sequestration of the "German War Art Collection" has meant that, aside from Lanzinger's <i>Der Bannenträger</i>, the only paintings produced during the Third Reich that scholars and the public have actually seen belong to the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i> [<a href="#2">re 2</a>]. Even though the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i> never left West Germany and the objects technically belonged to the Free State of Bavaria, the works of art remained in the nominal custody of U.S. officials until 1963.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  After a series of exhibitions of objects from the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i> were staged in West German art museums in the 1970s and 1980s,<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  the "Arno Breker/Museum Ludwig" controversy of the late 1980s fostered a heated discussion of the status of these objects and whether they should be exhibited in museums.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  The consensus that emerged in the German museum community in the 1990s was that Nazi art would henceforth be exhibited only under certain carefully observed conditions, e.g., only in historical rather than art museums and only when responsibly framed by historical information. Violators of this consensus risked the opprobrium of their peers in the museum community. One notable failure was the controversial 1999 Weimar exhibition of 140 meticulously restored objects from the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i> that was curated by Achim Preiss.  </p>

<p>A "coming out" party of sorts for the controversial collection, which had recently been transferred from the custody of the <i>Oberfinanzdirektion</i> [the German Federal Finance Ministry] to that of the German Historical Museum, <i>Aufstieg und Fall der Moderne</i> [<i>The Rise and Fall of Modernism</i>] was the most extensive show in the twenty-year exhibition history of the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i>. These pictures had formerly been stored in the <i>Hauptzollamt</i> [Chief Customs Office] in Munich. (Starting in the mid-1970s, this imposing edifice—empty but for the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i> and related objects, such as one of Hitler's desks—enjoyed the dubious distinction of being a pilgrimage destination for both serious scholars and Nazi fetishists.) Eight years on <i>The Rise and Fall of Modernism</i> is considered a dark chapter in the exhibition history of the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i>, chiefly because Preiss exhibited the pictures without sufficient contextualization. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Violations of the unofficial taboo on exhibiting Nazi art in museum continue to be treated with scorn in the German media and among museum professionals, as was made abundantly clear in the reviews and press coverage that greeted the recent exhibition of Arno Breker's works in Schwerin, <i>Zur Diskussion Gestellt: der Bildhauer Arno Breker</i> [<i>Under Consideration: The Sculptor Arno Breker</i>] . By contrast, the inclusion of the familiar <i>Der Bannenträger</i> by Hubert Lanzinger , which is the most recognized picture in the "German War Art Collection," in the <i>Das XX. Jahrhundert: Ein Jahrhundert Kunst in Deutschland</i> [<i>The Twentieth Century: A Century of Art in Germany</i>]  in Berlin's <i>Altes Museum</i> [Old Museum] and in <i>Kunst und Propaganda im Streit der Nationen, 1930–1945</i> [<i>Art and Propaganda: The Clash of Nations, 1930–1945</i>]  at the German Historical Museum, reflected strict observance of contemporary museum protocol.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Media coverage and the input of colleagues was universally positive. In the former, <i>Der Bannenträger</i> was hung as a component in the wall text outside the section of the exhibition entitled <i>Die Gewalt der Kunst</i> [<i>The Power of Art</i>]. In <i>Art and Propaganda</i>, Lanzinger's painting was framed by video screens and vitrines full of contextualizing materials. In both cases, the tainted object was kept apart from the "real art" in such a way that no spectator could mistake it for an independent element of the exhibition. Safely designated as "mere" propaganda, <i>Der Bannenträger</i> functioned in these exhibitions as a political prop or an ideological signifier rather than an autonomous work of art. </p>

<p>Albeit fragmentary and largely one-dimensional because all the objects in it were exhibited in the Great German Art Exhibitions, the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i> continues to meet the expectations of art historians who are not prepared to treat Nazi art as belonging to "real" art history and who cling to the belief that Nazi anti-Modernist agitation, culminating in the July 1937 <i>Entartete Kunstausstellung</i>, succeeded in eliminating all <i>avant-garde </i>artistic practice in Nazi Germany. The ubiquity of the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i> is also responsible for any lingering traces of this rigid dualism—"official art" versus "Degenerate art"—in standard treatments of 20th-century German art as well as in the most admired recent scholarship, including Michaud (1996; 2004). </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the "German War Art Collection," despite its vastly greater size (9,250 objects vs. the 754 objects in the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i>) and surprising stylistic diversity, remains virtually unknown. But as the examples discussed and represented here suggest, a more systematic study of the "German War Art Collection" has the potential to shift our focus from the aesthetic rupture between progressive <i>avant-garde</i> Modernism and "reactionary Modernism" to the now documentable relationship between various early Modernisms and "Nazi Modernism." It will be seen that the work of the privileged as well as that of the mass of artists accommodated themselves to the regime's fluid aesthetic without tortuous contortions and without making drastic aesthetic compromises. Aside from a small group of privileged artists comprised of Adolf Ziegler, Ivo Saliger, Josef Thorak, Arno Breker and a few others, most artists not subject to racial or political persecution continued to work without adopting the aesthetic template of the new court art as exemplified in the <i>NS-Reichsbesitz</i>. As evidenced by the contents of the "German War Art Collection," "Nazi Modernists" worked openly and experienced little 

<b></b>

 or no persecution or restrictions on their work, and many "Nazi Modernists," such as members of the Squadron of Visual Artists, were supported by state institutions, such as the German armed forces. These artists moved seamlessly between the boundaries of state-sanctioned taste and "Nazi Modernism," and, in the post-war era, adapted to the new conditions in the art market. </p>

<p>The "German War Art Collection" will also make manifest the need to accept that National Socialism not only produced culture, it produced a type of Modernist culture—not just in architecture, sculpture, and design, where by far the most scholarship on National Socialist aesthetics has been concentrated—but also in painting.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  These works of art will also foster study of the institutions in Nazi Germany that supported the various forms of "official" art that are represented in the "German War Art Collection" and the relationship between these forms of "official" art, their exhibition history, and their function in the art market. The rediscovery of the 9,250 works of art in the "German War Art Collection"—the "invisible museum" of Nazi art—has also made it possible to reconstruct the history of American intervention in German culture and to assess the impact of these actions on our understanding of Nazi aesthetics, especially the range of artistic expression and experimentation permitted to artists working in officially sanctioned programs. As the examples from the "German War Art Collection" reproduced here demonstrate, there were multiple "official" art forms in the Third Reich, including state-sponsored variations on the "Modernist" vernacular that co-existed with the conservative idiom favored by the Nazi leadership.  </p>

<p id="lead">

From the time of his appointment at the Salpêtrière Women's Hospice, Paris, in 1862 through to his death in 1893, Dr. Jean-Martin Charcot lectured in neurological diseases, pathological anatomy, geriatrics and other topics. Charcot's famous lessons on hysterioepileptic seizure and hypnotic automatism drew the most public attention. His presentations as a whole though focused on less dramatic conditions such as complications of gait and locomotor coordination (ataxia, sclerosis in plaques, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Charcot's work has elicited considerable attention from feminists and historians of hysteria and gender, medical historians, literary critics, photographic historians and others.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  While commentators typically acknowledge the theatrical quality of Charcot's presentations, there has been no sustained analysis of what this constituted, the significance of this theatricalism, or its precise nature. The accounts which appeared in the contemporary lay and medical press however demonstrate that Charcot was almost as well known for the aesthetic style of his presentations as he was for their specific content. An examination 

<b></b>

 of what this style was, how it functioned, as well as its strengths and weaknesses, is therefore overdue. While the transgressive nature of hysterical symptomatology has since become a truism of the historiography, the discursive transgressions embodied within Charcot's own <i>demonstrative technique</i>—a technique which he applied to all of the diseases he described, from goitre through to epilepsy—has not been acknowledged. It is this topic addressed below. </p>

<p>Charcot's chosen field of neurology was a new branch of medicine. His focus on the dynamic function of the body in time and space forced Charcot to find new ways to represent these essentially <i>performative</i> disorders.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The need for a novel form of medical representation and analysis brought the work of Charcot and his associates dangerously close to theatrical and para-theatrical aesthetics via the creation of a new multi-media style whose dynamically embodied, live form echoed that of the living, neurological body which was its subject. Charcot was an accomplished dramaturge whose refusal to employ elaborate rhetorical flourishes within his personal presentation constituted in itself a highly mannered performance of rationalist, scientific authority. A close study of the discourse which surrounds Charcot's work reveals that this project contained within it the possibility for inversion, with Charcot's "science" being read as a form of implicitly fictional "theatre," more closely allied to such sensationalistic precedents as Étienne-Gapsard Robertson's phantasmagoria of the 1780s, than to the secure, Positivist propriety which French medicine otherwise sought to project.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Spectators such as Platel perceived this formal contradiction, likening the neuropathologist's presentations to the arational, melodramatic aesthetics advocated by various dramaturges like Richard Wagner and others. </p>

<p>Charcot presented two distinct lecture series. There was the fully-prepared, afternoon, <i>vendredi</i> (Friday) lessons, offered as part of the Faculty of Medicine courses. The second was the morning, <i>mardi</i> (Tuesday) lessons—in addition to other less formalised presentations [<a href="#1">re 1</a>].<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Each lasted for approximately two hours: slightly longer than a short play.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Charcot and others emphasised the improvised nature of the <i>mardi</i> stream, in which he interviewed subjects who had ostensibly been chosen that morning from the clinical admissions of the hospice (<i>la policlinique</i>).<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  A comparison of the published lectures from both streams, the patients who appeared, and Charcot's detailed notes however shows that the "improvised" quality of the <i>mardi</i> presentations was considerably exaggerated. 

<b></b>

 In both cases, Charcot's speech closely corresponded with his notes, which he recited from memory, and both covered similar topics and used much the same theatrical machinery (slides, casts and so on).<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  The distinction between the two streams was therefore primarily a matter of their rhetorical framing. In both situations, Charcot consciously strove to manipulate the dramaturgy to best serve his aims. Charcot may not have actually plunged "right in" and proceeded "just as I do in my own practice" before the eyes of the audience at his <i>mardi</i> lectures. He nevertheless successfully maintained the <i>illusion</i> that this was what he did.</p>

<p>Sigmund Freud (who studied at the Salpêtrière 1885–1886) was particularly impressed by this aspect of the neuropathologist's pedagogy.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Freud observed that Charcot portrayed the true difficulties of clinical practice in the latter's more informal lessons. This was not the "Dogmatic" Charcot of the <i>vendredi</i> lessons, but rather a highly skilled yet humble physician, visible in all his fallibility. If the Friday lectures represented the summit of medical scenography, then the Tuesday demonstrations offered a glimpse into the more problematic, haphazard backstage world of actual diagnostic practice. The <i>mardi</i> presentations functioned through a process of deliberately crafted demystification, akin to Bertolt Brecht's later articulation of <i>gestic</i> theatre or the defamiliarisation of the theatrical process as aid to the conscious, rationalist understanding of causes 

<b></b>

 (<i>gestus</i>).<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Just as the patients' diseases were only fully manifest in real time, open to the exigencies of the moment yet nevertheless following a predictable pattern known to the physician, the same was true of Charcot's own discourse. </p>

<p>The use of curial terms such as "Dogmatic" and <i>"ex cathedra"</i> by Charcot and Freud gave the lectures an aura akin to a respectful community of shared worship—in this case to the god of rationalist science. As Freud put it, Charcot: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>would put aside his authority on occasion and admit—in one case that he could arrive at no diagnosis and in another that he had been deceived by appearances; and he never appeared greater to his audience than when, by giving the most detailed account of his processes of thought and by showing the greatest frankness about his doubts and hesitations, he had thus sought to narrow the gulf between teacher and pupil.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->





<p class="continued">By showing "his doubts and hesitations," the professor transformed both himself and science itself into res comparable to the heroes of classical tragic theatre: protagonists aware of their own limited, human powers, and hence heroic. Charcot crafted himself as an immensely sympathetic character, narrowing "the gulf between teacher and pupil"; between the papal chair (<i>cathedra</i>) and the seated congregation in "his audience." </p>

<p>Charcot's performance style therefore effected a double movement: it demonstrated the awesome powers of modern science at mastering the mysteries of the nervous tissues while simultaneously rendering visible the fraught, provisional nature of scientific truth and medical diagnosis. Charcot's theatre was at once seductive in its impressive theatrical display of scientific praxis, while simultaneously reminding the spectators that the fundamental principles upon which neurological dramaturgy was based were accessible to all with proper training. </p>

<p>The lecture theatre provided the ideal site for the dissemination of knowledge about the living, moving body. Public presentations alone were nevertheless not sufficient to establish an academic career. One of the problems facing Charcot and his fellow neurologists was how to transfer their work into <i>textual</i> form. </p>

<p>Salpêtrière <i>chef de clinique</i> Joseph François Felix Babinski provided the most detailed discussion of the difficulties involved in putting Charcot's lectures onto the page. In his "Preface" to Charcot's published Tuesday lessons, Babinski related that a 

<b></b>

 Viennese student was disappointed by a visit he made to the clinic of a famous German physician. The German did not appear to have "a single original" unpublished "idea" and that "reading his books" was "enough to know him." The German was most likely Ernest Kraepelin, while the Viennese student may have been Freud. The Viennese narrator implied that the medical techniques which Charcot dramatised within the Tuesday lessons defied written documentation. To fully "know" Charcot and his method one had to personally attend the lectures. Babinski continued that: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>It is for these … reasons that MM. Blin, Charcot <i>fils,</i> and [Henri] Colin . . . have thought . . . that publishing these Tuesday lessons would be a significant service . . . It will be greeted with the greatest satisfaction by those who have attended the classes and happily can relive them.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->





<p class="continued">Babinski nevertheless remained reluctant to concede that a close transcription of Charcot's <i>mardi</i> lessons could displace the authorial presence and medical knowledge which Charcot developed through theatrical presence. Babinski concluded that: "Without replacing the speech of the professor, the reading of these new lessons permits everyone . . . to better know the ideas of <i>le maître</i> and to broaden their own [understanding of them], as the Viennese doctor thought."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The text did not therefore replace the professor's voice; rather it <i>supplemented</i> it, expanding (<i>"d'élargir"</i>) both his ideas and the circle of his acolytes. Lecture-scripts remained an imperfect record of pedagogic performance, just as the textual description of the cadaver was an imperfect record of dynamic, living neurophysiology. </p>

<p>The disappointment of the Viennese doctor echoes Jacques Derrida's model of phonological discourse.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  So long as authority was closely tied to the thoughts and opinions of a single, phenomenologically real author—as was the case during the nineteenth century—the written text served primarily to register traces of an <i>absent</i> authority and an absent body. Only the author could (literally) breathe life into the text by speaking its words. This was particularly true of Charcot's discourse, where the subject of his speech was embodied neurological behaviour. Not only was Charcot's own authority made physically manifest by his presence as a speaker, but so also was the subject of his discourse enacted and performed by patients through movement. There was therefore a close parallel between how one gained access to the topic of Charcot's discourse itself (watching the patient perform), and how one gained access to Charcot's own discourse (listening to the author speak). </p>

<p>As Charcot himself explained, his purpose in delivering his lectures was: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>to place before your eyes anatomical specimens with which you are able to study the imperfections revealed by the naked eye. In their absence, I will present you with plates . . . No doubt a good plate, no matter how faithful it is, can never completely replace the direct contemplation of the diseased organ; but . . . since one is able to hold [the plate] always before one's eyes, it offers the advantage of quickly and efficaciously fixing one's memories which fade quickly if one does not have the opportunity of frequently reviving them.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 

<b></b></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">

 Charcot's discourse put into relief the very tensions which he sought to overcome. Photography and illustration were characterised as both superior <i>and</i> inferior to the theatrical viewing of the living body. The neuropathologist extolled photography for enabling one to see that which was difficult to revive, while simultaneously conceding that images could only stand in for the body. Photographs acted merely as mnemonic aids. The photograph was able to remain "always before our eyes"—yet ideally so too would the body itself. Photography took over only "when one does not have the opportunity" to stage pathologies before one's eyes. The amphitheatre therefore served as the privileged but nevertheless ambiguous site for the genesis, authorship and dissemination of Charcot's discourse. Charcot's methodology remained inescapably theatrical, even in its <i>textual</i> representation. </p>

<p>In the words of Charcot's immediate successor to the chair of neurology, Fulgence Raymond, Charcot first carried out his own "mnemonic exercise" in learning the complete text of what he was to say. Following this: "That which was engraved in his mind, he set himself the task of penetrating into the minds of his listeners and engraving it there also."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Ultimately it was not the illustrated pages of Charcot's published texts that served as the primary site for the re-transcription of Charcot's lectures. Rather the minds of those present in the amphitheatre acted as the primary slate or <i>site of audience</i> for Charcot's medical pedagogy. As Charcot's former student Moses Allen Starr observed: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>It has been said that the whole clinic was arranged for theatrical effect. I believe that was the only manner in which it was possible to demonstrate in a clear light . . . all of the features, clinical and pathological, of the subject. But grant that it was theatrical; it left on the mind of the students a series of mental pictures of patients and of lessons which no amount of private study could possibly produce. It taught men so that they could not fail to remember.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">The arrangement of images and forms in space constituted a spectacular, mnemonic system similar to the theatre of memory advocated by Cicero and other classical rhetoricians.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  One recalled concepts through the logical placement of visual keys located within specific spaces found within a virtual, mental theatre. Starr and others felt that Charcot transposed the manifest dramaturgy of the physical demonstrations onto the immaterial architecture of the audience's psyche—"it left on the mind of the students a series of mental pictures" such that "they could not fail to remember." </p>

<p>The venue within which lectures of both streams were eventually held was designed to meet Charcot's needs.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  A theatre was built at the Salpêtrière for Charcot's lectures and it was in use by 1880.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Audience members entered at the rear and descended from the back row, filling the seating from the front. Grand, lavishly decorated structures in the style of Renaissance dissection theatres were still employed at institutions such as the Paris Medical Faculty building.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Charcot's venue though was not in fact a true amphitheatre, nor did it feature any superfluous adornments. It was rather a long rectangular hall, more akin to a spartan performing arts building than a conventional anatomy theatre [<a href="#2">res 2</a>—4]. If one removed the proscenium arch found at sites such as the modest <i>Théâtre Libre</i> (founded by modernist dramaturg André Antoine and supported by Charcot's former student Léon Daudet) one would have had a comparable space.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  X from <i>Les annales politiques et littéraires</i> somewhat melodramatically described the auditorium as follows:<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The amphitheatre is a long room, of which perhaps one half is occupied by tiers. All of the windows are hermetically sealed and locked. Not a ray of daylight comes in to pierce . . . the dark light of the gas lamps with their frosted globes. The high walls painted in red give this light a special quality . . . in the other part of the room [on the stage itself], several rows of chairs face in upon themselves [i.e. in a semi-circle], surrounding a modest space, reserved for the professor, his subjects and his aides; two little tables with a few instruments for electricisation, demonstration illustrations, a large blackboard, this is the entire <i>mise en scène.</i><sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->





<p class="continued">Although the space had a claustrophobic air, it was not entirely "sealed," as X put it. Heavy coverings were fitted to the windows. Starr noted that it was only "After the audience had gathered" that the "dark shutters were closed at the windows, the footlights were turned up, and the clinic began." He added that "sometimes, when a particular feature had to be demonstrated, a calcium light"—or limelight—"was turned on the patient, whose re" became "the chief point of light in the darkness" and consequently "could always be perfectly seen by all."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Many commentators echoed Starr in extolling the modernity of the amphitheatre's stage machinery. The venue was fitted with various equipment not uncommon at theatre venues and magic lantern displays since the 1850s. Charcot's main innovation was the introduction of these mechanisms within the specific context of <i>medical</i> display. The lighting for example was controlled by a central dimmer which enabled Charcot to darken the foyer, a convention which Antoine later pioneered at the <i>Théâtre de l'Odéon.</i><sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Electrical slide projections and limelight spots could then be deployed to full effect. As Starr explained, this rendered the demonstration subject "the chief point of light in the darkness."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Charcot seems to have used Léon Laurent's relatively novel design for an electrically-powered "megascope" or slide projector (and not a limelight- or gas-powered magic lantern; <a href="#5">re 5</a>), thus adding a more explicit level of modernity to his otherwise piecemeal use of theatrical tools and new technologies.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The descriptions of journalists such as Pont-Calé from <i>Les hommes d'aujourd'hui</i> and of X, as well as that of Starr, indicated that the lighting of the space overall had

a dismal, high-relief, almost Gothic tone. Even when natural light was allowed into the room, the dark colour of the walls tended to absorb it, rather than diffusing it throughout the venue. Pont-Calé opined that: "The high walls painted in red lend their own gloomy note to that obscurity."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  When the directional lighting of the floor lamps and spots was deployed, however, the objects captured by the glare took on a harsh, bleached aspect, leaping forward within the viewer's depth of field. Platel similarly found the lighting extremely bright and consistent with the anatomical style of the lecture presentations themselves: "The smallest details of the scene are beaten into tiny fragments [<i>découpés à l'emporte-pièces</i>], under the bluish steam and rawness of the gas."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Charcot's stage machinery tended therefore to cast the body into a stark, high-contrast relief, vividly demarcating the shadows from illuminated clarity. Light took on a poetic function, rendering illness visibly comprehensible and banishing darkness to the margins of the space.</p>

<p>One notable concession to decoration within this harsh, gloomy ambience ("the only adornment in the room," as one author put it) was located on the wall behind the stage.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  This was Robert Fleury's salon painting <i>Pinel déliverant les aliénées de la Salpêtrière de leur chaînes</i> (1876; <a href="#6">re 6</a>)—an iconographic model which André Brouillet paraphrased in his own, later salon painting of Charcot: <i>Une leçon clinique à la Salpêtrière</i> (1887; <a href="#1">re 1</a>). The presence of Fleury's painting in the amphitheatre helped to establish a metaphoric link between the pioneering work carried out at the Salpêtrière after the Revolution by the alienist Phillippe Pinel, with Charcot's later, more anatomically-based discourse.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Excepting this iconographic set-piece, the unadorned

aesthetic of Charcot's theatre was consistent with the project of rationalism itself, being stripped back of superfluous details so as to reveal fundamental truths caught in the bright light of science. This was moreover notably different from the ambience created by the neo-classical ornamentation at the Faculty of Medicine amphitheatre. </p>

<p>As noted above, long wooden benches rested on tiered seating banks extending from the rear wall of the Salpêtrière amphitheatre, which tapered off at the front with an extended apron one step above the floor itself, before which sat the stage. The seating at the front consisted of nine or more rows of approximately ten to twelve unfixed chairs, which could be added to, subtracted from or moved as circumstances dictated [<a href="#2">res 2</a>—4]. The seats furthest forward were often used by the <i>chefs de clinique.</i> On some occasions: "On the slightly raised stage with the <i>chef de clinique</i> appeared some favoured spectators, placed near the actors as in the past were the <i>grands seigneurs</i> at the theatre."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Charcot often delivered his text from a seated position—literally <i>"ex cathedra"</i>—or stood side-on, his much commented upon likeness to Napoleon clearly visible in profile. The patients sat slightly behind him on the stage, illuminated by foot lights or adjustable spots.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Charcot's audience was typically mixed, with students and physicians joined by foreign guests, res from the <i>École des beaux-arts,</i> artists, actors, authors, socialites, journalists and politicians.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Notable spectators included Freud, Jules Clarétie (a friend of Charcot, former medical student and administrator of the <i>Comédie Française</i>), the professor of artistic anatomy at the <i>École,</i> Mathias Duval, senior Republican politician Léon Gambetta and his protégé René Waldeck-Rosseau, writers and dramaturges such as Léon and Alphonse Daudet, Émile Zola, Paul Arène, Guy de Maupassant, Edmond de Goncourt, and other intellectuals such as Hippolyte Taine, Emile Durkheim and Henri Bergson. The lectures were not completely open to the public. Most observers obtained an introduction of some kind, though visiting Glasgow physician Jane Henderson simply walked in off the street after asking for directions.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  The audience was nevertheless drawn predominantly from the same well-to-do society within which the Salpêtrière physicians themselves circulated.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Female medical students, <i>mondaines</i> and actresses such as Sarah Bernhardt (who toured the wards of the Salpêtrière) also constituted a highly visible minority, with several commentators disparagingly drawing attention to their presence—notably Charcot's disgruntled former student Axel Munthe.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  For Munthe and others, the very audience at Charcot's lectures caused the neurologist's work to too closely approximate a theatrical performance. </p>

<p>Charcot was a creature of habit in both his personal and professional life. The lessons began punctually and conserved a high degree of standardisation in general format. Anticipating a prompt commencement—as well as competition for seating—spectators often arrived over thirty minutes early.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Charcot's famed indifference to elaborate expressions of politeness and his cultivated "mask" of objectivity gave the proceedings a powerfully ritualised character—akin to a religious or Masonic ceremony—which reporters commented upon.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  X for example noted that expectant audience members would talk amongst themselves, when "a door is brusquely opened, the murmur ceases, all eyes turn towards the master."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  <i>Les hommes d'aujourd'hui</i> recorded that after 

<b></b>

 this: "The master moves forward with a slightly heavy step, followed by a cortege of students, the legendary aprons"—part of the physicians' uniform—"tied about their waists."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Senior medics like Charcot or the head of the Salpêtrière electrotherapy unit, Romain Vigouroux, often further reinforced their institutional standing through their costume with the addition of their academic caps. This opening procession was arrayed according to medical seniority. First came Charcot, then the heads of the specialist departments at the Salpêtrière (ophthalmology, photography, histology, hydrotherapy, electrotherapy), any special guests, the general <i>chefs de clinique,</i> interns and then the undergraduate externs and those who tended to the patients on a day-to-day basis.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  This opening display of medical hierarchy constituted a mutually supportive, physical reiteration of authority. The credentials visible in the entrance helped authorise the lecture series, which in turn bolstered the power and hierarchy of the medics themselves. The procession rendered in moving flesh the status of the Salpêtrière as a "neuro-pathological Institute," made up of various specialist facilities.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The diseased subjects were the last to enter. Henderson observed that the "patients who are to form the text of the clinical lecture" waited in an anteroom off-stage, or "behind screens till the time comes for them to come forward," at which point they shuffled out or were "carried and deposited on chairs."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Illustrations show that decorated Chinese screens such as were common in fashionable Parisian homes were used for this purpose, with these stage elements doubtless brought in from one of the doctors' offices near the amphitheatre (most likely Charcot's; <a href="#7">re 7</a>).<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Like the screens behind which they were sequestered, the patients remained essentially inactive sculptural elements within Charcot's dramaturgy, worked upon rather than constituting active participants. As historian Christopher Goetz observes: <i>"Charcot treated the patient like an inert object in the laboratory,"</i> frequently speaking "in front of the patients as though he was speaking in front of cadavers."<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  Charcot's presentations were therefore theatrically closer to monologues, such as was the typical form of address for contemporary magic lantern demonstrations, than they were to the dialogic form of most theatre. </p>

<p>Through such methods, the performing body was ordered and contained, its theatrical possibilities rendered according to Charcot's model of rationalist <i>gestus.</i> The content and form of Charcot's lectures resembled in this sense what Tom Gunning and André Gaudreault have described in the case of the first showings of the Lumière brothers' filmic <i>actualités</i> as a "spectacle of attractions."<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  At the Salpêtrière, the role of the lecturer-demonstrator—or <i>monstrator</i> in Gaudreault's terms—was to de-sensationalise, rationalise and discursively master the often shocking physical deformations and diseases which Charcot placed upon display.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Daudet however made it clear with his monstrously carnal medical satire of <i>Les Morticoles</i>  that he did not accept Charcot's de-sensationalising model. Rather, he argued that lectures such as those of the Salpêtrière provided a licence for depraved, pseudo-medical theatricality. Within the novel, he related how a patient fell "to the ground screaming" before commencing the "disorderly gymnastics" which Charcot claimed constituted the chief diagnostic sign of hysteria. This performance caused 

<b></b>

 several audience members to "get up to see better. Others cry <i>Sit down!</i> and <i>Hat!</i> at a sign from his boss," Charcot's fictional assistant "stems the attack," after which the "thaumaturge continues," while some of the junior students in the lecture hall attempted to "choke back their laughter."<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Charcot and his peers were deemed by Daudet and his sympathisers to be unable to fully defuse the performativity inherent in such neuropsychological illnesses, particularly those most complicated, performative syndromes which fell under Charcot's care—namely hysterioepilepsy, Tourette's syndrome and chorea. For Daudet, Platel and others, Charcot was subsumed within the frame of his presentations, becoming a harsh, Wagnerian thaumaturge who instigated an absurd, chaotic, para-medical melodrama.</p>

<blockquote class="disp-quote-epigraph">

<p>Charcot's speech was not without its flourishes. His German peer Ernst von Leyden, for example, commended the neuropathologist's use of "such sharp, striking, living expressions, for example: <i>accentuated speech</i> [<i>parole scandée</i>], <i>stepping walk</i> [<i>marche steppante</i>]."<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  Even more notable was what medical biographer A. Lubimoff called "the singular aptitude of M. Charcot" at "reproducing" illnesses through "gestures 

<b></b>

 and general appearance [<i>allure</i>]. In the pathetic moments, his voice had a timbre as attractive as a baritone making grave intonations."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  Other commentators went so far as to describe the neuropathologist as a "skilled scientific actor" on the basis of his ability "to show the gait characteristic of various nervous disorders, or describe with his hands different forms of choreiform movements."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Although Charcot leavened his presentation with moments of accomplished physical and vocal mimesis, these periods of high drama constituted dynamic interjections within an overall sedate aesthetic in which such dramatic materials as hysterioepilepsy and gross deformity were calmly monstrated to the audience—diseases were simply shown and then verbally emplotted within Charcot's scientific discourse. To achieve this effect, Charcot generally eschewed dramatic or oratorical demonstrations of authority in his own deportment and speech. Charcot's leading student Georges Gilles de la Tourette, for example, reflected that as an undergraduate Charcot had initially performed poorly in oral examinations: "Nothing was less suited to Charcot's temperament than such oratorical jousting where high-sounding words replace arguments of a scientific order."<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  The assessment of Charcot's performative temperament provided by later Salpêtrière neurologist Georges Guillain was also consistent with that of Tourette.<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  Guillain noted that Charcot had a "horror of" exaggerated "emphasis," just as he despised: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>commonplaces. His language was slow, his diction impeccable; he did not use gestures and sat as much as he stood. His exposé was always remarkably clear.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->





<p>Contemporary journalists also found Charcot's oratory modest. X reported of Charcot for example that: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>His voice is somewhat dull [<i>sourde</i>]; the speech is clear, precise, not meticulously arranged, sometimes slightly hesitant. But the master delays little in choosing words, he speaks simply, the elevation always comes from the subject.</p>
<p>With a few very short phrases, he poses the problem to be resolved, the question to be studied, and immediately introduced the living examples . . . one listens only to his voice, monotonous like that of a puppeteer of wax res<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">—these waxes being the closely-directed patients whom Charcot described. X felt that "the professor is self-effacing," tending to subside into the background and let the subject matter speak for itself: "he contents himself with being a great demonstrator."<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  This meant that spectators rarely kept their eyes upon the neuropathologist, or even necessarily upon such attractions as his patients, but instead "one listens only to his voice," gazing about distractedly as one attended to this plain, disembodied monologue suffusing the space. </p>

<p>The importance of Charcot's <i>speech</i> over his physical <i>performance</i> or even his use of <i>images</i> was particularly emphasised in Henderson's account: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Charcot's voice was not at all strong, so that the raised seats were too far away [for it] to be appreciated, and the majority of the students came as near as possible to the front, 

<b></b>

 even although [sic] the view of the platform was apt to be obscured by the heads of those before them.<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">For these audience members, Charcot's slides, sketches and specimens were far less significant than his vocal text. Accounts such as these show that, despite Charcot's famous innovations in spectacular presentation (see below), his monstration was often judged to be primarily <i>aural</i> and <i>conceptual,</i> strongly in keeping with his uncompromisingly rationalist, Positivist stance, and in opposition to the more extravagant aesthetics of both the popular and the <i>beaux arts</i> entertainments of the period. </p>

<p>Charcot's authority was not attributable to the "attractive" qualities of either his vocal or linguistic expression itself. As Charcot's former student Paul-Aimé-Desiré Peugniez observed, Charcot lacked the oratorical skills for which Hôtel Dieu lecturer Armand Trousseau or Hospital Necker demonstrator Charles Lasègue were renowned. Charcot was in fact a slightly boring and banal presenter—his style echoing the unremitting, unalloyed truth he revealed. As Raymond noted, Charcot: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>appealed primarily by means of a language stripped of all useless research, but with a clarity of expression, in harmony with the clarity of the thinking . . . a language seductive in its simplicity, and where each word had its proper value.<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Echoing both Raymond and Tourette, Platel ungenerously (but accurately) observed that: "He goes over his descriptions [<i>épithètes</i>] with his dull voice and drives the argument into the brain of his listeners, heavily and dully,—as one drives in a nail with a large block of wood."<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  As X observed, the "elevation" came "from the subject," and not from Charcot's <i>performance.</i> </p>

<p>For these and other commentators, Charcot's presentation style was deemed superior to those of Lasègue and Trousseau because of its <i>lack</i> of rhetorical enhancements. Charcot's personal presentation constituted a form of deliberate <i>non-performance</i>—in the words of historian Georges Didi-Huberman, "a spectacle without <i>mise en scène"</i>—a performative technique which (ironically) established the very mastery which Charcot refused to overtly display.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  This created a clear dramaturgical distinction between Charcot and his more extroverted, mumbling, staggering or fitting patients. Charcot's theatrical framing was simultaneously spectacular yet banal, effecting a contradictory balance between artifice and science. </p>

<p>Dismissing the patient, he would begin to describe the lesion, and at once on the screen on the opposite side of the stage the magic lantern would flash out the picture he wished to show, either in the form of a sketch made from nature, or an actual slide of a section of the spinal cord, or part of the brain magnified by the microscope, or a photograph of some unusual clinical type.</p>

<p>Charcot's most famous theatrical demonstration involved the differential identification of illnesses exhibiting symptomatic trembling. Charcot brought on stage patients suffering from paralysis agitans (Parkinson's disease), locomotor ataxia (tabes) and chorea. Raymond observed that: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>By various ingenious artifices, he sometimes amplified a symptom to produce specific characteristics . . . [including a] bizarre but instructive collection of trembling patients, provided with head gear terminating in long rods, and which Charcot presented . . . to demonstrate the oscillatory characteristics of the diverse varieties of tremors.<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->





<p class="continued">Feathers at the tip of each rod wavered distinctively according to the illness in question. Charcot demonstrated the "specific character" of Parkinson's by having assistants hold the subjects about the trunk. When the upper body of a Parkinson's sufferer was stabilised, the feather remained still—which was not true of the patients afflicted with other illnesses. The apparent head tremor of Parkinson's was therefore a secondary consequence of vibrations which originated in the trunk, showing Parkinson's to be a distinct disease entity associated with a loss of neuromuscular control centred in the torso. </p>

<p>These feather-topped hats constituted merely the most flamboyant device Charcot employed in these contexts. Another commonly rehearsed identifying mark involved the separation of intention tremor (loss of precise control over transitory voluntary actions) from persistent, involuntary tremor. The standard test was to have the patient attempt to drink a glass of water. Otherwise coordinated subjects often exhibited a marked tremor during such an action. The intention tremor of those afflicted with sclerosis in plaques (multiple sclerosis) helped distinguish them from sufferers of paralysis agitans, who exhibited a tremor while at rest.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  Other physical examinations performed in the amphitheatre included walking, writing, holding one's arms horizontally, or attempting to balance with the eyes closed (Romberg's sign). Charcot's presentations conformed in this sense to a tautological pattern of orally telling, then visually showing through the directed actions of the patient, and then further explication in words. </p>

<p>These diagnostic tests constituted, in Raymond's words above, a form of performative <i>amplification.</i> As in a sketched caricature (a form of illustration at which Charcot excelled),<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  the neuropathologist exaggerated the apparent scale of, or relative focus upon, various physical signs in order to make them more visible to the viewer. To manipulate the audience's attention, the physician utilised hand drawn illustrations, theatrical lighting, commentary and the direction of on stage action to dramaturgically <i>change the apparent proportions of the body</i> in such a way as to enhance his pedagogic demonstration and diagnosis. </p>

<p>Charcot's most influential contribution to medical display was his enthusiastic use of projections. Commentators were quick to proclaim his skilful manipulation of slides as a particularly impressive innovation in scientific pedagogy. It is unclear whether Charcot was the first to use photographic slides in an anatomical context. Slides were nevertheless relatively uncommon formal pedagogical tools at this time.<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>  The sheer quantity of photographic materials associated with the Salpêtrière during 

<b></b>

 Charcot's tenure was without precedent. The photographic laboratory at the hospice produced a vast quantity of images, which were widely disseminated throughout the publications of the Salpêtrière school.<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>  Contemporary commentators made frequent mention of the impressive slide presentations which Charcot gave and this practice continued at the Salpêtrière under Charcot's former student Pierre Marie (professor of neurology 1917–1925), whose talent for audiovisual display was said to surpass even Charcot's.<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Slides from the Salpêtrière photography clinic made up the most overtly modern, rational element within Charcot's iconography. There does not appear to have been a set location from which the slides were cast. Fully-enclosed modern, projection-booths were not common until into the twentieth century, following conventions first established in the cinema, phantasmagoria (moving magic lantern shows) and other forms like Charles-Émile Reynaud's idiosyncratic <i>Théâtre Optique.</i><sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>  The Faculty of Medicine amphitheatre had a bio-box added after Charcot's death, for example. The projector at the Salpêtrière however was visibly present to the audience, being typically directed onto movable stands resting on the stage, to one side of Charcot and the subjects [<a href="#3">res 3</a>, 5 &amp; 7].<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  The distance of throw was short and so images would have been bright and sharp, but relatively small. The theatre could also be fitted with a translucent cyclorama for more impressive displays, but there is no indication that Charcot took advantage of this possibility. Charcot's presentations were therefore notable not so much for the integrated scale of their effects, as for the number of slides, their flow and what Guillain described as the "luminous clarity" which they permitted. </p>

<p>Even more than the literal body which had been "beaten into tiny fragments" by the limelight, the projected photographic image enabled a transmutation—a <i>transration</i>—of the body into its immaterial, nosological characteristics. These elements constituted a veritable inverse panopticon, beaming out images with which Charcot enabled his audience to see through the eyes of observers past and present, arraying historic works of art depicting deformities and fits alongside his own representations of modern patients.<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>  Images lifted from the retina of this unblinking, all-seeing composite eye were distributed throughout the space of the amphitheatre. </p>

<p>The body-made-fleshless through projection—a body of pure light—was arrayed beside these numerous other iconographic representations, reifying the body even as Charcot established his mastery of it. As Starr's account at the top of this section suggested, slides not only enabled one to compare different physical fragments, but also to metaphorically look <i>within</i> the body of the patient in question, revealing the causes of these dynamic diseases of movement in tissue damage and other anatomical phenomena. The subject was dismissed from the theatre and the interiority of the pathological body displayed. No sooner was the body of the living patient presented on stage than it was replaced by its iconographic representation in the form of photographs, postmortem preparations, verbal explications and other materials [<a href="#5">res 5</a>, 7 &amp; 8].<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>  Charcot's methodology thereby minimised—but did not altogether disallow—the possibility that the live performance of the subject could destabilise his <i>gestic</i> presentation of this material.

<p class="continued">Charcot emerged from these accounts as a highly adept multi-media dramaturge and monstrator who nevertheless, either by choice or from necessity, presented himself in a modest, theatrically uninteresting light—even during his <i>ex cathedral</i> lessons. Charcot attempted to forge a reconciliation between theatrical aesthetics and the new science of neurology. The rhetorical devices which Charcot brought together were not however always compatible, highlighting conflicts which existed between different discursive forms and genres. Charcot's demonstrations constituted an evolved theatrical form which was nonetheless characterised by absences and contradictions. His dramaturgical methodology remained an incomplete one. Neither the lectures themselves nor the published clinical <i>Leçons</i> could fulfil their function alone without the other. The two

 discursive forms existed as part of a performative dialectic, each sustaining (whilst also partly undermining) Charcot's neurological discourse. As Charcot himself conceded, one had to constantly return to the living body in the amphitheatre, this dynamic subject of his discourse often seeming to subvert Charcot's methodology and transform him into a comic subject within his own <i>mise en scène. </i></p>

The anatomy theatre at the Paris School of <i>beaux-arts</i> was intermediate in character, with seven rows of semi-circular, raked benches and no decorative elements within the building's fabric. Various paintings and casts which could be varied at the whim of the demonstrator made up the main adornments. Unlike the amphitheatre at the Salpêtrière, that of the <i>École</i> was lit by natural light to facilitate painting. Charcot's medical peer and supporter Mathias Duval lectured here, 1873–1903, and was succeeded by Charcot's former students and collaborators Paul Richer, 1903–1922, and Henry Meige, 1922–1940. I am currently researching Richer's practice and presentation methodology.

<p id="lead">The following text takes to heart the possibilities opened up by a work like <i>The Cantos</i>. My main argument is the most obvious one—it consists in the design of this paper, in the kind of discipline this paper required in its refusal to say more than it needs to say, its refusal to repeat, rehash, and rephrase (and so appropriate other scholars' work). I have come to a point where it is impossible to go back—either to the idea that literary texts can be transparent and independent of what "container" they come into, or to a practice of criticism and scholarly work which assumes the same transparency for itself. The usual 12 point Times New Roman double-spaced page, which is then inflexibly poured into the template of whatever book or journal, is no longer neutral to my eyes. I see no reason why the objective, distanced, invisible position such page layout implies is often accepted to be the only option, and the resistances which keep it in place (lest we mistake criticism for something else) are yet to be brought to the table, especially as we are no longer dealing mainly with original texts, but with a rich (if not overwhelming) critical heritage on most subjects.  </p>

<p>I am approaching criticism here in an almost combinatorial manner, as a game, a composition of elements. It is not the game of conforming to an institutionalized format and language, although the very desire that drives this text belongs properly to academic discourse. It is giving shape to the story a work can tell. Giving form rather than assuming one. This is why this text lets mostly quotations do the job. The quotations take their place in an argument, which is by definition an incomplete puzzle: white spaces make part of the picture.

Cantos De Luxe
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The facts: the first three editions of Ezra Pound's <i>The Cantos</i> were limited deluxe editions:  </p>

<p>1925: <i>A Draft of XVI. Cantos</i>. (Three Mountains Press, Paris.) </p>

<p>1928: <i>A Draft of Cantos 17–27</i>. (John Rodker, London.) </p>

<p>1930: <i>A Draft of XXX Cantos</i>. (Hours Press, Paris.) </p>

<p>Then, in 1933, Farrar &amp; Rhinehart in New York and  </p>

<p>Faber &amp; Faber in London issued the trade <i>A Draft of XXX Cantos</i>. </p>

<p>From then on, <i>The Cantos</i> came out in trade editions. </p>

<p class="continued">

In their preparation of a revised edition in the 1970s (the project for a definitive edition of <i>The Cantos</i> was ultimately abandoned, for various reasons; see Eastman), the publishers and editors collated editions from the 1930's Hours Press (marginally included) onwards. The so-called "deluxe period" (a phrase which implies more deliberation than it ought to) is also a period of unsuccessful publication. I am not interested here in the textual difficulties of the various editions of <i>The Cantos</i>, even though as a narrow but 

<b></b>

 abysmal area of research I find it fascinating. Here it is a question of design—aesthetic, academic, publishing. </p>

<p>What follows is a series of quotes, which can show the reader various ways in which Ezra Pound thought of deluxe and trade editions, or publishing in general. By way of commentary, let me just say that publishing for Pound was more than a personal issue, though it was often expressed as personal grievance. Getting texts published and distributed ensured that the "good stuff (books)" were kept in circulation. Many of his translations were fueled by the same desire to make available and set in motion ideas and writing techniques. Hence, throughout his life, the anger at publishers who could not see the urgency of getting Fenollosa's essay or Guido's rimes out there.  </p>

<p>I am not going to try to impose a pattern: I don't see any. Jerome McGann sees an aesthetic turn in Pound's publishing history—from Pre-Raphaelite fine printing to industrial "transparent" editions. My doubts about his theory will be voiced locally. Miranda Hickman undermines McGann's claims but searches for ideological reasons for the disappearance of the deluxe editions in Pound's work. My objection to her interpretation is that I cannot imagine a single being guided by consistent strategy in the face of changing conditions—be they economical, social, or literary. Hickman's interpretation appears too neat to fit a life. </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p><i>[On the side: Lawrence Rainey writes: "To theorize concepts of "text" purified of the material complexity in which cultural works are located is to imagine the nonexistent or the unimportant. Theory advances not when it codifies empty abstractions, but when it facilitates fuller accounts." . . . And a little later: "literature is generated not in the bloodless abstraction of language, but in the material practice of writing. Literary studies can advance only through a comprehensive engagement with the entire range of graphic culture, from graffiti to train schedules, inscriptions to advertising. At present literary studies have much to learn from exactly those disciplines that have been considered "ancillary" forms of "lower criticism": disciplines such as paleography, codicology, diplomatics, bibliography, and epigraphy; disciplines engaged with writing as a social practice, not a private encounter with linguistic divinity;" (Monument 5 and 7) The year is 1991. Fifteen years later, from the limited position of observation which my status allows, literary studies appears to be still stuck in a rut. It has even let go of the debate on what literary criticism is for, as if that question belonged to the now historicized field of "literary theory." Writing is a wager (to modify Andre Masson's claim on painting). New themes and new archival research, which have always fed the progress of literary studies, present a safe bet for innovation. But how do we sustain a connection to teaching and active participation in current culture? Borrowing from paleography or turning literary criticism into a branch of the same?]  </i></p>

<p>Both authors seem to assume that there is the "text" and then, there is an "embodiment" or "incarnation" of the text in an edition. But such a "text" can only be supposed, so I would prefer to stay with what is there, in my library, and allow for silence when I have no answer. Both McGann and Hickman ignore the particular circumstances of producing

 the books, which occludes the picture and creates the impression of speaking from a distance, the way we have become used to speaking from a distance and condensing 50 years of life into a couple of gestures or several turns (imagist, vorticist, objectivist, linguistic, pictorial, . . . reflective). I have never been able to live in such terms. To my surprise, I have been easily convinced that they explain well.  </p>

<p><i>[Theories of hypertext have become fond of the word "instantiations", which implies a similar conceptualization of texts: although a (maybe) good description of the way electronic texts function (being reducible to a variated succession of zero's and one's), applied to print, the term "embodied text" forfeits the attempt of critics such as Katherine Hayles to promote media-specific reading. Look closer into the choices the following sentence makes: "Understanding literature as the interplay between form and medium, MSA [media-specific analysis] insists that "texts" must always be embodied to exist in the world" . The moment "embodied" appears on the page, just as "instantiated" or "incarnated text," and I understand perfectly the will to metaphors (though not specifically of religious ones), we reintroduce "the split between physical and verbal" (ib.)

<p>The background: "Pound had located a talented and wealthy American printer in Paris, William Bird. Together with Robert McAlmon, another U.S. expatriate with money to spare, they established the Three Mountains Press. It specialized in fine, limited editions of innovative British and American writing."  </p>

<p>"Another American expatriate, William Bird, a native of Buffalo, New York, started his Three Mountains Press about the same time. While McAlmon's press work was undistinguished, Bird's limited editions were beautifully designed and printed. They were works of art in themselves. He had acquired a massive 18th-century hand press which recaptured the glory of hand printing of an earlier era. </p>

<p><i>[Note that the press was quite old and the "looks" was quite old too. If the machine came from more than a century ago, Pound was excited about a "mss" feel of the edition. He speaks of "magnificence," that is, the appearance of grandeur, which he plays down with the spelling of "dee looks," (also "deLOOKS," "de lookx" and "de muxe" in various letters). The pun translates discomfort? A book of such dimensions (40cm or 15.7" high) and cost is unwieldy.  </i></p>

<p><i>This note is written (by Henri Campbell, an ex-minister and retired bookshop owner) with fascination for small publishing houses. What the author calls "works of art in themselves," I have seen other people describe as "amateurish." Personally, I was unseduced by Bird's book of the XVI Cantos.] </i></p>

<p>In time economic considerations led McAlmon and Bird to combine their operations, and Three Mountains Press lasted only about five years. But these were years of exceptional vitality for the press . . .  </p>

<p>Bird then sold his printing press to Nancy Cunard, a wealthy English expatriate who gave it new life as Hours Press. Cunard also brought forth a remarkable list of books over the four-year period of its existence, including works by Pound and Robert Graves. Parenthetically, in the face of computerized book production today, there is something deeply satisfying in the contemplation of books combining the crispness of hand printing with thoughtful design that characterizes these expatriate press books."

<p>To endow limited deluxe editions (a nineteenth-century invention marking the commodification of books) with subversive potential seems dubious from the beginning. The deluxe cost money and brought money when successful. From this point of view it could have been useful. But as Hugh Kenner notes, "the few who purchased the deluxe editions need not have been <i>readers</i>"  ("useless for new writers").

<p>In other words, the moment commercial publishing houses such as Random House came into the business of the deluxe, it became obvious that it was the small publishers who, usually in closer collaboration with the writers and artists, and by risking the publication of more avant-garde material, were providing all the subversion one could attach to limited editions.

<p>The story of <i>A Draft of XVI. Cantos</i>: </p>

<p>After he returned to Paris, in April 1923, Pound hastened to conclude the Malatesta Cantos. It was at this time that William Bird proposed a deluxe edition of <i>The Cantos.</i> The project was formidable and involved the collaboration of three men: author, publisher, and artist. 

 </p>

	<div class="attrib">
(Rainey [7])
<b></b>

	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

<p>Rainey, showing the attitude of a bibliophile, recognizes the collaborative nature of the deluxe edition. Note that the initiative was taken by Bird. Collectibles are expensive and often profitable. It is in this context that Pound asked Strater to illustrate the book. Henri Strater (Rainey calls him "an improbable choice") was an American painter who acquired brief celebrity around the 1922 Paris Salon d'Autonne.  </p>

<p>Oh well by that time we [Strater, Pound, and Hemingway] were all buddies. He was writing the last of his cantos then, and was thinking about how to print them. He wanted it illuminated . . . he wanted it to be brought out in illuminated form. So he said to me, "Will you do it?" </p>

<p>I said, "Hell no!" </p>

<p>He said, "I don't know anybody else to do them." And he kept at it and persuaded me. I had done a great deal of training in life-size drawing, and I thought maybe I could learn something by trying my hand at these small drawings. Later he had me meet Bill Bird. </p>

	<div class="attrib">
(Strater qtd. in Rainey [8])
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

<p>On the illustrations I'd have several ideas and he'd have several ideas, and we'd agreed on a general subject. Pound saw the first few finished drawings, but didn't see them all in finished form. I didn't show them all to him in the later stages, I'd take them directly to Bill Bird.  </p>

	<div class="attrib">

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>At one point Pound wanted to remove the love knot in the illustrations for Canto IV and Culver, a friend of Strater, reports that Bird refused on the grounds that he would not have asked Pound to change his text either. For Bird apparently the contributions of author and illustrator came under equal rights. </p>

<p>Pound provided ample textual explanations and gave Strater old books on Malatesta (from the 15<sup>th</sup> century). The disagreement of critics how much Pound was actually involved in the illustrations is based on imprecision. The general direction, the illuminated manuscript looks of the volume was definitely decided by Pound and Bird. The particular illustrations and capitals were clearly designed by Strater, and not very successfully. Apart from the difficulties of getting to terms with the medium, Strater never became absorbed or responsive to the Cantos. They were obfuscations or "ob-fus-cu-tra-tion!" (qtd in Rainey [9]). At best, the illustrations duplicated the text, unimaginatively translating keywords into key images. Nowhere does Strater interpret the Cantos in innovative or interesting ways. Does this justify the almost complete erasure of Strater's name when discussing the volume (in McGann, Hickner, Kenner, Read)? Or is it a manner of subsuming under the "intentions" of our main character the wills and abilities of two others? 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>While Kenner never really devotes much attention to the deluxe editions, let us look at McGann's idea about their significance in understanding the story of Pound the writer. </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The descent from the texts of 1925/1928—which culminate Pound's appropriation of his Pre-Raphaelite inheritance—to the industrial text of 1933 was not immediate.  </p>

<p>"Industrial text" probably misleadingly points to means of production, but both deluxe and industrial (note that this opposition does not mean much today, 2007) would have been set in metal type and printed through an automated process (for a picture of Bird's machine see Wilhelm 217). Both were "industrial" texts. And, of course, we know what "industrial" is doing here—it distinguishes between "creative expression" and "mass production."  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">

<p>It is clear that for McGann the deluxe edition makes the standard ND copy more interesting (radially codified), but I don't know if we are to read the two texts in opposition, in comparison, or one through the other ("in face of"?). I have difficulty thinking of transparency ("self-transparency"?) as an apparition, and if it goes away what are we left with? The deluxe overly ornate pages? Or a palimpsest? <i>[How transparent is really the text of ND's </i>Cantos<i>? Given that only the English type for </i>the initials<i> is one and the same throughout the volume, and that because ND held on to a particular style for </i>The Cantos<i> (just as Faber in England did). The ideograms, for example, are in Dorothy Pound's hand in the beginning and in a rather dull standard type by the end. But we will come back to this. Later, later.] </i></p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[A]nd no library in the world holds all the journals and volumes in which <i>The Cantos</i> was progressively issued. The practical problem reflected a larger one: every publication invoked another social code of meaning, another specific set of relations between author, readers, and mediating institutions, just as it involved a broader gesture towards the unity of the work, another promise of wholeness—a totality which was always just beyond the horizon, a future that was always about to be realized.

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p>McGann offers insights into the inevitable bibliographical nature of Pound's <i>Cantos, </i>which contain an intermittent scholarly apparatus within the text—inevitable, as for a large part <i>The Cantos</i> are the author's notes from research (see Kenner on not covering one's traces below), — but McGann's ideas on how to read the poem are undermined by: either a lack of attention to historical detail, or a love for Pre-Raphaelite art.  </p>

<p>Coming fresh out of his research on Malatesta, Pound was looking for the right way to publish <i>The Cantos</i>. He made a profitable but otherwise rather unfortunate choice.  </p>

<p><i>[He attempted to repeat the venture, with clearly financial aims in view, but both the 1928 and the 1930 deluxe editions failed to sell well.] </i></p>

<p>In reality his models were Renaissance books. His reference to William Morris is as a negative example of messiness and illegibility. If Pound's book refers to Morris, it is via Renaissance manuscripts and not the other way round. This story is taking place in Paris, post Vorticism, post Futurism, contemporary with Dada and a nascent Surrealism in comparison to whose publications (often limited editions) Pound's bulky and uneven deluxe is hopelessly out of place.  </p>

<p>It is William Bird who is directly part of a tradition of artisanal printing. Pound's participation is variously motivated—by money, by opportunity, by fascination with old books. How can then <i>A Draft of XVI. Cantos</i> be "a clear historical allusion" to William Morris and the nineteenth-century aesthetic movement (TC 122)? Or how can we say that Pound "wanted to display their [<i>The Cantos]</i> positive relation to late nineteenth-century poetic traditions"  and show "his commitments to bibliographical coding for his work" ? <i>[Rhetorical questions? Has McGann revised his views by now? or is the problem in the attempt to speak from a distance rather than within historical detail?] </i></p>

<p>Although, of course, I would never deny the importance of reading the context of producing a particular book. This is what this article is "about." (For more on the subject see Rogers.) 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>McGann concludes: "Pound's elaborate bibliographical coding rhymes with topics he raises and pursues at the work's linguistic levels . . . Pound's use of the physique of the book in his 1925/1928 edition of the early cantos <i>[note that two editions are collapsed into one here—contradictory gesture from a bibliographical reader]</i> consequently goes far beyond the bibliographical experiments of Mallarmé, Apollinaire, the vorticists, the imagists, and the futurists." (ib. 141) Which claim I have difficulty making sense of. How does one book go "far beyond" another? How do we measure?  </p>

<p>Pause. </p>

<p>He wants an estimate of what it would cost to print the Confucian Anthology ("as you sent me—TEXT, not Mao's comment"). </p>

<p>Characters about as large as enclosed. NOT MORE than 6 columns of 8 [characters] per page. Or 7 if needed to complete a strophe, with 7th column for title. Each poem of the 305 to start on NEW page, no strophe to be broken—if 2 strophes (say 34 characters) won't go entirely on page, then start new page. Verse form to be indicated clearly, by disposition of characters.  </p>

<p>Cost for 2000 copies, leaving bottom ½ page blank for translation &amp; notes. Characters of same verse a little closer. Then break between verses as here between the characters. 8 chs. to fill height here taken by seven. </p>

<p>Sorry this isn't a copy of S.Int. on the better paper. He wants sample of font of type &amp; of paper. </p>

<p> . . . so the shape of the strophe can be seen by american eye. </p>

<p> . . . if verse is 6 characters, the next verse starts on new column. </p>

<p> . . . no verse to be broken at column end, cf. my <i>Cavalcanti</i>. </p>

<p> . . . page size as <i>Integrale</i>, or a little larger. Pages to run occidental fashion.  </p>

<p>Ideograms in Pound pertain to an aesthetic which is more than pictorial and more than etymological. <i>[Graphic? In the full sense of the word.]</i> If at the beginning of the project Pound was excited about imitating a European manuscript look for the text, by Canto XXXIV (first ideogram) the direction seems very different. It is an almost impossible challenge to try to combine Chinese characters with the representational decorative conventions of Renaissance books. These are two different calligraphic traditions. That the two were candidates for <i>the Cantos</i> is evident not only in the various attempts at decorative initials, but also in the surviving tailpieces and dingbats designed at different points by Dorothy Shakespear (of which the fish above is an example).

<p>I am not trying to reduce the ideograms to illustrations. Rather, I am trying to elevate illustrations to ideograms. When Gaudier-Brzeska was able to see a horse in the written character, he, we deduce, knew how to look. If you ask a mechanic to look at the technical drawing of an engine, s/he will be able to tell you how the engine is supposed to work. For you the drawing may remain a beautiful abstract image, or become meaningful in a different way, if you learn the technique.

<p><i>[When Bruce Mau, the Canadian book designer, imagines a utopian work process "</i>where the creation of content and form are in dialogue from start to finish<i>" and where "</i>we are not sure . . . whether this [would mean] the end of design, or . . . that designers become authors, or authors become designers, or all three<i>," a similar push for acquiring new technique is implied. How much of our approach to critical work is predetermined by Microsoft Word, which we still use as a typewriter? What would happen if instead of Word one learned to write in another program, such as Adobe InDesign?] </i></p>

<p>If the example of technical drawing seems far-fetched, take something closer: handwriting and calligraphy. To understand the significance of the calligraphic gesture (for calligraphy is also an art of movement) is it enough to just look at it? Can one learn how to appreciate the traces left by the brush—the record of a gesture, but also of an author, a tradition, and so on? Yes. It depends on the context of looking, and on the state of mind with which one approaches. In this respect <i>The Cantos</i> are surprisingly consistent. The ideograms are always part of what critics have called "associative complexes" within which the ideograms can be looked at to some effect. After all, the poet developed only a Confucian "terminology" (Kenner 452), not a whole language for the reader to learn.

<p>Pound told his daughter not to worry about what she didn't understand immediately in the poem. For a while at least he believed that he had provided "the key," if there was need for any. From the example of "dawn" &amp; "sun" (the ideograms) it appears that he was trying to teach something by way of illustration. If one notices that the ideograms repeatedly appear surrounded by the words "sun," and "dawn", is it possible not to see a sun in their shape? So, part of the concept of <i>the Cantos</i> has to do with how to look at drawing/writing, that is, how to read. Reading begins with an awareness of the process (intellectual, mechanical and physical) of writing. The ideograms are there also as lessons in visual aesthetics, but the kind of visual aesthetics which has everything 

<b></b>

 to do with writing. This is one way of understanding why Pound did not care for corrections, but cared for more Chinese characters.This is one way of explaining why Strater's or Hynes's illustrations remain external illustrations, and have no chance of becoming integral to the text.</p>

<p>With her alphabet one can speak of typography in a modern sense of the word. That she never finished the alphabets she was working on is our loss.  </p>

<p>Dorothy Pound's techniques (with her assured lines) are analogous to Pound's incorporation of ideograms, which makes her initials successful in a functional sense. It is not about decorating the page. It is about what goes well—is "good to look at"—in <i>The Cantos</i>.  </p>

<p>The machines her designs feature are represented "artistically"—they are not precise and do not follow conventions of technical drawing. [Compare to Josef Albers's admonition that while to see how "1 + 1 = 3 or more" may be good for the imagination, it may not be good when shopping or building a bridge, which describes well the difference between "artistic" and "technical" in this context.] They alternate internal and external views of machine parts, returning to the point of view of the machine as form, an undertaking apparently shared with Pound:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"It seems possible that any man intending to practice the plastic arts; or to know excellent from mediocre or inefficient in the plastic arts might, in our time, more readily awaken his eye by looking at spare parts and at assembled machinery than by walking through galleries . . . not because a rolling press is necessarily a more pleasing spectacle than a wall painted by Cosimo Tura, but because people, as we now know them, can hardly look at anything as <i>form.</i>" </p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Pound was collecting images of spare machine parts for a project on "machine art." Some of these may have very well served Dorothy Pound in designing the initials. But the main merit of her letters is that they achieve a transition between letters and drawings, between representational form and abstract form, without narrowly (narratively) interpreting the poem: to be more precise, without interpreting the part of <i>The Cantos</i> that one can paraphrase. Of course, Dorothy Pound's designs, which never made it to print in her time, remain the domain of limited editions. But Pound's <i>Cantos</i> is already decorated, perhaps not as amply as Pound may have wanted to but certainly enough.  </p>

<p id="lead">

In "<i>Ulysses</i>, Order, and Myth," T. S. Eliot declares that the role of art in modern times is to provide a coherent "scaffolding"—the "mythical method" in Joyce's case—for a world that is itself meaningless.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Eliot's contemporaries and critical descendants also emphasize the "hard" and firmly delineated quality of modernist writing. It must be "the definite and the concrete," "<i>exact</i>," "objective," "<i>particular</i>"; its "watchword . . . is Precision"; it must seek "to refine, to clarify, to intensify"; it must avoid anything resembling symbolism's "mushy technique"—above all, it must not be "vague."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  But are concrete and precise really the best adjectives to describe works like Joyce's "damned monster-novel"?<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Virginia Woolf offered a very different view of modern fiction when she recorded her revelation while writing <i>Jacob's Room</i>: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>happier today than I was yesterday having this afternoon arrived at some idea of a new form for a new novel. . . For I re that the approach will be entirely different this time: no scaffolding; scarcely a brick to be seen; all crepuscular, but the heart, the passion, humour, everything as bright as fire in the mist.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->





<p class="continued">Woolf's plan for <i>Jacob's Room</i> explicitly challenges Eliot's contention that literature ought to provide an objective "scaffolding. 

<b></b>

" But what exactly is the "new form" for the "new novel"? And what would it mean for a novel to be "crepuscular"? </p>

<p>On the twenty-fifth of November 1922, a few months after the publication of both <i>Ulysses</i> and <i>Jacob's Room</i>, Bertrand Russell delivered a paper entitled "Vagueness" in front of a small group at Oriel College at Oxford University.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In contrast to Eliotic precision, Russell lamented that he "propose[d] to prove that all language is vague and therefore my language is vague." He stated: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>You all know that I invented a special language with a view to avoiding vagueness, but unfortunately it is unsuited for public occasions. I shall therefore, though regretfully, address you in English, and whatever vagueness is to be found in my words must be attributed to our ancestors for not having been predominately interested in logic.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Russell claimed to regret addressing his audience in English because of its "vagueness." "We can see an ideal of precision [in English], to which we can approximate indefinitely," he asserted, "but we cannot attain this ideal . . . It is therefore not applicable to this terrestrial life, but only to an imagined celestial existence" (<i>V </i>65). However, trying to aspire to this "celestial existence," linguistically and logically, seemed worthwhile, and therefore Russell insisted that language ought to be subjected to rigorous scientific standards: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Science is perpetually trying to substitute more precise beliefs for vague ones; this makes it harder for a scientific proposition to be true than for the vague beliefs of uneducated persons to be true, but makes scientific truth better worth having if it can be obtained.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>V </i>68)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Russell explained that he was giving the talk because, "vagueness is much more important in the theory of knowledge than you would judge it to be from the writings of most people," and he intended to demonstrate "that the process of sound philosophizing . . . consists mainly in passing from those obvious, vague, ambiguous things . . . to something precise, clear, definite."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In "Vagueness," Russell highlighted several philosophical questions that were fermenting in 1922 and that are germane to the treatment of language and form in the "new novel." First, to amend the words of Joyce, "it seems that language was to blame" for what appeared to be otherwise unresolvable philosophical paradoxes. Russell called this tendency to treat purely linguistic confusions as actual philosophical questions the "fallacy of verbalism" (<i>V </i>62). Second, Russell asserted that analytical methods and logical formulae were needed to clean up the muddle in which philosophy found itself. Scientific methods were granted a status above previous approaches to philosophy. And finally, Russell claimed that our ordinary language, in this "terrestrial life," is so riddled through with vagueness that a new "special language" is required to approach philosophical questions (<i>V </i>61).  </p>

<p>Russell's lecture participated in a revolutionary movement in philosophy reevaluating the vagueness of language. His lecture actually stemmed from questions he encountered 

<b></b>

 when writing two essays: one an introduction for the first English publication of Ludwig Wittgenstein's <i>Tractatus</i>, the second a review of John Dewey's <i>Essays in Experimental Logic</i>. His claim that an ideal language would be free of vagueness was also implicitly an argument against pragmatists who pointed to the concept of vagueness to demonstrate the faults of classical logic. In fact, F. C. S. Schiller, expected to hold the opposing Pragmatic view, had been asked by the society to prepare a response to Russell's lecture in advance, so the two camps were in place before the talk began. Ideal language theorists, like Russell, posited language's fallibility and advanced a more scientific approach to philosophy; yet Pragmatists were initiating a drastic change in philosophy. Richard Rorty calls this change in early twentieth-century philosophy "the linguistic turn"—"the view that philosophical problems are problems which may be solved (or dissolved) either by reforming language, or by understanding more about the language we presently use."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In contrast to Russell's desired "celestial" language, philosophers beginning with Charles Peirce, William James, and Ludwig Wittgenstein turned to language to solve philosophical problems. The question of vagueness was at the core of this debate between Ideal Language theorists and Pragmatists because it underscored either language's shortcomings or its enormous potentialities, depending upon one's philosophical view. </p>

<p>Modern novelists, I argue, from Henry James to Gertrude Stein, were simultaneously enacting their own linguistic turn in fiction, and in this linguistic turn, too, "vagueness" played a major role. In <i>The Rise of the Novel</i>, Ian Watt "proposes a close analogy between the epistemological premises of formal realism and those of 'philosophical realism.'" I am proposing a close analogy between the modern novel's attempt to revise the conventions of the realist novel and the revolt against positivism in the philosophy of language.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  It has long been argued that modern fiction turned inward as novelists flaunted the structures of their genre and self-consciously held language up for examination. What has not been noted is the contemporary philosophical debate about language's vagueness and the connection between the debates surrounding ordinary language philosophy and the modern novel's linguistic experimentalism and revision of literary traditions. I am promoting a historicized explanation for the linguistic incursions and self-referentiality of these major works of modernism: novelists assimilated contemporary philosophical questions, then seen as linguistic questions, into fiction. Indeed, since language was the fiction writer's domain, the novel seemed to offer answers to philosophical problems that philosophy itself could not resolve.  </p>

<p>In the following pages, I will briefly sketch the history of the question of vagueness and outline Virginia Woolf's parody of Bertrand Russell's dream of a precise language in her radio broadcast, "Craftsmanship" . To underscore Woolf's commitment to vagueness, I will turn to analyze her attitude towards prose's slipperiness in <i>Night and Day</i> , a work stylistically different from the rest of her <i>oeuvre</i>. Indeed, in <i>Night and Day</i>, self-consciously her most traditional novel, Woolf introduces her heroine (and by proxy the reader) to a world of emotion and messy interpersonal relationships where a devotion to precise mathematics and straightforward plots must be exchanged for the "vagueness of the finest prose."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  That modern writers themselves must similarly discard 

<b></b>

 precise forms is made clear both by Woolf's subsequent "fragmentary" style in novels like <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> and by Woolf's image of "Modern Fiction" as a "semi-transparent envelope."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  By tracing this image to its origins in Henry James, I aim to depict a strain of what I am calling the linguistic turn in fiction, joining the stylistic ambiguities and linguistic extravagances of Henry James to the "works of vision" of Virginia Woolf. </p>

<p>It is important to note both the vagueness of literary Impressionism and that modern novels can engage with language's vagueness without being 'impressionistic.' Literary Impressionism has a thorny history with regards to modern novelists, most of whom (including Joseph Conrad, Woolf, and Joyce) disdained the actual term 'Impressionism' for various reasons, primarily for its association with an earlier movement in French painting. In fact, what connects the novels of James to those of Joyce, those of Woolf to Stein, is less an interest in conveying an impression than in investigating the very language used to convey impressions, objects, or dialogue. Watt has summarized the main goal of literary Impressionism, as replacing the emphasis on the object viewed with the perceptions of the subjective viewer. Ford Madox Ford's insistence, for example, that "the Impressionist" provides "the fruits of his own observations alone" and Conrad's technique of delayed decoding both accentuate the perceptions of the observer rather than the object or person observed.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  While subjective perceptions certainly play a large role in modern novels, this new focus fails adequately to account for Henry James's "almost intolerable ambiguity" in the dialogue of <i>The Golden Bowl</i> or Joyce's verbal punning in <i>Ulysses</i> or <i>Finnegans Wake</i>.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Moreover, definitions of literary Impressionism vary so widely that Jesse Matz in <i>Literary Impressionism and Modernist Aesthetics</i> has wondered if the term itself becomes "meaningless" and asks, "But what if Impressionism's tendency towards definitional vagueness is itself definitive?"<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  I would concur resoundingly, though not in order to attempt to redefine, once again, the term for the modernist era but instead to focus on modern novelists' "bewitchment" (to adopt Wittgenstein's term) with the <i>vagueness</i> itself of the word "Impression." </p>

<p>Ironically, William James, who called for the "re-instatement of the vague" in <i>The Principles of Psychology</i> , deplored the parallel movement in fiction.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Although he emphasized the short-comings of scientific precision for psychology, he simultaneously expressed his frustration with the vague style of his brother's novel <i>The Golden Bowl</i>: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I don't enjoy the kind of "problem," . . . and the method of narration by interminable elaboration of suggestive reference (I don't know what else to call it, but you know what I mean) . . . won't you, just to please Brother, sit down and write a new book, with no twilight or mustiness in the plot, with great vigor and decisiveness in the action, no fencing in the dialogue, no psychological commentaries, and absolute straightness in style? Publish it in my name, I will acknowledge it, and give you half the proceeds.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">The novels of Henry James, Virginia Woolf, William Faulkner, James Joyce and Gertrude Stein, to name a few, all resist the qualities William James sought and revel instead in "psychological commentaries," indecisiveness in plot and action, and "absolute" vagueness in style. If the conventions of the realist novel can be summarized by an emphasis on an "original" or "novel" plot, diminishment of "rative eloquence," and 

<b></b>

 "the particularization of character and background, of naming, temporality, causation, and physical environment," the modernist novel's focus on subjectivity, resistance to anything easily definable as plot, and rative and stylistic eloquence pushed to the brink of solipsism all demonstrate a new set of conventions in fiction.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Rather than attempting to eliminate vagueness, modernist fiction probes vagueness as the best way to examine psychological depth, to depict sexual indeterminacy, or to register disenchantment with the capitalist, bourgeois, and symbolic status quo while still existing within those systems.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Even William James grudgingly admitted that his brother achieved a "paradoxical success in this unheard-of method."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  </p>

<p>"Vagueness is huge," wrote Richard Rorty, in an article in <i>The London Review of Books</i> in 2005.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Whereas in the field of literature the word "vague" continues to be confined primarily to negative comments on students' arguments, in philosophy "Vagueness Studies" have "exploded in the last thirty years."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Rorty explained to those readers outside of analytic philosophy that vagueness studies should interest the general reader because "[i]t is an underlying concern with the question of whether and how language gets in touch with the world that has made vagueness a hot topic." "The controversy," he noted, can be boiled down to a t "between realists, who think the notion of truth as correspondence to reality can be saved, and pragmatists, who regard it as hopeless." The question of vagueness, however, is far from new, though the rise of pragmatism corresponded to an explosion of writings on vagueness, both of which closely corresponded in time to the birth of the modern novel.  </p>

<p>The concept of vagueness has a long and volatile history.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Terms with "vague boundaries" have been an object of philosophical debate since Eubulides of Miletus in the 4<sup>th</sup> century <small class="caps">bc</small> first asserted his sorites paradox (<i>soros</i> is 'heap' in Greek):  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I say: tell me, do you think that a single grain of wheat is a heap? Thereupon you say: No. Then I say: What do you say about 2 grains? For it is my purpose to ask you questions in succession, and if you do not admit that 2 grains are a heap then I shall ask you about 3 grains. Then I shall proceed to interrogate you further with respect to 4 grains, then 5 and 6 and 7 and 8, and you will assuredly say that none of these makes a heap.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->





<p class="continued">The boundary between several grains of sand and a heap, or a man with little hair and a bald man, appears unstable. Recent theorists of vagueness continue to wrestle with this problem—to such an extent that M. F. Burnyeat exclaims, "Eubulides himself can hardly have foreseen that his modest heap of grain would grow to menace Olympus and undermine the foundations of logic."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The sorites paradox menaces logic because 

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>If you remove a single grain of sand from a heap of sand, you surely still have a heap of sand. But if you take a heap and remove grains one by one, you can apply that principle at each stage, which will commit you to counting even the solitary final grain as a heap. This is the sorites paradox.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Logicians emphasize that terms such as 'heap' and 'tall,' or even 'child' or 'belief,' have boundaries that are so fuzzy that when logic is applied to define them, although "the premises are highly plausible, [and] the inference seems valid, . . .the conclusions are absurd."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Vague boundaries appear to undermine the principle of bivalence—either something is or is not true—therefore shaking the foundations of classical logic. </p>

<p>Though in classical times paradoxes like the sorites were actually used to test scholars' dialectical skills—and the 'heap' was so famous a paradox that the average reader was supposed to note allusions to heaps<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> —it was not until the end of the nineteenth century with the origins of the analytic tradition that vagueness resurfaced as a key concept. From the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century, the problem of vagueness in language became a central subject of debate in pragmatism and the philosophy of language. Ideal language theorists like Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell devised new formal languages and symbolic systems in order to avoid the "irregular, unperspicuous, and ambiguous" qualities of colloquial language, while pragmatists like Charles Sanders Peirce and William James believed that the logicians' efforts to avoid vagueness were futile and therefore chose to enlist vagueness as a tool.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Both Peirce and William James recommend "'vagueness' as a counteraction to the dogmatizing of existent truths and as the necessary condition for the exploratory search for new truths"; but Peirce believed that the new truths would themselves be precise whereas William James asserted that vagueness itself finally had a "proper place in our mental life."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  The positive re-evaluation of vagueness culminated in Wittgenstein's praise of the "blur" in <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>, where all language is defined as necessarily vague, but unproblematically so, since vagueness does not undermine a language's utility.  </p>

<p>Gottlob Frege, "the father of modern mathematical logic," created in his 1879 <i>Begriffschrift</i> (<i>Concept-notation</i>) a formal language to avoid ordinary language's ambiguities. He argued: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>If it is a question of the truth of something . . . We have to throw away concepts that do not have a meaning . . . These are . . . such as have vague boundaries. It must be determinate for every object whether it falls under a concept or not; a concept-word which does not meet this requirement on its meaning is meaningless.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Frege noted that, since "a large part of a philosopher's task consists—or at least should consist—in a struggle with language," a philosopher's language needs to be as precise as possible; therefore, "vagueness, like madness, must be mentioned in order to be excluded."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Frege, and Russell in his wake, turned their backs on ordinary language's slipperiness in order to address crucial logical questions. Wittgenstein's <i>Tractatus</i>—also published in 1922—with its "picture theory of language" can be seen to contribute to the ideal language tradition, if we concur, with Russell's introduction, that the <i>Tractatus</i> 

<b></b>

 sets out "the conditions which would have to be fulfilled by a logically perfect language."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Similarly C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards's <i>The Meaning of Meaning</i>  and Ogden's later work on Basic English can be linked to this "ideal language" tradition.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Russell's view that a "vague" concept may be the origin of a philosophical question but that vagueness must be eliminated in the approach and in the fruits of philosophy seems typical of the ideal language tradition: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The process of sound philosophizing, to my mind, consists mainly in passing from those obvious, vague, ambiguous things, that we feel quite sure of, to something precise, clear, definite, which by reflection and analysis we find is involved in the vague thing that we started from, and is, so to speak, the real truth of which the vague thing is a sort of shadow.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Russell insists that "vagueness" may exist before a problem is addressed but that the final result must be "precise, clear and definite."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  </p>

<p>However, the pragmatic countercurrent in philosophy, utilizing rather than trying to stamp out vagueness, was gaining momentum in the first decades of the twentieth century. Peirce, a friend of William and Henry James and the coiner of the term "pragmatism," is often seen as the first rigorous theorist of vagueness, though his attitude towards vagueness was ambivalent. Regretting that "logicians have been at fault in giving Vagueness the go-by, so far as not even to analyze it," he had "worked out the logic of vagueness with something like completeness."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  When called upon to define "Vague" for the 1902 <i>Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology</i>, Peirce wrote: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>A proposition is vague when there are possible states of things concerning which it is intrinsically uncertain whether, had they been contemplated by the speaker, he would have regarded them as excluded or included by the proposition. By intrinsically uncertain we mean not uncertain in consequence of any ignorance of the interpreter, but because the speaker's habits of language were indeterminate; so that one day he would regard the proposition as excluding, another as admitting, those states of things. Yet this must be understood to have reference to what might be <i>deduced</i> from a perfect knowledge of his state of mind; for it is precisely because these questions never did, or did not frequently, present themselves that his habit remained indeterminate.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">For Peirce, therefore, vagueness is due to an "indeterminate" habit of language, resulting from incomplete self-consciousness, the failing of a thinker who did not bother to press himself with essential questions. Peirce does not assert that the world itself might be vague, but that indeterminacy stems from a speaker's inconsistent relationship to language. Nonetheless, he simultaneously stresses that vague terms, even in science, can be extremely valuable steps along the way to discovering truth, "so the practice of science is better served by vague predicates than by precise ones."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Peirce called the excessive need for clarity in every step of logical thought the "fallacy of over-precision," and warned against it (<i>CP</i> 8:244).  </p>

<p>In contrast to Peirce's desire to refine vagueness out of existence, William James believed that both the scientific method and the truths discovered are themselves 

<b></b>

 "vague." "[L]et the science be as vague as its subject," he writes in <i>The Principles of Psychology</i>. Just as "the boundary line of the mental is certainly vague," so also consciousness and language reflect that vagueness (<i>PP</i> 1:6). James resisted fixed truths and concrete mathematical terms. In addition, he found Russell's desire to read language as a precise science ridiculous. He writes: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>A mathematical term, as <i>a, b, c, x, y, sin</i>, log, is self-sufficient, and terms of this sort, once equated, can be substituted for one another in an endless series without error. Mr. Russell . . . seem[s] to think that in our mouth also such terms as "meaning," "truth," "belief," "object," "definition," are self-sufficients with no context of varying relations that might be further asked about. What a word means is expressed by its definition, isn't it? The definition claims to be exact and adequate, doesn't it? Then it can be substituted for the word—since the two are identical—can't it? Then two words with the same definition can be substituted for one another, <i>n'est-ce pas</i>? Likewise two definitions of the same word, <i>nicht wahr</i>, etc., till it will be indeed strange if you can't convict someone of self-contradiction and absurdity.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">James emphasizes the importance of "varying relations" to definitions and demonstrates that substituting "same" words ("doesn't it?" "<i>n'est-ce pas</i>?" "<i>nicht wahr</i>?") as one would substitute equal mathematical terms quickly leads to "absurdity." Instead, since topics like psychology, philosophy, and belief are vague, language, that vague medium, is well suited to investigate their principles. </p>

<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein is the central re to bridge the competing approaches to vagueness. The <i>Tractatus</i> can be seen to sum up Frege, Russell and G. E. Moore's goal of an "instrumental language," but his <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> reverses his earlier views.The<i> Tractatus</i> investigates "the conditions for a logically perfect language," attempting to resolve the problem that "language is always more or less vague," with a new "picture" theory of language.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  The <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>, however, demonstrates the influence of the pragmatist re-evaluation of vagueness but pushes the reassessment even further.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Like William James, Wittgenstein disagrees with Frege's dismissal of "vague boundaries": </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Frege compares a concept to an area and says that an area with vague boundaries cannot be called an area at all. This presumably means that we cannot do anything with it.—But is it senseless to say: 'Stand roughly there'? Suppose that I were standing with someone in a city square and said that. As I say it I do not draw any kind of boundary, but perhaps point with my hand—as if I were indicating a particular <i>spot</i>.</p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">"Stand roughly there," according to Wittgenstein, is a meaningful command. Moreover, it is not only as meaningful as less vague assertions, but also often more so. Wittgenstein's notion of the way language itself works, the language "game," is itself necessarily a blurred concept: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>One might say that the concept 'game' is a concept with blurred edges.—'But is a blurred concept a concept at all?'—Is an indistinct photograph a picture of a person at all? Is it 

<b></b>

 even always an advantage to replace an indistinct picture by a sharp one? Isn't the indistinct one often exactly what we need?<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">For Wittgenstein the "indistinct" photograph or "blurred" concept represents an inescapable property of language. Vagueness, according to Wittgenstein's "functionalist" theory of language, cannot truly be evaded and is indeed "exactly what we need" in order to perform philosophical investigations, to capture meaningful images, and to communicate in daily life. Wittgenstein disagreed with those who claimed a new language was needed: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>It is clear that every sentence in our language 'is in order as it is'. That is to say, we are not <i>striving after</i> an ideal, as if our ordinary vague sentences had not yet got a quite unexceptionable sense, and a perfect language awaited construction by us.—On the other hand it seems clear that where there is sense there must be perfect order.—So there must be perfect order even in the vaguest sentence.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">In contrast to Russell and Frege's "perfect language," Wittgenstein asserts that truth can be found even in, and precisely in, the "vaguest sentence."  </p>

<p>Wittgenstein's change of opinion about the question of vagueness may indeed circle back to Peirce, through the re of Frank P. Ramsey.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Ramsey, a Cambridge mathematician who died at the age of twenty-six, studied Peirce and knew Russell and Wittgenstein personally. (He may have also inspired Woolf's choice in the profession and name of the semi-fictional portrait of her father, the philosopher Mr. Ramsay, in <i>To The Lighthouse.</i><sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup> ) Ramsey's influence on Wittgenstein's philosophical revisions in <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> is undeniable—in the Preface, Wittgenstein notes that "to a degree which I myself am hardly able to estimate," the changes were instigated "by the criticism which my ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom I discussed them in innumerable conversations during the last two years of his life" (<i>PI</i> xe). Similarly, Ramsey himself stressed Peirce's influence on his own later thought; in "Truth and Probability"  he writes, "What follows to the end of the section is almost entirely based on the writings of C. S. Peirce."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  While the extent of Ramsey's effect on the pragmatic strain of the later Wittgenstein is hotly debated, what is notable is Ramsey's emphasis in his last writings (and therefore perhaps in these conversations recalled by Wittgenstein) on the importance of vagueness.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  For example, in a late paper entitled "Philosophy," Ramsey writes: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I could not see how we could understand a word and not be able to recognize whether a proposed definition of it was or was not correct. I did not realize the vagueness of the whole idea of understanding. . . The chief danger to our philosophy, apart from laziness and wooliness is <i>scholasticism</i>, the essence of which is treating what is vague as if it were precise and trying to fit it into an exact logical category.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Ramsey's revised approach to the meaning of words like "understanding" and his refusal to treat "what is vague as if it were precise" foreshadow Wittgenstein's focus on the vagueness (<i>Vagheit</i>) of language-games. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Debates about vagueness, and particularly sorites paradoxes, raise two main issues pertinent to modernist fiction. First, if, as both analytic and many pragmatic theorists imply, vagueness is <i>epistemic,</i> that is, if boundaries of vague terms are not actually blurry but "our failure to detect a sharp transition" is "merely a defect in our knowledge," then vagueness could be (ideally) eliminated, and greater and greater precision should smooth the problems apparent in definition and communication.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  Henry James's assertion that Flaubert's <i>mot juste</i> nonetheless misses something "beneath and behind, that belongs to the realm of vagueness and uncertainty," seems to deny this possible cure for vagueness.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Second, if vagueness is not epistemic but <i>semantic</i>, that is, if it is not just that we do not have enough knowledge about the case at hand to determine whether a borderline heap is a grain or a heap (or whether Orlando is a man or a woman) but that there is no actual answer, then vagueness might demonstrate "some real indeterminacy in the non-linguistic world itself;" hence, arguments that "vague language undermines realism."<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  Writings by both William James and Wittgenstein appear to contend that vagueness might be semantic, and engagement with semantic vagueness seems particularly germane to the revision of character, motivation, and consciousness occurring in modern novels. Indeed, the questions philosophers were asking about heaps and non-heaps suggested an interesting middle ground between Idealist and Realist ways of looking at the world, a possibility that was simultaneously considered in literature. </p>

<p>While many early twentieth-century novelists, such as Henry James, Woolf, and Stein, had personal ties to the philosophers investigating vagueness, particularly William James, Charles Peirce, and Bertrand Russell, they were also writing, like the philosophers, in a cultural and intellectual climate that encountered and countered the limitations of precision. Why did literary realism, like a transparent language of logic, prove insufficient at the beginning of the twentieth century for capturing the vagaries of consciousness or modern life, leading to Woolf's question: "Is life like this? Must novels be like this?" (<i>CR</i> 212). Woolf herself posed one famous answer to that question, when she argued that fiction needed to change since "on or about December 1910 human character changed" (<i>EVW</i> 3:421). Woolf labels this a "very vague" assertion and omits mentioning the possible historical factors behind her choice of that date, such as the death of Edward VII and succession of George V in May or the First Post-Impressionist Exhibition in November. In addition to changes in government and art, another important event in that year—specifically in December 1910—was Russell's and Alfred North Whitehead's publication of the first volume of <i>Principia Mathematica</i>, setting out proofs for the logical basis of all mathematics.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  The imprecision of Woolf's declaration—"on or about"—is very different from the logically sound mathematical language set out in that work. Woolf specifically calls attention to the imprecision of her declaration; she writes that the "change" in human character was not "'definite," like a "hen [that] had laid an egg" (<i>EVW</i> 3:421). Indeed, though Woolf adds that one "may well complain about the vagueness of my language" (<i>EVW</i> 3:431), assertions such as "on or about December 1910 human character changed" embrace vagueness for tone and irony while crystallizing the distinction between Woolf's vision of 'reality' and that endorsed by philosophers like Bertrand Russell (<i>EVW</i> 3:431).

III. Virginia Woolf, Bertrand Russell, and the Question of Vagueness:  

Mush &amp; the Telescope
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>When the Ramsays are finally sailing to the lighthouse, Mr. Ramsay, the philosopher, looks at his daughter Cam and thinks to himself: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Women are always like that; the vagueness of their minds is hopeless; it was a thing he had never been able to understand; but so it was. It had been so with her—his wife. They could not keep anything clearly fixed in their minds. But he had been wrong to be angry with her; moreover, did he not rather like this vagueness in women?<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Woolf's philosopher, who is "stuck" in his own writing, nonetheless picks apart the minds of women and chooses "vagueness"—an inability "to keep anything clearly fixed in their minds"—as a fault. Though he admits to liking "this vagueness in women," his own work and philosophy of life lie in stark contrast to it—his work is a "definite contribution to philosophy" (<i>TTL</i> 39), and his rule to his children is that "life is difficult; facts uncompromising" (<i>TTL</i> 11). He thinks of his philosophy in a purely linear fashion; to him, "thought is like the keyboard of a piano, divided into so many notes, or like the alphabet is ranged in twenty-six letters all in order," and "his splendid mind had no sort of difficulty in running over those letters one by one, firmly and accurately, until it had reached, say, the letter Q" (<i>TTL</i> 53). The vagueness of his daughter Cam and his deceased wife may be charming, but he does not believe it is the way forward in rigorous intellectual pursuits.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Ramsay is not wrong in believing that the women's minds in <i>To The Lighthouse</i> work in opposition to his. When Lily tries to consider Ramsay's work, she feels "vagueness as to what Mr. Ramsay did think about" (<i>TTL </i>232), and she digresses in her thoughts, first about Andrew's sudden death, then about the symbol she has created to imagine Ramsay's philosophy. Her "circular tendency" in thinking is more akin to Woolf's writing in "The Mark on the Wall" or "An Unwritten Novel" than to Mr. Ramsay's orderly keyboard.<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  Both Lily and Mrs. Ramsay also chastise Mr. Ramsay for the impersonal nature of his thought. Mrs. Ramsay admits to herself that "[t]o pursue truth with such astonishing lack of consideration for other people's feelings" seems to her a horrible "outrage of human decency" (<i>TTL</i> 51). Lily allows that "[n]aturally, if one's days were passed in this seeing of angular essences, this reducing of lovely evenings, with all their flamingo clouds and blue and silver . . . naturally one could not be judged like an ordinary person" (<i>TTL</i> 38). (Her repetition of "naturally" puts into question, however, the notion that "reducing" the world is really natural to her at all.) Woolf later wrote that her depiction of the Ramsays was largely autobiographical and mostly derived from observing her parents. And yet, her portrayal of a philosopher who detests "vagueness," who believes philosophical inquiry must be "impersonal," and who posits that philosophical thought is best rendered in alphabetical letters, also calls to mind her relationship with Bertrand Russell.  </p>

<p>At a dinner party in 1921 Woolf's reaction to Russell foreshadowed elements of her creation of Ramsay, composed six years later. Recalling the conversation in her diary, she 

<b></b>

 claimed to have waved her hand about the room and admitted to him that "[a]ll this is mush [to me]; &amp; you can put a telescope to your eye &amp; see through it." This comment initiated the following discussion about their different views of life. Woolf writes: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>If you had my brain you would find the world a very thin, colourless place, he said.</p>
<p>But my colours are so foolish I replied.</p>
<p>You want them for your writing, he said. Do you never see things impersonally? . . .</p>
<p>But I have a feeling that human affairs are impure.</p>
<p>God does mathematics. That's my feeling. It is the most exalted form of art.</p>
<p>Art? I said.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>DVW</i> 2:147)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Woolf and Russell parody their own ways of seeing the world ("mush," "colourless") and yet their characterizations quite succinctly summarize their different approaches. Russell acknowledges the limitations of his method in which, echoed in Woolf's later portrayal of Mr. Ramsay, the "flamingo clouds and blue and silver" do not factor into his colorless world. Similarly, Woolf claims her vision ends in "mush" and is "foolish." Yet Russell's question, "Do you never see things impersonally?" and Woolf's response, that she has a "feeling that human affairs are impure," clearly demonstrate their antagonistic viewpoints. Woolf makes subjective even her statement that human affairs are subjective; Russell sparringly equates mathematics with divinity. Russell grants that Woolf's writing may benefit from feeling and from color, but science and impersonal mathematics direct the brain of the philosopher. Woolf, in contrast, gives herself the last word in her journal, questioning whether mathematics is really an "Art" at all, and implying Art is more "exalted" than mathematics. </p>

<p>Less than a year later Russell delivered his "Vagueness" lecture at Oxford and Woolf published <i>Jacob's Room</i>. In "Vagueness," Russell advocates moving philosophical inquiry away from traditional questions—What is truth? What is reality? Words are vague, he argues, but the mere fact that words are not precise does not mean that the world itself is not precise; this error stems from the "fallacy of verbalism" (<i>V </i>62). At the same time that Russell advocated new mathematical approaches to philosophy, Woolf's novels take up the philosophical questions Russell has discarded as "vague." Woolf wrote fiction and essays that incarnate an antithetical philosophy to that being ushered in by Russell. In Woolf's view, the world itself and our position within it are necessarily vague, shifting, and blurred. Woolf's famous "semi-transparent envelope" as a description of life is practically the definition of a boundary-less term (<i>EVW</i> 3:33). Moreover, the vagueness of language is its strength; it refuses to fix concepts the way Russell's ideal language seeks to do. While Russell aims to move philosophy away from "impure" English, Woolf's novels become "fictionalized epistemology."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Her novels explode the realist conventions of the nineteenth-century novel in order to satisfy the question she poses in "Modern Fiction": "Must novels be like this?" (<i>CR </i>212). Woolf's novels require new complex forms in order to render the "vague general confusion" of modern life; rather than a plot that runs from A to Z, she blends genres, and includes narrative interruptions, fragmentation, and gaps that necessitate the reader's own associations. Although Woolf often expresses a kind of nostalgia for a time of fact, and 

<b></b>

 longs to represent the objective precise fact, she also insists that modern literature must represent "Life" the way it really is—blurred and distorted—and language is the best tool we have at our disposal.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Woolf, of course, was not a philosopher per se. She was a novelist, journalist, and essayist. Although her father, Leslie Stephen (another model for Mr. Ramsay), wrote philosophy and wished to be remembered as a philosopher, Woolf herself exclaimed in her diary, "I don't want 'a philosophy' in the least," and complained that the novels of D. H. Lawrence were tiring since "[a]rt [should be] being rid of all preaching" (<i>DVW</i> 4:126). In <i>The Waves</i>, Bernard, the voice of the novelist, exclaims, "Certain things lie beyond my scope. I shall never understand the harder problems of philosophy" (<i>W</i> 186). Woolf also professed a rather scathing attitude towards any kind of institutionalized philosophy, as we might expect from the writer shut out of Oxbridge in <i>A Room of One's Own</i>—"philosophic words," she wrote there, "if one has not been educated at a university are apt to play one false."<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  Although she admired the "philosophical novel," she feared the influence that too much knowledge of philosophy might have on a novelist, as well as too much systemization on a philosophy. She wrote in a book review: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[W]hen philosophy is not consumed in a novel, when we can underline this phrase with a pencil and cut out that exhortation with a pair of scissors and paste the whole into a system, it is safe to say that there is something wrong with the philosophy or with the novel or with both.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">She also minimized her knowledge of philosophy, though she knew both Russell and G. E. Moore personally, attended open lectures, and lived in Bloomsbury society where, as she wrote, "discussing philosophy, art, religion" was in the atmosphere itself.<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Moreover her essays, such as "Modern Fiction," certainly have a theory (if never a named and explicit one) behind them—what she calls at one point a "philosophy."<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  Recent critical works have tried to pin down this philosophy. I agree with Mark Hussey's statement in <i>The Singing of the Real World</i> that forcing Woolf's fiction into a philosophical school does it a disservice; or, as Matz explains, "Woolf's philosophical affiliations change with the moods of her characters, which is why no philosophical affiliation can define her vague theory of fiction."<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  Nonetheless, juxtaposing her investigations of language and desire to dismantle the "materialist" novel to Russell's disdain for "vagueness" and creation of a new symbolic language demonstrates a clear opposition. Further, Woolf's dislike of institutional philosophy is in keeping with her philosophical novels, as she moves epistemological questions out of the academy where they are addressed by only a (usually male) privileged few and into novels, open to the Common Reader.<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In her radio broadcast on "Craftsmanship," Woolf offered a more generous view of language's imprecision than that expressed by Russell in his lecture on "Vagueness."<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  The BBC aired the talk on 29 April 1937, near the end of Woolf's life. Her broadcast was part of a series entitled, "Words Fail Me," and Woolf's talk acts as a challenge to the series title. In "Craftsmanship," Woolf accepts that she is meant to take "for our 

<b></b>

 starting point the statement that words are not useful" (<i>C</i> 245), and analyzes the idea that "[i]t is words that are to blame" for the confusion and miscommunication in the world (<i>C</i> 249). But, taking advantage of, as she notes, the "crafty" (in the sense of "cajolery" and "cunning") meaning of the word craftsmanship, Woolf teasingly plays with philosophies of language like Russell's, undermining the idea of inventing a new language and praising the "democratic," associative, and personal nature of words. Words are "irreclaimable vagabonds," Woolf makes clear, but "that is because the truth they try to catch is many-sided" (<i>C</i> 251). </p>

<p>According to the preview of the talk published in the <i>Radio Times</i> on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of April: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In Virginia Woolf's opinion, craftsmanship is a word that can be applied to the making of pots and pans, but not to words in the way in which writers use them. There is a distinction to be made between the useful use of words and their literary use. The novelist and the scientist use words very differently.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">This is a peculiarly misleading summary of Woolf's talk (perhaps written by the producer). In fact, Woolf makes no distinction between scientific language and literary language, insisting that all words are "not useful." Words "always" tell the truth, she argues, but that is because "it is the nature of words to mean many things" (<i>C</i> 247). The only nod Woolf makes to the scientist's use of words may be in her playful examination of the new "language of signs" that she claims "we are beginning to invent." </p>

<p>Quentin Bell expressed dismay at the tone of voice in Woolf's (his aunt's) recording: "Her voice is deprived of depth and resonance; it seems altogether too fast and too flat; it is barely recognizable."<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>  With more recent critics, however, I would argue that Woolf's tone varies, and that in many moments her quickness marks her attempt to mask her humor and irony.<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>  For example, in order to prove that "words are not useful," Woolf chooses as if by hazard "Passing Russell Square" as her first example of three words to repeat "over and over again" as a demonstration of how words "shuffle and change." "Passing Russell Square, Passing Russell Square," she repeats, but in her repetition, she loses the useful meaning of the words and hears instead the resonance of "Passing away saith the world, passing away." Christina Rossetti's verse makes Woolf forget to exit at Russell Square, the correct Tube stop. Woolf concludes that words proved "that they hate being useful" because "it is their nature not to express one simple statement but a thousand possibilities." Woolf notes: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">

<p class="continued">This new language of "signs" will be "useful," helping Woolf to exit the train rather than to recite poetry.  </p>

<p>Russell Square was a familiar and frequent tube stop for Woolf, so she may have chosen to repeat "Passing Russell Square" by chance as her example for the need to 

<b></b>

 create a new language. However, since the focus of her talk is the multiple meanings of words, she notes that "Russell" suggests "the rustling of leaves and the skirt on a polished floor," as well as "the ducal house of Bedford" (i.e., Bertrand Russell's family). Moreover, given her knowledge of Bertrand Russell, it seems her new "beautifully adapted language" may be referring to the "special language" Russell invented. </p>

<p>Woolf's praise of "a new language of signs" is heavy with irony. She continues: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>There is one great living master of this language to whom we are all indebted, that anonymous writer—whether man, woman, or disembodied spirit, nobody knows—who describes hotels in the Michelin Guide. He wants to tell us that one hotel is moderate, another good, and a third the best in the place. How does he do it? Not with words . . . He sticks to signs; one gable, two gables, three gables. That is all he says and all he needs to say.</p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Though this method of signs may work very well for Michelin and Baedeker, to address "truth" (and Woolf spells out she means not only "literary truth" but also "God's or gospel truth and home truth"), she returns to words. Words are the "the wildest, freest, most irresponsible, most unteachable of all things." However, since "the truth they try to catch is many-sided," words are well suited, "being themselves many-sided, flashing this way, then that." Woolf implies that a new language like Russell's may be satisfactory for certain tasks (like judging hotels) but words, which "lapse and flow into each other like reeds upon the bed of a river," are needed to address truth. In contrast to Russell, who believes that the problem of language is that it is "one-many," Woolf asserts that truth itself is "many-sided," so the many meanings of words are their strength. Moreover, Woolf emphasizes that the kind of truth language can capture is more important than a language of signs—"words are the only things that tell the truth and nothing but the truth," she insists (<i>C</i> 245). </p>

<p>Woolf also notes that it is impossible for words to be impersonal, nor can a language remain pure. "But has any writer," she asks, "succeeded in being wholly impersonal? Always, inevitably, we know them as well as their books" (<i>C</i> 248). In contrast to Russell's notion (and also that of T. S. Eliot) that "impersonality" is possible or desirable, Woolf insists that language reveals personality; further, "If you start a Society for Pure English, [words] will show their resentment by starting another for impure English."<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  Just as Woolf commented to Russell over dinner that she feared that "human affairs are impure," so also she insists that language is impure, but its impurity is a strength, because it is "highly democratic too . . . uneducated words are as good as educated words, uncultivated words as cultivated words, there are no ranks or titles in their society" (<i>C</i> 250).  </p>

<p>Most criticism of Woolf's attitude to language tends to focus on a few stock negative lines from her writings, and disregards her important claims that language is "democratic" or her gendering of language itself as female.<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  Critics point, for example, to Lily Briscoe's assertion that "in the chambers of the mind and heart of the woman . .. were stood, like treasures in the tombs of kings, tablets bearing sacred inscriptions, which if one could spell them out would teach everything," yet the knowledge is "nothing that 

<b></b>

 could be written in any language known to men" (<i>TTL</i> 79). Lily longs to understand Mrs. Ramsay in a way freed from language "known to men." Julia Kristeva's view of Woolf is often cited as a truism about Woolf's relationship to the logos: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In women's writing, language seems to be seen from a foreign land; is it seen from the point of view of an asymbolic, spastic body? Virginia Woolf describes suspended states, subtle sensation, and above all, colors—green, blue—but she does not dissect language as Joyce does. Estranged from language, women are visionaries, dancers who suffer as they speak.<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Although my investigation into Woolf's vagueness similarly finds gender and open-endedness essential to Woolf's prose, I hesitate to see Woolf as necessarily more "estranged from language" than male writers like Joyce. I would agree with Kate Flint that it is "misleading" to take Woolf's language as some sort of "preration of new French Feminist thought," which seems essentialist and ahistorical; as Flint argues, "for Woolf, women, language, and consciousness intertwine in a way which is ultimately inseparable from social context."<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In fact, one important social context involved access to lectures, such as Russell's, and philosophy departments at Oxbridge. Woolf would not have heard Russell's actual lecture "Vagueness" as it was given at a private club at Oxford. However, Woolf admitted she went to some of his open lectures, since "[t]he touchstone of virtue. . . now is whether you attend Bertie's lectures or not" (<i>DVW</i> 1:273). Her reaction was none too favorable. She jokes in a letter that "Bertie lectures on Tuesdays, and thinks to issue a new constitution, so we are told, with the help of young Cambridge."<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>  Her thoughts on Russell's lecture and the war lead her to exclaim, "I become steadily more feminist." Russell may have worked for the suffrage campaign, but his philosophy and his new mathematical language voiced from the pulpit of Cambridge irked Woolf. Unlike the ranks and titles of Cambridge—which Woolf deplores in <i>Three Guineas</i>—language is open to all. Judith Shakespeare's writing suffered because she lacked education and a room of her own; nonetheless, Woolf suggests language was still her tool: "Anon," she argues, "who wrote so many poems without signing them, was often a woman."<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>   </p>

<p>When Woolf depicts vagueness it is usually gendered. She recalls, for example, that her father was always "cracking up sense and manliness" and "crying down sentiment and vagueness."<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  When she praises Dorothy Richardson's "psychological sentence of the female gender" it is "of a more elastic fibre than the old," capable of "enveloping the vaguest shapes."<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>  In Woolf's second novel, <i>Night and Day, </i>she contrasts her two heroines as follows: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Where Katherine was simple, Cassandra was complex; where Katharine was solid and direct, Cassandra was vague and evasive. In short, they represented very well the manly and the womanly sides of the feminine nature.</p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Woolf's narrator here, like Mr. Ramsay and like Leslie Stephen, finds fault with "the feminine nature" for its vagueness. In "Women and Fiction," Woolf wonders if the vote 

<b></b>

 will change women from being "fluctuating and vague" "toward the impersonal" (<i>CE</i> 2:147); in <i>Jacob's Room</i> young girls and old ladies are "[b]right yet vague"; and Rachel Vinrace in <i>The Voyage Out</i> is consistently depicted as vague, though Helen warns, "She seems vague, but she's a will of her own."<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>  When male characters like Terence Hewett in <i>The Voyage Out</i> are depicted as vague, their manliness seems at stake. Hirst critically asks Hewett, "I wonder if it's really nice to be as vague as you are?" (<i>VO</i> 97). Solidity and directness are gendered male, whereas vagueness and "dear Mother English" are aligned to "the feminine nature." </p>

<p>Woolf concludes "Craftsmanship" with a conceit comparing writing to moth collecting.  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Perhaps that is [words'] most striking peculiarity—their need of change. It is because the truth they catch is many-sided, and they convey it by being themselves many-sided, flashing this way, then that. Thus they mean one thing to one person, another thing to another; they are unintelligible to one generation, plain as a pikestaff to the next. And it is because of this complexity that they survive. Perhaps then one reason why we have no great poet, novelist, or critic writing today is that we refuse words their liberty. We pin them down to one meaning. . . And when words are pinned down they fold their wings and die.</p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Woolf asserts that we "have no great poet, novelist, or critic" because writers, like moth collectors, pin words down and kill them in the effort to examine them. "We are trembling on the verge of one of the great ages of English Literature," she asserts in "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown," and though "Grammar is violated, syntax disintegrated," the language of the moderns will achieve where the Edwardians' flounders.<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>  Allowing language its liberty will require freedom from what Woolf calls in her diary, "This appalling narrative business of the realist: getting on from lunch to dinner" (<i>DVW</i> 3:209). Woolf calls words "irreclaimable vagabonds," and just as she discovered craftiness in the root of craftsmanship, we can locate "vague" in the root of the word vagabond. "Wandering, inconstant, uncertain," the vagueness that Woolf praises in language and the new novel is exactly that which Russell would have eliminated in the search for truths.  </p>

<p>Indeed, although Woolf generally avoided coining new words, one word which the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> still cites Woolf as creating is <i>vagulous</i>. During the same summer that Woolf commented repeatedly in her diary about Russell's lectures,—"They were going to hear Bertie lecture; I preferred the songsters of Trafalgar square" (<i>DVW</i> 1:270)—Woolf uses <i>vagulous</i> to describe E. M. Forster. "I like Forster very much," Woolf writes, "though I find him whimsical and vagulous to an extent that frightens me with my own clumsiness &amp; definiteness" (<i>DVW</i> 1:291). Derived from the latin <i>vagulus</i>, Woolf's word seems both a compliment and also the opposite of "definiteness," the quality praised by Russell, but clearly a fault according to Woolf. Forster's <i>vagulous</i> character seems to hold some sort of negative capability that Woolf fears she lacks. This becomes evident when she uses the word in print in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> in 1925: 

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[Old Sir Harry] liked her; respected her, in spite of her damnable, difficult upper-class refinement, which made it impossible to ask Clarissa Dalloway to sit on his knee. And up came that wandering will-o'-the-wisp, that vagulous phosphorescence, old Mrs. Hilberry, stretching her hands to the blaze of his laughter (about the Duke and the Lady), which, as she heard it across the room, seemed to reassure her on a point which sometimes bothered her if she woke early in the morning . . . how it is certain we must die.</p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">The "vagulous phosphorescence" of "old Mrs. Hilberry" contrasts with Sir Harry's physicality: his booming laughter and desire to hold Clarissa upon his knee. Yet her indefiniteness is also a kind of knowledge, and, unlike Sir Harry, she emphatically faces the fact that "we must die." Though she may appear inconsequential to the outside observer ("that wandering will-o'-the-wisp"), she shares with other Woolf heroines, particularly Clarissa herself, a self-consciousness about her own mortality which, kept within reason, is the basis of knowledge in Woolf's work. To be <i>vagulous</i>, therefore, reflects a kind of wisdom. Woolf's additional use of a variant of <i>vagulous</i> in her diary, describing Ottoline Morrell as "undulated and vagulated," connects <i>vagulous</i> to the French word <i>vague</i> or wave (<i>DVW</i> 3:93). Morrell's character appears changeable to Woolf, like the waves, suggesting a relationship between <i>vagulousness</i> and waves. Waves work as important res of inescapable change in Woolf's writing. Stretching from her recollection of the childhood waves at St. Ives in <i>Moments of Being</i> to their depiction in <i>The Waves</i>, waves act as an apt metaphor for the ineradicable vagueness of "dear Mother English" (<i>C</i> 250) and its openness to new associations and democratic coinages.<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>  </p>

IV. <i>Night and Day </i>and "the semi-transparent envelope"

<p><i>Night and Day's</i> protagonist, Katharine Hilbery, sounds as if she would gladly help to usher in Russell's new constitution if she had the chance. Katharine thinks to herself: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">

<p class="continued">Katherine Mansfield, whose scathing review of <i>Night and Day</i> continues to set the standard criticism of Woolf's longest and most neglected novel, comments on the strangeness of this phrase of Woolf's. She emphasizes that the heroine, the grand-daughter of one of England's most famous poets, is in "profound protest against the family tradition, against the making of phrases (and what Mrs Woolf rather curiously calls) 'the confusion, agitation, and vagueness of the finest prose.'"<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>  Mansfield's review strives to pigeon-hole <i>Night and Day</i> as anachronistic, a wartime novel which refuses to acknowledge the war, a traditional English novel, complete with two concluding marriages and Shakespearean laurels, during the "age of experiment." "In the midst of our admiration," she concludes, "it makes us feel old and chill: we had never thought to look upon its like again!" However, this oddity of "Mrs Woolf's" phrasing, and her 

<b></b>

 heroine's absolute distrust of language—even as Katharine is the symbolic heir to England's literature—make it both more of a war novel and less a rote exercise in tradition than Mansfield suggests. Woolf's heroine doubts something about language that is actually central to the novel's "love" plot and comic conclusion, and the focus on language's "confusion, agitation, and vagueness" connects Woolf's early novel to her more obviously experimental later works. In fact, in <i>Night and Day</i>, Woolf teaches her heroine (ironically named Katharine) in a novel in the realist tradition something about language and the power of vagueness that Woolf embodies in the form of her later experimental novels.	 </p>

<p>Mansfield not unfairly highlighted the debt of <i>Night and Day</i> to an earlier English literary tradition. Woolf wrote in a letter to Roger Fry that <i>Night and Day</i> was an attempt at "the large, old fashioned, high minded English novel."<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>  A combination of <i>Bildungsroman</i>, portraiture, and autobiography, <i>Night and Day</i>, in a "leisurely progression," tells the story of Katharine Hilbery's engagements, first to a young suitable man of her same class, next to the clerk whom she comes to 'love.'<sup><a name="REF83" href="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>  As in Jane Austen's novels, the plot focuses on the marriage of a worthy young protagonist, and in the vein of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, two marriages rather than one bring the novel to its happy conclusion. The omniscient narrative style is strongly reminiscent of the careful control of Austen or Eliot. Woolf chose to set her novel in a literary environment, where Henry James appears in the caricature of "Mr Fortescue, the eminent novelist" (<i>ND</i> 4), and Katharine's employment when she is not showing off the literary memorabilia of her ancestor is to read Henry Fielding to her parents (<i>ND</i> 84). In fact contemporary writers, "the moderns," are caricatured as "too clever and cheap and nasty for words."<sup><a name="REF84" href="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Rather than admiring her literary ancestors, Katharine strives for a world of impersonal fact beyond the reaches of impure feelings. Katharine's utter distrust of language makes her impervious to the offers of love she receives. "But I haven't got the sort of feeling—love, I mean—I don't know what to call it," she insists to her mother and fiancé. She cannot accept that "love" has multiple interpretations, noting that: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Much depended, as usual, upon the interpretation of the word love; which word came up again and again, whether she considered Rodney, Denham, Mary Datchet, or herself; and in each case it seemed to stand for something not to be passed by.</p>

	<div class="attrib">

	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Each time the word "love" means something important, but it fails "to stand for something" static. Language seems insufficient to Katharine, so that whereas Mrs. Hilbery argues, "The best of life is built on what we say when we're in love," Katharine merely insists, "we talk a lot of nonsense" (<i>ND</i> 260). Just as Rosalind in Shakespeare's <i>As You Like It</i>, to whom Katharine is three times compared, urges that "men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love," so also Katharine refuses to accept any profundity in the words of love that first Rodney, then Ralph, urge upon her.<sup><a name="REF85" href="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>  Instead, Katharine craves "res, laws, stars, facts" (<i>ND</i> 240). Her disbelief in language actually foils the story and stretches Woolf's novel out much longer than 

<b></b>

 one could conceive (and perhaps, honestly, than one would desire), since her heroine repeatedly refuses Woolf's marriage plot. </p>

<p>Yet, through her mother, Katharine learns that language, rather than the precise astronomy she admires, can best suit the "impure" affairs of humanity. Before Mrs. Hilbery's intervention Katharine and Ralph are paralyzed, not feeling themselves in the kind of love that the other couple, Cassandra and William, obviously share, though Ralph asks "what other word describes the state we're in?" (<i>ND </i>360). In contrast Katharine thinks: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Ah but her romance wasn't that romance. It was a desire, an echo, a sound; she could drape it in colour, see it in form, hear it in music, but not in words; no never in words. She sighed, teased by desires so incoherent, so incommunicable.</p>

	<div class="attrib">

	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">When Ralph tries to make her into something she is not, she ts against his "damn romantic nonsense," stating, "I'm a matter of fact" person (<i>ND</i> 323). Their main difficulty is that their love comes and goes, and they often appear to each other as mere illusions. The lovers in <i>Night and Day</i> experience a great division between Night and Day, between Dreams and Reality (Woolf's manuscript title for the novel), and they fail to believe language will connect their experiences.  </p>

<p>Mrs. Hilbery elicits the help of words and stories to beguile the lovers, and upsets Katharine's belief in mathematics by forcing her to speak of her emotions. Unlike the kind of writing that Katharine says she could admire, which "ought to go from point to point" (<i>ND</i> 93), Woolf writes that Mrs. Hilbery "veiled purposely by the vagueness of her words." She describes "[t]he night and the stars, the dawn coming up, the barges swimming past, the sun setting," all the time staring with "a gaze that was at once very vague and penetrating" (<i>ND</i> 362). Mrs. Hilberry's stories are both "ancient fairy-tales" and fragments of poetry like the natural interludes in Woolf's <i>The Waves</i>. Mrs. Hilbery calls Katharine's mathematics (as well as her notion that she and Ralph might just live together rather than get married) "ugly" compared to the mystical tale of love by which Katharine, in listening to her mother's words, feels compelled. "A plus B minus C equals <i>xyz.</i> It's so dreadfully ugly, Katharine," Mrs. Hilbery retorts to Katharine's mathematics, whereas "a soothing word when uttered by another, a riveting together of the shattered fragments of the world" calms both Ralph and Katharine (<i>ND</i> 411). Although "A plus B minus C equals <i>xyz</i>" may mirror Russell's approach to philosophy, as a philosophy of life for Woolf's young protagonist it is absolutely stultifying and needs to be replaced by evocative "shattered fragments" of stories to assure growth.  </p>

<p>Leonard Woolf, however, found <i>Night and Day</i> depressing. "L. finds the philosophy very melancholy," Woolf noted in her diary, yet, "[t]he process of discarding the old [answers] when one is by no means certain what to put in their place, is a sad one" (<i>DVW</i> 1:259). In some ways Woolf's novel's ending is very bleak, as the heroine must set aside her passion for mathematics to find passion and companionship. Katharine and Mary Datchet, characters who re in many ways as twins, are exiled from each other at the book's end; Woolf's moral may be that love and work are mutually exclusive. 

<b></b>

 And yet, as a philosophy posited in a novel it is less stark because Woolf argues in favor of the power of literature, noting that mathematics fails to hold the answers that Shakespeare's fool or vague prose can offer. Solid answers, like Katharine's astronomy, and even traditional writing demonstrating "unity of phrase," like that of <i>Night and Day</i> itself, must be discarded for a writing which is "unfinished," "unsoldered," and "unwritten." Only the possibilities inherent in this new "unfinished" language, whether in the scribbles of Katharine and Ralph or in Mary's manuscript (bad as it allegedly is) conclude the book with a sense of hope. </p>

<p>Ralph and Katharine agree upon a particular "unfinished" fragment as a significant image at the end of the novel that is importantly vague and relates both to an image from Henry James and to Woolf's essay "Modern Fiction." In an effort to communicate with Katharine, Ralph has drawn with "half obliterated scratches" a strange symbol for her. Woolf writes: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>It represented by its circumference of smudges surrounding a central blot all that encircling glow which for him surrounded, inexplicably, so many objects of life, softening their sharp outlines, so that he could see certain streets, books, and situations wearing a halo almost perceptible to the physical eye.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>ND</i> 420)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Woolf's image merits comparison to a passage from Henry James that Woolf liked. Explaining how he viewed his novel <i>The Awkward Age</i>, James described: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The neat re of a circle consisting of a number of small rounds disposed at equal distances about a central object. The central object was my situation, my subject in itself, to which the thing would owe its title, and the small rounds represented so many distinct lamps, as I liked to call them, the function of each of which would be to light with all due intensity one of its aspects.<sup><a name="REF86" href="#FOOT86">86</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">In her essay "The Method of Henry James," written for the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> in 1918 while she was writing <i>Night and Day</i>, Woolf had quoted this passage, admiringly. Woolf notes, "One had almost rather read what [Henry James] meant to do rather than read what he actually did," and praised James's notion of fiction acting as "so many distinct lamps." If "[w]e want to be rid of Realism," as Woolf proclaims, Henry James's theory seems to offer a new method (<i>EVW</i> 3:12). </p>

<p>However, the image in <i>Night and Day</i>, which she would soon reconre in "Modern Fiction," is markedly different from James's "neat re." As in James's image, there is a central object of focus and there is a circumference of illumination. Yet in Woolf's novel, James's central object has been blurred, made into a "central blot" and rather than the symmetry of James's lamps at equal distances, Ralph's image is, like Russell's photograph, "smudge[d]." Ralph communicates to Katharine that the world, "streets, books, and situations," is not distinct but blurred and that objects are not precise but they have an "encircling glow."  </p>

<p>In his lecture on the vagueness of language Russell emphasizes that words have a similar "penumbra." Russell writes that language cannot maintain precision: "[t]he 

<b></b>

 fact is that all words are attributable without doubt over a certain area," and yet they "become questionable within a penumbra, outside which they are again certainly not attributable" (<i>V </i>63). A word, Russell argues, has an area of certain usage but then a penumbra where usage is vague. And one cannot escape this penumbra: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Someone might seek to obtain precision in the use of words by saying that no word is to be applied in the penumbra, but unfortunately the penumbra itself is not accurately definable, and all the vaguenesses which apply to the primary use of words apply also when we try to fix a limit to their indubitable applicability.</p>

	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Ralph's vision of life is like Russell's view of language; a penumbra or halo inexplicably and inescapably smudges certainty. </p>

<p>Having finished <i>Night and Day</i>, Woolf writes in "Modern Fiction":  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Life is not a series of gig-lamps symmetrically arranged; life is a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end. Is it not the task of the novelist to convey this varying, this unknown and uncircumscribed spirit, whatever aberration or complexity it may display, with as little mixture of the alien and external as possible?</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>EVW</i> 4:160–1)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Woolf clearly rejects James's vision of symmetrical lamps, and her earlier depiction of Ralph's picture is now adopted as part of her own belief about "Life."<sup><a name="REF87" href="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>  Woolf's essay particularly targets "the materialists," "Mr. Wells, Mr. Bennett and Mr. Galsworthy," whose realist technique "provides scenes of tragedy, comedy, and excitement," and yet fails to capture life. This is where Woolf writes, "if one were free and could set down what one chose, there would be no plot, little probability, and a vague general confusion in which the clear-cut features of the tragic, the comic, the passionate, and the lyrical were dissolved beyond the possibility of separate recognition" (<i>EVW</i> 3:33). Woolf's new generation of writers, the moderns or "spiritualists," will embrace the "vague general confusion" of modern existence and will not cling to the conventional distinctions between tragedy and comedy. Her new image of fiction rejects Henry James's "fixed lamps" and symmetry as well as the linear plot and probability of the materialists and seeks to replace their sharp shapes and clear-cut categories. Moreover, the penumbra that Russell attributes to language is for Woolf an actual quality of the world, a necessary function of consciousness; the "semi-transparent envelope" that the novelist must convey may be the ontological vagueness that Russell believes is a fallacy. </p>

<p>After <i>Night and Day</i>, even in <i>The Years</i> or in <i>Between the Acts</i>, Woolf demonstrates she has discarded writing that goes "from point to point to point," in favor of the vision of vagueness that Katherine and Ralph share at the end of <i>Night and Day</i> and that she outlines in her essays on modern novels. The experimentation of later works like <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, combining free indirect discourse, multiple perspectives, and interspersed passages of tragedy (Septimus's suicide) and comedy (Clarissa Dalloway's reconnection with Peter Walsh and Sally Seton), embodies the new formal vagueness that <i>Night and Day</i> teaches the reader to accept. Clarissa Dalloway's sense of a penumbra surrounding 

<b></b>

 her, because "she felt herself everywhere," leads to her "transcendental theory" that she has "odd affinities" with strangers and unfamiliar places (<i>MD</i> 152–3). Woolf's narrative structure supports Clarissa's sense of her vague connections to the rest of the world by paralleling Clarissa's and Septimus's streams of thought. Indeed, since Clarissa's party is the closest to a metaphor for Woolf's own writing in the novel, Woolf underscores the vagueness of her novel's structure. Fearing Peter Walsh believes she has matured into a mere society hostess, Clarissa asserts that her parties are "an offering; which sounded horribly vague." Although the meaning of Clarissa's party, "an offering; to combine, to create," may seem horrible in being "vague" to her, Woolf's narrated monologue mirrors Clarissa's desire to "to combine, to create" in uniting disparate individuals (<i>MD</i> 121–2). Clarissa's party is itself a vague symbol of the structure of Woolf's later novels.  </p>

<p>Indeed, Woolf asserts that any symbolism in her writing needs to be vague, recalling her distaste for Russell's new symbolic language: "I can't manage Symbolism except in this vague, generalized way," she insisted, "directly I'm told what a thing means, it becomes hateful to me."<sup><a name="REF88" href="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>  This preference for vagueness and hatred for 'direct' writing could similarly be attributed to the other early twentieth-century novelists who constitute the linguistic turn in fiction. Henry James, pace Woolf's depiction, declared his "confidence in the positive saving virtue of vagueness," and readers and critics have amply noted his "inveterate indirectness" since his 'major phase' works were published: a 1901 reviewer declared, "Henry James at His Vaguest: <i>The Sacred Fount</i>, His Latest Work, Is Also His Most Characteristic."<sup><a name="REF89" href="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>  James Joyce's works, too, move towards greater indirection in the trajectory from <i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, to <i>Ulysses</i>, to the punnings and portmanteaux of <i>Finnegans Wake</i>. Yet Joyce emphasizes that even Stephen Dedalus's writing appears "vague words for a vague emotion" after he has imbibed a "vehicle of a vague speech" from his encounter with a prostitute.<sup><a name="REF90" href="#FOOT90">90</a></sup>  The debate about language's vagueness in philosophy is finally fully dramatized through Joyce's examination of the "the buried life of language" in <i>Finnegans Wake</i>.<sup><a name="REF91" href="#FOOT91">91</a></sup>  These modern novelists' investigation of vague language and form challenges Eliot's portrayal of modern writing as hard and direct. The simultaneous turn towards vagueness in philosophy and in fiction—a turn that has been crucially overlooked—provides a useful corrective to the overemphasis in literary criticism on classicism and objectivity as characterizing modernist works of art. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT37" href="#REF37">37</a>. With Russell, G. E. Moore's attitude towards vagueness was influential in early twentieth-century philosophical and literary circles, though his philosophy did more to suggest a direction than to formulate a rigorous theory of language. In fact, Wittgenstein took a jaundiced view of Moore, mostly because of what Wittgenstein deemed Moore's unstable notion of definitions. Wittgenstein noted that although Moore's attitude towards clarity was a key aspect of his philosophy, he was not primarily concerned with <i>the way</i> words mean what they mean. Wittgenstein's biographer records Wittgenstein's now infamous dismissal of Moore: "'Moore?'—he once said—'he shows you how far a man can go who has absolutely no intelligence whatever,'" Ray Monk, <i>Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius </i>(New York: Penguin Books, 1991), 262.

Mark Hussey calls for "a new field of inquiry: the philosophical implications of Woolf's art, and thus the implications for our lived experience in the world," in <i>The Singing of The Real World</i> (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1986), xiv. There is actually a limited, though important, amount of scholarship on Woolf and philosophy. S. P. Rosenbaum's article, "The Philosophical Realism of Virginia Woolf," <i>English Literature and British Philosophy</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1971), explicates the connection between G. E. Moore's "Refutation of Idealism" and Woolf's depiction of the "obduracy of matter." Rosenbaum's later works on Bloomsbury (3 vols.) continue to examine the relationship between Bloomsbury and Moore's philosophy. Tom Regan, author of <i>Bloomsbury's Prophet</i> and "Moore and Bloomsbury: The Myth and the Man," <i>The British Tradition in 20</i><sup>th</sup><i>-Century Philosophy</i>, ed. Jaakko Hintikka and Klaus Puhl (Vienna: Verlag Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky, 1995), similarly emphasizes the connection between Moore's "naturalistic fallacy," and Bloomsbury values, claiming that "What Bloomsbury's Cambridge core also found in the <i>Principia</i> was a philosophical justification for their anti-authoritarian and anti-conventional tendencies" . He contests Paul Levy, who argues in <i>G. E. Moore and the Cambridge Apostles</i> (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1979) that Bloomsbury was "influenced by Moore's charismatic personality but by his moral philosophy not at all" . Russell in his autobiography denied Moore's influence on Bloomsbury, stating Bloomsbury embraced an elitist and aesthetic "doctrine, [which] quite unfairly, they fathered upon G. E. Moore, whose disciples they professed to be," <i>The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell</i>, vol. 1 (Boston: Little Brown, 1967), 94–5. Gillian Beer's excellent essay on "Hume, Stephen, and Elegy in <i>To The Lighthouse</i>," <i>Virginia Woolf's To The Lighthouse, Modern Critical Interpretations</i>, ed. Harold Bloom (New York: Chelsea Publishers, 1988), demonstrates how, through her father, Woolf imbibed the idea of "the fictitiousness of the separation between object and subject," and argues that in Woolf people "survive . . . in a kind of writing which eschews permanence," 93. Rosenbaum's "Wittgenstein in Bloomsbury: 1911–1931," and Martha Nussbaum's "The Window: Knowledge of Other Minds in Virginia Woolf's <i>To The Lighthouse</i>," both collected in Hintikka and Puhl, are two Wittgensteinian readings of Woolf; the former a historical essay, describing the Apostles and Russell's influence on Wittgenstein, the latter arguing that Woolf's "approach can in some respects be fruitfully compared with some interpretations of the later Wittgenstein, particularly that in Stanley Cavell's <i>The Claim of Reason</i>," and that <i>To The Lighthouse</i> depicts the possibility of knowing the other as other. Banfield's <i>Phantom Table</i> and Hussey's <i>Singing of the Real World</i> are the most pertinent texts to my discussion of Woolf, Russell, and vagueness. </p>

Ann Banfield notes the connection between Ramsay's dislike of vagueness and his "analytic spirit" and suggests that Woolf may be positing that vagueness, "the inability to distinguish one thing from another" may in fact be a sign of genius . Her work focuses, however, on Russell's <i>Theory of Knowledge</i> (1912–14) and argues that "underlying Woolf's art was a thought, a philosophical project worthy of new attention," which is "the theory of knowledge" (ix). It seems unlikely that Woolf would actually have been conversant with Russell's theory of sensibilia, and proving Woolf's unconscious assimilation of this particular theory often seems to stretch Banfield's readings of Woolf against the grain.  </p>

<p id="lead">"Nazis. We love them," professes Tony Barta, referring to Hollywood's fascination with fascism as its most beloved villain . Tall black leather boots, well-cut Nazi uniforms, Germanic accents, and fascist architecture have energized and sexualized the worn plots of Hollywood films and their primal conflict between good and evil for more than half a century. "The reason for all the German uniforms and everything is that the Germans made the best-looking stuff. Art directors love it," said Ed Neumeier, screenwriter for Paul Verhoeven's science fiction thriller, <i>Starship Troopers</i> , in an interview (Svetkey 8). To be sure, the films that stage fascism's seductive powers most spectacularly are often films about our future—science fiction films. From <i>Star Wars </i>(1977–83) and <i>Gattaca </i> to <i>Equilibrium</i> , <i>Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow </i>, or <i>Hellboy</i> , science fiction action-thrillers resurrect fascistic troops and fascist architecture, tinker with a master race, or evoke the archetypal evil of Nazi villains. TV classics such as <i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i> (1993–1999) lost much of their semantic depth if the episodes were not modeled on the quasi-Holocaust suffered by the Bajorans at the hands of the fascist Cardassians (Kapell 104–14).  </p>

<p>The current cinematic appropriation of fascism focuses on the performativity that rendered it cinema material in the first place; it is articulated by a self-referential, but historically blind system of cinematic signifiers. Fascism reappears in the popular imagination less as a historical legacy than as a reservoir of aesthetic images and spectacles referring to earlier cinematic representations 

<b></b>

 of Nazism rather than the political realities of the Third Reich. Michael Verhoeven's 1996 science fiction spectacle, <i>Starship Troopers,</i> lends itself to an exploration of how contemporary science fiction film transports the past into the future and why. <i>Starship Troopers</i>, like other recent sci-fi films, functions as a postmodern pastiche that exploits the "terrific" spectacle of the Third Reich without any clear moral reference point. It exemplifies how current science fiction cinema translates history into spatial registers that override temporal coordinates and how this translation is aided by advanced digital media that "transcode" cultural discourses and categories, such as history, into digitally enhanced surfaces or game options. </p>

<p>The big budget <i>Starship Troopers, </i>designed to have international appeal, turned out to be a box office flop. Critics panned its poor acting and excessive carnage, and focused on the fascist overtones by a Dutch director whose pre-Hollywood career included anti-fascist features such as <i>Soldaat van Oranje</i> . Loosely based on the novel by the much debated and allegedly right-wing science fiction author Robert E. Heinlein, <i>Starship Troopers</i> features a futuristic, military society whose values include submission to state authority and self-sacrifice for the sake of the human race. While the novel concentrates on the rigorous demands made on infantry combatants as part of the war machinery, Verhoeven expands its scope by developing the war with an alien race into outrageous representations of dehumanized Otherness. At some point in the distant future, Earth engages in a deadly intergalactic battle against a race of giant, intelligent bugs, the arachniads, who hurl their spores into space and threaten to annihilate humanity. The film's storyline follows the fate of four high school graduates who enter military service to participate in the t against the arachniads. <i>Starship Troopers</i> makes ample use of the convention of reducing representations of fascism to mere signals: black SS-like uniforms of the troopers and intelligentsia, Mussolini-style eagles, and intimidating halls and public spaces serve as a backdrop for the extreme suspense. Fascistic Earth also sacrifices its own kind in large numbers on the battlefields of the arachniad empire which are littered with charred insect and mutilated human bodies. Meanwhile the four high school friends rise through the ranks of the army and experience romantic entanglements seemingly unperturbed by the fascist values of their society and the genocide around them. While fascist signifiers dominate the look of <i>Starship Trooper</i>, the film also re-inscribes xenophobic constellations into futuristically altered and technologically enhanced social contexts. </p>

<p>The technological perfection of <i>Starship Troopers</i> has always garnered more attention than the narrative of the film. With its digitized computer animation and its poorly developed dialogue and storyline, the film resembles a giant video game more than a movie. A web-based, 3-D game as well as an interactive CD-ROM were developed parallel to the movie, both featuring three-dimensional battle scenes with the aliens and appealing to the growing number of computer game users. The opulent design and animation of different bugs with different functions involved traditional model 

<b></b>

 building and new technology that allowed the digital creation of bug swarms laced with interactive elements and pyro-effects for the battle scenes (Sammon 79–81). The special effects for the battleship scenes in space required compositing shots of small scale model ships and full-size ships on location with digital elements such as stars, planets, and space (Sammon 77). In sum, <i>Starship Troopers</i> is a special effects feast. The opulent design of different types of giant insects and their computerized interaction with human troopers had special effects buffs praise the feature as the then most advanced film in terms of its complex mix of animation, digitalization and on-location filming. </p>

<p>To Barry Keith Grant, the films of Paul Verhoeven are "exemplary postmodern texts." <i>Starship Troopers,</i> he argues, extrapolates from Heinlein the fascistic principles of a militarist society and even revels in the graphic imagery of "guts and glory," only to subvert the reactionary ideology by juxtaposing it with images of official state propaganda attempting to mask the effects of war (Grant 27). <i>Starship Troopers</i> can be read as a postmodern pastiche that ironicizes, but also plays to contemporary obsessions with Nazism and the Holocaust; it simulates fascism and collapses the past into the future in the form of a grand spectacle more terrific, in the double sense of the word, than the Third Reich itself. Two factors, however, complicate the film's reading. One is a narrative economy that forces audiences to side with fascist, prototypically Aryan-looking humans against alien bugs, the other the interplay between new digital media technologies and the representation of the past. </p>

<p>"It is best to discuss the future in terms of the known—that is, the past and the present," asserts Marleen S. Barr in her preface to <i>Envisioning the Future: Science Fiction and the Next Millennium</i>  (xi). That the past has become an obsession of cinema has been amply stated by historians and cultural critics. Particularly Jean Baudrillard has argued that with our Western societies' move into the simulated worlds of the hyper-real, history has become our lost referential, the last great myth that particularly the cinema pursues with a vengeance . In "perfect remakes" and "extraordinary montages" that emerge from new technologies of mixed media, contemporary film simulates history without the political investments and struggles that once gave it substance (Baudrillard 44–45). To be sure, the Third Reich in the context of WW II can be considered one of the last cohesive grand narratives, that, according to Jean-Francois Lyotard, postmodern thinking has abandoned. In a similar vein, Frederic Jameson argues, this resulting "weakening of historicity" produces emotional "'intensities'" without historical depth . Verhoeven's own investment in the <i>Starship Troopers</i> seems to be fuelled by such a nostalgic search for history as lost referential: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"I'd always wanted to do a movie about the Second World War, because I think it is an extremely interesting period. And since I'd experienced the Nazi occupation of my homeland when I was a boy, the concept also had personal connections. <i>Starship Troopers</i>

 seemed to be an opportunity to explore that period in an unusual way, and to translate my feelings about it onto the science fiction framework".</p>

<p><i>Starship Troopers</i> certainly creates such intensities. In the voice-over commentary on the 2002 DVD release of <i>Starship Troopers,</i> Verhoeven explains how his childhood memories of WWII and German fascism have entered into the film. The digitalized and animated shots of the spectacular battle scenes in space represent traumatic childhood experiences of burning ter jets over the coast of Holland at night, and the damage inflicted on these battleships resonates with Verhoeven's experience of the bombing of Dutch suburban areas during the war. The elaborate shots of the space ship, Rodger Young, and its strangely beautiful destruction by the illuminated firework-like spores of the arachniads, transforms WWII events and experiences into their own images that bear the emotional intensity, but not the historical semantics of the events of the war itself. Yet <i>Starship Troopers</i> abounds with visual allusions that quote films from the 1930s and reference historical landmarks and events.  </p>

<p>The film opens with a recruitment ad entitled "Do your part," whose mise-en-scène is lifted directly from Leni Riefenstahl's infamous Nazi propaganda film, <i>Triumph of the Will</i> , featuring the beauty of the armoured and disciplined body and the will to sacrifice. Others that encourage youth to enlist and become citizens through military service, or exalt death and sacrifice, are reminiscent of Frank Capra's <i>Why We t</i> series (1943–5), America's propagandistic answer to the Nazi propaganda machine. Critics have noted that the film's action imitates assorted WWII events. The arachniads' sink attack alludes to Pearl Harbor; the catastrophic invasion of Klendathu followed by the pell-mell retreat from the planet at the center of the arachniad empire is a reminder of Dunkirk. A series of strategic peripheral attacks can be compared to the American army's island-hopping in the Pacific and the decisive turning point during the third attack on the arachniads is reminiscent of D-Day (O'Hehir 54). All these events are recognizable within a science fiction setting because they have been rendered iconic in numerous cinematic versions of WWII. <i>Starship Troopers</i> re-enacts such visual and narrative clues of the Third Reich and WWII without engaging with that history in a discursive manner. For instance, fascistic Earth performs the role of the Allies during WWII, while the arachniads who are invaded by human settlers are cast as the ultimate enemy: their attack on the human colony established on their soil smacks of the attack of the Japanese on Pearl Harbour. In short, the film performs iconic sights of the Third Reich and WWII, distributing them arbitrarily and playfully among opposing parties in the film, yet rendering them more spectacular and suspense-laden than their historical originals. <i>Starship Troopers</i> conflates the past and the future by forwarding the emotional "intensities" attached to iconic visual representations of bombings, fascist emblems, and war and by obscuring the contours of these historical events.  </p>

<p>Other recent sci-fi films evoke this fusion of past and future by immersing themselves passionately in the mythically shrouded landmarks of the WWII era. <i>Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow </i> unfolds as a futuristically enhanced version of the 1930s. The film opens with a breathtaking stylized shot of a fictitious Hindenburg III 

<b></b>

 majestically docking at the top of the Empire State building. While the plans for such a docking station were abandoned in 1937 when the real Hindenburg was destroyed by fire thereby ending the zeppelin era, the retro-styled future world of <i>Sky Captain</i> completes the unfulfilled promises of the past. With its sepia-tone skyline of Manhattan inspired by the industrial designers of the 1939 World Fair, the screening of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> , the evocation of the eve of WWII through shots of robots marching through the streets of Manhattan in geometric Riefenstahlian patterns, <i>Sky Captain</i>, far from engaging with the 1930s, conjures up the heightened tension of the era in order to create a mythical, ahistorical space. </p>

<p>Contemporary media, Vivian Sobchack argues, foster changed, postmodern understandings of history in which historical events are considered increasingly indeterminate in their boundaries and historic significance ("History Happens" 2). Film and television, by amplifying their representational immediacy, are increasingly closing the temporal distance between present, past, and future that structured earlier notions of the temporal dimensions we call history ("History Happens" 4–5). That means an event and its representation, immediacy, and reflection have moved increasingly towards simultaneity or synchronicity ("History Happens" 3). Fascist images, then, like other historic images, can be recalled, segmented, inserted, and amplified at will: they can be cannibalized randomly. Sci-fi films such as <i>Gattaca</i> or <i>Equilibrium</i> unfold authoritarian or racist societies which are marked as fascistic by quoting aesthetic conventions of monumental neo-classical buildings, intimidating public spaces, and grandiose architectural plans of the fascist regimes of the 1930s to saturate a semantically deep vision of the future.  </p>

<p>This changing understanding of history is accompanied and facilitated by new technologies such as digital media which process the arbitrary and motivated segmentation of time and history in bits and shots (White 22–23). As past, future, and present move closer together, they forge a new historical consciousness that also allows Nazi res and emblems to spill over from the past into the future. Verhoeven's "translation" of childhood experiences into a science fiction setting indeed addresses the past "in an unusual way;" it reformats a traumatic past for the surfaces and interfaces required by new digital environments. The waning of historicity, which Jameson diagnosed as a symptom of the late twentieth-century cultural production, is countered by a domination of culture "by space and cultural logic" . During this process, aided by new technologies, history loses its temporality and becomes more "spatial." </p>



<div class="sec-break">

<p>Spatial aspects are integral to science fiction: the look, iconography, and landscape of science fiction constitute it as a genre. Vivian Sobchak's reprinted edition of <i>Screening Space</i>  applies Jameson's work to science fiction film, thereby identifying the augmentation of space as one of the main characteristics of science fiction films of the 1980s and 90s (223–306). <i>Starship Troopers</i> neither possesses the sensuous clutter of <i>Blade Runner</i>  nor the costume museum of <i>Dune</i> , yet it exhibits both 

<b></b>

 the deflation (and the increase in surface) and the conflation of space (the excess scenography) that Sobchack diagnosed as typical for the science fiction films of the late twentieth century. A number of interconnected factors contribute to the expansion of surface rather than of depth in <i>Starship Troopers</i>.  </p>

<p><i>Starship Troopers</i> owes its visual appeal to its fascist décor and design, its surface and style. The federal eagle, the swastika-like logo on flags and insignia, the well-cut SS outfits of Carl, the intelligence officer, or the Speer-inspired grand architecture make Earth look less historically faded than fittingly retro chic. Part of the story takes place in Buenos Aires, yet only the city's and the actors' names bear a Latin character, while architecture and surroundings breathe a stylish mix of Californian with Nazism. The representation of Nazism in <i>Starship Troopers</i> amounts to a collection of images and spectacles which connote both imaginary and stereotypical properties of fascism. What Jameson diagnosed for the nostalgia film's approach to the past can be applied to the colonization of the future in <i>Starship Troopers</i>, <i>Sky Captain</i>, or other sci-fi films. The future is "conveying 'pastness' by the glossy qualities of the image," resulting in a "'1930s-ness'" that clutters the filmic space of films with fascist décor (Jameson 19–20). Yet this "1930s-ness" is merely a performance of, not an engagement, with the past. </p>

<p>The amplified surfaces of "pastness" in <i>Starship Troopers</i> owe their effect to the reproductional technologies of computer animation. In a lengthy DVD commentary, Verhoeven and Neumeier emphasize the way both space and battle scenes had to be filmed, cut, and computerized and how the actors' performances needed to be simulated in light of the absent digital enemy. Some of the model spaceships were built to look like WWII naval battleships, others to resemble the transporters used to land Allied troops during D-Day; compositing shots of these model ships then were integrated into the digital environments. These interlocking technologies contribute to what new media critic Lev Manovich calls "transcoding": "To 'transcode' something is to translate it into another format. The computerization of culture gradually accomplishes similar transcoding in relation to all cultural categories and concepts. That is, cultural categories and concepts are substituted, on the level of meaning and/or language, by new ones that derive from the computer's ontology, epistemology, and pragmatics" . The use of new technologies in <i>Starship Troopers</i> and other sci-fi films transcodes the history of the Third Reich into spectacular sights accomplished by digital media. For the filming of <i>Sky Captain</i>, the actors had to perform in front of a blue screen to be inserted later into the computer-generated background, emphasizing the comic-book stereotypes that characterize the protagonists. The film thus can be read as a transcoding of 1930s and 40s comic-book super-heroes into the digital computer game surface of new media. The spatial sobriety owed to the digital environment becomes a new stylistic and aesthetic feature. Similarly, <i>Hellboy</i>, another recent past-future fusion based on a comic book, opens with a special effects laden scene of a time machine that the Nazis use to bring the Antichrist from the depth of time to help them win the war. The digitally enhanced performance of the time machine that produces the creature Hellboy transcodes the historical WWII battlefield into a fantasy game. The transcoding results in a visually and aesthetically superior text that exceeds the original history of WWII. For <i>Starship </i>

<b></b>

 <i>Troopers</i>, Verhoeven intended these spectacular sights to be "emotionally visceral" (Sammon 77) and thus accessible only through the emotional "intensities" that once fuelled the original history of the WWII era. </p>

<p>Verhoeven's casting choices add to the amplification of space in <i>Starship Troopers</i>. Humankind looks beautifully white. Although Verhoeven claimed that the appearance of other races in the structure of the army shows Earth's future society as egalitarian, black and Asian characters in the film have merely supporting roles or short appearances. The lead actors, from popular daytime teenage soaps such as <i>Melrose Place</i> (1992–1999) and <i>Beverly Hills, 90210 </i>(1990–2000), represent an all-white American community dressed in fashionable black and ting dirty, slimy, and gory bugs. As Verhoeven explains about the casting of the protagonists on the 2002 DVD commentary, he was looking specifically for actors fitting the proto-fascist mould. By choosing appearance over acting ability, he intended to plant an ironic and subversive trend into the film—none of the protagonists are strong personalities, but, on the contrary, get willingly and uncritically absorbed into the fascist ideology of their society. Yet the almost plasticine, cartoon-like performance of the cast and their insertion into the digital environment transposes Aryanism and Whiteness into technically and synthetically enhanced aesthetic styles: Nazism becomes fashion and Hitler entertainment.  </p>

<p>While many critics accused the film of advertising Nazism, Verhoeven insists on having intended a more subversive engagement with the past to interrogate our present through the medium of the future: "What I tried to do is use subversive imagery to make a point about society. I tried to seduce the audience to join [Troopers'] society, but then ask, 'What are you really signing up for?'" (Svetkey 9). In fact, the DVD release's special edition in 2002 is geared to diffuse the accusations of fascism through voice-overs and special features that include statements by producers and film critics. Could the spatial augmentation, the fascist clutter, the flat B-cast, and the computer-game surface of the film be conceived of as the director's attempt to first enthral and then critically confront the audience with Nazi extravaganzas? Verhoeven's version of Heinlein has certainly been read as an "aesthetic and ideological field of postmodern play" (O'Hehir 54). </p>

<p>This playfulness mostly emerges from the interactive, self-guided Internet news broadcast, the Federal Network, that intersperses and frames the film's narrative and disseminates the values of the authoritarian society. A propagandistic online news agency, it dominates the public sphere in the film. Similar propaganda news reports had been employed successfully and explicitly by Verhoeven in his earlier <i>RoboCop</i>  as a way to comment ironically on the corruption of society. But in <i>Starship Troopers</i> irony is not always easily discernible, as actions of the characters and newscasts, and, by extension, history and its representation, are often seamlessly interwoven. For example, borrowing again from Riefenstahl, Verhoeven shows the female infantrist Dizzy triumphantly waving a flag after a victory while she is turned into an image as part of 

<b></b>

 FedNet's ads. "Pixillated" and slowly drained of color, her movements are aestheticized by reducing them to slow motion, as she becomes part of the propagandistic online news coverage that stylizes the reality the characters experience. </p>

<p>While reviews of the film have, in their majority, focused on the liberal borrowings from Nazism (Gleiberman 53–4; Maio 88–92; Nashawaty 42–44), the voice-over commentary to the DVD edition has both Neumeier and Verhoeven emphasize aspects of the film that offer irony, subversion and critique of the fascist world presented, most of which refer to FedNet's broadcasts. In the segment entitled, "A World that Works," fully armed soldiers encourage a group of young children to hold and play with automatic weapons. The boys and girls respond eagerly; the overall message that violence makes for a safe society is described by Verhoeven as a hyperbolic social-political commentary. Yet the friendly soldiers could also easily be read as protectors of society. Two sequences later, FedNet shows a Mormon colony in the heart of the Arachniad empire where all colonists have been slaughtered; the camera panning across the screen shows a landscape littered with mutilated human bodies. Verhoeven praises this segment for its irony and subversiveness. The humans, he points out, are clearly shown as invaders of arachniad territory and initiators of the war between humans and bugs. The possible critique contained in the brief narrative segment, however, is drowned out by the power of the images of mutilated human bodies that, in their bloody excess, are bound to indoctrinate both the audiences of FedNet within the film's narrative universe as well as present-day audiences.  </p>

<p>One of the most ambiguous scenes involves a journalist who interviews troops on the battle station Ticonderoga. He suggests that the aliens were provoked by humans and that a live-and-let-live policy might be the best solution. The journalist is interrupted by the aggressive young hero, Johnny Rico, who supports the war effort as a means of revenge for the death of his parents. In a subsequent scene later in the film, when the same journalist reports live on the ground during the invasion, he becomes a spectacle of blood and death himself as he is impaled by an attacking bug. While these two scenes provide, as Verhoeven argues, critical commentary on the actions of the protagonists who go to war without questioning their orders or the ideology around them, this critique is visually erased: the pasty and unfit-looking journalist visually loses out against the confident, beautiful young heroes, and his violent death invalidates his reconciliatory policy and critical opinion. On the one hand, the overt propaganda of fascist news reports in <i>Starship Troopers</i> functions as a parodic distancing tool from the totalitarian and authoritarian aspects of governments; on the other hand, the possible parody of the racist and totalitarian images never translates into the consciousness of the characters, who never gain insight into the propaganda machine and the totalitarian workings of their own society. By only offering brainwashed and propagandized Aryan heroes as protagonists with which to identify, Verhoeven indeed comments on the "infinite corruptibility of narrative formations, whose structures can be filled with whatever content serves a given purpose" (Schulte-Sasse 2). <i>Starship Troopers</i>, however, does not discourage viewers who might experience the film's fascist universe as tempting. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>To appreciate irony and recognize parody, we require a referent, an accepted original. Parody enacts its critique by foregrounding the artifice of its model's representation of reality; in order to be effective, it first requires a norm from which a text deviates and then it exposes the incongruity between the two. Postmodern forms of parody mock the efforts to verify such a norm thereby pointing to the arbitrary nature of all interpretive constructs (Bennett 32–33). This modified form of parody, according to Linda Hutcheon, works through a "double-coding" ("Politics of Postmodernism" 192), which makes postmodern texts less radical than modern ones in that they are "more wilfully compromised, more ideologically ambivalent, or contradictory" because they simultaneously "destabilize and inscribe the dominant ideology" ("Epilogue" 125). This weakened form of ambivalent parody in <i>Starship Troopers</i> utilizes Nazi décor as a pastiche of styles, neither discouraging fascism nor encouraging a critical reading of it. The ambivalence in <i>Starship Troopers</i> results in a relativity of discourse that passes the responsibility for a critique of fascist forms in the film on to the audience, who may or may not relate to the self-reflexive parodic mode of the film. </p>

<p>Yet in numerous magazine interviews Verhoeven felt pressed to produce authoritative statements about how to read the film. Over and over he stated that he was not a "fascist," but "a democrat" and that the fascist world he envisions had subversive elements and was intended to be ironic (Svetkey 9). In the voice-over commentary on the 2002 DVD, Verhoeven can be heard in a desperate attempt to rectify the perception of his film as a flirtation with fascism. "Whenever you see a fascist uniform," he shouts exasperatedly into the voice-over microphone, "that means, bad, bad, bad." If Verhoeven, who can be considered a master of postmodern ironic subversion (Grant 27), felt that interpretation aids were necessary to decode the irony of <i>Starship Troopers</i>, the much gentler hints of ironic subversion in films such as <i>Sky Captain</i>, the film's self-referentiality to its own comic book status and pulp fiction stereotypes, will and have been even more widely overlooked. If parody is "contextually, not intrinsically defined," the codes necessary for the comprehension of postmodern parody need to be shared by both encoder and decoder (Hutcheon, "Politics of Postmodernism" 200; Bennett 28). Such congruity occurs only when the referential system is both obvious and obviously undermined in its repetition. Postmodern parody, however, is becoming increasingly impossible to encode beyond a vague ambiguity, as evidenced by the overwhelmingly critical responses to the "fascist subtext" of <i>Starship Troopers</i> and their lack of appreciation for the intended irony. </p>

<p>Yet if parody in its traditional sense ceases to work as a register, fascism can assume its full presence with the effect of "colonizing" the filmic text. Nazism's historic attempt to create, on film, what Benedict Anderson coined "imagined communities" and Linda Schulte-Sasse termed "pleasurable illusions of wholeness" presupposes another fantasy, that of ultimate Otherness . Yet the Other of any social group "is never outside or beyond us," as Homi K. Bhabha reminds us. "It merges forcefully, within cultural discourse, 

<b></b>

 when we think we speak most intimately and indigenously <i>between ourselves</i>" . Otherness, in other words, emerges as a suppressed element in those cultural contexts in which values such as community, homogeneity, and exclusive belonging become ultimate social fantasies. <i>Starship Troopers</i> cannot escape the inscription of ideology in its visual and narrative form—regardless of what Verhoeven as director might have intended. From this perspective, <i>Starship Troopers</i> engages with fascism's exclusionary and binary mechanisms in an intense, yet also guilt-free way. In <i>Starship Troopers</i>, National Socialist fantasies about the ultimate Other have taken on a visible shape that an ambivalent parodic mode is unable to disperse. The real stars of the film are not the "teeny-bopper bit players from glossy television soaps," but highly sophisticated, digitally animated bugs (Steyn 36). Still it is not the bugs, but the process of dehumanizing in order to exterminate them, which commands every single action in the film and which also lies at the heart of the creative sources for the film. </p>

<p>Heinlein's novel, written during the time of Sputnik anxiety, echoes the fear of the communist collectives in its description of the insects populating Klendathu and colonizing other planets (Cass 2). Similarly, in an interview about the imaginative origins for his script, writer Ed Neumeier related his childhood fear of bugs to a teacher's comment about the insect-like collectivism associated with the Chinese (Kronke 1). Director Paul Verhoeven shaped the film not only in reminiscence of the invasion of the Netherlands, but particularly with a conscious decision to utilize German propaganda films. The members of Phil Tippett Studios, responsible for the appearance of the bugs, created horrifying bugs as sexually devouring organisms (Sammon 69). In sum, the different imaginative sources of the film produce multi-layered anxieties about cultural Others that are subsumed into the abject, sexualized bodies of the alien insects.  </p>

<p>Race, however, "pretends to be an objective term of classification, when in fact it is a dangerous trope" (Gates 5). Such tropes of race have been exploited incessantly, most notoriously in German anti-Semitism. <i>Mein Kampf</i> is flooded with bestial metaphors and metonymies; according to Hitler, Jews produce neither culture nor technology; they merely colonize other cultures and are not concerned with ideals or values, but survival and reproduction (301–304). The notion of Jews as a never-ending plague of swarming insects and vermin informed much of Nazi propaganda, such as Fritz Hippler's pseudo-documentary <i>The Eternal Jew</i> . Just as this film intended to verify the uncontrollable reproduction of Jews, the aggressive fecundity of the alien insects in <i>Starship Troopers</i> is visualized not only in their need to expand their habitat by colonizing other planets, but also through their sexualization. </p>

<p>"Racist obsessions are hardly rational, but invariably tinged with sexuality: a preoccupation with, deadly curiosity about, the sexual excesses of the hated group" (Bernardi 82). While the ter-bugs in <i>Starship Troopers</i> are coded as hyper-aggressive and hyper-masculine with long extremities, blade-like jaws, and hooks in order to impale (preferably) females and to sever the body parts of males, the brain-bug is imagined as vampiristic, brain-sucking mother. It is female in its round, vessel-like shape and visceral composure; it has a slitted, vagina-like mouth organ, from which unfolds a hollow, pointed phallic proboscis, which can spike the top of a human head and suck its 

<b></b>

 brains out. In short, the alien insects of the film aggressively inscribe a cultural Other through the exoticization, sexualization, and dehumanization that most infamously marked National Socialism's fantasies of Jewish Others. The masculine prowess of the ter bugs, the fertility of the plasma bugs, and the vampiristic brain bug seem to unite a German anti-Semite's fantasies, the dangerous fusion of masculine and feminine sexual qualities in the Jew (Gilman 195–202).  </p>

<p>Against the reproductive sexuality of the bugs, the sexual energy contained in the eroticized image of the human warrior is transformed into an idealistic force that ultimately benefits the community. We witness male and female infantry members in the shower and gaze at their nude bodies, yet the dialogue is concerned with the relation of the individual to the state. In her reading of Leni Riefenstahl's <i>Triumph of the Will</i> , Susan Sontag concluded aptly that the "fascist ideal is to transform sexual energy into a 'spiritual' force, for the benefit of the community" . Sontag's reading extends uncomfortably to <i>Starship Troopers</i>. The only sexually charged human action the audience is privileged to see is a coitus interruptus between Johnny and Dizzy followed by an explicit order to "have fun" and report for duty after twenty minutes: Earth is at war, and the state disciplines, controls, and rechannels sexual energy into aggression against the enemy. Klaus Theweleit discusses in <i>Männerphantasien</i> the fascist male's fear of female floods, flowing, and fluidity in terms of the "body armour" that keeps emotions and desires in and bodily contamination out (418–22). In <i>Starship Troopers</i>, the sexual energy of male and female infantry is contained in constricting armoured suits and redirected into an orgasmic spectacle of fluids, guts, and gore, as the ting troopers scream equally with joy and disgust as they blast the abject bodily fluids of the bugs out of their crustaceous shells, flooding their own armours with green slime. Not only do the film images engage with larger themes of Nazi ideology, such as the contrast between the clean and the impure, the incorruptible and the defiled, but they also merge with science fiction's long-standing legacy of promoting "the purity and civility of whiteness" (Bernardi 82). </p>

<p>While <i>Starship Troopers</i> is suspended between a weakened parodic mode and the fascination of sex, death, and violence that Nazism gratified on a grand scale (Elsaesser, "Subject Positions" 151), the popular television series <i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i> (1993–99) offers a counterpoint to how contemporary sci-film taps into racist pasts. <i>DS9</i> makes allusions to and representations of WWII in an effort to carve meaning and moral out of fascism, anti-Semitism, and the Holocaust. The popular series focuses on the conflict between the Cardassians and their victims, the Bajorans whose planet has been invaded causing a Bajoran diaspora all over the galaxy, but also 10 million victims murdered or exterminated in camps. The two races are modeled on Hitler's rise to power to explain Cardassian fascism, and Jewish history to unfold Bajoran culture. <i>DS9's</i> re-enactment of the Holocaust within the future takes place within a paradigm often called the "Americanization of the Holocaust," which transforms the historical Holocaust into the heroic gestures of resistance ters and survivors fit for mainstream prime time entertainment: every Bajoran in the show is by definition a survivor (Kapell 108–111). Where <i>DS9</i> overcomes racism by cancelling out genocidal 

<b></b>

 victimhood altogether, <i>Starship Troopers</i> videogame surface offers a guilt-free mock-Holocaust with alien insects. </p>

<p>Despite its abundant allusions to National Socialist fantasies and phantasms, however, it is difficult to conceive of <i>Starship Troopers</i> as screened memory of anti-Semitism or the Holocaust, when the alien insects are so decidedly non-human. While dehumanizing the Other is always part of the process of excluding, expelling, or exterminating cultural Others, as German anti-Semitism and other racisms detail, it is this dehumanized civilization in <i>Starship Troopers</i> that offers audiences and computer game users an imaginary license to kill—the opportunity to revel guilt-free in a genocide of holocaustic dimensions, leaving only burned and charred bugs. In <i>Starship Troopers</i>, fascist aesthetics operate without a historical referent and racism without a human signifier, allowing viewers to indulge in an exaltation of the beauty of fascist power and to engage in a mock-Holocaust without ever having to confront historical legacies or current views of racism.  </p>

<p>In conclusion: <i>Starship Troopers</i> performs an "exemplary postmodern text" that entertains through a grand simulacrum of Nazism, offers playful parodic ambiguities and enlists new media in order to fuse past and future into an emotionally intense viewing experience enticing audiences into a hyperactive genocidal computer game. The film subverts, but also recuperates contemporary fascinations with fascism that have provoked both critiques and defensive reactions. While postmodern playfulness, ambiguity, and temporal indeterminacy are accepted and encouraged in almost every other context, the Third Reich seems to be exempt from such relativity. Should one condemn the Nazi clutter in <i>Starship Troopers</i> and the numerous examples of North American mass culture, or celebrate it as cult or camp, thereby embracing it as one of many styles and aesthetic possibilities? How, in other words, should we judge the commodification of one of history's most vicious chapters, its transformation from fact into fantasy, from past into pop? That we fetishize that past in a both ironic and nostalgic manner points neither to the past nor to the future, but, as Thomas Elsaesser has argued, to the present. Rather than defending or refuting the film's fascist trajectory, Verhoeven himself, playing devil's advocate once again, suggests on the 2002 DVD release that "war makes fascists of us all." Regardless of his daring allusions to the world-wide war on terrorism, Verhoeven's comments exemplify that purposeful collisions of the past and the future most often converge in the present, in which Nazism remains a signifier that gains new, albeit ambivalent, meanings when re-examined against the emotional intensities of contemporary debates about military aggression and just causes. </p>

<b>Abstract</b>
<p>Social fragmentation and cultural incoherence are conventionally regarded as trademark modernist themes, among the defining processes of modernity. Using Matthew Arnold as a touchstone, this paper frames the anxiety about wholeness as a Victorian inheritance, and anchors the discussion of fragmentation concretely in two early twentieth-century attempts to imagine society: Ford Madox Ford's social criticism and the first meetings of the London Sociological Society. I read Ford's 1905 impressionistic essay <i>The Soul of London</i> and his 1908 supernatural romance <i>Mr. Apollo</i> in light of Edwardian sociology's preoccupation with synthesis. Ford's social criticism supplemented and critiqued scientific sociology by the importance it assigned to the affect of interest, and to pathos.</p>

<p id="lead">Culture, for Matthew Arnold, was a vantage point from which life could be seen whole and integral, disencumbered of both the blinkers of class interest and the magnifying glass of the specialist. As Raymond Williams has shown, Arnold's "opposition to the powerful Utilitarian tendency which conceived education as the training of men to carry out particular tasks" was a recurrent theme in the nineteenth-century critique of industrialization, running from Burke to Arnold via Carlyle and Newman, but Arnold's <i>Culture and Anarchy</i> was to be "more influential than any other single work in this tradition."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Refusing the fragmentation of knowledge into specialized disciplines, its author dryly disclaims all professional credentials, styling himself "a plain, unsystematic writer, without a philosophy" and pleading instead the cultured man's prerogative to appraise any social question whatever.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  What Arnold called "<i>totality</i>"—his humanist ideal of well-rounded selfhood—was a more important qualification than specialist expertise (<i>CA</i>, 193). Likewise, the visionary vagueness of "the best that can at present be known in the world" serenely ignores the problem of disciplinary specialization, lumping together every category of knowledge in a single digest of human achievement (<i>CA</i>, 151).  </p>

<p>T. S. Eliot scolded Arnold for making culture into a religion.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  But if Arnold's faith in culture seemed passé to the modernist mandarinate, the crisis of social fragmentation and cultural incoherence that he diagnosed lived on as quintessential modernist concerns. During the Second World War another canonical modernist, E. M. Forster, found Arnold so prescient that "when we read him now he seems to be in the room," and even as a 

<b></b>

young novelist impatient of Victorian hypocrisy Forster looked to Arnold as an apt diagnostician of European anomie, if not as its therapist.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  <i>Howards End</i> is, among other things, a test of how Arnold's project of consolidation might be implemented by other means than literature. The weak-hearted clerk Leonard Bast is plainly a dupe of Arnold's cultural evangelism, ploughing through reams of Ruskin every evening in search of non-specific enlightenment. He longs by this means to one day "see the universe," but reads unsystematically and superstitiously, hoping "to come to Culture suddenly, much as the Revivalist hopes to come to Jesus."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Bast represents a miscarriage of Arnold's "<i>general</i> expansion" of culture, incarnating instead the leveling of literary value that Arnold feared (<i>CA</i>, 62). He makes no distinction between high culture and sententious or jingoistic popular literature, invoking the doyenne of the mass market, Marie Corelli, to judge the Schlegel sisters, and earnestly citing (to Helen's distaste) E. V. Lucas's middle-brow patriotic travelogues (<i>HE</i>, 53, 125). Forster paraphrases Arnold's much-quoted sonnet "To A Friend" as a gloss on Leonard's pathetic and uncomprehending trajectory through the world of Schlegels and Wilcoxes: "To see life steadily and see it whole was not for the likes of him." Leonard's son, however, the fruit of his and Helen Schlegel's connection, may well fare better, his inheritance of Howards End promising to restore the Bast line to its sustaining rural roots. Here, after all, "[i]n these English farms, if anywhere, one might see life steadily and see it whole" (<i>HE</i>, 67, 264).  </p>

<p>It is not my purpose here to trace the manifold recurrences of this Arnoldian saw in Forster's novel, nor to measure the mutations in liberalism that distinguish Arnold's normative "Best Self" from Forster's veneration of the self as such, in its infinite variety. By recalling Forster's allusion to Arnold, I want only to dramatize the persistence of this structure of feeling—this desire for totality—for early twentieth-century social thinkers, whether novelists like Forster and, as we shall shortly see, Ford Madox Ford, or scientists. Forster's manner of reworking Arnold's ideal also points up a distinction to be made between these two groups, for whereas the novelists Forster and Ford adulterated their Arnold with a spoonful of modernist skepticism, many Edwardian sociologists preferred to swallow his program holus-bolus. The main focus in what follows will be Ford's <i>The Soul of London</i> —the first volume of a trilogy of social criticism and a breakthrough work for his literary career—and his novel <i>Mr. Apollo</i> , but I will contrast these literary works with the self-consciously scientific discourse of Edwardian sociology, and particularly the early proceedings of the London Sociological Society. The Society held its first meeting in the spring of 1904, just as Ford was finishing <i>The Soul of London</i>, and the climax of its initial activities coincided with the completion of the series: in 1907 <i>England and the English</i> was published as a single volume in the U.S., and the liberal intellectual L. T. Hobhouse was appointed to Britain's first chair of sociology. The trace of Arnold's dream of unity is apparent in both Ford's social criticism and the discourse of Edwardian sociology, but whereas sociologists entertained, on the whole, an Enlightenment optimism about the proximity of this goal, Ford's response, like Forster's, was equivocal.

<p>The growing tendency to favor specialist training over humanistic <i>Bildung</i> was a minor theme of <i>Culture and Anarchy</i>, one of the obstacles to seeing things as they were. Arnold, as we have seen, lamented the "intense energetic absorption in the particular pursuit we happen to be following," and carped that the institution lately endowed by Ezra Cornell in upstate New York "seems to rest on a misconception of what culture truly is, and to be calculated to produce miners, or engineers, or architects, not sweetness and light" (<i>CA</i>, 200). In <i>Howards End</i> Forster, too, registered his discontent with the cult of expertise, sniffing at "the student's belief in experts" and complaining that modern man leaves "psychology . . . to the specialist, which is as if he should leave his dinner to be eaten by a steam-engine" (<i>HE</i>, 275, 273). The science of psychology, Forster insists, is taking the division of labor too far, delegating a natural human function to purpose-built machines. The critique of specialization exemplified here by Arnold and Forster was not, however, an occupation reserved for poets and novelists. Sociologists, too, laid claim to the virtue of holism. </p>

<p>As Wolf Lepenies has shown, sociology and literature were natural competitors in the nineteenth-century ecology of social knowledge, each aspiring to a complete interpretation of industrial society and the individual's place within it, rather than the more specialized task of explaining isolated phenomena. Lepenies argues that Matthew Arnold's insistence that culture alone could round up and decipher the findings of the modern sciences made him, in the eyes of some, a sociologist manqué. The positivist and sometime president of the London Sociological Society, Frederick Harrison, went so far as to say that "Arnold . . . was constantly talking Comte without knowing it, and was quite delighted to find how cleverly he could do it."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Although Comtean positivism was not the only doctrine preached at the Society, its credo of the interconnectedness of all social phenomena was common ground for almost every sociological camp, and in this sense the mission of Edwardian sociology was entirely consistent with Arnold's.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In the second half of the nineteenth century "sociology" had been primarily identified with either the positivist doctrine of Auguste Comte or the stridently individualist social theory of Herbert Spencer.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In the Edwardian era, however, Spencer's influence was in decline while, as the historian Phillip Abrams observes, "organized Positivism . . . was a fragile growth," and British sociology remained a volatile category, lacking either an institutional base or an intellectual orthodoxy.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Its proper application was contested by a variety of thinkers and sects and even by the colonizing ambitions of other sciences, so that the need for self-definition was high on the London Sociological Society's order of business. As Stefan Collini points out, a pattern emerged "in which the speaker propounded his own definition of the aims and methods of sociology, and his audience, by way of criticism, briefly exercised their own hobby-horses."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  The precise genealogies of these diverse schools of thought will not concern me here; what I want to stress is the opposition to specialism that they held in common. A broad consensus was reached at the London Sociological Society that sociology should be synthetic in purpose, coordinating and interpreting the findings of more specialized disciplines. 

<b></b>

Evidently, this ambition had much in common with Arnold's desire to, as Lepenies puts it, "bring together the discoveries of the modern sciences"—to see modern life steadily and see it whole.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> </p>

<p>The liberal social theorist J. A. Hobson, a founding member of the Society, recalls in his memoir that its mission "seemed to many of us a precarious project, partly because it appeared to conflict with the tendency to specialize and subdivide which the conception of 'thoroughness' involved."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  In <i>The Social Problem</i>  Hobson had, in fact, invoked Arnold in order to criticize this "tendency," attacking "[t]he academic person who seeks precision by minute specialization [and who] denies that there is a Social Question," whereas "all great philosophers have sought to 'see life steadily, and see it whole'." In a chapter entitled "The Need of a Sociology," Hobson couched this Arnoldian holistic project in more scientific terms, calling for a "close and accurate intellectual replica of the entire intricacy of the social processes."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  This predilection for the overarching view is professed many times in the Society's proceedings. A preliminary circular sent out to leading thinkers and academics annexed the whole "unfolding process or drama of social evolution" to the sociologist's purlieu, a portfolio which, it goes without saying, "profoundly distinguishes the Sociologist from the specialist investigator who occupies himself exclusively with the study of some particular one of the many recognised approaches to social knowledge."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Emile Durkheim, inaugural professor of sociology at the University of Bordeaux and founder of the journal <i>L'année sociologique</i>, bestowed his imprimatur on the enterprise with a lecture "On the Relation of Sociology to the Social Sciences and to Philosophy," in which he, too, laid the stress on synthesis, the need for sociologists "to interpenetrate the diverse technical studies more fully with the sociological conception of unity."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Behind this conception of sociology lay the nineteenth-century anxiety that scientific knowledge was piling up much faster than it could be organized, let alone digested. As L. T. Hobhouse, soon to become Britain's first professor of sociology, put it at a meeting of the society in 1905,  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[w]e have in . . . the second half of the nineteenth century, the rise and predominance of specialism. We have the fact that knowledge is pursued in detail. It is so broken up, on the one hand, and amassed into such enormous heaps on the other, and this in every direction, that it has been apparently impossible for any human mind to grasp it in its entirety. The stream of thought is thus, as it were, choked, as the result of specialism.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The "stream of thought," a metaphor often on the tip of Arnold's pen, was to be unblocked in the twentieth century not by culture, but by sociology.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The legacy of Victorian knowledge was collapsing under its own weight, and only a metascience working from the blueprint of social evolution could put its estate in order.  </p>

<p>This ambition of total synthesis now sounds quite audacious enough, but the aims of some sociologists were grander still; indeed, utopic. Value-neutrality was not a prominent scruple among Edwardian sociologists, who tended to see themselves as society's navigators, authorities on its best interests. It is only to be expected, then, that sociology, like Arnold's culture, would move in to fill the void left by the decline of religious belief, and offer itself not as an esoteric science but as a desirable attitude for 

<b></b>

the layperson. A public familiar with the interconnected nature of the social organism, some sociologists reasoned, could hardly fail to adjust its conduct in favor of the collective interest. Anthony Giddens provides an apt analysis of this peculiarly sociological hubris, the belief that "knowledge could be filtered continuously into the reasons for social action, producing step-by-step increases in the 'rationality' of behaviour in relation to specific needs."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  This very metaphor of filtration was used by Hobson to express the hope that sociological understanding would "percolate into the general mind," whilst Victor Branford, a driving force in the Society's foundation, thought it feasible "to impart to every sane adult of the population, what we would here call the sociological habit of mind." This would entail "the power and habit of picturing any particular social phenomenon (say, a loaf of bread, or a band of musicians, a policeman, or a horse-race), not merely as an object of personal use or enjoyment . . . but also as . . . an element in that unfolding series of actions and reactions which we are learning to call evolution."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Part and whole would be inseparable. Like Eliot's poet, who could integrate such miscellaneous modern experiences as falling in love, reading Spinoza, the noise of a typewriter, and the sound of cooking, sociological man would enjoy a thoroughly solidary sensibility.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> </p>

<p>Like any nascent discipline vying for tenure in a competitive intellectual marketplace, sociology was promoted by way of grandiose claims about both the good it could do for society and the extent of its legitimate field of study. It promised to replace the altruism and fellow-feeling previously assured by Christianity with a new, scientific counterweight to egoism, which we might call <i>cognitive altruism</i>.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  And it recognized almost no limit to the kinds of things it ought to concern itself with. As Hobhouse put it in the first number of the <i>Sociological Review</i> in 1908, "To the sociologist 'nothing that is human is foreign'."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
The Soul of London 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Both of these tropes—the idea that a single social observer could be interested in everything human, and the concern with altruism—red prominently in Ford Madox Ford's thinking about society and the role of the artist. Indeed, he cited the very same humanist aphorism as Hobhouse in his own journal, the <i>English Review</i>, a year later, although he preferred the original Latin: "'<i>Nihil humanum a me alienum puto</i>'."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  <i>The Soul of London</i>, like its sequels <i>The Heart of the Country</i>  and <i>The Spirit of the People</i> , seems written with this dictum in mind, comprising a scrapbook of London vignettes and opinions rather than a well-defined research project. The apparent dilettantishness of such a method did not damage the book in the eyes of the critics, however, and it became Ford's first major <i>succès d'estime</i>. Aggressively marketed by the young publishing house Alston Rivers, it received favorable reviews on the day of publication (2 May) from three major dailies—including the archetype of the halfpenny mass newspaper, Lord Northcliffe's <i>Daily Mail</i>—and was later praised more circumspectly in the triumvirate of lofty literary weeklies: the <i>Athenaeum</i>, the <i>Academy</i>, and the <i>TLS</i>. In the words of Edward Garnett it was "boomed, boomed furiously," and in 

<b></b>

October Joseph Conrad was able to report a change in Ford's fortunes: "Hueffer's work was kept off for 3 years and now it is all going as easy as can be."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> </p>

<p>One review in particular highlights Ford's rationale of eclecticism, that interest in all things human which characterizes the trilogy as a whole. Choosing the third volume, <i>The Spirit of the People</i>, as "Book of the Week" in January 1908, <i>The New Age </i>expressly ratified Ford's method of miscellaneous detail: "His power of seeing the psychological content of apparently trivial occurrences and chance remarks uttered by casual people is quite remarkable." Mundane events "are to him so many valuable indications of the spirit of the nation which he has so closely studied. No one can question that this method, wisely used, is the right one."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The author's openness to any data whatsoever is applauded. Although the title of each book proclaims the quest for a unitary essence—a soul, a heart, a spirit—Ford seems less inclined to isolate the nucleus of Englishness than to shatter it, purporting, in the preface to the third volume, "to write about only such things as interested him," and defining, in the first, the "ideal author" as one who is "passionately alive to all aspects of life."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The impressionist disclaimers Ford gives in the prefaces to all three volumes function, I suggest, as a license to take in the whole social scene, exempting the author from that mastery of secondary literature or possession of a technical qualification incumbent on the specialist. When Ford openly lays down subjectivist premises for his enterprise, proposing "a picture of the place as its author sees it" (<i>SL</i>, xii), "his personal view of his personal countryside," or "an image of the world he has lived in, reflected in his own personality" rather than the laborious research presented in "the work of reference, Blue book, statistical, etc," he is also asserting his right to write about everything, not as a dilettante, but as an "exact scientist" who has consistently applied a "method" of his own (<i>SP</i>, xiv–xv).<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>   </p>

<p>But if Ford describes a kind of sociological gaze here, one which sweeps the whole social landscape—"all aspects of life"—he is also painfully aware of its unattainability: "one falls," he writes, "no doubt very far short of one's ideal" (<i>SL</i>, xv). Like Forster, Ford had his doubts about whether Arnold's all-encompassing viewpoint was still an option in the twentieth century, concluding in 1911 that "[w]e may contemplate life steadily enough to-day: it is impossible to see it whole."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  As one would expect, the obligatory nod to Arnold appears also in <i>The Soul of London</i>, which explicitly addresses the need "to see London steadily and see it whole," but here again Ford is less sanguine than the sociologists Branford and Hobson about the attainability of totality, surmising that such panopticism would entail an uncomfortably schizoid mentality.

<p class="continued">Ford's oscillation between "impressionability" and "impersonality," sense data and abstraction, casts doubt on the possibility of the "sociological habit of mind" described 

<b></b>

by Branford: seeing steadily and whole seems to call for two or more very different selves—as it does literally in <i>Howards End</i>, with the complementarity of Margaret Schlegel and Henry Wilcox: it being "impossible to see modern life steadily and see it whole," Margaret chooses "to see it whole," whilst Henry "saw steadily" (<i>HE</i>, 165).  </p>

<p>This irreconcilability of concrete experience with the idea of the whole is perhaps the primary finding of <i>The Soul of London</i>, which begins from the premise that "London is illimitable" (<i>SL</i>, 16). As one critic has put it, Ford discovers an "inescapable connection between living in a metropolis and the loss of totality, objectivity, permanence."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Rather than "an impression, a remembered bird's-eye-view of London as a whole," such as might have been possible in the eighteenth century, the modern Londoner's perspective is like that of "the eye of a bird that is close to the ground," animated by a kind of perceptual appetite: just as the bird seeks "minute fragments of seed, minute insects, tiny parasites, we also look for things that to us are the constituents of our mental or visual pabula" (<i>SL</i> 14, 18). Then, too, the phenomenology of London fluctuates according to social class: the suburban commuter—the "villa dweller"—has the impression of "'Parks' and 'Gardens', surrounded by uninteresting or repulsive districts of small houses," whereas the "working man" thinks of tenements (<i>SL</i>, 19). Towards the end of the book, having come no closer to limiting the "illimitable" city, he brackets out the problem of totality by personifying the two poles of particularity and abstraction in two personality-types, the "Individualist . . . [who] sees his dead and his living as human beings," and the "Theorist who sees mankind only in the bulk" (<i>SL</i>, 154, 152). Finding these tendencies to be irreconcilable, Ford takes refuge from the deadlock in documenting "the present of our times," the supply of "unceasing mortals to be interested in" (<i>SL</i>, 175). This modest fallback position is hardly equal to the pretensions of Ford's title, and signals a definitive surrender to the demands of plurality. Matthew Arnold had been able to resolve the cacophonous demands of the <i>demos</i> with the device of a "Best Self," a Platonic ideal in which empirical differences melted away. For Ford, however, the compulsion to imagine the "strongly individualised human being" in each of the "small houses" glimpsed from the train renders the "Survey of a Modern City" uncompletable (<i>SL</i>, xv). </p>

<p>If the welter of subjectivities makes <i>The Soul of London</i> unachievable <i>a priori</i>, Ford encounters a further, <i>historical</i> hurdle in the rise of occupational specialization. As Arnold intimated in <i>Culture and Anarchy</i>, it had become apparent to nineteenth-century observers that a major obstacle to seeing life steadily and whole was the division of labor. Durkheim reached a similar conclusion in his 1892 treatise on the subject, although his attitude to this process was diametrically opposed to Arnold's. The specialist worker, he wrote, "need not embrace vast portions of the social horizon; it is sufficient that he perceive enough of it to understand that his actions have an aim beyond themselves."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Ford's chapter on "Work in London" is much concerned with the phenomenon of specialization, and specifically with what Max Weber called the <i>stahlhartes Gehäuse</i>, the "iron cage" in which capitalism installs its subjects: "that mighty cosmos of the modern economic order (which is bound to the technical and economic conditions of mechanical and machine production)."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Ford cites the classic

<b></b>

 example of watchmaking to illustrate the fact that "all work in London is almost of necessity routine work: the tendency to specialise in small articles, in small parts of a whole, insures that." This is true not only of workshops, but also of offices, where "a partner mentions the drift of a letter to a clerk, he dictates it to a shorthand-typewriter, she writes and addresses it, a boy posts it" (<i>SL</i>, 87). Drawing on chance encounters with a railway signalman and the cashier of a bus company, Ford offers a vivid portrait of rationalization, the division of labor under which "work itself becomes an endless monotony; there is no call at all made upon the special craftsman's intellect that is in all the human race" (<i>SL</i>, 87). His account echoes Marx's description of industrial manufacture, in which "the individual himself is divided up, and transformed into the automatic motor of a detail operation."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup> </p>

<p>The examples Ford gives of denatured labor continue the theme of fragmentation, the irreconcilability of part and whole. In a parodic image of totality that precisely echoes Weber, Ford describes how the signalman "spends dreadfully long hours, high up in a sort of cage of wood and glass, above the innumerable lines of shimmering rails just outside the dim cave of a London terminus. He works himself dog-tired, pulling levers that are constantly bright with the friction of his hands" (<i>SL</i>, 85). This ironic sketch of a technician dominated by technology is juxtaposed with an account of the signalman's leisure hours, devoted to the construction of architectural models: "His ambition is to make a model of every cathedral in the country" (<i>SL</i>, 86). Ford astutely links the rise of specialized leisure activities to the rationalization of labor, but there is also an implicit connection between the division of labor and the sense of alienation from the whole. Like Ford's other example—a cashier who aspires to "cover, on his bicycle, every road of the United Kingdom"—the signalman's hobby is a displaced image of totality, a surrogate for social coherence (<i>SL</i>, 86). Reduced to an "automatic motor" during work hours, the signalman constructs a replica of a knowable, completable England in his spare time. Ford's intuition that the division of labor itself produces the characteristic modern sense of fragmentation brings <i>The Soul of London</i> into line with the tradition of humanist Marxist critique exemplified by Georg Lukács—as Lukács writes in <i>History and Class Consciousness</i>, "[t]he specialisation of skills leads to the destruction of every image of the whole."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup> </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
Mr. Apollo 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Immediately after publishing his trilogy on English culture and society, and doubtless with the vexatious quest for an "image of the whole" fresh in his mind, Ford turned his hand to a genre less strictly indentured to reality: the supernatural romance. Probably influenced by H. G. Wells's <i>The Wonderful Visit</i>  and <i>The Sea Lady</i> , <i>Mr. Apollo</i> relates the variously comic and tragic contretemps that arise when a classical deity descends on twentieth-century London. What makes <i>Mr. Apollo</i> significant vis-à-vis Ford's social criticism, however, is the fact that Apollo's quest for total understanding of the city is more or less the same task that Ford himself had attempted in <i>The Soul of London</i>. Critics have tended to evacuate any serious ambition from this novel, seeing it 

<b></b>

as a Wellsian pastiche entirely separate from Ford's achievements in the prestigious fields of narrative experimentation and social realism. Ford's Edwardian apprentice works are, as Samuel Hynes defensively puts it, "clearly romances, and tend to be wildly mis-valued if read as serious novels."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Seen in the light of Ford's social criticism, however, it is clear that <i>Mr. Apollo</i> is rooted in his intellectual encounter with the contemporary city, and constitutes a "serious" consideration of the problems involved in social observation. Apollo's uncanny sangfroid and lofty infallibility, no less than his patrician bearing, prere later Fordian know-it-alls like Mr. Fleight and, above all, Christopher Tietjens, and it is tempting to suppose that the novel grew out of a thought experiment similar to the one Ford would later attempt with the Tietjens tetralogy, <i>Parade's End</i> (1924–1928). The device of those novels, he recalled in 1931, was to imaginatively refract the chaos of the First World War through the supposedly hyper-lucid consciousness of his late friend Arthur Marwood.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Similarly, <i>Mr. Apollo</i> imagines an observer of London whose supernatural gifts enable him, theoretically, to surmount the difficulties that Ford had encountered in his own survey of the "illimitable" city.  </p>

<p>The city of <i>Mr. Apollo</i> is the teeming, impersonal metropolis of <i>The Soul of London</i>, its bewildering complexity embodied in an endlessly circulating population: "The street . . . was so crowded with motor omnibuses that any aspect of it at all was impossible. . . . the crowd, gentle, jostling, silent, prevented the possibility of any glances at the shop-fronts on the near side."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  In <i>The Soul of London</i> Ford identifies "enormously increased size" and "change in our habits of locomotion" as signs of the times, and these factors epitomize unknowable London in <i>Mr. Apollo</i> (<i>SL</i>, 15). Mr. Todd, a conniving muscular Christian who appoints himself cicerone on Apollo's London visit, attempts to chasten the deity's will-to-know by enumerating an "array of ideas of quantity—of infinite and incomputable quantities": "He was intent on showing how never-ending this crowd was" (<i>A</i>, 38). And this innumerable crowd is constantly on the move: "the motor buses, the horse buses, the horse cabs, and the motor cabs carried people above ground; below ground a convenient tube carried them still more swiftly" (<i>A</i>, 38). This sketch of a seething metropolis is intended to intimidate Apollo, rebuking the naivety of his quest for knowledge of the city as a whole. </p>

<p>To Todd, Apollo's wish to understand the "aspirations" of London's every inhabitant signifies an "impracticable point of view" (<i>A</i>, 36, 38). In imagining this meeting between a humbug East End missionary and a divine visitor, Ford engages with the lively late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century interest in understanding the urban poor, an interest which culminated in the Poor Law Commission of 1905.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Books like <i>From the Abyss</i> by the Liberal M. P. (and friend of Ford's) C. F. G. Masterman emphasized the staggering ignorance that prevailed about the majority of London's inhabitants, its working-class masses. As its title implies, this tract exploited the sensational image of a heretofore mute and invisible underclass, "the creeping into conscious existence of the quaint and innumerable populations bred in the Abyss."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  In the context of the drive to collect information about this other London, Apollo appears as a heavenly social researcher, a superhuman urban observer who combines Ford's incompatible traits of "impressionability" and "impersonality," transcending the opposition between lived 

<b></b>

experience and reflective knowledge. As he explains, "a god, though by his nature he is omniscient, yet he must have in him the capacity for experience. All knowledge is contained in him, yet the vicissitudes of fate and of mortality are, for him, as for you, inexhaustible" (<i>A</i>, 118). Apollo's advantage over mortal observers is his extra-temporal being: released from bondage to time, his serial impressions form a timeless whole. Particularity and abstraction are reconciled. "Time has no existence for me" (<i>A</i>, 31), he declares, gliding placidly from one encounter to the next, ruled, as he says, by "caprice" (<i>A</i>, 188). "I am here to experience certain things; these I can experience when and how I will" (<i>A</i>, 189). <i>Mr. Apollo</i> encodes the basic problem of <i>The Soul of London</i> as a mystery of faith, the impossible union of omniscience and the stream of impressions.  </p>

<p>The supernatural romance theme of Apollo's visit intersects with a layer of gritty naturalism in the portrayal of Alfred and Frances Milne, socialist intellectuals eking out a penurious existence on a teacher's salary and odd bits of jobbing journalism. The exigent budget and squalid digs which delimit the Milnes' lives are reminiscent of the Basts in <i>Howards End</i>; they are Ford's attempt to recover a life of quiet desperation conducted on the edge of the abyss. This is literally the case for the Milnes, whose decrepit block of flats is situated opposite "the gaping vault" of a working-class tenement, represented as a dank citadel of cockney depravity (<i>A</i>, 206). As a young man Ford had been admonished by the anarchist Peter Kropotkin to write about "simple and ordinary people," an injunction he found compelling but hard to execute. "My subsequent difficulties have been technical. I always want to write about ordinary people. But it seems to be almost impossible to decide who are ordinary people—and then to meet them. All men's lives and characteristics are so similar."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Alfred Milne appears to be an attempt to take Kropotkin's advice. Although as an ex-public schoolboy Milne is not statistically ordinary, his life nonetheless stands for the "innumerable," his destiny shaped by prosaic and impersonal forces.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  The trope Ford uses to specify Milne's ordinariness is <i>attrition</i>: unlike Apollo, Alfred Milne is emphatically time-bound, defined by gradual decay.  </p>

<p class="continued">The mechanism of this diminution is the city itself. Milne's idealism is worn away by sheer numerical vastness, his passion for teaching eroded by "the unnumbered bands of noise-makers that so perpetually dulled the edges of his life" (<i>A</i>, 76). Alfred Milne's attritive destiny illustrates the anonymity of the modern city, "that oblivion," as Ford writes in <i>The Soul of London</i>, "that 'being no more seen,' that is, in matters human, the note of London" (<i>SL</i>, 11). Ford offers a foil to this incremental naturalism in the Ruritanian romance novels read by the young writer Arthur Bracondale, "in which motor-cars, exiled princes, revolutions in German Grand Duchies and Bosnian Palace conspiracies played the chief part" (<i>A</i>, 263).

Milne's story details a "microscopic destiny," shaped by the sustained pressure of an "unseen process" rather than climactic events.  </p>

<p>Apollo embodies Ford's credo of "<i>Nihil humanum a me alienum puto</i>," showing an impartial interest in every aspect of modern London. To Alfred Milne's horror, this indifferentism extends even to debased popular culture: Apollo's blithe tolerance of Lord Aldington's <i>Daily Outlook</i>—a cipher for Lord Northcliffe's <i>Daily Mail</i>—compels Milne to renounce his friendship. In <i>The Soul of London</i> Ford advocates just such a liberal attitude to the modern city, made possible by an imaginative projection into the future anterior: "[w]e see terra-cotta ornamental excrescences, meaning nothing to us . . . . But to our great grandchildren these excrescences will have meanings and associations" (<i>SL</i>, 171). Apollo's resemblance to this detached and universally interested artist is nowhere more apparent than his rapt contemplation of blinking electric logos on the London skyline:  </p>

<p class="continued">Endowing garish modern consumerism with antique gravitas, Apollo exemplifies Ford's ideal artist, refusing the conventional dichotomy of tradition and vulgarity, according equal dignity to every impression of modernity.  </p>

<p>Apollo is not an uncritical portrayal of the ideal social observer, however. Just as <i>The Soul of London</i> betrays a certain unease about the sociological project of seeing steadily and whole, <i>Mr. Apollo</i> probes the limitations of an ideally impersonal perspective: the corollary of Apollo's universal interest is a psychopathic lack of compassion. This trait is most marked in Apollo's implacable punishment of the odious Mr. Todd, whom he turns into a tree without a thought for the feelings of his beleaguered wife. When the hapless Todd is eventually restored to human form, it is in a state of twitching catatonia. After having first introduced Todd as a re of fun, Ford shifts the emphasis at this point to the suffering of his family, foregrounding the human cost of Apollo's imperturbable blandness. As Arthur Bracondale realizes, godlike omniscience is alien to human sympathy: "it astonishes me that you haven't enough knowledge of human nature to see it. You know so much" (<i>A</i>, 274). Apollo may have the sociological trait of universal curiosity, but his inability to sympathize with individuals makes him a monster. His mild and meandering course through London leaves an escalating series of atrocities in its wake, beginning with the death of a policeman who looks too closely at his face, and culminating in the summary mass murder of a whole working-class community, killed when Apollo razes their slum housing to the ground: "And indeed, faint and from far below, there came the shrilling of screams and of many voices" (<i>A</i>, 307). These moments of casual violence and horror vividly express Ford's doubts about the project of totality. Apollo's divine capacity to take an interest in everything seems to entail a certain anaesthesia, an inability to feel pity.

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>Both the naturalistic and the romance strains of <i>Mr. Apollo</i> are concerned with London's "illimitable" nature. The re of Alfred Milne expresses Ford's sense of the alienating impersonality of the modern city, comprising innumerable such "microscopic destin[ies]" shaped by intractable economic forces. As he writes in <i>The Soul of London</i>, the Londoner soon learns that "there are so very many others of as little import in the scale of things as the catapult seller, the green fields,—and as himself" (<i>SL</i>, 6). The sheer ordinariness of Milne's predicament, and Ford's interest in urban life as a process of attrition rather than heroic action, foregrounds the oppressiveness of London's vastness for early twentieth-century observers. Apollo fulfills a utopian wish to master this complexity without reducing it, taking an interest in each individual. His monstrous indifference to human feelings, however, suggests that such a project may presuppose an amputation of compassion. This pessimistic strain in Ford's thinking about totality marks an important difference from the discourse of the London Sociological Society; whereas Hobhouse confidently proclaimed the goal of interest in all things human, Ford's sense of human finitude makes his account more tentative. Cataloguing the whole city would require superhuman callousness as well as superhuman intelligence; for those who, like Milne, possess a social conscience, London's vastness is crushing.  </p>

<p class="continued">Modern citizens perforce adopt a "negative type of social conduct."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Durkheim also commented on this salient feature of modern cities, reasoning that "[c]ollective curiosity is keener as personal relations between individuals are more continuous and more frequent.

In the city, "the great source of attention, that of interest, is more or less completely wanting."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Durkheim's discussion of this negative conduct in terms of curiosity is especially pertinent to <i>The Soul of London</i>, which laments this lack of interest and attention even as it reiterates Simmel's health warning: </p>

<p class="continued">Prering the concerns of <i>Mr. Apollo</i>, Ford regrets the passing of the personal <i>polis</i>, contrasting the ideal of the Athenian "<i>agora</i>"—"the best of social units"—with the "mass of Corporations" that the city has become (<i>SL</i>, 149).  </p>

<p>Drawing on the work of the affect theorist Silvan Tomkins, I want to consider Ford's keyword of <i>interest</i> as itself an affect, an innate response to novelty that motivates human behavior: the inclination to seek out excitement, Tomkins argues, is a primary human motive.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Tomkins proposes "interest-excitement" as a fundamental condition of being in the world, a sort of phenomenological glue that allows a series of impressions to be integrated into a cognitive whole.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  This affect of interest is crucial to Ford's idea of community. London inhibits the ability to perceive particularity, suppressing interpersonal interest—"[i]t blunts, by its vastness, their peculiarities, and our interest it dulls"—but for those alive to "the present of our times" it affords "the solace of unceasing mortals to be interested in" (<i>SL</i>, 148, 175). Interest was also the touchstone of Ford's method of composition in the <i>England and the English</i> trilogy, which was structured, we have seen, not by a rigid system but by attention to "only such things as interested him" (<i>SP</i>, xiv). Similarly, Ford's aesthetic objective was to awaken "a Londoner here or there to an interest in the human aspects of his London"; a work of art must, "before all things, be interesting" (<i>SL</i>, xv–xvi).  </p>

<p>Merely being interested in others seems at best a rather folksy take on social renewal, at worst a retreat into precapitalist nostalgia. I want to suggest, however, that Ford's attention to this platitude of urban existence constituted a critique of sociological thinking, a kind of self-reflexive sociology. As Tomkins notes, Western science has tended to ignore the role of affect in scientific discovery, isolating cognitive achievements from their affective context, whereas learning, in his view, is underpinned by affect: "[t]here is a real question whether anyone may fully grasp the nature of any object when that object has not been perceived, wished for, missed, and thought about in love and in hate, in excitement and in apathy, in distress and in joy."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Ford's impressionistic sociology redresses this erasure of affect, reinstating, among other things, the place of embodied experience in social observation. Ford situates Hobhouse's dictum of "Nothing human is foreign" in the most inimical context available: the modern city, where any expansion of interest, according to Simmel, exposes one to psychic harm. Even if the "awakened sense of observation" can be kept up, Ford writes, this alertness is a "curse." Ford's preoccupation with forms of apathy and habituation, on the one hand, and with interest as the basis of community, on the other, subjects the potentially unbounded scope of sociological inquiry to a searching practical interrogation. How can one get to know the city—let alone society itself—if urban survival requires apathy, aloofness, and forgetting? </p>

<p>Habituation blocks the perception of London as a whole. Like Walter Benjamin, who noted that "technology has subjected the human sensorium to a complex kind of training," Ford saw the city as a matrix of technical competence, inscribed unconsciously on the urban body:<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<p class="continued">Not only the crowds, but also the technological complexity of the city—its modern "habits of locomotion"—reduce the capacity for sustained interest, minimizing "personal contacts." Ford's phenomenology of urban life shows itself alert to the embodied experience of the city, describing how its rhythms are assimilated to the citizen's "bodily functions." This analysis points out a fundamental obstacle to seeing London at once steadily and whole: the need for its citizens to learn automatic programs, a process which stymies Ford's ideal of an "awakened sense of observation."  </p>

<p><i>The Soul of London</i> is a self-reflexive record of social inquiry, registering the problem of sustaining interest in the city, as well as the pathos that awakened interest can produce. In terms of Ford's avowed aesthetic, impressionism, this means that the impressionist social observer refuses to separate visual impressions from emotional ones, situating the attempt to see London whole in its affective context.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  This blurring of the boundary between mind and body seems endemic to formulations of impressionism as far back as the empirical philosophy of David Hume, a notorious conflater of feeling and thinking: <i>A Treatise of Human Nature</i> (1739–40) distinguished impressions from ideas by "degrees of force and liveliness" rather than kind, a distinction which has, as Stephen Everson observes, "proved recalcitrant to analysis and elucidation—and has as a result seemed to many to be both false and carelessly executed."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Like Tomkins, Hume acknowledges the role of feelings in intellectual endeavor, famously subordinating "reason" to "passion," and noting of his own work that "I <i>feel</i> I shou'd be a loser in point of pleasure; and this is the origin of my philosophy." Reasoning itself is "nothing but a species of sensation," and "the imagination and affections have close union together": "no object," Hume argued, "is presented to the senses, nor image form'd in the fancy, but what is accompany'd with some emotion or movement of spirits proportion'd to it."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> </p>

<p>Ford's London impressions are of this impure kind, seen and felt simultaneously. "London is before all things an incomparable background," its images taking on "a sudden consonance with [the Londoner's] mood, of overwhelming and hardly comprehensible joy, of overwhelming and hardly comprehensible pain" (<i>SL</i>, 27). The remembered "cloud of little experiences, of little personal impressions" is organized emotionally, imbued by "moments of stress and anguish" with "significances so tremendous and meanings so poignant" (<i>SL</i>, 175). The book itself is designed to reintroduce affect to the public sphere, to transmit "pleasure, or that counterpart of pleasure which is pain," along with its images (<i>SL</i>, xv–xvi). The most powerful stimulus of urban pathos, however, is the sense of fragmentation itself, the inability to see London whole. (Sara

Haslam has inferred the pertinent Fordian doctrine here, in the course of a penetrating reappraisal of <i>The Good Soldier</i>: "[i]n order to really know one's fictional—and actual—surroundings, one must be made to suffer by them."<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup> ) </p>

<p>Once again, "habits of locomotion" re prominently as triggers of urban pathos: the glimpse of a steam crane from the roof of an electric tram inspires sadness by its very incoherence: "Then the outlines grew tremulous, it all vanished with a touch of that pathos like a hunger that attaches to all things of which we see the beginnings or the middle courses without knowing the ends" (<i>SL</i>, 40). Similarly, a train journey is a rich source of unfinished narratives:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I looked down upon black and tiny yards that were like the cells in an electric battery. In one, three children were waving their hands and turning up white faces to the train; in the next, white clothes were drying. A little further on a woman ran suddenly out of a door; she had a white apron and her sleeves were tucked up. A man followed her hastily, he had red hair, and in his hand a long stick. We moved on, and I have not the least idea whether he were going to thrash her, or whether together they were going to beat a carpet. . . . Incidents even so definite as these are more or less the exception, but the constant succession of much smaller happenings that one sees, and that one never sees completed, gives to looking out of train windows a touch of pathos and dissatisfaction. It is akin to the sentiment ingrained in humanity of liking a story to have an end.</p>

<p class="continued">"It arises," Ford adds, "out of the innate <i>altruism</i> that there is in us all, or out of the universal desire 'to know'" (<i>SL</i>, 62; my emphasis). Nick Freeman notes that this scene marks a "change in sensibility from the comforting certainties of many other London writers," prompting open-ended reflection rather than determinate conclusions.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  The important corollary of this open-endednesss for my purposes is the "touch of pathos"; it is this trace of affect that most strikingly differentiates Ford from the sociologists. The impressionist visual specificity of this passage—the tucked up sleeves, the red hair—encodes the overwhelming contingent detail of city life. This is Roland Barthes's "reality effect": undetermined narrative flotsam, irresolvable into the symmetry of plot. Ford uses this resource of his impressionism not only to assert the primacy of qualitative experience—as Fredric Jameson has argued of Conrad's impressionist aesthetic—but also to affirm the primacy of pathos, the affective level of social perception.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  Ford's narrative altruism—"liking a story to have an end"—is trained on individuals, unlike the <i>cognitive</i> altruism of the sociologists which depends on abstraction, on the <i>idea</i> of society as an organic whole. As an awakened <i>interest</i> in people, moreover, it gestures towards an altruism founded on affect, rather than reason. Much of the impressionist pathos of <i>The Soul of London</i> derives from the thwarting of this affect of interest, the alienating power of the London crowd to "chill out of us the spirit of altruism itself." Correspondingly, Mr. Apollo's detached curiosity seems to be an attempt to think through this problem: to sustain interest in the London crowd, one would have to be emotionally numb.  </p>

<p><i>Sociological</i> and <i>modernist</i> are traditionally taken, in literary criticism, to be mutually exclusive categories, the one connoting a crude materialism and formal timidity, the 

<b></b>

other a commitment to interiority for its own sake and a will to experiment; sociological is to modernist as "Edwardian" is to "Georgian."<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  This casual usage of the term "sociological" obscures the profound affinity between literature and sociology, not only by occluding the "sociological" content of modernist writing and deflating the literary value of "sociological" novels, but also by misrepresenting the nature of sociology itself, particularly in its infancy. Edwardian sociology was driven by the same sense of fragmentation as early modernist writing, and its conception of its own mission was as exalted as any high modernist manifesto: after all, what was cognitive altruism if not an attempt to forge the uncreated conscience of a race? Raymond Williams was not quite right to claim that by the turn of the century a writer "must choose and in the act of choice declare himself poet or sociologist."<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  H. G. Wells, for one, strove to persuade the London Sociological Society that sociology could not do without literature (and not, as his modernist critics would have it, the other way round).<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  Ford's engagement with sociological themes in an impressionist register, along with his polemical self-description as an "exact scientist," bear witness to this territorial dispute between literature and sociology. And like sociology, Ford's impressionistic social criticism admitted all manner of social data—everything human—to its scope. Nonetheless, it will not do to assimilate early sociology and early modernism. While both were imprinted with the Victorian longing for wholeness, for which Arnold's words functioned as a shorthand, the response of an Edwardian man of letters such as Ford differed markedly from that of an Edwardian scientist like J. A. Hobson. Attentiveness to affect is one way of locating the axis between these two responses. What the sociologists sought in cognitive altruism, Ford imagined as the novelist's interest in other human beings, "the sentiment ingrained in humanity of liking a story to have an end." Necessarily thwarted by the scale and complexity of industrial society, this interest in everything human is manifest negatively in <i>The Soul of London</i> as pathos, the bruise of altruism rebuffed. This perception of the relationship between community, narrative, and affect, achieved while the Edwardian garden party was in full swing, pointed Ford, perhaps, towards the final masterpiece of his prewar career, <i>The Good Soldier</i> —a precocious postmortem of Edwardian society, an inconclusive narrative, and, of course, the saddest story.  </p>

<p id="lead">Anton Giulio Bragaglia (1890–1960) was a key re in early Italian cinema and in theater of the 1920s. From 1906 on he was a director's assistant at Cines, a film production house run by his father. In December 1911 he published <i>Futurist Photodynamism</i> (<i>Fotodinamismo futurista</i>; Rome: Nalato, 1911), an attempt to formulate a Futurist theory of photography, drawing on the chronophotography of the French photographer Jules-Etienne Marey. Perhaps because of concern that Bragaglia's photographs were undermining the status of Futurist painting, he was formally expelled from the Futurist ranks on 1 October 1913. Despite this, he seems to have maintained a cordial personal rapport with various Futurists, especially the Futurist painter Giacomo Balla, who also resided in Rome. In 1918 Bragaglia opened a gallery, Casa d'arte Bragaglia (The Bragaglia House of Art), which lasted until 1933 and sponsored 275 exhibitions by artists such as the Futurist sculptor and painter Umberto Boccioni, De Chirico, Gerardo Dottori, the Futurist and dadaist groups, Gustav Klimt, Vinicio Paladini, Ivo Pannaggi, and Enrico Prampolini. In 1922 he enlarged it to include a theater and club, with rooms decorated by the Futurist artists Giacomo Balla, Fortunato Depero, and Enrico Prampolini. The theater, which became the most innovative theatrical venue of the period in Italy, staged works by Luigi Pirandello, Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Schnitzler, Guillaume Apollinaire, and Ardengo Soffici, as well as Futurist syntheses (extremely brief dramatic works, often lasting only a few minutes) by Emilio Settimelli, Bruno Corra, and F. T. Marinetti. Bragaglia also wrote books on theater, dance, film, and archaeology, and was an active journalist, critic, and reviewer.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Bragaglia's major theoretical achievement was undoubtedly his <i>Futurist Photodynamism</i>. It consisted of a forty-seven page essay, accompanied by sixteen plates, that was divided into fifty-five numbered sections. A second edition was published on 30 June 1913. It was enlarged by six additional sections, so making sixty-one in total, and eighteen smaller expansions of the text, typically a single sentence in length. A few months later a third edition was published, unaltered from the second. (The third edition was later reprinted: see Anton Giulio Bragaglia, <i>Fotodinamismo futurista</i> [Turin: G. Einaudi, 1970]). The text presented here is taken from the third edition, the most widely accessible; however, in the eight instances where that edition transmits material added in the second edition (and so not contained in the first edition of 1911), these are registered in a list of variants indicated in the text proper by an alphabetical superscript. The following translation presents twenty-two sections of the book in their entirety, specifically sections 1, 4–8, and 16–31, all indicated by section numbers. The only previous translation of this work, by Caroline Tisdall (found in Umbro Apollonio, ed., <i>Futurist Manifestos</i> [New York: Viking, 1973], 38–45) consisted of isolated paragraphs taken from sections 18 and 28, together with eleven sections given in their entirety (19–26 and 29–31), though with no indication of their enumeration. </p>

<p>The translation that follows was originally prepared for inclusion in <i>Futurism: A Reader and Visual Repertoire</i>, edited by Lawrence Rainey, Christine Poggi, and Laura Wittman, and scheduled for publication later this year with Yale University Press. Under U.S. law, <i>Photodynamism</i> is currently out of copyright; under European Union law, it will remain in copyright till 2030. To conform with EU law, the translation was withdrawn from <i>Futurism: A Reader</i>. It is printed here as an example of the heady mixture of philosophical and quasi-mystical formulations that circulated in Futurism's early years. </p>

<p><i>Futurist Photodynamism</i> </p>

<p>Anton Giulio Bragaglia </p>

<p>December 1911 </p>

<p>At the outset, it is important to distinguish between dynamism and dynamism. </p>

<p>There is the realistic, effective dynamism of objects unfolding with real motion—which, for the sake of precision, should be called <i>movementism</i>—and there is the virtual dynamism of immobile objects, which is of interest to Futurist Painting. </p>

<p>What interests me is movementism, which indeed might legitimately be termed Photo-movement-istics or Photocinematics were it not for my intention to insist on the inner dynamics of Photodynamism. </p>

<p>The concept of Photodynamism was inspired by the "Technical Manifesto of the Futurist Painters."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  </p>

<p>We want to achieve a revolution in photography, through progress: in order to purify, ennoble, and truly elevate photography to an art, for I am convinced that we 

<b></b>

can achieve art with the mechanical means of photography only if we overcome the pedestrian photographic reproduction of the real as something static or caught in a pose in a snapshot. In so doing, the resulting photograph, achieved by experimental and other means, would succeed in registering the expression and the vibration of actual life, and in distancing itself from obscene, brutal, and static realism, and it would no longer be the usual photography, but something much more elevated, which we have called Photodynamics. </p>

<p>We want to create the art of Photodynamism, then—an art unique and distinctive in its aims—and, along with that, we want to give the painting and sculpture of movement the firm foundations which are absolutely necessary today, foundations that we will demonstrate scientifically in what follows.<sup><a name="REFa" href="#FOOTa">a</a></sup> </p>

<p>The results we have obtained up to now have shown that Photodynamism is not only the right creation, but the necessary one. </p>

<p>That many of these results are still imperfect or insufficiently persuasive should be attributed to the lack of technical means sufficiently adapted to capture and render living beings and things in movement. </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">

</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>We consider life to be pure movement. </p>

<p>We love and we observe reality in its fatal and vital motion. </p>

<p>We want to render, graphically, the <i>perpetual motion</i> in the perpetuity of a gesture which has been captured. </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
5 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Thus, we are pleased that we can render life in its unique, logical expression, and reality in its deepest and less realistic aspect, which is to say, so completely purifying the operation of the camera which is directed and dominated <i>by us</i> that it can register what is in <i>our</i> sensibility, violating the power of the objective thing to the point where we can even make the camera perceive its transcendental dimension, to the extent permitted by its mechanical photographic nature. </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
6 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Whence the impossibility of maintaining the traditional appearance of things: which, of course, leaves us deeply happy. </p>

<p>Thus motion, which has to be kept pure, requires the destruction of the initial appearance of static objects; and photography, enhanced to become Photodynamism, will purge itself of the memory of those appearances and enrich itself with the speeds of rhythms, which will be the foundation of the nobility and the avant-garde status of its enhancement.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Only those who have remained behind with an older conception of art will foolishly ask us for a more salient connection between our works and the real forms of static objects, regretting precisely what we find most appealing; and they will rest discontent before the infinite treasury of delight contained in the pure life of movement and the superb deformation which it wreaks on objects. </p>

<p>But such people wouldn't even know how to enjoy the solid, compacted, grounded, and imposing corporeality of an object, seen through its given cubature. </p>

<p>Nor would they be attracted by the solid stability of volume; they prefer seduction by the most obscene and stupid copy of what is apparent. </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
7 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>But we are no longer concerned with inner or outer reality or its volume as much as with <i>the spirit of living reality</i>, with signifying the deep tendency of its movement and expressing the molecular passion of its change of location. </p>

<p>We want, in short, to record reality unrealistically.<sup><a name="REFb" href="#FOOTb">b</a></sup> </p>

<p>We want to render what is not seen on the surface: we want to register the living sensation of a particular reality's deep expression, and we are seeking its sensation of movement because that is rich with magnificent, hidden depths and multiple emotive sources that render it unspeakable and ungraspable. </p>

<p>Thus we want to voice and grasp those transcendental qualities of the real as it changes its location and in turn changes the surrounding atmosphere, since we are striving to register the environment in its total volume, as perturbed or convulsed by the revolution which results from a body's moving within it: the environment that we know and perceive more intensely in the action of movement than in the tranquility of stasis, the environment which we have already materialized in many works with such force that even passéist artists such as Bistolfi and Biondi have spontaneously felt it when visiting our exhibition.<sup><a name="REFc" href="#FOOTc">c</a></sup> <sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">

<p>For photography it has never been possible to render even the <i>concept</i>, the <i>general idea</i> of motion. </p>

<p>In a completely absurd and insane act, the snapshot has arrested motion in absurd positions which were merely transitional states. </p>

<p>Only art has known how to synthesize the two chief times in the transition from one <i>state</i> to another, and at least that way it has rendered the <i>general idea</i>, the <i>concept</i> of the action—though not the movement, it should be noted, because even with this ingenious method the res <i>do not move</i>. </p>

<p>The <i>complete concept</i> of motion, then, has been rendered; but today, in the bustling life of modernity, can we rest content with a representation of the bare concept? </p>

<p>Our needs have been multiplied by the growing rapidity of life.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>We don't have time to stand around in front of a <i>concept</i> and wait till it becomes suggestive! </p>

<p>We feel a vivid need to be assaulted, at one blow, by the emotion which is contemporary with our first sight of something. And for that reason we need to achieve immediately the perfect evocation of the complete emotion. And since that is born from the <i>total</i> evolution of an action, it cannot be re-experienced except by evoking that <i>total</i> evolution. </p>

<p>The static synthesis of two static states, even when they are the principal states, does not suffice. What is needed is a synthesis, but it must be a dynamic synthesis of complex evolution and not a synthesis of two rigid static states within a transition that <i>can't be seen</i>. </p>

<p>With Photodynamism we have obtained this synthesis of dynamic evolution and have liberated photography from the obscenity of brutal realism and the mania of the snapshot, which once seemed to be right only because a mechanical result was confused with a scientific fact. We have freed photography from its two most colossal defects: because these negated any scientific value to photographic outcomes—at least in the case of the snapshot's bestial error—and any value of art by virtue of the sheer ugliness of copying the real. </p>

<p>So we have purified photography, transforming and recreating it while also elevating it. Photography, until now, even when it wanted to appear as an art form, has always been merely a trade that was exercised in a little studio located alongside the sausage-maker's shop. </p>

<p>For that reason, with the exception of some rare hints or repressed attempts, photography has been devoid of originality and has become ever more a trade, especially when—in this instance following the corruption of the public while aspiring to be Art—it unconsciously drowned in the imitation of paintings by artists such as Rembrandt, for example, executing portraits still more rigid than those. </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
16 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>To record movement—its shape—it is at least necessary to reproduce a theory of the static states which constitute it. </p>

<p>Yet this theory will evoke the dynamic sensation, which is the unique essence of a motion in rapport with our character as spectators, only when it has been coordinated, unified, and <i>deeply merged</i> and synthesized with the <i>trajectory</i> of the action.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  </p>

<p>If we reproduce <i>only the trajectory</i> of a movement, then our sensation of it will be still fuller and easier. </p>

<p>Then we will have completely achieved our artistic goal, since a gesture for us is a pure dynamic sensation which, in turn, is nothing other than the effect produced on our sensibility by its trajectory, and hence we can re-experience the dynamic sensation of the gesture and achieve our goal. </p>

<p>In my <i>Portrait</i> and <i>Guitar</i>, and in many others works, such as <i>The Carpenter</i>, there are exemplary elements of such a synthesis.

<h1 class="sec-headA">

<p>We have, indeed, come quite a long way in our conception of Photodynamism: we no longer mechanically reproduce, as it were, the hundred arms that have gone into a gesture, but we try to render their <b>dynamic result</b>, or their trajectory: a synthesis of the entire gesture and a rendering of the moment in which that gesture lived for us, fully <i>present</i> in its final state, and progressively <i>more remote</i> in its earliest or most distant expressions. </p>

<p>Such a method firmly answers the objection that was raised in the wake of our first attempts, for it is no longer sufficient just to decompose a gesture, but instead a reconstruction of it is now deemed necessary, reconstruction through an effective record of its dynamic effect. </p>

<p>Here, however, it is worthwhile to note that some critics continue to affirm that cinematography and chronophotography have already captured the effect that we are seeking.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>But that claim is another example of complete stupidity.<sup><a name="REFd" href="#FOOTd">d</a></sup> </p>

<p>First and foremost, Photodynamism must be understood not as an innovation applicable to photography in the way that chronophotography was, but as a creation that aims to achieve ideals that are in opposition to the objectives of <b>all</b> the representational means of today. If it can be associated at all with photography, cinematography, and chronophotography, it is only insofar as they all have origins in the wide field of photographic science, the technical means forming a common ground. All are based on the physical properties of the <i>camera</i>. </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">

</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>We, certainly, are not concerned with the aims and characteristics of cinematography and chronophotography. We are concerned not with the precise reconstruction of a movement, which has already been broken up and analyzed, but only with that element of a movement which produces sensation, the memory of which still palpitates in our consciousness. </p>

<p>We despise the precise, mechanical, icy reproduction of reality, avoiding it at all costs, because for our purposes it is a harmful and negative element, whereas for cinematography and chronophotography it is the very essence. They in turn overlook the trajectory, which for us is the most essential value. </p>

<p>The question of cinematography in relation to us is absolutely idiotic, and can only be raised by a superficial and imbecilic mind in utter ignorance of the matter.<sup><a name="REFe" href="#FOOTe">e</a></sup> </p>

<p>Cinematography does not register the shape of movement, but subdivides it, without rules, with mechanical arbitrariness, disintegrating and shattering it without any kind of aesthetic concern for rhythm: its coldly mechanical power is incapable of addressing such concerns. </p>

<p>Further, cinematography never analyzes movement, but shatters it in the frames of the film strip, quite unlike the action of Photodynamism, which analyzes movement precisely in its details. And cinematography never synthesizes movement, since it merely reconstructs the fragments of a movement's reality that have already been coldly broken up, in much the same way as the hand of a chronometer breaks up time, while time itself flows in a continuous and constant stream.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Photography, too, is quite distinct from Photodynamism. It is useful in the perfect anatomical reproduction of reality; necessary and precious therefore for aims that are absolutely contrary to ours, for ours are artistic <i>in themselves</i>, or rather are scientific in their researches but nevertheless always directed towards art.<sup><a name="REFf" href="#FOOTf">f</a></sup>

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>In sum, both photography and Photodynamism possess their own distinctive qualities, clearly separate, and are very different in the importance, the usefulness, and the nature of their aims. </p>

<p>The chronophotography of Marey has also been a form of cinematography, this time carried out on a single plate or a continuous strip of film, even though it hasn't used frames to divide up the movement.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Instead, the movement has already been marked off into units, much as one does in scanning poetry, and broken up into snapshots. Chronophotography, in short, also shatters the action. The instantaneous images are even further apart, fewer and more autonomous than those of cinematography, so that this too cannot be called analysis. </p>

<p>In actual fact, Marey's system was used in the teaching of gymnastics, for example; and out of the hundred images that might trace a man while jumping, it captures only a few, just enough to describe and to teach students the principal stages of a jump. </p>

<p>That was all very well for the old Marey system, for gymnastics and other such applications; but with five extremely rigid snapshots we cannot obtain even the <i>reconstruction</i> of a movement, let alone its <i>sensation</i>. Given that chronophotography certainly does not reconstruct movement, or give the sensation of it, any further discussion of this subject would be idle; but the point is worth stressing because there are still those who identify Photodynamism with chronophotography, albeit with a certain degree of elegant malice, just as others have wanted to confuse it with cinematography. </p>

<p>Marey's system, then, seizes and freezes the action in its principal stages, those which best serve its purpose. It thus describes a theory that could be equally deduced from a series of snapshots. The images might even be said to depict different subjects, since, if any stage within a movement is removed, no link unites and unifies the various images. They are <i>photographic</i>, <i>contemporaneous</i>, and appear to depict <i>more</i> than one subject. To put it crudely, we could compare chronophotography to a clock whose face was marked only with the quarter-hours, cinematography to one on which the minutes have also been indicated, and Photodynamism to a third on which are marked not only the seconds, but also the tiny <i>inter-momental</i> fractions that exist in the passages between one second and another. This becomes an almost infinitesimal calculation of movement.<sup><a name="REFg" href="#FOOTg">g</a></sup> </p>

<p>In fact it is only through our researches that it is possible to obtain a vision that is proportionate, in terms of the force of the images, to the very tempo of their existence and, what's more, proportionate to the speed with which they have lived in space and in us. </p>

<p>In Photodynamism, the greater an action's speed, the less intense and clear is the image that it leaves. It follows that the slower an action is, the less will its image be dematerialized and distorted. As an image grows more distorted, it becomes less real, and hence more ideal and lyrical, still further abstracted from its own particularities and closer to a <i>type</i>, with the same evolutionary effect of distortion as was followed by the Greeks in their search for their type of beauty.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>There is an obvious difference between chronophotography's tendency to mechanism—as an embryonic and rudimentary form of cinematography—and the tendency of Photodynamism to move away from mechanism and follow its own ideal, one completely opposed to the aims of all that went before it (although we too propose to undertake our own scientific researches into movement). </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">

<p>Photodynamism, then, analyzes movement and synthesizes it at will, and to telling effect since it doesn't have to resort to disintegration in order to observe it, but possesses the power to record the continuity of an action in space. Whence it can trace in a face not only the expression of passing states of mind (for example), as photography and cinematography have never been able to, but also the immediate shifting of volumes discernible in the immediate transformation of expression. </p>

<p>A shout, a tragical pause, a gesture of terror, in the entirety of the scene, in the complete external unfolding of its intimate drama, can now be expressed in one single work. And not just at the points of departure and arrival—or with a few intermediate points thrown in, as in chronophotography—but continuously, from beginning to end, because in this way, as we have already said, the <i>inter-movemental</i> stages of a motion can also be invoked. </p>

<p>In fact, where scientific research into the evolution and shape of movement are concerned, we declare Photodynamism to be exhaustive and indispensable, given that no precise means of analyzing a movement exists, apart from the rudimentary work of chronophotography which we have already discussed. </p>

<p>Just as the study of anatomy has always been essential for an artist—now a knowledge of the paths traced by bodies in action and of their transformation in motion will be indispensable for the painter of movement. </p>

<p>In the composition of a painting, the optical effects observed by the artist are not enough; it also requires a precise analytical knowledge of the essential properties of those effects and their causes. The artist will know how to synthesize such analyses, but within such a synthesis those analyses, like a skeleton, the precise and almost invisible analytical elements which are still realistic, must exist. These can only be rendered visible by the scientific aspects of Photodynamism. </p>

<p>In fact, every vibration is the rhythm of infinite minor vibrations, since every rhythm is built up of an infinite quantity of vibrations. If human consciousness has hitherto been conceived and considered as movement in its <i>general rhythm</i>, it has fabricated, 

<b></b>

so to speak, an algebra of movement. This has been considered as <i>simple</i>, as <b>finite</b> (see Spencer, <i>First Principles</i>, "The Rhythm of Motion").<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  But Photodynamism has revealed and represented it as <b>complex</b>, raising it to the level of an <b>infinitesimal calculation of movement</b> (see our most recent works, e.g. <i>The Carpenter</i>, <i>The Bow</i>, <i>Changing Positions</i>). (. <a href="#2">2</a> and <a href="#3">3</a>) </p>

<p>Indeed, we represent the movement of a pendulum, for example, by relating its speed and its tempo to two orthogonal axes. </p>

<p>We will obtain a continuous and infinite sinusoidal curve. </p>

<p>But this applies to a theoretical pendulum, an immaterial one. The representation we will obtain from a material pendulum will differ from the theoretical one in that, after a longer or shorter (but always <i>finite</i>) period, it will stop. </p>

<p>It should be clear that in both cases the lines representing such movement are continuous, and don't at all portray the reality of the phenomenon. In reality, these lines should be composed of an infinite number of minor vibrations, introduced by the resistance at the point of union, which doesn't move with smooth continuity but in a jerky way caused by infinite coefficients. Now, a <b>synthetic</b> representation is more effective, even when its essence contains an <b>analytically divisionist</b> value, than a synthetic impressionist one (meaning divisionism and impressionism in the philosophical sense). In the same way the representation of realistic movement will be much more effective in a synthesis, even when its essence contains an analytical divisionist value (e.g. <i>The Carpenter</i>, <i>The Bow</i>, etc.), than in analysis of a superficial nature, that is, when it is not minutely interstatic but expresses itself only in <b>successive static states</b> (e.g. <i>The Typist</i>)<i>.</i> (<a href="#4"> 4</a>) </p>

<p>Therefore, just as the scientific work of Rood suggested the essential question of chromatic divisionism (a synthesis of effect and an analysis of means) in the painting of Seurat, so today Photodynamism indicates the need for a divisionism of movement, that is, synthesis of effect and analysis of means in the painting of movement.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  But—and this should be noted—this analysis of means should be infinite, deep, responsive, rather than immediately perceptible. </p>

<p>This point we noted earlier by demonstrating that, just as anatomy is essential in static reproduction, so the anatomy of an action—close analysis—is indispensable in the representation of movement. Such representation will not render thirty images of the same object in order to represent it in motion, but will render it <b>infinitely multiplied</b> and <b>extended</b>, while the re <i>present</i> will appear <b>diminished</b>. </p>

<p>Photodynamism, then, can establish results from positive data in the construction of moving reality, just as photography obtains its own positive results in the sphere of static reality. </p>

<p>Once this essential affinity has been established, not only between artistic conception and representation of reality, but also between artistic conception and application, it is easy to discern the kinds of information and how much information dynamic representation can offer to the artist who is engaged in a profound search for it. </p>

<p>Light and movement in general, light acting upon movement, and hence the movements of light, are revealed in Photodynamism. Given the transcendental nature of the phenomenon of movement, it is only by means of Photodynamism that the painter will be able to know what happens in the inter-movemental states that have been generated, and will become acquainted with <i>the</i> <b>volumes</b> <i>of individual motions</i>. He will be able to analyze these in minute detail, getting to know the <i>increase in aesthetic value of a flying re</i>, or its <i>diminution</i>, relative to light and to the dematerialization consequent upon motion. Only with Photodynamism can the artist acquire the elements necessary for the construction of a work of art which embodies the synthesis he desires. </p>

<p>In this regard the sculptor Roberto Melli wrote to me explaining his view that Photodynamism "must, in the course of these new researches into movement which are beginning to make a lively impression on the artist's consciousness, take the place which has hitherto been occupied by drawing, a physical and mechanical phenomenon very different from the physical transcendentalism of Photodynamism. Photodynamism is to drawing what the new aesthetic currents are to the art of the past."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>For James, movement was "<i>the fact of occupying a series of successive points in space, corresponding with a series of successive moments in time</i>."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  </p>

<p>But James offers no comments on how a point gets to another point during these moments. And such inter-movemental states, consisting of pure trajectory, are the exponent of the passage from one point to another, as well as from one moment to another, since in movement <i>time is being translated into space</i>. </p>

<p>With them, the image which existed most remotely in space will be weaker and more faded than the image which is present, while the present image will be more realistic to the degree that the gesture has been less rapid. </p>

<div class="sec-break">

<p>We will gradually have images that are more pronounced, more conspicuous in capturing the brief moment of the final image within a movement, and in our hands <b>time</b> will become a <b>fourth dimension in space</b>, acquiring notable weight in expressing a gesture's sensation and producing a work that is more chronographic than anything in the Marey system, which was called "chronographic" only because it seized a few rare moments within a gesture, i.e. a few <i>states</i>. </p>

<p>But we must briefly reconsider the Marey system. </p>

<p>If we consider chronophotography as a scientific instrument for the study of movement, it is a failure. Such study demands a minute analysis, which is precisely what chronophotography doesn't offer, since within a single movement it jumps from one point to another quite distant point. It not only fails to register the plainly existing yet ungraspable entities which Photodynamism records, and which we have called the <i>inter-static</i> or <i>inter-movemental</i> or <i>inter-momental</i> states of a gesture, but it doesn't even manage to capture all the essential static states which have gone into the making of a gesture in its material dimension, if we may put it that way. </p>

<p>While Photodynamism <i>rejects the snapshot and the older values of line and color</i>, seeking the <i>newer sensations of rhythm</i>, chronophotography uses the snapshot as an absolute foundation and reinforces the old values of line and color. Photodynamism wants to render the <b>dynamic result</b> of a gesture, i.e. the synthesis of its trajectory, though it can also minutely analyze every shift of a body in motion and register its action in time, and even capture what happens in the intervals, putting together every minute value of a trajectory as well as portraying that dematerialization of a re which our eyes can sense and which our senses therefore enjoy. Chronophotography doesn't analyze images; it is made up of distant snapshots which are brutally realistic; it does not capture more than one twentieth of the multiple movements of a body in motion; and it does not trace its trajectory, which is our artistic goal, for that is the source of its dynamic sensation. Chronophotography also does not render a re's dematerialization, does not portray its rhythm, since it has captured only occasional elements, and cannot render <i>any</i> dynamic <i>emotion</i>, or any true or genuine reconstruction since, it must be repeated, it does not aim at capturing such vital things.

<p>Bergson has written that, "In the living mobility of things, the mind is concerned with registering their real, or virtual locations, or else it takes note of their departures and arrivals. That is all that matters to human thought, to the extent that it is simply human. To grasp what happens in the intervals in between is more than human."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Now, with cinematography and Marey's equivalent system the viewer moves abruptly from one state to another, and thus is limited to the states that compose the movement, without concern for the inter-movemental states of the action; and with photography he sees only one state. But with Photodynamism, which registers what occurred between one stage and another, a work is presented that transcends the human condition, becoming a <i>transcendental photograph of movement</i>. For this end we can also envisage a camera which will render actions visible, more effectively than is now possible, with actions traced from one point, but at the same time keeping them related to the time in which they were made. They will remain idealized by the distortion and by the destruction imposed by motion and light which are translated into trajectories. </p>

<p>When you tell us that the images contained in our Photodynamic works are unsure and difficult to distinguish, you are merely noting a pure characteristic of Photodynamism. For Photodynamism, it is desirable and correct to record images in a distorted state, since images themselves are inevitably transformed in movement. Further, our aim is to make a decisive move away from reality, since cinematography, photography, and chronophotography already exist to deal with mechanically precise and cold reproduction. </p>

<p><i>We are seeking the interior essence of things: pure movement; and we prefer to see everything in motion</i>, for in motion, as things are dematerialized they also become idealized, while still retaining, deep down, a strong skeleton of truth. </p>

<p>This is our first aim, and with it we are attempting to raise photography to the heights to which it is unsuccessfully striving to attain because it lacks the elements essential for such an elevation, constricted by the hierarchical criteria that make it conform to a precise reproduction of reality, and dominated by that ridiculous and brutal negative element, the snapshot, which has been presented as a great scientific strength when in fact it is a laughable absurdity. </p>

<p>But even in the scientific analysis of movement, that is to say in multiplying reality in order to study the deformation it undergoes in motion, we can capture not just one but many values of a gesture. We are repeating this idea, I know, but we insist on it, we will impose it and return to it without hesitation and untiringly, until we can affirm it absolutely with the obsessive demonstration of an external and internal quality which is essential for us. </p>

<p>And it is beyond doubt that such <i>multiplication of entities</i> will enable us to attain a <i>multiplication of values</i>, capable of enriching any fact with a more <i>imposing personality</i>.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>If we repeat an action's principal states, the re of a dancer—moving a foot in mid-air or pirouetting—will, even when not possessing its own trajectory or offering a dynamic sensation, be much more like a dancer, and much more like dancing, than would a single re frozen in just one of the states that build up a movement. </p>

<p><i>The picture therefore can be invaded and pervaded by its subject's essence</i>, can be <i>obsessed by the subject to the extent that it energetically invades and obsesses the viewer</i> with its own values. It will not exist as a passive object which an unconcerned public masters for its own enjoyment. It will be an active thing that imposes its own extremely free essence on the public, though this will not be graspable with the insipid facility common to all images that are too faithful to ordinary reality. </p>

<p>For this study of reality multiplied in its volumes, and for the multiplication of their lyrical sensations, we have devised a method of research that is highly original in its mechanical means, one we have already made known to some of our friends. </p>

<p>More immediately, we are studying the trajectory, a synthesis of action which fascinates our senses, a vertiginous lyrical expression of life which vividly invokes the magnificent dynamic feeling with which the universe incessantly vibrates. </p>

<p>We are striving to extract not only an aesthetic expression of the motifs, but also the inner, sensorial, cerebral, and psychic emotions that we feel when an action leaves its superb, impetuous trace. </p>

<p>This is in order to offer to others the elements essential to re-experiencing the desired feeling. </p>

<p>And it is on our current researches into the <i>interior</i> of an action that all the emotive artistic values existing in Photodynamism are based. </p>

In all these domains, including that of human consciousness, "Rhythm is very generally not simple but compound. There are usually at work various forces, causing undulations differing in rapidity; and hence it continually happens that besides the primary rhythms there are secondary rhythms, produced by the periodic coincidence and antagonism of the primary ones.

<b>Abstract</b>
<p>"My laughter is a concrete wall," says Kafka to Gustav Janouch. In this paper, I claim that laughter offers us a way to appeal to our own bodies as a basis of doubt. I try to substantiate this general proposition by examining Kafka's identification with the story of Sarah laughing uncontrollably at God's promise of a child in Genesis 18. I argue that Kafka finds in the re of Sarah's laughter not only a most poignant precursor to his own skepticism of the body, but also a basis to retell (in the <i>Octavo Notebooks</i>) the story of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac.</p>

I. Kafka's Laughter: Simulated Joy 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>According to Maurice Blanchot, "Kafka's narratives are among the darkest in literature, the most rooted in absolute disaster."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  For the majority of their readers, they are the product of a grim depressive, a literary self-harmer who also managed to cut himself when he "plunged the sharpest Ockham's razor into the substance of the novel."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  As Jean Starobinski writes, "A man stricken with a strange sorrow, so Franz Kafka appears to us. . . .  Here is a man who watches himself being devoured."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Immediately contradicting this popular image of Kafka the grim depressive are the accounts of the Czech writer laughing—at times uncontrollably—when he read his work aloud to his Prague coterie. As Max Brod recounts in his biography of Kafka: "we friends of his laughed quite immoderately when he first let us hear the first chapter of <i>The Trial</i>. And he himself laughed so much that there were moments when he couldn't read any further. Astonishing enough, when you think of the fearful earnestness of this chapter. But that is how it is."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  What are we to make of Kafka and his friends laughing "quite immoderately" at the "fearful earnestness" of his work? For Brod, it points to something too easily and often overlooked by critics: Kafka's joie de vivre. "Certainly it was not entirely good, comfortable laughter," Brod continues. "But the ingredients of a good laugh were also there—alongside the hundred incidents of uncanniness, which I shall not try to minimise. I am only pointing out 

<b></b>

the fact that is otherwise so easily forgotten in studies of Kafka—the streak of joy in the world and in life."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In their influential <i>Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature</i>, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari seek to debunk the once-dominant perception of Kafka as a guilt-ridden, solemn, and despondent modernist. Their playful text seems to find its very condition of possibility in Brod's suggestive anecdote. "The best part of Max Brod's book on Kafka," they write, "is when Brod tells how listeners laughed at the reading of the first chapter of <i>The Trial</i> 'quite immoderately'."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Deleuze and Guattari want nothing less than to reread Kafka on the basis of this immoderate laughter arising from the reading (aloud) of <i>The Trial</i>. "There is a Kafka laughter," they claim: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>a very joyous laughter, that people usually understand poorly. It is for stupid reasons that people have tried to see a refuge far from life in Kafka's literature, and also an agony, the mark of an impotence and a culpability, the sign of a sad interior tragedy. . . . He is an author who laughs with a profound joy, a <i>joie de vivre</i>, in spite of, or because of, his clowning declarations that he offers like a trap or a circus. . . . Everything leads to laughter, starting with <i>The Trial</i>.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Despite so vehemently affirming the significance of laughter to Kafka's work, Deleuze and Guattari do not develop their thinking any further on this topic.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In light, then, of the provocative but still inchoate remarks of Brod and of Deleuze and Guattari, I want to ask here: how should we continue to think about Kafka's (relation to) laughter? </p>

<p>A somewhat poignant reminiscence from Gustav Janouch's <i>Conversations with Kafka </i>helps me to clarify the stakes of my inquiry. "Franz Kafka and I often laughed long and loud together," Janouch recalls, </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>that is to say, if one could ever describe Franz Kafka's laughter as loud. For me at least what remained in my memory is not the sound of his laughter but the physical gestures by which he expressed his amusement. Depending on how much he was amused, he threw his head back quickly or slowly, opened his mouth a little and closed his eyes in narrow slits, as if his face was turned to the sun. Or he laid his hand on the desk, raised his shoulders, drew in his bottom lip and shut his eyes as if someone were going to shower him with water.</p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">When Kafka was in just such a mood, Janouch told him "a little Chinese story." </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"The heart is a house with two bedrooms. In one lives suffering and in the other Joy. One mustn't laugh too loud, or one will wake the sorrow in the next-door room."</p>
<p>"And Joy? Isn't she woken by the noise of sorrow?"</p>
<p>"No. Joy is hard of hearing. So she never hears the suffering in the next room."</p>
<p>Kafka nodded. "That's right. That's why one often only pretends to be enjoying oneself. One stuffs one's ears up with the wax of pleasure. For instance, me. I simulate gaiety in order to vanish behind it. My laughter is a concrete wall."</p>
<p>"Against whom?"</p>
<p>"Naturally, against myself."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
<b></b>

</p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">
Laughter emerges from Janouch's anecdote as above all else a matter of the body and of its various gestures or mannerisms. (According to Walter Benjamin, "Kafka could understand things only in the form of a <i>gestus</i>."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> ) Precisely as a matter of the body, laughter is able to render the abstract tangible: one fears laughing too loudly because manifesting joy convokes the physical proximity of sorrow. Perhaps on account of this astonishing capacity to materialize emotion, laughter remains for Janouch's Kafka a defensive or a sceptical mode of expression. Laughter becomes skeptical when it simulates rather than expresses joy—that is to say, when it shows the body to be not just expressing itself, but also withdrawing into itself. </p>

<p>What immediately complicates Kafka's notion of laughter, then, are the doubts he retains about the body as a locus for true expression. For Kafka, dedication to his writing seems to entail the sacrifice of the body; it has the vampiric effect of rendering the body barren. On 3 January, 1912, he writes in his diaries: "When it became clear in my organism that writing was the most productive direction for my being to take, everything rushed in that direction and left empty all those abilities which were directed towards the joys of sex, eating, drinking, philosophical reflection, and above all music. I atrophied in all directions."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  According to Elias Canetti, </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Kafka never lost his pronounced sensitivity to anything related to his body. This sensitivity . . . must have marked even his childhood. Early on, his thinness made him attentive to his body. He became accustomed to taking note of anything that his body lacked. He found, in his body, an object of observation which never escaped him, which could not slip away from him. . . . Gradually thoughts about the individual organs beset him. A pronounced sensitivity to these organs begins to develop, until finally each is placed under a separate guard. But by this the dangers are multiplied—there are countless symptoms to be watched by a mind fraught with suspicion, once that mind is aware of the special character of the organs and their vulnerability. There are moments of pain. . . . The pains warn of dangers, they are heralds from the adversary. Hypochondria is the short change of <i>Angst</i>; it is <i>Angst</i> which, for its distraction, seeks names and finds them.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Insofar as it evokes the hypochondriacal or the simulated body, laughter may indeed be viewed dialectically—as one of the distractions of Kafka's <i>Angst</i>. </p>

<p>To conceive of Kafka's laughter as simulated gaiety is to recognize that it does not serve to alleviate the "fearful earnestness" of the work. The comical element in Kafka does not have a mitigating or a mollifying effect; indeed, if anything, it functions to heighten the abiding sense of horror. As Kafka's fellow countryman and devotee, Milan Kundera, explains in his essay "Somewhere Behind," </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>the <i>Kafkan</i> takes us inside, into the guts of a joke, into the <i>horror of the comic</i>. In the world of the <i>Kafkan</i>, the comic is not a counterpoint to the tragic (the tragi-comic) as in Shakespeare; it's not there to make the tragic more bearable by lightening the tone; it doesn't <i>accompany</i> the tragic, not at all, it <i>destroys it in the egg</i> and thus deprives the victims of the only consolation they could hope for: the consolation to be found in the (real or supposed) grandeur of tragedy.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
<b></b>

</p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">
Tragedy consoles because it affords its onlooker access to states of interiority. The tragic hero suffers externally—endures an ignominious death—so that heroic action may resonate emotionally with the audience. According to Aristotle in the <i>Poetics</i>, tragic suffering should never be a matter of mere spectacle, "For the plot should be so ordered that . . . anyone merely hearing about the incidents will shudder with pity and fear as a result of what is happening."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> </p>

<p>What Kundera rightly perceives as unnerving about the comic element in Kafka is its insistence upon the irreducibility of spectacle. The Kafkan precludes tragic <i>catharsis</i> by continuing to associate the victim-protagonist in death with a type of metaphysical shame. While tragic death is ultimately redemptive, Kafkan death represents an ultimate or pure form of humiliation—think of the end of "The Judgement" where the immediate precursor of Josef K., Georg Bendemann, accepts his fictitious guilt and throws himself into the river at the request of his father. When Kafka laughs at the opening of <i>The Trial</i> he is reveling, no doubt devilishly, in the comic humiliation of his protagonist. But he is also laughing at himself, recognizing in the absurd circumstances of Josef K.'s arrest an aspect of his own humiliation. As Canetti observes, "Two decisive events in Kafka's life—events which he of all people would have wanted to keep especially private—had taken place in a way that was embarrassingly public: the official engagement in the Bauer family home on June 1, and six weeks later, on July 12, 1914, the 'tribunal' at the Askanische Hof, which led to the breaking of the engagement." In the "tribunal"—as Kafka later came to call it—Felice confronted him with love letters he had written to Grete Bloch during the period of their engagement. With Bloch (who had supplied the letters to Felice) presiding as judge, Kafka offered no defense and the engagement dissolved, as he had wanted it to in any case. Canetti continues: "It can be shown that the emotional substance of both events entered directly into <i>The Trial</i>, which Kafka began to write in August. The engagement becomes the arrest in the first chapter; the 'tribunal' appears as the execution in the last."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  <i>The Trial</i> thereby derives its emotional resonance from the peculiar fact of the author becoming a public spectacle. Josef K.'s unwarranted arrest at the beginning of the novel signifies the public realm invading and evacuating the private: "Somebody must have made a false accusation against Josef K., for he was arrested one morning without having done anything wrong."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  This disquieting foreclosure of the private is consecrated even more forcefully at the very end of the novel when a mysterious re watches from a distant window as Josef K. dies—"like a dog," so that the shame would outlive him. </p>

<p>"Not the curse of solitude but the violation of solitude is Kafka's obsession!" avers Kundera (<i>AN, </i>111<i>)</i>. Here, Kundera's interpretive gambit is once again to oppose the Kafkan to the tragic. As I am arguing, the "curse of solitude" is the defining mark of the tragic hero and the preservation of the hero's solitude (even in the ignominy of death) is what ultimately enables for our cathartic identification with him. Insofar as the Kafkan comes about through the "violation of solitude," however, it disrupts this tragic schema; it forces us to find meaning not in tragic interiority (the hero's guilt) but rather in the "horror of the comic," that is to say, in the hero's humiliating exposure to the unexpected intrusion of others into the private sphere. According to Deleuze and 

<b></b>

Guattari, "Only one thing really bothers Kafka and angers him, makes him indignant: when people treat him as a writer of intimacy, finding a refuge in literature, as an author of solitude, of guilt, of an intimate misfortune."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  What serves to break the spell of interiority in this schema is Kafka's laughter: by laughing at the "rape of [Josef K.'s] privacy" (<i>AN</i>, 111), Kafka locates the meaning of (his) literature outside the reader's identification with the hero—in a form of social contact whose raison d'être is the annihilation of the self's (right to) privacy.  </p>

<p>Kafka writes in his story "Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk," "what is entrusted to one's care one does not laugh at."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  One laughs, rather, at what is no longer entrusted to one's care, at what one has come to relate to in more external or impersonal terms. According to the superiority thesis, dominant in the philosophical tradition up until the eighteenth century, laughter works by putting the object of derision—the butt—beyond the real or ethical concerns of the derider or wit.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  By laughing at something I distance that thing from myself so as to neutralize its power to affect or even to hurt me. Laughter thereby embeds everything, in the words of Virginia Woolf, "in a kind of non-descript cotton wool."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  It celebrates the things of the world, that is, insofar as they have become marvelously ineffectual or profoundly inert. To link literature to laughter is first of all to posit an ideal addressee who confirms the meaningfulness of the work precisely by laughing at it, that is to say, by acknowledging its intrinsic ineffectuality or its profound inertia. In a speech he gave upon receiving the Jerusalem prize in 1985, Kundera wryly conceives of the form of the novel as the echo of God's laughter. "There is a fine Jewish proverb," he writes: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Man thinks, God laughs. Inspired by that adage, I like to imagine that François Rabelais heard God's laughter one day, and thus was born the idea of the first great European novel. It pleases me to think that the art of the novel came into the world as the echo of God's laughter. But why does God laugh at the sight of man thinking? Because man thinks and the truth escapes him. Because the more men think, the more one man's thought diverges from another's. And finally, because man is never what he thinks he is. . . . Don Quixote thinks, Sancho thinks, and not only the world's truth but also the truth of their own selves slips away from them.</p>

<p class="continued">For Kundera, literature is consubstantial with irony; it is intrinsically comical or diversionary. Moreover, it relates to the possibility of radical doubt otherwise than Descartes in his <i>Meditations</i>. Cartesian skepticism brackets off corporeal reality in order to arrive at the metaphysical truth of what I am: a thinking thing (that doubts). Literary skepticism or irony, by contrast, achieves its profoundest effects in the opposite way: by attempting to embody the metaphysical.  </p>

<p>According to Simon Critchley in his recent book <i>On Humour</i>, "What makes us laugh . . . is the return of the physical into the metaphysical, where the pretended tragical sublimity of the human collapses into a comic ridiculousness which is perhaps even more tragic."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In the more economical phrase of Henri Bergson, the comic is "the body taking precedence over the soul" (quoted in <i>OH</i>, 61). In a wonderful parable from the first volume of <i>Either/Or</i> , Søren Kierkegaard stages this idea of the 

<b></b>

comical by depicting the assembly of the Roman gods laughing at the sight of man thinking. Kierkegaard's pseudonym—the aesthete A—here tells of trying to wrest the power of laughter away from the gods. "Something wonderful has happened to me," he writes. </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I was caught up into the seventh heaven. There sat all the gods in assembly. By a special grace I was granted the privilege of making a wish. "Wilt thou," said Mercury, "have youth or beauty or power or a long life or the most beautiful maiden or any of the other glories we have in the chest? Choose but one thing." For a moment I was at a loss. Then I addressed myself to the gods as follows: "Most honourable contemporaries, I choose this one thing, that I may always have the laugh on my side." Not one of the gods said a word; on the contrary, they all began to laugh. From that I concluded that my wish was granted and found that the gods knew how to express themselves with taste; for it would hardly have been suitable for them to have answered gravely: "Thy wish is granted."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">What this astonishing parable reveals about the nature of laughter is its tendency to escape toward the other or to exceed the limits of self-possession. In wishing to have the laughter on his side, Kierkegaard's aesthete does not wish for anything he might possess. Rather, his desire is to encounter the transcendence of the divine not just physically but also socially. The gods oblige our aesthete in the most appropriate way imaginable: by laughing at him. </p>

<p>Insofar as it shows the metaphysical momentarily taking physical form, Kierkegaard's parable operates in the opposite way to Descartes's famous "evil genius" scenario. Towards the end of the first of his <i>Meditations</i>, Descartes writes, "I will suppose therefore that not God, who is supremely good and the source of truth, but rather some malicious demon of the utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies in order to deceive me; . . . I shall consider myself as not having hands or eyes, or flesh, or blood or senses, but as falsely believing I have all these things."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  As Ian Hacking observes of this scenario, "The malicious demon . . . is an all-purpose demon who can create doubt about anything, particularly, the truth that I have a body, that I have a head and arms. <i>This</i> doubt, about my very body, is in fact strikingly close to some manifestations of what is called paranoid schizophrenia; real live scepticism is close to genuine madness."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  But there can be no laughter without the body. Laughter thus works uncannily to neutralize the power of the metaphysical to deceive the physical and may be viewed as an empirical counter to the metaphysical nihilism of Descartes's thought experiment, which would have us contemplate nothing less than the annihilation of every consolatory image. This, I take it, is the ironic point of Kierkegaard's parable: as the gods honor their end of the bargain and laugh at his pseudonym, they are momentarily dispossessed of their metaphysicality and must express themselves in reassuringly human terms. </p>

<p>In Kierkegaard's parable (as in the Jewish proverb), the gods assert their superiority over man by laughing at him. As Georges Bataille writes, in what is another formulation of the superiority thesis, "In general we laugh on condition that our position of dominance not be at the mercy of laughter, the object of laughter. To laugh, it is necessary 

<b></b>

that one not risk losing one's position of dominance."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The gods are free to respond to Kierkegaard's pseudonym as they do because his wish does not require them to give up their position of dominance. But it does require them, momentarily, to express their dominance in a physical rather than a metaphysical way. Insofar as it res the enigmatic encounter between the physical and the metaphysical, the phenomenon of laughter thus shows this encounter to finish up on the corporeal side of things. To laugh—to have the laughter on your side—is always to cleave to physical rather than metaphysical possibilities. This is perhaps why all laughter expresses a direct or an indirect joie de vivre and why the best type of comedy is physical comedy. We are able to see the humor in two strange men entering into Josef K.'s bedroom and arresting him one morning without reason because this remains—however uncomfortably—a physical possibility. On the other hand, we cannot laugh at Descartes imagining himself without hands, eyes, flesh, blood, or any of the senses because this presents us with a purely—and terrifyingly—metaphysical scenario. </p>

<p>For Bataille, that which is risible may simply be <i>the unknowable</i>: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>We laugh . . . in passing very abruptly, all of a sudden, from a world in which everything is given as stable within a generally stable order, into a world in which our assurance is overwhelmed, in which we perceive that this assurance was deceptive. Where everything had seemed totally provided for, suddenly the unexpected arises, something unforeseeable and overwhelming, revelatory of an ultimate truth: the surface of appearances conceals a perfect absence of response to our expectation.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Here, Bataille shifts his focus from the superiority to the incongruity theory of laughter. But my point remains the same: whether expressing a feeling of superiority over the butt of a joke or "a perception of the incongruous," laughter proceeds by first divesting the unknown of its metaphysicality.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  What is revealed to be laughable is, in some sense, revealed to be <i>of the body</i>. (The wish of Kierkegaard's pseudonym is also to affirm the value of finitude.) As Critchley remarks, "If we laugh with the body, then what we often laugh at <i>is</i> the body, the strange fact that we <i>have</i> a body. In humour, it is as if we temporarily inhabited a Gnostic universe, where the fact of our materiality comes as some-thing of a surprise" (<i>OH</i>, 44). </p>

II. Sarah's Laughter: The Skepticism of the Body 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>To understand better how laughter works to divest the unknown of its immateriality, it is helpful at this point to recall the story of the birth of the biblical patriarch, Isaac, whose Hebrew name means "he laughs." This story is relevant to my discussion for a number of reasons—not the least because it came to fascinate Kafka. Malynne Sternstein summarizes the biblical episode neatly: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Sarah's beauty was legendary but it was barren: she remained childless until the fulfillment of God's (laughable) promise that she would be "mother of nations" (Gen. 17:16). Old as she and Abraham were—she in her 90s, he a centenarian—she gave birth to the 

<b></b>

promised son. Sarah's doubt of God (giving her maidservant Hagar to Abraham as a surrogate mother, she enterprisingly fulfills God's promise <i>for</i> Him) is often cited as the center of this tale. Yet Sarah is not punished for her lapse of faith; she is not scolded for her skeptical laughter, her gallows humor. She is instead rewarded. . . . Her laughter is embodied forever in God's award of Isaac.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>Vitzchak</i>)<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">From the point of view of the incongruity theory of humor, Isaac appears as an incarnation of laughter. The apparent incongruity he overcomes, moreover, is one that preoccupies Kafka. For one who is so concerned with the feeling of physical barrenness ("My life is a hesitation before birth," writes Kafka on 24 January, 1922 [<i>D</i>, 405]), Sarah's doubts about being able to conceive a child in her old age come to represent an irreducibly meaningful expression of despair. We discover the following fragment in Kafka's diaries: "It had been impossible for him to enter the house, for he had heard a voice saying to him: 'Wait till I lead you in!' And so he continued to lie in the dust in front of the house, although by now, probably, everything was hopeless (as Sarah would say)" (<i>D</i>, 395; 21 October, 1921). </p>

<p>Let us now turn to the detail of the story. In Genesis 17, Abraham first learns that he will soon have a son by Sarah. God says to him: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"I will bless [Sarah] and surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her."</p>
<p>Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, "Will a son be born to man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?" And Abraham says to God, "If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!"</p>
<p>Then God said, "Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him".</p>

	(Gen. 17:16-18)<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Abraham laughs here because of the seeming impossibility—the apparent incongruity—of the couple conceiving a child now that they are well into their old age. This incredulity gains even stronger expression in the next chapter of the Bible—when it is Sarah rather than the patriarch himself who laughs uncontrollably upon hearing God's incredible promise. </p>

<p>Sarah's laughter is remarkable for the way it seems to come about despite God's best efforts. In Genesis 18, three (strange) men appear to Abraham—"some exegetical remarks cite them as angels, some as God triumvirate."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  These strangers are immediately at pains to ensure that Sarah is excluded from the discussion: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"Where is you wife Sarah?" they asked him.</p>
<p>"There, in the tent," he said.</p>
<p>Then the Lord said [to Abraham], "I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son."</p>
<p>Now Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which was behind him. Abraham and Sarah were already old and well advanced in years, so Sarah was past the age of childbearing. So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, "After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?"

<b></b>

</p>
<p>Then the Lord said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?' Is there anything too hard for the Lord? I will return to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son."</p>
<p>Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, "I did not laugh."</p>
<p>But he said, "Yes, you did laugh".</p>

<p class="continued">Vital to the meaning of this scene is Sarah's positioning at the entrance of the tent. According to Don Seeman, "the instability of her enclosure there—is she inside the tent, or at its opening?—is mirrored by a concern with the unstable 'closure' of her body, which threatens to frustrate the divine promise of motherhood she has received."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  In the context of the Hebrew Bible, Seeman explains: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"Closure" can be positively valued as protection from external assault, but it more often carries negative connotations. Closure of wombs indicates the inability of women to conceive children, while the enclosure of people within houses can represent either the ritually enacted social alienation that accompanies affliction, or the dumb isolation of mourning. Each of these usages presumes a structural opposition between open and closed in which the latter is the more negatively valenced term. Thresholds (or "tent openings") are therefore a natural focal point for biblical narrative, because they represent a site for the mediation of blessing and barrenness. Abraham and Sarah's continuous movement towards [relative] openness and exteriority in the narrative of Isaac's conception signals the movement towards new fertility and the covenantal promise of progeny that they receive.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">According to Seeman, Genesis 18 shows Sarah moving to the opening of the tent to receive God's blessing in a distinct and gender-specific way. But to leave it there is to suppress the negative moment of her gallows humor and the completely ambivalent exchange it subsequently provokes with God. Sarah's laughter is more incredulous or faithless than Abraham's because it is more self-reflexive: it leaves her alone with the thought of (the limits of) her own body: "After I am worn out [or barren] and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?" What immediately lessens the degree of Abraham's skepticism is his ability to make another the focus of his concern. Abraham avoids contemplating the (meta)physics of God's promise by worrying about the welfare of his first son, Ishmael: "If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!" There is no/body, however, to divert Sarah from doubting God (or the metaphysical) by doubting the full and proper functioning of her body. </p>

<p>Sarah's laughter expresses what I want to call here the skepticism of the body. I understand two things by this phrase: on the one hand, the sense of incredulity that our physical selves may express towards the metaphysical; but then, on the other hand, the doubts we may retain about the body as a locus for true expression. Rather than developing into a melancholic or a tragic affirmation of solitude, (Sarah's) laughter marks the ambivalent threshold—the "opening"—between the inside and the outside, the public and the private, the blessed and the barren. By laughing, Sarah overexposes herself to and humiliates herself before the metaphysical other. She attempts to cover up her sense of humiliation by lying. But this does her no good; her laughter has denied her 

<b></b>

the right to privacy upon which properly tragic interiority depends. At the same time, however, the very spontaneity of her response has an uncanny and self-empowering effect: it momentarily suspends the power of the metaphysical over the physical. God is bemused by Sarah's laughter. In the act of chastising her, he nonetheless reaffirms the potential of her laughter to equivocate his word and so allows for this equivocation to become copresent with the passage of the promise. The point, I take it, is the same as in Kierkegaard's parable: laughter reveals the physical momentarily taking precedence over the metaphysical; the only appropriate way for God to reply to Sarah's skepticism of the body is to deliver on his promise of Isaac. </p>

<p>Generating the tension in this scene is not just the awkward disclosure of Sarah's faithless laughter, but also the fact that we must wait for God to respond to Sarah's provocation <i>in kind</i>. This happens a year (and three chapters of Genesis) later when Sarah duly gives birth to Isaac at the age of 90. Upon his birth, Isaac becomes a miraculous sign to his mother that the laughter is on her side: "Sarah said, 'God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.' And she added, 'Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age'" (Gen. 21:6). Isaac consecrates the (comic) meaningfulness of Sarah's incredulous laughter, her skepticism of the body. In Critchley's terms, he is the joyful return of the physical into the metaphysical: the embodiment (or the echo) of God's laughter. Sarah was right to laugh at God's incredible promise of Isaac because the encounter between the physical and the metaphysical was (meant) to end comically rather than tragically. There is thus a sense in which Sarah's laughter allows the birth of Isaac to be thought not in terms of the covenant and of sacrificial obligation to the divine but rather according to another, more ironic, comical and, I would add, literary temporality. </p>

III. Kafka's Abraham 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>In order to perceive Sarah's laughter as a re of the literary, we must follow a rhetorical move Kafka himself makes and contrast Sarah's expression of skepticism in Genesis 18 with Abraham's expression of faith in Genesis 22. In Genesis 22, Abraham's faith in the divine is most sorely tested when God asks him to go to Mount Moriah to make a holocaust, or a whole burnt offering, of Isaac. On the way to Moriah, the beloved son, who is carrying the fire and the wood for the sacrifice, asks, "Father? . . . The fire and the wood are here . . . but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?" (Gen. 22:7). The father replies to the son's question indirectly, speculatively, even ironically, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son" (Gen. 22:8). Abraham here responds to Isaac by ratively introjecting a remote future—God providing the lamb for the sacrifice—into the discourse of the present. He thereby subsumes the physically humiliating circumstances of the present (in which the son surely suspects what is up) to the metaphysical grandeur of an imagined or hoped-for future. For her part, Sarah refuses to make this temporal leap of faith; her laughter draws its rhetorical strength from the very act of giving up on the metaphysical reality of the future. By laughing at 

<b></b>

God's promise of Isaac, she cleaves to the physically humiliating circumstances of the present, even as these leave her without hope.  </p>

<p>I want to conclude my argument by affiliating Sarah's laughter with the Kafkan. When Kafka famously put it to Brod that "There is an infinite amount of hope—but not for us," does this pronouncement not owe a rhetorical debt to Sarah's dark comedy of the body?<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  A single sentence from Kafka allows us to posit Sarah's laughter as a precursor to his own. The story of Abraham's averted sacrifice of Isaac was long one of his favourite topics—and in a remarkable letter, from June 1921, to his friend Robert Klopstock, he mocks the story by rereading it in terms of Sarah's laughter. "[It]'s all an old story not worth discussing any longer," writes Kafka dismissively. </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Especially not the real Abraham; he had everything to start with, was brought up to it from childhood—I can't see the leap [<i>Sprung</i>]. If he already had everything, and yet was to be raised higher, then something had to be taken away from him, at least in appearance: this would be logical and no leap. It was different for these other Abrahams, who stood in the houses they were building and suddenly had to go up on Mount Moriah; it is possible they didn't even have a son, yet already had to sacrifice him. These are impossibilities and Sarah was right to laugh.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup></p>

<p class="continued">This is a truly beguiling passage—not least because, rather than commenting simply or directly on the Genesis narrative, it also responds to the well-known reading of Abraham's trial presented in Kierkegaard's 1843 "Dialectical Lyric," <i>Fear and Trembling</i>. For one familiar with the argument of that text, Kafka's dense observations constitute a none-too-veiled criticism of Kierkegaard's account of Abraham. Kafka is here zeroing in on Kierkegaard's famous claim for the "leap of faith." This is the belief Abraham must maintain throughout the trial that the demand for Isaac's sacrifice comes from God and that it requires him to suspend his ethical obligations to his son for the higher <i>telos</i> (whether end or goal) of religious piety. "According to Kierkegaard," Jacques Derrida explains in <i>The Gift of Death</i>, "the highest expression of the ethical is in terms of what binds us to our own and to our fellows (that can be the family but also the actual community of friends or the nation)."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The Kierkegaardian leap signifies the point at which adherence to ethical (or familial) obligation becomes, by virtue of the absurd, insufficient to the expression of faith. The leap means that Abraham is paradoxically able to realize the work of the eternal as a temporal being—but only on violent terms. As Kierkegaard puts it in <i>Fear and Trembling</i>, only the one "who draws the knife gets Isaac."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> </p>

<p>For his part, Kafka rejects this aggressive conception of Genesis 22, which puts the ethical, not to mention the eternal, so firmly in Abraham's grasp. According to Theodor W. Adorno, "Kafka used motifs from Kierkegaard's <i>Fear and Trembling</i> not as heir but as critic."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  An initially enthusiastic Kafka first began reading Kierkegaard in 1913—at the time he was breaking off his first engagement with Felice. On 21 August, 1913, upon receiving a selection from Kierkegaard's journals, he notes in his diary, "Today I got Kierkegaard's <i>Buch des Richters</i> [<i>Book of the Knight/Judge</i>]. As I suspected, his case, despite essential differences, is very similar to mine, at least he is 

<b></b>

on the same side of the world. He bears me out like a friend" (<i>D</i>, 230). Here, Kafka compares his situation with Felice to that of Kierkegaard breaking off his marriage engagement to Regine Olsen (in November 1841). But these feelings of existential fraternity on Kafka's part do not last very long and, after studying Kierkegaard in 1917, he disparages <i>Fear and Trembling</i> in a March 1918 letter to Brod: "He [Kierkegaard] doesn't see the ordinary man . . . and paints this monstrous Abraham [<i>den ungeheuren Abraham</i>] in the clouds."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Kafka criticizes <i>Fear and Trembling</i> not simply on the grounds that "Kierkegaard's Abraham is a murderer and, by antiphrasis, a Cain."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  What ultimately disturbs him about Kierkegaard's presentation of Abraham is less its endorsement of physical violence than its sheer metaphysicality. Kafka writes (once again to Brod), "as far as Kierkegaard is concerned . . . aspiring man must set his face against the world in order to rescue the divine in himself; or, what comes to the same thing, the divine sets him in opposition to the world in order to rescue itself."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  According to Kierkegaard, by violently suspending his ethical relation to Isaac in Genesis 22, Abraham transcends the mundane and enters as a single individual into direct relation to the Absolute (God). But, for Kafka, this philosophical (or, if you prefer, theological) version of tragic solitude remains dangerously unimaginable and hence "monstrous"—a bit like Descartes wondering what it would be like to be without a body. Contra Kierkegaard, Kafka thus insists upon depicting an absurdly ordinary or mundane Abraham, one who remains unable to extract himself from the ethical contingencies of his daily life. </p>

<p>Kafka writes to Klopstock, in a fine illustration of his comic touch: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I could conceive of another Abraham—he certainly would never have gotten to be patriarch or even an old clothes dealer—who was prepared to satisfy the demand of the sacrifice immediately, with the promptness of a waiter, but was unable to bring it off because he could not get away, being indispensable; the household needed him, there was perpetually something or other to put in order, the house was never ready; for without having his house ready, without having something to fall back on, he could not leave—this the Bible also realised, for it says: "He set his house in order."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  And, in fact, Abraham possessed everything in plenty to start with; if he had not had a house, where would he have raised his son; and in which rafter would he have stuck the sacrificial knife.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The main consequence of Kafka's thinking about the Genesis narrative, Benjamin notes, is that Abraham must cede his place in tradition.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  We laugh at Kafka's Abraham because his deeply personal and unique relationship with God has come down to the purely material problem of finding a place to hide the sacrificial knife. According to Kierkegaard, "faith is the paradox that interiority is higher than exteriority."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  But, for Kafka, there is no such paradox or divine right to privacy—only the horror of the comic. By emphasizing the fact that Abraham had a house with rafters in which to stick the weapon, Kafka thus ridicules Kierkegaard's supposition in <i>Fear and Trembling</i> that Abraham successfully concealed from all the ethical authorities around him not just the knife, but also his sacrificial intentions.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup> </p>

<p>If Kafka's intention is to render the patriarch in comic rather than tragic terms, then surely the Archimedean point of his thinking about the sacrifice is reached when these 

<b></b>

other Abrahams are required to go up to Moriah even though they do not yet have a son. These "other Abrahams" are incapacitated and humiliated by the absurd fact of lacking a son to sacrifice. But the son—Isaac—is here really just another name for a definite sense of the present, the finite or the temporal. Thus, as Jill Robbins notes, "We could read this 'not yet' [having a son] and 'already' [having to sacrifice him] as an 'always not yet' and an 'always already,' that is, as an unreachable futurity and an unreachable anteriority."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  In contrast to the real Abraham who enjoyed divine favor from the beginning—who already possessed "everything" and was able to offer it up readily in the form of Isaac—these others are dispossessed of a sense of the present, the temporal, the finite at the crucial point of the sacrifice being demanded. The absurdity of their predicament—their relation to the absurd—arises precisely from this constitutive lack. </p>

<p>In Kierkegaard's version of events, Abraham expresses his faith by asserting his absolute solitude—that is to say, by doubting the ultimate reality of his ethical relations to others. Kafka's Abraham takes this skepticism one crucial and comical step further: he doubts he even has a son to sacrifice. It is thus as if Kafka here reimagines everything from the point of view of Sarah's laughter in Genesis 18: Sarah <i>was</i> right to doubt God's promise of Isaac; Isaac was never born; and yet Abraham is still asked to offer up his son for sacrifice. The absurdity of this situation expresses what Kundera refers to as "the horror of the comic": Abraham is exposed before the metaphysical other but is at the same time unable to retreat into the consolatory or cathartic depths of tragic interiority. He is bound to the contingencies of the mundane as these give expression to his intrinsic banality. The basis for Kafka's astonishing act of literary expropriation, I have been arguing, is a sense of physical inadequacy in the face of metaphysical possibility: not (the real) Abraham's faith, but (the real) Sarah's laughter. </p>

<p>In a third and final rendering of the trial to Klopstock (to whom he had given a copy of <i>Fear and Trembling</i>), Kafka foregrounds Abraham's feelings of physical inadequacy in the face of the metaphysical ordeal. In this version, which Peter Mailloux acknowledges as most clearly expressing Kafka's own qualities, Abraham remains unable to go through with the sacrifice because he becomes afraid of transforming into Don Quixote on the way.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup> </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>But take another Abraham. One who wanted to perform the sacrifice altogether in the right way and had a correct sense in general of the whole affair, but could not believe that he was the one meant, he, an ugly old man, and the dirty youngster that was his child. True faith is not lacking in him, he has this faith; he would make the sacrifice in the right spirit if only he could believe he was the one meant. He is afraid that after starting out as Abraham with his son he would change on the way into Don Quixote. The world would have been enraged at Abraham could it have beheld him, but this one is afraid that the world would laugh itself to death. However, it is not the ridiculousness as such that he is afraid of—though he is, of course, afraid of that too and, above all, of his joining in the laughter—but in the main he is afraid that his ridiculousness will make him even older and uglier, his son even dirtier, even more unworthy of being really called. An Abraham who should come unsummoned! [<i>Ein Abraham, der ungerufen kommt!</i>] It is as if, at the end of the year, when the best student was solemnly about to receive a prize,

<b></b>

the worst student rose in the expectant stillness and came forward from his dirty desk in the last row because he had made a mistake of hearing, and the whole class burst out laughing. And perhaps he had not made a mistake at all, his name really was called out, it having been the teacher's intention to make the rewarding of the best student at the same time a punishment for the worst.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">"An Abraham who should come unsummoned!" We have now entered fully into the bowels of the joke. Abraham—or should we rather say Kafka himself?—must not only confront his irremediable ridiculousness, but also stop himself from laughing along with the others. What precludes Kafka's Abraham from escaping ridicule by relating privately to the divine is his overwhelming sensitivity to his own physical inadequacy. Here, then, Kafka completes his parabolic act of identification with the re of Sarah's laughter by transferring her doubts about the propriety of her body on to the patriarch himself. Along the way to Moriah, via the pages of <i>Fear and Trembling</i>, Kafka's Abraham so becomes a laughing stock—a purely literary re, a Don Quixote. </p>

<p>Underlying Kafka's laughter, I have been arguing in this paper, is the skepticism of the body, one extreme expression of which is the feeling of being unable to have children. On 19 January, 1922, Kafka returns in his diaries to what is a persistent topic of reflection: namely, the burden of childlessness: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The infinite, deep, warm, saving happiness of sitting beside the cradle of one's child opposite its mother. There is in it also something of this feeling: matters no longer rest with you, unless you wish it so. In contrast, this feeling of those who have no children: it perpetually rests with you, whether you will or no, every moment to the end, every nerve-racking moment, it perpetually rests with you, and with no result. Sisyphus was a bachelor.</p>

<p class="continued">In his essay, "Kafka and the Work's Demand," Blanchot explains Kafka's peculiar situation as a writer by appealing to his reworking of the trial of Abraham. As Blanchot points out, what burdens the writer is the nerve-racking fact of lacking a real object—in this privileged case, a beloved child—to sacrifice: "For Kafka the ordeal is all the graver because of everything that makes it weigh lightly on him. (What would the testing of Abraham be if, having no son, he were nonetheless required to sacrifice this son? He couldn't be taken seriously; he could only be laughed at. That laughter is the form of Kafka's pain)."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  What else is laughter, one might ask, but a form of imaginary pain? Or, the imagination of a pain to come: the birth pains of the future? We recall the moral of Janouch's little Chinese story: one must not laugh too loudly for fear of waking the sorrow in the next room. Insofar as he draws his power and authority from an always imaginary or imagined form of suffering, from a type of pain to come, the writer must acknowledge the rectitude of Sarah's laughter. This most anxious and skeptical form of laughter expresses a joie de vivre by momentarily and inadvertently releasing the despairing self into the company of others. However elusive or fugitive it may seem, the <i>telos</i> of (Kafka's) laughter is the return of the physical into the metaphysical which is "the happiness of being with people" (<i>D</i>, 411; 2 February, 1922). According to

<b></b>

 Brod: "It is a new kind of smile that distinguishes Kafka's work, a smile close to the ultimate things—a metaphysical smile so to speak—indeed sometimes when he used to read out one of his tales for us friends of his, it rose above a smile and we laughed out aloud."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> </p>

Janouch's book of reminiscences was first published in 1951. A second edition, revised and enlarged, was published in 1968, the year of Janouch's death. The quoted passage is one of the additions Janouch made to the 1951 version. Janouch was 17 when he first met Kafka in 1920 and the conversations between the two men probably only continued on until 1922. It should be noted that many Kafka scholars (including Ronald Gray, Roy Pascal, Malcolm Pasley, Peter Neumeyer, Gersholm Sholem, and Eduard Goldstücker) have doubted the authenticity of Janouch's book, especially the expanded edition. Critics remain skeptical, for the most part, because the author wrote the conversations up from his various notes and diary entries long after they had actually taken place. Hugh Haughton analyzes the various aspects of the controversy surrounding the <i>Conversations</i> in his introduction to the quoted edition (vii-xxxv). To balance the gathering negative assessments of the work, Haughton notes the following: "Max Brod and Dora Dymant thought Janouch's book brought Kafka back to life. Even if much of Janouch's material is fictional and garbled, all of it bears something of the imprint of Kafka's personality—and voice. . . . It may well be that the <i>Conversations</i> should be classified with the multiplying number of imaginary or semi-fictional portraits of Kafka" (xxiii). In his 1986 essay, "Kafka-Criticism: A Typological Perspective," James Rolleston writes: "The old debate about the 'authenticity' of the <i>Conversations with Kafka</i> now looks uninteresting in the extreme. What that book does is to loosen the limits which Kafka imposed on his own fictional writing, to suggest how powerfully he could find words for phenomena like Charlie Chaplin or the Russian Revolution, to validate the reader's sense that the history of this century has already been written by Kafka." In <i>Kafka's Contextuality</i>, ed. Alan Udoff (Gordian Press and Baltimore Hebrew College, 1986), 5. My aim is to demonstrate that, however much a fictional or imaginary portrait, Janouch's reminiscence does bear something of the imprint of Kafka's voice and can be shown to provide valuable insight into Kafka's idea of the phenomenon of laughter. </p>

<b>Abstract</b>
<p>Gertrude Stein's notebooks reveal her acute awareness of a constitutive feature of late nineteeth- and early twentieth-century urban life, the grid. The grid structure, as a model of visual and material organization, characterizes and is consolidated across legible environments from the visual-textual integration of the printed page to the design of city streets, becoming the definitive paradigm of modern spatio-temporal experience. Stein's notebooks for "Subject-cases: The Background of a Detective Story" demonstrate that Stein, in playing with the grid, not only subjects its basic features to rearrangement through her diagrammatic method but also uncovers its political foundations.</p>

<p id="lead">In one of her little <i>carnets</i>—a bound notebook smaller than a stack of cards—Gertrude Stein plays a game of fill-in-the-blank. Printed on the flyleaf, inside a box decorated with a floral motif, are black lines dedicated to proper identification: lines on which to write the notebook's subject, the start and end date of its use, and the owner's name and address. But Stein refuses this staid propriety. Her book says instead: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>LIVRE  <br />

Commence le <i>best</i> <br />
Termine le <i>best also</i> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APPARTENANT <br />
A <i>cuddle</i> <br />
Rue <i>muddle</i> No. <i>middle</i><sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The little book's empty lines evidently offered an irresistible opportunity. Stein's elliptical sense of humor and trademark language <i>à rebours</i> meet their perfect straight man here, the sober idiom of function, producing a Mad-Libs poem that parades its own diagrammatic skeleton.  </p>

<p>The diagram as a term is suggested by Stein herself in her essay "Poetry and Grammar," in which she speaks of and performs the synchronization of the material world, the abstract system of language and the self: "I really do not know anything has ever been more exciting than diagramming sentences. . . . I like the feeling the everlasting feeling of sentences as they diagram themselves. In that way one is completely possessing something 

<b></b>

and incidentally one's self."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Stein's reference to "completely possessing something and <i>incidentally</i> one's self" (my emphasis) brings together external, objective experience and internal, subjective experience, carefully refusing a claim of relation between them. The point is precisely that, in her pleasure in diagramming, the grammatical vectors of sequence are, ironically, detached from any theory of origin or causation regarding subjects and objects. The "I" enjoys diagramming sentences; meanwhile, the sentences independently "diagram themselves." Likewise, the "possessing" trespasses back and forth across normal lines of transmission, for the things of language are possessed by a self that is also possessed by language, in a present continuous tense—"is possessing." Such mutually constitutive possessing is, like the feeling it produces, "everlasting." Stein's diagramming, therefore, involves the mapping of experience on to an elastic and transitory conceptual space where specific elements and the relations between them matter but cannot take a fixed form.  </p>

<p>Outside of its didactic use in grammar, in English a diagram is a basic structural illustration or outline of a re. In French, however, a <i>diagramme</i> is also a graph. Given that French was most plausibly the language that galvanized Stein's interest in grammar—the language that she was learning at the beginning of her writing career and that she never completely mastered—it is likely that the other French meaning of the term inflects her use of it.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  But whether it is conceived as a schematic rendering of syntax, as a schematic illustration, or as a schematic grid of intersecting lines, a diagram in the conventional sense is a visual system for the representation of predetermined categories into which specific information is inserted. Stein's use of the term, however, radically rearranges this system. She insists on the primacy of concrete experience rather than fixed categories and fixed relations between categories, although she does not deny the existence of categories either. Stein's diagramming does not contain experience through <i>a priori</i> categories, nor does it provide an answer key to relieve the reader. Rather, it is an evolving structure in which categories and experiential data signify on the same plane. Her statement about diagramming sentences, in the end, articulates a philosophy of language in which the diagram res as the ground rule: a means of perceiving and simultaneously organizing experience. The diagram thus provides Stein with an answer to the problem of representation—the philosophical impasse and historical baggage associated with representation that, like others in her generation, she was attempting to circumvent. It allows her to sidestep representation in favor of presentation, via language as object. Through her diagrammatic practice, language may be treated materially, as a set of detachable units to be broken apart and rearranged. </p>

<p>Diagramming therefore captures Stein's analysis of living experience, which associates concrete objects and their fundamental lack of knowability. In order to resist the shell game of mimesis—the pretense that something is not missing—Stein uses words to turn experience into things that are simultaneously present and absent, aiming to make both presence and absence perceptible. As she touches each thing again and again in its process of unfurling, she creates repetitions, or what she calls "insistence."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  "Insistence" is crucial to her "continuous present," a phrase that oversees the slippage 

<b></b>

between physical presence and temporal presence, the <i>pas de deux</i> of experience in space-time. Based on a manner of conceptualizing experience indebted to sentence diagramming, graphing, and similar modes of visual demonstration, Stein's diagram is a scrolling display of coincident text and metatext.  </p>

<p>The little notebook's fill-in-the-blank text is just such a machine-in-the-making, for it registers and sets into motion an experience in progress, one present for Stein at the time of writing that she obliquely situates next to the prompts and blanks provided by the notebook. It is likely the <i>carnet</i> really did come from the <i>cuisine</i>—it probably belonged to the cook originally, and perhaps Stein simply meant to praise her cooking, to say that it was always the best from beginning to end. "Cuddle" is one of Stein's nicknames, here evoking the cosy warmth appropriate to the kitchen, and "muddle" and "middle" are euphonious, mouthy words to mix with it. The three words also, in sequence, cleverly reproduce the idea of filling in the blank, as they vary by only one letter from the preceding word. </p>

<p>However, this hybrid text is also a display of script intersection in which printed type meets manuscript, which is supposed to conform to print's dictates but here satirizes it instead. The other writings and drawings in the <i>carnet</i>, epitomizing the innocent and familiar inscriptions that attend domestic life, also exhibit this feature of writing—writing that, even in the most casual context, has become bound to its own surface, to a support that is visually assertive and visibly organized. The last page of the <i>carnet</i> contains a homemade chart: a list in French, containing the words, with some misspellings, <i>corsage</i>, <i>cache corsets</i>, <i>calcons</i>, <i>bas</i>, <i>mouchoirs</i>, <i>tricots</i>, <i>jupon</i>, <i>chemisette nuit</i>, <i>col dentelle</i>, <i>peignoir</i>, in a handwriting that is not Stein's, followed by four columns of numbers, some of which are crossed out or ticked off, separated by four hand-drawn vertical lines.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  The back flyleaf of the <i>carnet</i> is printed with a "Table de Multiplication" for the numbers two through fifteen, in three columns; opposite this, on the inside back cover, is a crude pencil drawing of a four-legged animal with a tail. The paper itself in this <i>carnet</i> is quadruled in light blue lines. Each of these innocuous and ordinary elements displays the dominance of visual array: the quadruled paper invites the writer to graph, inventory, or tabulate; the multiplication tables provide a pattern for the budget-maker; even the sketch can be seen to conform to the geometric imperative, precisely because it has no obvious purpose—it was made because the space for making it existed.  </p>

<p>Stein's diagrammatic method in the flyleaf poem and throughout her work is thus predicated on the prevalence of paper geometrically cut, printed, and bound. In Stein's compositional environment, the alliance between these mechanomorphic qualities of the everyday writing surface and the diagram is apparent. A diagram even makes an appearance on the cover of one of her larger compositional notebooks, a schoolchild's <i>cahier</i>, where an image of children playing with a paper airplane is accompanied by a labeled plan of the airplane—presumably allowing the young consumers of the notebook to use its very pages to reproduce the toy. (<a href="#1"> 1</a>) The <i>cahier</i> cover, like the multiply charged <i>carnet</i>, reveals that Stein's practice of diagramming is reinforced by a popular textual culture inherited from the nineteenth century, one valorizing the 

<b></b>

organized visual presentation of text. Stein participated in this culture through her choice of writing materials, her compositional methods, and her daily domestic and metropolitan experiences. The popular textual culture of Stein's Parisian milieu, that is, produced an environment of surfaces organized into lines and quadriform spaces: a gridded world.  </p>

Detecting the Grid: From Printed Page to City Plan 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>The grid is a familiar re of modernist visuality. As the basis for and constant preoccupation of a modernist visual aesthetic that signifies a break with the past, the grid, according to Rosalind Krauss, "has been almost totally successful in walling the visual arts into a realm of exclusive visuality and defending them against the intrusion of speech."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  As it is "[impervious] to language," it is also "[hostile] to narrative" and by extension to chronology and incident (<i>OAG</i>, 158). These characteristics of the grid, in Krauss's account, are implicitly caught up in its simultaneous and contradictory "centripetal"

<b></b>

 and "centrifugal" effects, its role in the modernist secular religion of abstraction, and, above all, what Krauss calls the "illusion . . . of the originary status of the pictorial surface" (<i>OAG</i>, 18; 160). The grid, therefore, is what enables the avant-garde to signify itself as such, even though it is paradoxically a structure that only permits repetition, a "system of reproductions without an original" (<i>OAG</i>, 162). Krauss's argument, focused on the repressed and yet essential role of the copy in avant-garde practice from the nineteenth century on, requires a definition of the grid that is fundamentally resistant to language. The implicit temporality of her schema is static; both as a period in which art was premised on the denial of an original and as a style that defiantly reiterates framing, this grid thwarts the entry of time into the space of the visual. </p>

<p>Krauss's account of the grid, however, overlooks the grid's most prevalent medium in the period of the modernist avant-garde: not painting, but popular print culture—printed texts and printed images. Krauss thus betrays the influence of Clement Greenberg and other formalists with whom she is in other ways at odds; the grid in Krauss's argument is, symptomatically, the grid that one gets with the limited purview of high art. Despite her attention to pastiche and collage, Krauss slights the materiality of the grid as the formative rubric of modernist art practice, which manipulated and was in large part a response to the inescapable actual products of reproductive technologies, not just the theoretical condition of reproducibility. The printed texts and images that permeated the legible environment, especially in the urban centers where artists gathered, were not only widespread but increasingly allied; text and image, previously held to separate philosophical and practical conditions, were enlisted in the same framework. Illustrated postcards, magazines, newspapers, advertisements, posters, and books were the products of reproductive print technologies such as lithography, photography, and rotary press processes, which allowed for the integration of text and image. This integration was consummated through the grid, a paradigmatic structure into which words and pictures could be placed and valued as equivalents.  </p>

<p>The grid devolves from, reinforces, and is reified by print. As the product of typography and the graphic imperative, it does not erect a fortress <i>against language</i> as Krauss claims, but is instead profoundly <i>attached to language</i> through printed text, the form in which language takes on a uniform visuality. Accordingly, the grid operates with the temporal movement of language. The grid of popular print culture is integrally implicated in sequence, rather than repetition that denies an origin, for printed text is the first example of a system of "repetitions" that evolve block by block—a system that culminates in cinema. As the defining feature of the legible environment, the grid is materialized primarily in visual-textual objects that depend on visible and potentially infinite sequencing, generating the transitory and serial temporality of the line of letters, the daily newspaper, the roll of film—the modest, mass-produced, and omnipresent things of everyday life. Stein calls attention to this temporality through the continuous present; her mischievous deployment of the continuous present is one of her many techniques—which collectively I am calling her diagrammatic method—for revealing, parodying, and playing with the grid.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>As the dominant vehicle and effect of popular print culture, the grid must be understood to comprise an inexorable feature of modern temporal experience. Modern temporality, as described by Benedict Anderson, was indeed instigated by print technology; in particular, the "simultaneity" of the novel and the newspaper—in which, respectively, concurrent plotlines and newsworthy events took material form—was indebted to the grid.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> In its reliance on, and revaluation of, temporal sequence, the grid initiates a reading-and-looking activity that is in constant but orderly motion. But the grid also fundamentally affects the spatial experience of the page, by facilitating a revisionary and fluctuating understanding of positive and negative space. The codependence of, exchange between, even interchangeability of text and image within a common matrix, are the most important factors contributing to the paradigm of the grid, and this unified display of text and image in turn depends on the basic units of the grid, lines and spaces. Yet the visual value accorded each of these units varies depending on location. The line may be visible, as in the black ink of the line of printed letters, or it may be "invisible," a visible blankness awaiting completion, as in Stein's <i>carnet</i>. Likewise, the quadrangular element of the grid created by lines may be an empty space, a framed absence, or it may be a solid block. The grid therefore puts into play a constantly changing and contingent relationship between what is there and what is not there, requiring a visuality that must be aware of the potential legibility of both positive and negative lines and spaces. </p>

<p>So far this survey of the grid has been concerned with its production in popular print culture, the visual-textual complex of the "pictorial turn" of the mid-nineteenth century.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  But the visual tracking of time and space that the visual-textual grid necessitated was not, in fact, confined to the page, and neither was the grid structure itself. Indeed, those technologies responsible for the visual-textual grid, beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, were intimately related to other technologies of mass production that had begun to change the basic terms of everyday life, in transportation, communication, recreation, the workplace, and domestic practices. These technologies and their products shared the basic temporal and spatial characteristics of the grid: the framed and changing spectacle of goods in department store windows; the successive movement of railroad boxcars; the sequential time of the assembly line. The nexus of these new forms of everyday experience—temporal and spatial experience associated, broadly speaking, with the visuality of the grid—was the city.  </p>

<p>The city was the place where the goods of mass-production were concentrated, and where the producers, sellers, managers, and distributors of those goods worked and lived. It was also in the city that the emblems of the visual-textual grid, such as newspapers, were produced. Most importantly, the nineteenth-century city itself took on the aspect of the grid. For example, the reorganization of Paris in the 1860s not only created standardization in the layout of streets, but also in the names of those streets and their identification in consistently spaced and uniformly designed street signs. Haussmann could not make Paris conform completely to the grid, since the new city had to be adapted to the preexisting medieval city and its landmarks, but he did apply to the city surface the basic units of the line and the geometric space, especially 

<b></b>

the straight line of the broad avenue, affording a clear view and the visual delectation of order.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In the United States, the grid was adopted as the <i>de facto</i> planning device of new towns and cities, for the grid proved to be "cheap, fast, reliable, and widely understood . . . a perfect marketing formula for headlong growth."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Moreover, the grid "registered the cultural expectations that conditioned nineteenth-century land use": equality, accessibility, adaptability, and the infinite extension afforded by the interchangeability of parts.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Envisioned through the structure of the grid, the city itself became a legible environment. </p>

<p>Its physical layout in lines and geometric shapes made the nineteenth-century city consonant with the visual-textual grid.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  The grid thus organized very different forms of nineteenth-century physical culture—the spaces through which one moved as well as the things one observed. On the large scale, the grid was the progeny of the nineteenth-century marriage between commodity culture and new visual technologies such as lithography, photography, and halftoning, which had industrial applications but which could also produce new private and domestic "spaces" through personal mementos like daguerreotypes and keepsake albums and parlor games such as zoetropes and stereoscopes. This intersection manufactured new methods of seeing texts and reading images, new urban experiences of space and time, and new spectatorial visions of selfhood. However, while the grid's multiple and interconnected forms originated in the nineteenth century, the grid per se was not yet fully visible, for the grid <i>as a system</i> was only unveiled as such in the twentieth century.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> </p>

<p>In the twentieth century, the grid system of the city and the grid system of print culture could be seen and read together, being equally subject to legibility and visual surveillance. Given this correspondence, the grid became an organizing value of spatiality itself, an abstract notion made manifest in urban design, architecture, the packaging and advertising of manufactured consumer items, and the already recognizable geometric schemes of apartment blocks, textile patterns, maps, and newspapers. In this epistemological shift to a gridded world, such disparate dimensions of everyday life appeared not only as interconnected components of the grid, but as visual surfaces bearing or awaiting textualization. The concept of the grid could thus extend into blank spaces free of inscription. It could also extend into time, which was made to conform visually to the grid through the publication of timetables and the standardization of time zones. In short, the grid no longer needed to be visible in order to be seen. The "grid vision" of modernism, therefore, was imaginary as well as physiological: the lines and spaces of the material grid available to sight were supplemented and multiplied by the developing mental habit of envisioning gridded structures. In its visible forms, the grid provided reading cues—as in a line of printed text, the key to a map, the border around an illustration in a magazine. In less visible forms, it also provided writing cues, because even those kinds of inscriptions that might seem to be outside the parameters of a geometric matrix, such as handwriting or the drawn line, were joined to an imagined grid. Such "invisible" grids often consisted of framed and designated blank spaces awaiting manuscript completion, as in the vacant square of the postcard, a contract to be signed, or Stein's travestied <i>carnet</i>. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>The grid as the ubiquitous form of the visual-textual interface would have become increasingly familiar to Stein through multiple sources. Photographs, postcards, bound booklets, pieces of lined paper, official licenses and documents, receipts, bills of sale, and other ephemera of everyday life had the visual appearance of the grid, often modified or completed by manuscript. The most telling evidence of the grid as an environmental fixture for Stein, however, occurs in her notebooks, the small <i>carnets</i> and the composing <i>cahiers</i>.  </p>

<p>The small <i>carnets</i> contain not only the cook's shopping lists and Stein's jokey doodles and play texts, but also messages exchanged between Alice and Gertrude, as well as occasional drafts and writing memos. They contain, in other words, a full range of inscriptive possibilities, all upon surfaces of lined or quadruled paper. These visually organized, commonplace, and cheap instruments of writing would have been especially marked for Stein, who did not spend time in an office, as part of home life.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Throughout her decades in Paris, Stein used these devices on a daily basis; they provided the essential material of composition, but they also imparted domestic order and pleasure, connecting private and public space through the grid. As vehicles of the regulation of manuscript and, by extension, the thought process, an effect that might seem properly to belong to bureaucratic, official, and public realms, the <i>carnets</i> demonstrate a limited power, for they also facilitate transgression. That is, the <i>carnets</i> seem to offer a means to organize and contain domestic note-taking that is easily, sometimes joyfully, and sometimes indifferently flouted, as in the fill-in-the-blanks poem, the willy-nilly combination of "genres," or the illegibility of one <i>carnet</i> page on which Gertrude and Alice wrote notes to each other at perpendicular angles, one text block right on top of another, one stage of writing eclipsing and obscuring the one beneath it in perfect grid formation.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The <i>carnets</i> indicate that, treated diagrammatically—subjected to Stein's categorical rearrangements, perception of blank spaces, and experience-centered organization—the grid format can be adapted to ends contrary to its inherent and seemingly unassailable regimentation. </p>

<p>The larger <i>cahiers</i> that Stein generally used for composition, which as objects are equally indicative of the structure of the grid, are filled with writing that seems at first glance less visually responsive than that in the <i>carnets</i>.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Nevertheless, the <i>cahiers</i> also demonstrate how diagramming can absorb the grid and rearrange its formal components. Stein used the kind of notebooks that were intended for schoolchildren and were widely available, not just at stationery shops, but at bookstores, newsstands, groceries, department stores, and pharmacies. Before and during the First World War, all her <i>cahiers</i> have black cardboard covers, are approximately nine by seven inches in size, and contain anywhere from eighty to two hundred pages of paper in horizontal lines or grids. Beginning in the early 1920s, notebooks with illustrated, colored paper covers prevail among her collected papers. These later notebooks are not only more visually complicated, but also represented for Stein a novelty item, a departure from her prewar norm. They materialize the grid in a more obvious form, so it is not surprising that in these later notebooks Stein seems both more aware of the grid and more keen to play with it.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

Diagramming the Grid: Stein's "Subject-cases" 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Characteristic of this latter category of notebook are the fifteen <i>cahiers</i> that contain the manuscript of Stein's story "Subject-cases: The Background of a Detective Story," composed in 1923.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  "Subject-cases" presents an exceptional opportunity for reading Stein's diagrammatic method in relation to the grid of print culture as its commitments to both the diagram and the grid are pronounced. As a story, "Subject-cases" has been diagnosed even by a Stein critic as "impenetrable" and "enigmatic."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Such a conclusion is not surprising, for in print "Subject-cases" is entirely opaque; the story has no discernible plot, setting, or characters. Viewed through the framework of its title, the story establishes Stein's special interest in the genre of the detective story—and, given its word repetitions, cascading sentences, and cumulative paragraphs, that this interest is, at bottom, "structural."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  However, while the text in printed form makes no obvious statement about the significance of the writing environment of its original manuscript, an examination of its detective-story foundations in relation to the notebooks as objects reveals that in fact it stages a pointed and triumphant diagrammatic sally with the grid. "Subject-cases" articulates specifically, first of all, that the detective story mirrors the grid in its structure—its urban <i>topos</i>, its sequentiality and implied temporality, and its predictable arrangements of repeated objects. Secondly, through the detective story, Stein not only discloses the structure of the grid, but also, through a diagrammatic treatment, subjects it to recombination and rearrangement. Finally, Stein's probing engagement with the grid exposes its political foundations. </p>

<p>Stein's structural interest in the detective story is best summed up in her 1936 lecture, "What Are Master-pieces and Why Are There So Few of Them," in which she claims that "the detective story is . . . the only really modern novel form that has come into existence."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  She attributes its modernity to its reversal of the usual linear progression of plot: "by having the man dead to begin with . . . you have so to speak got rid of the event before the book begins. . . . In real life people are interested in the crime more than they are in detection . . . but in the story it is the detection that holds the interest and that is natural enough because the necessity as far as action is concerned is the dead man . . ." ("MP," 358). She continues this thought with a self-demonstrating joke that again underlines what makes a detective story interesting, the death not only of its pseudo-protagonist but of a particular time-consciousness: "I <i>once said</i> that nothing could bother me more than the way that a thing goes dead <i>once it has been said</i>" ("MP," 361; my emphasis). This "modern" feature of the detective story may seem implausible. After all, the detective story is by definition acutely dependent on plot, more so than any other genre; by extension its temporal structure would seem to be hypertypical. For Stein, though, it is this very dependence, constituting the essential and candid contract between reader and writer, that removes the detective story from the predicament of plot, the elaborate constructedness of which is supposed to remain politely unremarked. This structural legibility makes the detective story peculiarly modern; its "'formulaic' qualities"—"experiments with narrative voice, generic codes, and self-reflexivity"—"constitute less an 'escape from literature' than a foregrounding 

<b></b>

of its very nature."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  The detective story as it progresses is always in the process of analyzing itself, for it is a plot about a plot, and more generically, about plot itself. </p>

<p>This structure makes the detective story a prime candidate for Stein's diagrammatic treatment. The typical detective story has two temporalities that work against each other: the detection narrative progresses while the narrative about "the event"—the death, the culminating incident—regresses. The two narratives hook up at either end; the conclusion of the past event, the death, is what initiates the detection, and the detection ends only when the beginning of the past event has been discovered. The way to stay current in the detection plot is to update the present continuously by counterpoising it—"weigh" and "measure" are recurring terms in "Subject-cases"—against the fragmented pieces of the past event. Stein reminds the reader of this dual temporal scheme throughout "Subject-cases" by emphasizing the broken chronology of the detective plot. She throws its progress into relief through fragments that intimate temporal disjunction, such as, "It was succeeded by, it was before this" ("SC," 8).<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The word that inserts time-consciousness most often and that most succinctly suggests the double temporality of the detective story is "antedate," as in, "The history and beaming, the first article antedating making more than examples" ("SC," 12). The word dominates an entire paragraph but also appears repeatedly throughout the entire text. Through these temporal communiqués, Stein proposes that to read a detective novel is to participate dramatically in narrative presence, an experience of continually uncertain, contingent currency that is distinguished from and marked against the partial, isolated, and dissonant pieces of the past event.  </p>

<p>Besides the temporality required by its plot, Stein unveils and maneuvers other constitutive features of the detective story structure. She mimics the cumulative minutiae of clutter that inhabits the detective story, and the manner in which these "same things" must be constantly arranged and rearranged to form plausible narratives in the minds of the reader and the detective.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  In a conventional detective story, the hard facts that are built up into a reconstruction of the past event must be repeated, because the reappearance of a thing is the clue to its validity. These "same things" also characterize the genre as a whole, making repeat appearances in multiple texts as stock elements: the smoking gun, the dead body, the stolen diamond, the cryptic telegraph, and so on. </p>

<p>"Subject-cases" sets up these features of the same thing with an opening section of clever doggerel, essentially like Stein's fill-in-the-blank <i>carnet</i> game, that introduces the main ingredients of the detective story and the recombinational play of elements central to the process of detection:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In case of this. / A story. / Subjects and places. / In place of this. / A story. / Subjects and traces. / In face of this. / A story. / Subjects and places. / In places of this and in place of this. / A story. / Subject places. / In place of this. / A story. / When the work when the work and when the work when should he work. / In place of this and in place of this and in place of this places. </p>
	<div class="attrib">
	("SC," 3) 

<b></b>
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->


</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This section prepares the reader for increasingly complicated paragraphs of recombination in which the sounds and various grammatical functions of words are exhibited, as in, "Every now and then and when, when every now and then and where . . . very presently and to present it as a present or as present. It is present, and better pleased than before" ("SC," 19). Here the sound of the stock phrase "now and then" is emphasized by the addition of the rhyming word "when," and the different syntactic forms of the word "present" require different pronunciations. Often Stein uses rhyme and simplistic word associations to exhaust the possibilities, aurally and conceptually, of each of the fundamental detective story elements that each paragraph explores—structural components necessary to detective plots such as "agitation," "accident," "periodical," "change," "a station in justice," "direction," and "antedate." The process of word experimentation imitates the continual, recombinational mental activity of detection and glosses pure Steinian diagramming. </p>

<p>Gradually, these paragraphs about plot elements are interrupted more and more frequently by fragments of idiomatic genre speech, as if imported from actual stories. For instance, possible "subject-cases" are introduced, that is, suspects on whom a case could be based—a "he" who "makes music" and "was in love with his wife," a "they" circling around "two," and later "three" and "four" and a "party." Other telling details and phrases appear as well, some of which return and some of which do not, in keeping with the formula's requirement that the reader/detective be occasionally misled: "Corals are again stylish" ("SC," 9), "silver set of course" ("SC," 16), "blinds can be drawn" ("SC," 20), "finders keepers" ("SC," 21), "central baggage" ("SC," 23). Stein never lets us forget (which would force us to rely on the representational faculty of memory) that <i>this</i> detective story is, in effect, a story about a story about a story. Adding another layer of referentiality, Stein also throws in deictic pointers to the text itself and her writing process: the title, of course, forces us to apply the grammatical sense of the subjective or nominative case—the state of being a person or thing—to the gumshoe vocabulary of "subjects" and "cases."  </p>

<p>The piece of idiomatic genre speech that saturates "Subject-cases" most thoroughly is the word "parlor," which is the basis for several especially fervid stretches of verbal orchestration, as in, "So indeed so indeed a parlor settles that. So indeed and so indeed and so indeed and a parlor settles that and so indeed a parlor and so indeed a parlor settles that. A parlor. Indeed, and as to a parlor. Indeed as to the parlor. A parlor settled that" ("SC," 22).<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The last paragraph of Chapter II evokes a climactic feeling by playing at length on the words "at once," calling up both meanings of immediacy and simultaneity; this paragraph is preceded by a paragraph that tells us, "Prepare, kindly prepare the parlor. The parlor is prepared. Kindly antedate it, it is antedated, kindly attend to it, it is attended to . . ." ("SC," 28). The word "parlor" distinctly conjures the all-important setting of the detective story. Moreover, the rhythm of its appearances in Stein's story corresponds to its structural role at the beginning, middle, and end: the crime scene, where the event is committed or discovered; the place to which the detective must continually return in search of clues; and the location of the crime's exegesis, where the detective finally informs the various suspects and witnesses gathered "at once" who 

<b></b>

among them are the real "subject-cases." In that place, the dual temporalities of the story reconnect and the story must end with its conclusive "antedating." </p>

<p>If "antedate" explains the temporal sense of the title's "background," then "parlor" supplies the other, spatial sense: a detective story has a prescribed "background" temporal structure, but also employs a limited set of possible "background" settings. The parlor is one of a number of spaces repeatedly enlisted by the detective story—city spaces such as railway stations, police stations, dark alleys, bare attics, crowded thoroughfares, shabby offices. Such sites, familiar from Edgar Allan Poe to Dashiell Hammett, comprise the standard lexicon of the detective story's usually urban settings, many of which manufacture the feelings of enclosure or vulnerability that can instigate the necessary sense of urgency. But the psychological connotations of particular settings are not their only function; they also have an integral relationship to the plot, because "the plot must appear to be an actual record of events springing from the terrain of its operations . . . the plans and diagrams so often encountered in detective stories aid considerably in this effect."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  City spaces subtend the plot of the detective story and its "modernity," for as G. K. Chesterton observed in 1901, the urban setting offers a pervasive textuality that the detective story is the first to exploit fully: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Of this realization of a great city itself as something wild and obvious the detective story is certainly the "Iliad". . . . A city is, properly speaking, more poetic even than the countryside, for while Nature is a chaos of unconscious forces, a city is a chaos of conscious ones . . . there is no stone in the street and no brick in a wall that is not a deliberate symbol—a message from some man, as much as if it were a telegram or a post-card. . . . Every brick has a human hieroglyph as if it were a graven brick of Babylon; every slate on the roof is as educational a document as if it were a slate covered with addition and subtraction sums.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The city is here rather remarkably described by Chesterton as the incarnation of the visual-textual grid.  </p>

<p>The parlor, in the metropolitan world of the middle class, purports to be removed from the outdoor, public, "wild," and prolix textuality of the urban landscape. In truth, because it is the room traditionally consecrated to conversation (as Stein probably knew, from its roots in the French "parler"), the parlor functions as the domestic space where public and private realms are mediated. It is the space, that is, where the interface between public and private is overtly textualized through specialized language codes: certain conversational modalities and subjects, radio and television broadcasts, the reading of newspapers, mail, and socially acceptable texts such as detective novels. Like the dining room of Stein's 1934 "mystery novel" <i>Blood on the Dining-Room Floor</i>, it is a room for semi-private affairs and semi-public gatherings, where family members and invited guests congregate, especially on formal occasions. The parlor is the privileged place in the grid where public and private surfaces correlate. Stein's own famous "parlor" at 27 rue de Fleurus, where her salons took place, vividly illustrates how the textuality of the public world was mapped on to this space in the interior of the home. Photographs of the room reveal that those walls were covered by the square

shapes of many frames—the Stein art collection, materializing as an uneven geometric gridwork.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Stein's archived papers even include a drawn plan of the placement of her paintings, a picture of the picture grid. (<a href="#2"> 2</a>)  </p>

"References. Begin Now": The Grid's Colonial Background 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>The grid is not only present behind the scenes as the "background" of or to the parlor in "Subject-cases," it is also built right into it, albeit in camouflage. In the text of "Subject-cases," Stein references the fifteen manuscript notebooks containing "Subject-cases," but in ways that make their presence hard to detect. Given that publication was not imminent at the time of the composition of "Subject-cases," the ongoing references to her own writing environment constitute a kind of private investigation.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  These references are among the general class of techniques that Stein often employs to integrate into her text concrete features of her current life and work.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  What distinguishes the references to the manuscript notebooks in "Subject-cases" and the other instances of such incorporation—for instance, in "Natural Phenomena" , "A Bouquet" , and "A Diary" —is that they are prompted by the visual and physical properties of the immediate writing environment, not primarily their linguistic properties.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Perhaps because the novelty of the illustrated notebooks was still remarkable in the first decade or so of her use of them, Stein began to see them as part of the same framework of textuality that she was creating in her writing. Her diagrammatic attention to language-in-motion was catalyzed by the notebooks as textual-visual entities—as, that is, emblems of the grid to be transcribed and transgressed.  </p>

<p>Like postcards or comic strips, the kind of notebooks <small class="caps">s</small>tein used were often produced as serials. The position of each individual notebook within sets and subsets of sequenced topic matter was indicated by signals of serialization: titles, subtitles, numeric ordering, and other visual data pertaining to classification. Such serialization was clearly intended to facilitate collecting. Often, in addition to a topical illustration, a notebook contained extensive written information related to the topic on its inside and back cover. Any one notebook thus constituted a mini-lesson, complete with visual aid; the illustration and informative text were even overtly "authored," with the names of illustrator, engraver, writer, and editor given. To appeal to young consumers and to please their parents, the subject matter of these serials tended to be educational or useful, but also adventurous, exciting, or moving in some way. In short, these notebooks were oriented toward producing patriotic and functional citizens, appropriately socialized men and women with a solid literacy in canonical French culture. They visibly materialized the abstract grid of the knowledge desirable or necessary for successful cultural navigation, intersecting not only with the paper vehicles of entertainment, like newspaper cartoons, serialized stories, and puzzlebooks, but also with the pervasive icons of a carefully organized, nationalized pedagogy. In this context, the title "Subject-cases" takes on yet another level of meaning, for each of the notebooks in which the story is written comprises a case study of a particular subject.

<p>The notebooks containing "Subject-cases," however, seem to have nothing to do with the subject matter of the story. The story does not begin with embedded notebook references.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Nor do the notebook topics and illustrations serve any discernible function integral to the text, for they describe exploration and conquest, scenes from the colonized world and sources of national pride. In contrast to the modern, metropolitan fixations of the detective story, symbolically and structurally centered in the parlor as the site of exchange between public and private urban worlds, the notebooks of "Subject-cases" assemble a territory that is almost exclusively historical, militaristic, non-urban. Cover illustrations depict "men of action," desert scenes, flags, ships, airplanes, and France's colonial adventures in the Congo, Morocco, and Algeria.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Sometimes this territory is overtly political, as in, "France in Morocco, After Six Months of the Protectorate." In other cases, colonial authority is vividly exhibited, as in the disturbing "Measurement of the Natives" illustration depicting a black man up against a wall; one colonial supervisor measures his forehead, another notes the results, and a third looks on. Guns are in the foreground.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  (<a href="#3"> 3</a>) Many of the covers, however, contain illustrations whose political relationships are brought into view by Stein's gathering itself: ancient "Byzantine" domestic architecture becomes ominous next to images of marauding Algerian horsemen; "How to Construct a Model Biplane" becomes protomilitaristic beside illustrations of airplanes flying reconnaissance missions, encamped air squadrons, surveillance kites, and the flags of Napoleonic conquest. The last of the notebooks switches the scene: a picture of eighteenth-century outdoor theater in the Place Dauphine. Clearly, Stein is constructing a counternarrative through the notebook covers, a revelation of the vast military, political, and economic network of empire built up over centuries. If the relationship of these alien "backgrounds" to Stein's detective story seems unclear at first, the final image suggests that those adventures in the colonies boil down to metropolitan political performance, returning us to the detective story's setting. Collectively, the cover illustrations of Stein's notebooks force us into a different kind of detective story in which the evidence is out in the open, an environmental presence so pervasive that it is unlocatable and invisible: the colonial background of the grid. </p>

<p>While this background is, by definition, unrepresentable in standard language, Stein uses her diagrammatic method to cite it. She has three modes of response in the text of "Subject-cases" to the encyclopedic categories of knowledge and colonial mastery represented by her notebooks. The first, most basic mode consists of specific, literal allusions to their texts and illustrations, although her manner of making the connection between them and her own subject is insistently indiscriminate. Sometimes a direct quotation from a notebook text appears that also reinforces a concern of the story.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  More often, however, the references to the notebooks seem crudely pasted into the story's text, with little or no integration.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  These references are the ones that most loudly declaim the acute incongruity of their presence, yet, paradoxically, their obscurity is made less perceptible by the bewildering gradations of digression throughout the text. </p>

<p>The second mode of response is Stein's employment of a metatextual level of commentary on the materiality of the notebooks by frequent recourse to the vocabulary of 

<b></b>

illustration. In these instances the lack of integration is slightly less pronounced, but only because the references are less specific, less obviously alien to the surrounding textual flow. Occasionally her use of this vocabulary is explicit, as when she refers to colors, foregrounds, or, repeatedly, illustration.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Sometimes she seems to be noting the physical properties of the notebook, with long riffs on "paper" ("SC," 17), "tissue paper fairly certain to be inherited" ("SC," 31), and something that is "understood as periodical" ("SC," 7), although here it is not clear whether the word "periodical" originates in Stein's musings about her notebooks' material characteristics or in her dematerializing of the detective story structure. </p>

<p>The third, and most abstract, mode of allusion focuses specifically on this idea of periodization, fundamental to the notebook serials, the structure of the detective story, and the grid itself. Periodization breaks entities up into discrete temporal or material units. It is the disciplining operation of a supervisory power, intended to organize reproducible sequences, but it also unintentionally abets rearrangement. Through de- and re-periodization, Stein most forcefully articulates her diagrammatic interference with 

<b></b>

the order of the grid. The text, for instance, appears to announce the commencement of its notebook references with, "References. Begin now," but in fact this statement comes after a quotation from the "Histoire de l'habitation" notebook—after, that is, references have begun already ("SC," 9). The statement is as misleading as a deliberately planted false clue. What she actually provides is something that works diligently against any preestablished path, for her references in the text to the notebooks do not follow the order of the notebooks, nor do her chosen notebooks represent in any sense a sequence. It seems rather that she has gone to some trouble to detach the notebooks she uses from their original serial arrangements and to reorchestrate them according to the progress of "Subject-cases." In place of the fixed and predetermined spaces of the grid, Stein's order is the order of "at once," of the handwritten line as it takes shape on the page. The notebooks thus contribute to a different kind of "periodization" that reveals the constructedness of the grid, just as the detective story reveals the constructedness of plotted narrative. </p>

<p>Stein herself explicates this diagrammatic "periodization." Following a paragraph that imaginatively pursues the idea of multiple "directions," the words on the page proclaim that <i>something</i> is, "Ineradicable to remain, to possess and to see movements when movements are approachable approachable as if it were undoubted. . . . Ineradicable to remain. <i>What is it</i>. In as it were intentional. And to be presentable. Bows and smiles. Organisation and in time" ("SC," 8; my emphasis). Stein is describing and enacting an itinerant "What" that leaves, follows, and erases its own traces simultaneously, an organizational process that takes place only from the site of its own current time frame. While the specific subject of the description is not named and is therefore in doubt, the subject must be the writing itself—a mobile principle that has to conjure its presence wordlessly. In fact, Stein pledges soon afterwards that, "In this way anything can seem to be read," including, one must assume, references to "backgrounds" that would disappear in any printed version of her text ("SC," 9). Reading is always a case of "seeming" to read, of skimming surfaces, because meaning is always contingent on the local conditions in which a text is embedded. The reading subject, flagrantly missing from this oddly passive construction, is similarly contingent. The "anything"—the text, whatever it may be—is actually what directs the experience. Stein comments on this insistently idiosyncratic order, this de- and re-periodization, in a tone at once reassuring and self-abnegating: "Everything in order, in that order in order that there is no value. There is no value in our having been right. Alright. To ground a ground and on the ground, to be as if it were to be found here and there" ("SC," 15). This order that is "as if it were . . . found here and there," invented to circumvent predetermined values, itself has no value. What it does have is a ground, or rather "backgrounds," even when they are undetectable, barely perceptible, or overlooked. </p>

<p>The fleeting legibility of the notebook "backgrounds" is Stein's wily way of presenting absence; the founding absence that is framed and glimpsed is the trivializing, infantilizing, and normalizing text of colonialism. "Absence" is indeed the telltale symptom of this structure: the structure hides its systematicity and the colonial subjects on whose invisibility its continuation depends. In fact, the metropolitan center connects not only 

<b></b>

to the domestic "private" interior of the parlor, via the ordered and textualized grid of its spatial conration, but by the same route to the unseen marginal excess of the colony. For the grid extends beyond the page, past the printer in the city, past the paper manufacturer in the factory town, all the way to the natural resources and labor on the other side of the ocean. To catch sight of the faint and transient appearance of the grid as a totality is to catch sight of the scaffolding of the otherwise unrepresentable colonial relationship.  </p>

<p>Fredric Jameson describes these "representational effects" of the colonial system as a sort of meaning-blindness: "the mapping of the new imperial world system becomes impossible, since the colonized other who is its essential other component or opposite number has become invisible."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  In contrast to the "loss of meaning" characterizing the industrialization and commodification of the modern metropolis, the loss adhering to the system as a whole is "spatial disjunction."

<p class="continued">Given the detective story's articulation of the grid and its modern narrative structure, it is not a surprise that Jameson's thoughts about the visual space of modernism were initiated in an essay on the detective novelist Raymond Chandler.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Nor is it surprising that they were originally prompted by Stein's 1934 lecture, "What Is English Literature." Jameson notes Stein's observation that, in England, </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>If you live a daily life and it is all yours, and you come to own everything outside your daily life besides and it is all yours, you naturally begin to explain. You naturally continue describing your daily life which is all yours, and you naturally begin to explain how you own everything besides. You naturally begin to explain that to yourself and you naturally begin to explain it to those living your daily life who own it with you, everything outside, and you naturally explain it in a kind of way to some of those whom you own.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">"Some of those whom you own": the laissez-faire texture of Stein's actual politics warns us that her unveiling exploits with the lines and blank spaces of the grid should not be understood as a technique she developed in order to challenge global imperialism, the militaristic use of technology that enabled it, or its inherent violence, although all of these features are depicted in the notebooks of "Subject-cases."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Her remark about the proprietary relationships that define daily English life is shocking for its casual tone; she dryly conveys the "naturalness" of this arrangement. Her perceptions register a stark analysis, embellished with the performative cleverness that often characterizes her work: "can you see what I see." Through her continuous, contingent, and exploratory approach to looking at the everyday world and her own experiences, she has come 

<b></b>

to see the grid as a system, enabling her to make a coded but trenchant observation about its deadly games. </p>

<p>Stein's references to the imperialist discourse of her notebooks register a recognition of this context. Her "kind of way" of explaining it is both more and less explicit than that of a properly modernist style, according to Jameson, who claims such styles mark the "unrepresentable totality" through a "new spatial language" ("MI," 58). Her diagrammatic deployment of language turns words into things, but by integrating the actual terms of the grid into her diagrams, she essentially turns things—the commodities that are the form and content of colonial circulation—back into words. The maligned, beloved, and abused realist object that modernism seeks to expunge is really only redefined. The thing in question is no longer the thing represented in the text, but the text itself. Such is the sense of the book as commodity suggested by the term "pulp fiction," a narrative genre defined by its paper content.  </p>

<p>Paradoxically, the detective story genre is an ingenious screen on to which to project the colonial relationship precisely because its purview is so insistently parochial, and because it is so densely cluttered with its own set of "same things"—its own repertoire of commodities, those false symptoms of a realist environment. As Stein says of the detective story, the process that starts with "somebody being dead" continues to "move along" so that the absences and presences of the grid unroll in a reading present that is commensurate with the textual thing.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  The scenes of national identity and its transnational attachments that decorate the covers of Stein's "Subject-cases" notebooks, seemingly so remote from their detective story subject, are in fact not simply <i>coincident with</i> but <i>constitutive of</i> it. Her transmogrifying linguistic recombinations are not "beyond all point of view," as Jameson says of Joyce ("MI," 62); they are instead manifestations of the invisible ink of the grid, in which all points of view are eventually contacted and connected. </p>

<p>North Africa may seem a long way from "cuddle"'s kitchen <i>carnet</i>, her salon/"parlor" and the other focal points of Parisian domesticity, but indeed, as the regulatory paradigm of Western cultural and epistemological power, the grid is designed to conceal its own links. Stein points out those unmentionable lines and spaces, evacuates them of the usual categorical meanings and fills them with words that act as the agents of concrete experience. It is perhaps inevitable that her diagrammatic digging eventually bumps up against the political matrix in which the visual-textual grid is embedded. From its margins to its center, the grid is the background through which we need to read Stein, to appreciate fully the perverse reversals of her diagrams.  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT8" href="#REF8">8</a>. The "pictorial turn," referring to the visual preoccupations of postmodern philosophy, is W. J. T. Mitchell's term. I would argue, however, that such a turn actually dates back to photography, the distinctive phase of popular print culture that it initiated, and consequently the new varieties of visual conceptualization that it offered. Forms of visual-textual integration in print culture certainly predate the nineteenth century. Intaglio and relief methods of printing images were both reproducible and potentially coterminous with printed and engraved text. However, not until the advent of photography and the related technological advances in printing could image and text become truly unified and in a sense indistinguishable within a single visual paradigm. See W. J. T. Mitchell, <i>Picture Theory</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994) and, for his expanded view of visuality which I have adopted, <i>Iconology: Image, Text, Discourse</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986); also, Jonathan Crary, <i>Techniques of the Observer: On Vision and Modernity in the Nineteenth Century</i> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1990) and <i>Suspension of Perception: Attention, Spectacle, and Modern Culture</i> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1999).

The city, in Europe and the Americas, underwent unprecedented population growth and related geographic expansion beginning in the 1820s. Thus, while the geometry of the nineteenth-century city can be seen, in some respects, as an extension of the principles of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment that had structured urban space and architecture for centuries, the new "great city urbanism" of the nineteenth century required entirely new kinds of planning—not just of city surfaces but of public works and services, policing, population control, and "hygiene"—and, consequently, new theories of urban space.

<p><a name="FOOT12" href="#REF12">12</a>. Long before the nineteenth century, of course, the textual order of print had crossed the threshold of the newsstand, library, school, gallery, theater, office, shop, church, home, and coffeehouse into the urban outdoors, by way of posted announcements and signs; during the eighteenth century, for example, European and American public and private spaces were increasingly interconnected through the circulation of print, aided by an economy of reproduction based on the engravings of paintings. In the mid-nineteenth century, however, the sheer number of textualized surfaces expanded, due to the new printing technologies and the more numerous applications for their use, in domestic, educational, commercial, and civic settings. For similar reasons, textualized surfaces also acquired more regularized appearances, which coincided with other forms of the regularization of visible space, particularly in the urban environment. On the history of the newspaper and periodical press in the eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, and its connection to political change, public opinion, and definitions of reading, subjectivity and citizenship, see Hannah Barker, <i>Newspapers, Politics and English Society, 1695–1855</i> (New York: Longman, 2000), Charles E.

<p><a name="FOOT16" href="#REF16">16</a>. A thorough survey of all the notebooks and Stein's idiosyncratic compositional methods in them would here be impracticable. Suffice it to say that, in the earlier type of notebook, Stein employs a variety of writing practices that seem to recognize the physical boundaries of the notebook and the lines that fundamentally structure the grid. Note, for example, the way she addresses her writing surface in <i>The Making of Americans</i> in place of the reader: "Truly I never feel it that there ever can be for me any such creature, no it is this scribbled and dirty and lined paper that is really to be to me always my receiver." <i>The Making of Americans</i> (New York: Something Else Press, 1966), 33. In other instances, Stein seems to work deliberately against the grid. She developed an unusual habit of filling the notebook only on the recto of every page, then flipping the book over to fill every verso; she would fill a notebook with multiple different texts in this manner, which then sometimes required splitting a single text among several notebooks, instead of simply starting a new text in a new notebook. She had a way of crossing things out that was sometimes indistinguishable from underlining. Her own lineation, at times "poetic" and at times in paragraph form, seems to have no consistent relationship to page boundaries or surface markings, and at the same time seems based on no discernible "literary" system. That is, Stein's lineation indicates not only her patent disregard for the conceptual distinctions between prose and poetry and her general program of genre disruption, but also a refusal to supply or obey the potential markers of such distinctions on paper (for instance by beginning a new "poetic" section within a "prose" piece on a new page, or drawing a line between sections or skipping a space)—a striking lack of distinction that is broadly consistent with her custom of combining different texts within one notebook. Ulla Dydo broadly outlines the status of the <i>carnets</i> and <i>cahiers</i> in "Reading the Hand Writing: The Manuscripts of Gertrude Stein," in <i>A Gertrude Stein Companion: Content with the Example</i>, ed. Bruce Kellner (New York: Greenwood Press, 1988), 84–95. She argues that the manuscript notebooks probably do not represent first drafts, but that between the <i>carnet</i> notes and the <i>cahier</i> versions, there must have been other notes or notebooks. Dydo also considers that the <i>carnets</i>, noting the various kinds of lists, doodles, and so on that they contained, are useful for establishing a personal context for some of Stein's writings, but that probably most of them were destroyed and that the few bequeathed to the Yale archive were left unintentionally—implying that the information they could collectively provide about Stein's compositional practice is limited. Nevertheless, it would be unwise to conclude that critics should dismiss the possibility of finding in the <i>carnets</i> some relationship in them to Stein's finished texts simply because the majority of them are probably missing; it also seems that to regard the writing in the <i>cahiers</i> as fair copies would be a mistake, for as Dydo herself notes, Stein not only copied into them but also composed new writing in them to "continue or complete her pieces" (Dydo in <i>A Gertrude Stein </i>Companion, 85). In any case, my argument that the notebooks, generally speaking, provide evidence that Stein's diagrammatic structure is in part a response to the grid does not depend on the particular stage of writing they represent.  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT20" href="#REF20">20</a>. Landon, "'Not Solve It But Be In It'" in <i>American Literature</i> 53:3, 488. "Subject-cases" dates from ten years before the period when Stein began to make frequent use of detective story conventions in her writing and as a pointed topic of reflection about her writing. Her recourse to the detective-story form in this text, then, could not have been habitual; rather, in all likelihood, "Subject-cases" instigated her later attraction. Landon points out that Stein was an avid reader of detective stories. The genre receives a great deal of attention in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>  and <i>The Geographical History of America</i> . In addition, Stein wrote a detective "novel" in 1934 called <i>Blood on the Dining-Room Floor</i>, gave a lecture in Chicago collected in <i>Narration</i>  called "The Audience and the Novel and the Mystery Story as Narrative," discussed detective stories in the 1936 "What Are Master-pieces and Why Are There So Few of Them," provided a short piece for <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> in 1937 called "Why I Like Detective Stories," and in 1944 wrote a short play about a murder called "Three Sisters Who Are Not Sisters," published in <i>The First Reader</i> , which was based on a "film" written in 1929 called "Deux Soeurs Qui Ne Sont Pas Soeurs" and published in <i>Operas and Plays</i> . "Subject-Cases," therefore, was written well before Stein's interest in the genre reached its height in the 1930s, a time that corresponded with the "golden age" of detective fiction. This "golden age" came after the "clue puzzle books" of the early 1900s, which mimicked the genre of fill-in-the-blank game books, and before the division of the detective story into national subgenres, as described in Raymond Chandler's 1949 essay "The Simple Art of Murder." </p>

Henceforth abbreviated "MP." This lecture, given at Oxford and Cambridge in 1936, was directly the result of Stein's own recent authorial fame and begins with deliberations on the inadequacy of oratory as a form that will produce masterpieces. Thus it is paradoxically caught up in the drama of authorial identity that it is also an attempt to discredit, for her goal here, echoing her concerns in <i>The Geographical History of America</i> , is to make a case against "human nature" and identity in the creation of masterpieces, i.e. work that is original. Identity must be forgotten in the act of creation because, "At any moment when you are you you are you without the memory of yourself because if you remember yourself while you are you you are not for purposes of creating you . . . [master-pieces] are knowing that there is no identity and producing while identity is not" ("MP," 356–60). Indeed, while a masterpiece must be <i>about</i> identity and time, it cannot be written from inside the consciousness of those circumstances, nor can it betray any awareness of them: "master-pieces have no more time than they have identity although time like identity is what they concern themselves about . . . " ("MP," 361). As genre fiction, the detective story avoids the trap of identity because it must deliberately occlude the author's personality, except for the minor style variations permitted within the limited genre repertoire ("MP," 358).  </p>

Phrases such as, "In exchange for rooms" ("SC," 7) and, "Let there then be reasonably a history of habitations" ("SC," 7) remind us of the general category of rooms, and the parlor itself recurs throughout the story periodically, in phrases such as, "Preferences, accepted as parlors as parlors are private" ("SC," 13), "so much for the use of a parlor" ("SC," 21), and "A parlor for consent" ("SC," 23).  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT29" href="#REF29">29</a>. It is impossible to know if Stein intended "Subject-cases" to be published, or if she thought it was publishable. This fundamental uncertainty means that it is difficult to know how to regard the status of the notebooks: if she accepted that the work was unpublishable, perhaps we can consider its form in the notebooks to be definitive. In the absence of the nineteenth-century practice of handwritten document exchange that provided a limited public for "private" manuscripts, notebooks like Stein's, we have to assume, would have gone largely unread. So the coded ways in which Stein actually refers to these notebooks in the text of "Subject-cases" are twice as ambivalent.  </p>

"When and where are obelisks washed and arches" alludes to the arches in the picture of "Byzance" in the "habitations" notebook, and perhaps to the implied outcome of the flags notebook that follows it, i.e., the obelisk of the Place de la Concorde ("SC," 9). </p>

<b>Abstract</b>
<p>Three enigmas confront Bloom near the end of "Ithaca." The first is "self-imposed" ("the cause of  a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the sentient material of a strainveined timber table"); the second is self-involved ("Who is M'Intosh?"); the third is self-evident ("Where was Moses when the lights went out?"). Only the self-involved enigma remains unsolved, by Bloom at least, leading us to suspect that there are certain mysteries that are—narratively as well as existentially—best left unanswered. This essay explores why this should be so.</p>

<p class="continued">Even though—or perhaps <i>because</i>—so many questions remain unanswered in our own lives, we hold the novel to a higher standard of answerability. Fiction should not only represent life, but account for it, explain it, that is, endow it with a plausible and self-consistent form. With the impertinence of the modernist, Joyce plays on those expectations of the novel without fulfilling them in <i>Ulysses</i>, a work richly detailed, and hence highly susceptible to inadvertent error. Joyce converted susceptibility to his advantage, mischievously claiming that he staked his immortality on professorial eagerness to solve or dispatch the anomalies, puzzles, and enigmas that compromise the reputation of the novel as a plausible representation of human life.  </p>

<p>One need not, however, be a professor to busy oneself with the problem of what might have been meant by the unanswered questions that trouble our understanding of Joyce's work. Resolving the contradictions, anomalies, and enigmas that undermine the novel's authority and credibility is a favorite literary pastime for both professors and lay readers; a game, for example, played with commendable good humor by John Sutherland in his enjoyable books on the subject, <i>Is Heathcliff a Murderer? </i>and <i>Can Jane Eyre Be Happy?</i>. What Sutherland calls "literary brain-teasers" run from questions about vital missing details, such as "Is Daniel Deronda circumcised?" or "Is Black Beauty gelded?", to more morally vexed questions, such as the source of Sir Bertram's wealth in <i>Mansfield Park</i>, whether Alex D'Urberville is a rapist, or what Edward Hyde looks like.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Then there are the questions 

<b></b>

that we ask without hope of a final answer, questions that concern (or try to imagine) the afterlife of fictional characters, of which "Can Jane Eyre be happy?" is a pointed example. <i>Ulysses </i>abounds, purposively so, in such questions. Many of them have not lost their power to irritate the literal-minded reader. I suspect wide, lingering dissatisfaction with all the solutions offered to the question of what "U.p: up" really refers to.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Many questions are unlikely ever to be satisfactorily resolved: Does Stephen, centrifugal departer, disappear for good into the June night or does he return to take up, if not residence, at least a relationship, with Bloom, and begin a course of a mutually beneficial instruction for and by Molly? Do Leopold and Molly ever resume marital relations? These are questions the novel leaves open and one can only pray that no one in the foreseeable future will try to answer them by writing a sequel.  </p>

<p>I agree with Sutherland that, however far-fetched the solutions he or his readers offer, these questions are good questions.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  They uphold the honor of the novel in the court of verisimilitude. I would even go farther and insist that what makes them such good questions is that they can never be definitely or definitively answered. In <i>Ulysses</i>, unanswered questions awaken us to a different, more exciting sense of the novel's realism. To pursue this point, I want to attend to the question lurking behind or beneath these enigmas and puzzles; namely, why such puzzles should remain unsolved in a novel that Joyce himself described as an encyclopedic narrative of human life in which the myth of the <i>Odyssey</i> is rendered, as he revealed in a letter to Carlo Linati, <i>sub specie temporis nostri</i>.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>   </p>

<p>I begin my own speculation, not so much with a dagger definition, as with a pointed etymology—the common linguistic heritage of question and quest. Both words descend from the same linguistic root—<i>questia.</i> Their kinship tells us that asking and seeking are comparable activities, allied modes of venturing out into the unknown world in which the human drama of becoming must be played out. Both the quest and the question, to adapt the language of Stephen Dedalus, are ways of finding in the world without as actual what is in the world within as possible (<i>U</i>, 175). This helps explain why Joyce ends the male narrative of his modern quest epic with the most formal and systematic mode of questioning—the impersonal catechism. It is a mode that firmly holds that questions it asks not only need, but have, definite answers, since they address the most urgent and solemn of human concerns.  </p>

<p>This expectation is coded in the linguistic as well as theological root of catechism, <i>kata echien</i>, to sound thoroughly. The Catechism of the Council of Trent enshrines this etymology as a point of church doctrine when it proclaims that "faith comes by hearing." It is clear, the Counter-Reformation church fathers assert, "how necessary at all times for the attainment of eternal salvation has been the labour and faithful ministry of an authorised teacher; for it is written, how they shall hear, without a preacher? And how shall they preach unless they be sent?"<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  By their fruits you shall know them and the true prophet is known by the answers he provides to the supreme questions posed by the Creation—the end of man, the nature of God, and the terms of the Last Judgment. The technic Joyce thought most suitable for concluding the novel's male odyssey pays homage to that deep identity between the desired end of homecoming—Ithaca—and 

<b></b>

finding or supplying an answer to a question, indeed a series of questions, whose answers about the end of man and the meaning of the Creation are found, in retrospective rearrangement, to have been known all along.  </p>

<p>According to this deep identity, the motion of a life and of a narrative is ended not by the finality of death, but by reaching, or returning to, that Ithaca of the mind where all questions we have asked of Life are at last answered. The anxiety about concluding that overtakes Bloom toward the end of "Ithaca" is precisely the anxiety sown by questions for which answers need to be found. These questions take the form of three enigmas that confront Bloom, "about to rise in order to go so as to conclude lest he should not conclude" (<i>U</i>, 599), near the end of "Ithaca" and of his own long day's journey into night. The first question is "self-imposed": it relates to "the cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the insentient material of a strainveined timber table" (<i>U</i>, 599). In <i>Ulysses Annotated</i>, that treasured answer book for all steadfast Joycean puzzle solvers, Don Gifford obligingly solves this particular enigma by referring us to the corresponding moment in the <i>Odyssey</i> when Odysseus, having successfully strung his bow, is about to slaughter the suitors. A clap of thunder signals Zeus's sanction for the catastrophic punishment to be meted out. Gifford, alert to historical as well as mythical counterparts, goes on to report a similar incident in the life of Carl Gustav Jung. In his <i>Memories, Dreams, Reflections </i>, Jung relates how in the summer of 1898 he heard two loud cracks emitted by furniture that "wiped out all my earlier philosophy and made it possible for me to achieve a psychological point of view" (<i>UA</i>, 602). This is an intriguing but not immediately helpful solution to the enigma, for it still leaves the problem of determining the precise or even general relation between the "loud lone crack" issuing from a "strainveined timber table" and the divine thunderclap that is the most potent form of godspeech. More perplexing—and worth pursuing—is the question of why Joyce would designate such enigmas as self-imposed. </p>

<p>I think it is fair to claim that the allure of this self-imposed enigma, for the catechizer and for the reader, if not for Bloom himself, is not in the difficulty of its material solution, but in its indeterminate but real value as a novelistic sign. The crack is a symbolic confirmation of Bloom's worthiness to serve as a surrogate Odysseus for modern times, times in which the gods are scandalously silent. The self-imposition to which the catechizer refers may be of the ecclesiastical kind, a confirmation or ordination effected by the imposing or placing on of hands. This self-imposed enigma, then, is accidentally about what makes furniture groan or, as Gifford would have it, why thunder should sound out of a cloudless sky. More critically, it raises a question about Bloom's placement, in this instance his favorable placement in the schemes of the god-author who here seems to be vouching for his stature as a classical hero. We will see in a moment why placement is always among the first questions the novel must consider in its disposition of people, places, and things.  </p>

<p>A different, if related, perplexity concerning place attends the third of these questions that Bloom puts to himself: "What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30 years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?" Answer: "Where was 

<b></b>

Moses when the candle went out?" (<i>U</i>, 600). Gifford, again obligingly, supplies us with Bloom's answer to the enigma—"In the dark"—but supplements this answer with two amusing variants from street rhymes dating from the early twentieth century: "Down in the cellar with his shirt tail out," and "Down in the cellar eating sauerkraut" (<i>UA</i>, 602). Even if Bloom has finally solved the enigma he has pondered intermittently for over thirty years, surely it shouldn't have taken him three decades to arrive at a solution that a street urchin could improvise in the course of a morning's play. This is one of the rare moments in <i>Ulysses</i> when Bloom strikes me as positively idiotic in his mental meanderings. Is there something about the self-evident that eludes or defeats Bloom's mind, which is characterized on our first introduction to him as at once kindly and curious (<i>U</i>, 45)—an ideal moral combination to my mind? Perhaps the self-evident is so baffling to him precisely because the solution—like himself—remains <i>too</i> close to home. </p>

<p>Whatever the reason, his consideration of this enigma does not show up Bloom's intelligence in a particularly flattering light. Moreover, the solution Bloom suddenly apprehends is less imaginative and pleasing, although technically more correct, than the iconoclastic street rhyme answers to Moses's whereabouts. These solutions are more Joycean in the irreverent fun they indulge; they cleverly work in local color, putting Moses, not, as Bloom does, in the generic dark, but in the cellar, his shirt-tail out or eating sauerkraut. (Of course such cheeky answers would be incorrect on other grounds, since they would take us out of the realm of the self-evident into the murkier world of the self-invented.) Aside from its transparently silly tribute to the logical property of self-evidence, this enigma, too, poses a question about placement, the all-important question of where one is found out—in the dark, indeed, with or without one's shirt tail out.  </p>

<p>Neither the first or third enigma radically challenges the mind of the catechumen who responds on Bloom's behalf—or, more precisely, on behalf of the narrative itself, for I take it that in the impersonal catechism of "Ithaca," <i>Ulysses</i> seems to be questioning itself. More importantly, neither question opens up a space for a question to expand and metamorphose into a quest. It would seem that self-imposed and self-evident enigmas cannot generate and sustain purposive mental or narrative movement. They fix our sense of place rather than unsettle and enlarge it. They are the least urgent of questions, since we know in asking them that, even if they are answered to our complete satisfaction, we will not be any more advanced down an interesting path than we were before we asked them. Questions with predetermined or self-evident answers constrain rather than release the mind to discover its own way into reality. Such constraints can have grave consequences. In his remarkable study, <i>Crowds and Power, </i>Elias Canetti observes, rather alarmingly, that "even in normal circumstances, an answer restricts the movements of the person who gives it; he has to abide by it; it forces him to take up a fixed position and to remain there, whereas his questioner can shoot at him from anywhere, changing his position as it suits him."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Indeed, it is arguable that the Catechism is the anti-narrative form par excellence, since its structure as well as purpose foreclose all possibilities of error and improvisation. 

<b></b>

Yet it is the errant soul, motivated by the human, often heretical, desire to explore and extend the boundaries of its physical and social existence that the classical novel since <i>Don Quixote</i> has celebrated. The novel is the special preserve for errant beings who must wander through the wilderness of the mistaken and misbegotten answer until they arrive at that promised land where the paths of error lead to truth. In <i>Ulysses</i>, Stephen Dedalus claims that this capacity for fateful and productive error is the attribute of genius. In trying to reconcile the known and limited facts of Shakespeare's life with the profound knowledge of human life bodied forth in his plays, Stephen insists, against much protest, that for Shakespeare, all errors "are volitional and are the portals of discovery" (<i>U</i>, 156).  </p>

<p>The novel, then, is a form which not only admits, but encourages, error as a way of arriving at undiscovered truths, new or forgotten realities. Only then can its characters find in the world without what is in their world within as possible: "<i>If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend" </i>(<i>U</i>, 175). Identity is coinvolved with movement through, and position within, space. To solve the mystery of human identity is thus to ask a question about place. Identity and place, as Canetti observes, are the original questions we put to any living thing as a way of gaining knowledge of it:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The first question concerns identity, the second is about place. Since both presuppose speech, one is led to ask whether there was an original situation which preceded this verbal questioning and corresponded to it. If there was, place and identity must have coincided in it, for one without the other would be meaningless. Such a situation existed, and still exists; it is the hesitant examination of prey. "Who are you? Are you good to eat?" An animal, which is continually in search of food, touches and sniffs at everything it finds, and sticks its nose into everything: "What is this? Is it something to eat? What does it taste like?" The answer is a smell and either a movement or a lifeless rigidity. The strange body is simultaneously also a place; by smelling and touching it the animal makes itself at home with and in it; translated into our terms, it names it.</p>

<p class="continued">Canetti later remarks that these primary questions retain their importance in the most routine questioning of the citizen in the modern state: "the first official question a man is asked is his name, the second is his address. These, as we have seen, are the two oldest questions, those concerning identity and place" (<i>C</i>, 289). Identity, according to Canetti, may be the first and oldest of questions, but it is the middle and central term in Bloom's triad of enigmas: "What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?" Response: "Who was M'Intosh?" (<i>U</i>, 600).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> </p>

<p>This is the only enigma that remains without any proposed (even if banal, deficient, or unsatisfactory) solution. Ask a question about identity, Joyce seems to be saying, and you only generate more questions. Still, the pursuit for answers compels us to turn once more to Gifford, who refers us to the "Circe" episode where Bloom is accused by The Man in the Macintosh of being "Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser" (<i>U</i>, 395). Bloom's incendiary identity as the world's greatest reformer is temporarily amalgamated, according to Gifford, to that of the notorious "John M'Intosh who made 

<b></b>

gunpowder and kept a secret arsenal for Robert Emmet and who was taken by Major Sirr when the location of his powder manufactory was revealed by an accidental explosion" (<i>UA</i>, 476). Detailed and helpful as this answer is, it is not <i>involved </i>enough; it only unfolds one layer of Bloom's multilayered identity. Puzzling out the question of who The Man in the Macintosh may be leads to the more general question "What's in a name?" We soon find how much and how little a name is able to answer questions about who is who and what is what. As a hostile spectator of Bloom's civic fantasies in "Circe," The Man in the Macintosh claims that Leopold M'Intosh's real name is Higgins; a human and printer's error will lead to his being identified as M'Intosh in the newspaper account of Dignam's funeral, the same report in which Bloom's own name is misspelled as L. Boom. M'Intosh's identity is thus one of the unassimilated residues of the day, a free radical of the novel's physical body that takes up no confirmed identity or fixed location.  </p>

<p>"Who is M'Intosh?" is one of the few questions which the otherwise relentless and apparently omniscient catechizer fails to pursue to its logical limits until satisfied by an answer. This uncharacteristic laxity needs—and rewards—attending to. Why doesn't the catechizer ask a follow-up question, as he has shown himself so willing to do in just about every other instance? Perhaps even the catechizer comes to appreciate that some questions may not have answers; perhaps he has never had any real interest in the answers he receives, only in asking questions until the last dot—literally—of his appointed time as the narrator of the chapter. The inability or refusal to settle this question about M'Intosh suggests that there are certain mysteries that are, narratively as well as spiritually, best left unanswered.  </p>

<p>It is not immediately apparent why this should be so. Questions, Canetti contends, "are intended to be answered; those which are not answered are like arrows shot into the air" (<i>C</i>, 285). I find Canetti's re of arrows shot into the air somewhat unnerving. Of course, an arrow may eventually land in a place of little or no importance, but land it must. I do not like not knowing where that will be. The consequences of the free floating question are even more difficult to track, harder still to pin down. Hence its novelistic claim, even unpleasant demand, on our attention. The unanswered question mobilizes the vagabond force of contingency and uncertainty. If we don't control the course of the question, if we allow the question to pursue, unchecked, an errant or aberrant trajectory, then it exposes us to the violence of an answer we may not be prepared to accept or even survive. To link the question with unleashed violence is not my hyperbole, but Canetti's carefully considered metaphor. All questioning, he asserts, constitutes a forcible intrusion, even the morally productive questioning of Socratic dialogue. "When used as an instrument of power," he writes, </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>it is like a knife cutting into the flesh of the victim. The questioner knows what there is to find, but he wants actually to touch it and bring it to light. He sets to work on the internal organs with the sureness of a surgeon. But he is a special kind of surgeon, one who keeps his victim alive in order to find out more about him and, instead of anaesthetizing, deliberately stimulates pain in certain organs in order to find out what he wants to know about the rest of the body. (<i>C</i>, 284–85)

<p class="continued"><i>Ulysses</i>'s self-involved enigmas and mysteries complicate our understanding of questioning as a form of power and an act of intrusion, since what is involved in such questions is some sort of violence against the body, to adopt Canetti's image, of experience itself.  </p>

<p>By leaving some questions unanswered <i>Ulysses</i> seems to be exploring the permissible and even impermissible limits of its peripatetic form, to be seeking ways to elude or pry open the question that, if answered directly, would put an end to questing. The impatience with questions whose solution is either too difficult or too easy is a marked feature of modern fictions generally. In <i>The Years</i> Virginia Woolf has Peggy Pargiter fondly complain about her aunt Eleanor: "The things she wants explained … are either as simple as two and two make four or so difficult that nobody in the world knows the answer."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Peggy has a markedly scientific temperament and so objects to questions that collapse the distance between the simple and the insoluble, or in the language of the catechizer, between the self-evident and the self-involved enigma. She prefers to occupy the middle distance in which questions are difficult enough to challenge the mind, but not so as to defy solution. Yet Woolf herself does not yield to this impatience with unanswerable questions. She quickly takes us into Eleanor's mind. Once inside, we begin to appreciate the unavoidability, as well as the everydayness, of questions that address the mysteries of identity and place: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Where does she begin, and where do I end? she thought …. On they drove. They were two living people, driving across London; two sparks of life enclosed in two separate bodies; and those sparks of life enclosed in two separate bodies are at this moment, she thought, driving past a picture palace. But what is this moment: and what are we? The puzzle was too difficult for her to solve it.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The puzzle of what we are, the puzzle of identity, involves the puzzle of where we end and other people begin, a puzzle about the boundaries of place. These are difficult puzzles without obvious or even possible solutions, but these are precisely the questions, Woolf implies, the novel must ask. If they are not entertained by the novel, where else can we seek and hope NOT to find definitive answers to the questions we put to ourselves about who we are, both in ourselves and in our relation to other people?<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> </p>

<p>Let me suggest that we identify, in the idiomatic manner of Bloom, these unanswered questions as the perennial questions. Perennial questions, by definition questions that recur without respite, are questions that preoccupy and often confound us because we can neither answer nor refrain from asking them. We feel that not to ask them is to forfeit something of our nature as errant, questing beings. Perennial questions never admit to definitive answers, but encourage us to devise solutions that answer to our own specific needs and ends. They concern two kinds of perplexity equally but differently generative of narrative movement and mystery.  </p>

<p>The first are questions that address the mysteries of human relationships whose instrinsic volatility gives us little real hope of permanent solution. Of this type, questions involving connubial relations distinguish themselves as the most persistent and intractable. A familiar and representative instance is the "domestic problem [which] as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his [Bloom's] mind": "What to do with our wives" (<i>U</i>, 561). Bloom returns to this question in the presence, if not in 

<b></b>

the hearing, of Stephen, the least likely person capable of answering it. Earlier in the day, as he glances at the people around him attending Mass in "Lotus Eaters," he had asked a perennial question of a more civic and spiritual order: "Who is my neighbour?" (<i>U</i>, 66). Bloom is echoing the question the lawyer posed to trap Jesus, asking him what he needs to do to gain eternal life. Jesus invites him to answer his own question: "You shall love the Lord your God … and your neighbor as yourself." But the lawyer, being a lawyer, asks a follow-up question: "And who is my neighbor?" (Luke 10:25–29). For Simone de Beauvoir, Christ's answer is exemplary: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>When the disciples asked Christ, "Who is my neighbor?" Christ did not respond with a list. He told the parable of the good Samaritan. The neighbor of the man abandoned on the road was the one who covered him with his coat and came to his aid: one <i>is</i> not the neighbor of anyone, one <i>makes</i> another a neighbor through an act.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">"Who is my neighbor?" is a question in constant need of new answers, none of which, by the very nature of the question, may ever be final. "Who is my neighbor?" is a perennial question because its answer can only be forged anew in the conscience of a soul or of a race; it is a perennial question because the answer it solicits must be performed as well as thought. The parable, de Beauvoir alerts us, is thus an ideal form for unanswered questions, since its meaning is never fixed. </p>

<p>The second order of questions are those for which answers cannot be made or found—these are questions that simply must be endured. The primary question of this order addresses "love's bitter mystery" and it is posed by the disconsolate and wretched Stephen as he recalls the scene of his mother's deathbed: "She was crying in her wretched bed. For those words, Stephen: love's bitter mystery." Stephen responds to this distressing memory with an even more distressing question: "Where now?" (<i>U</i>, 8). Stephen's question, the question known to all who have experienced grief, simultaneously encompasses the mystery of identity and of place. The whereabouts of his mother is allied to the question of what she has become. She has suffered a change of substance, hence a change of identity; she has become, as the cliché chillingly reminds us, a ghost of her former self. Is her phantom haunting some nether realm or has she found a ghostly dwelling in the penumbra of human consciousness where the dead exist, if they exist at all? </p>

<p>Stephen initially seeks answers to the whereabouts of his dead mother in  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[h]er secrets: old featherfans, tasseled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl.

<p class="continued">
Stephen, rummaging through his mother's "secrets," hopes to unlock the riddle of her girlish past and womanly existence. But the enigma of her life and death does not yield itself to his memory and he can only conclude that her life is "folded away in the memory of nature with her toys" (<i>U</i>, 9). Secreted within these double folds of phantasmal mirth and memory is the germ of a pun: involve—in + <i>volvere</i>, to roll or fold in. This image evoked in response to the pangs of "love's bitter mystery" seems to prepare for the self-involved enigma that will be posed, with phanstasmal mirth, in "Ithaca," when Bloom asks, "Who is M'Intosh?" Both the dead mother and the phantom re persist in the mind as ghosts, with neither the identity nor the place accorded all settled living creatures.  </p>

<p>Whether or not Stephen's question—"where now?"—has an answer, it does have a future, foreshadowing as it does the last question the novel will ask of its peripatetic, errant hero, Bloom—"Where?" (<i>U</i>, 607). Gifford reminds us that in the first, as in the critical, edition, the "answer" to this question took the form of a large black dot, signifying, as Gifford writes, "the Q.E.D. (that which was to be proved)" (<i>UA</i>, 606). But what exactly is being demonstrated as Bloom falls off into sleep, dissolving and recombining his own nature with the mythic heroes and elements out of which he once emerged? The dot may logically as well as narratively conclude the novel's male odyssey, but it does so only by ending, decisively and paradoxically, on an unresolved question. To the question "Where?" the narrative can only provide a dot indicating that a sequence or a thought has been completed. Where does that leave us? Here and there, everywhere and nowhere—another enigma indeed. Concluding with such an indefinite sense of place, the narrative leaves us with an equally uncertain sense of identity. Bloom is a character who remains metamorphic, elusive, unconcluded, in transit still. </p>

<p>The perennial questions of life and death, identity and place, are questions that do not end with a life, but only with the end of Creation itself. We can appreciate this by comparing it to another question Stephen puts to himself, in an equally bitter mood in "Scylla and Charybdis" as he internally questions the ties between father and son: "What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut." This catechetical question is then followed by a genuine one (Stephen, like Bloom, is adept at answering his own questions): "Am I a father? If I were?" (<i>U</i>, 171). Two things are worth noting about these questions: 1) that these are precisely the questions about the conditions and consequences of fatherhood that motivate the father-son plot of <i>Ulysses;</i> 2) that if transposed into the female key, these questions would never preoccupy a woman for more than a few months. Do men entertain different secrets, search out different mysteries than women, and are the answers they tentatively formulate substantially different? Is there a difference in the kinds of questions women put to the world and to themselves? </p>

<p>Molly, to whom we might put this question, in fact asks many questions, but when she does, they veer off like arrows shot into the air. My favorite is the question she asks as she looks down on her husband, recumbent beside her, and wonders, "is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it" (<i>U</i>, 610). Shrewd, indomitable, downright, and self-affirming Molly—who else could translate the question of identity and place into 

<b></b>

such plain words? Who else could condense the subject of much metanarrative and metaphysical puzzlement—who is thinking or dreaming what, whether the dreamer can be separate from the dream—into an question at once self-interested and speculative? However self-involved her question may be, Molly is essentially asking a question about intersubjectivity, about how one's self takes on reality and takes up space in another mind, about where, as Eleanor would say, one's self begins and another ends. She is probing the central psychological problem of the novel—the relation of one mind to another, the impact of one life on another—as it plays itself out in the perennial questions of connubial relations.  </p>

<p>Perennial questions may frustrate us, but they also advise us not to confuse definitive and prescribed answers with knowledge of life. This is a lesson also urged in Saul Bellow's <i>Mr. Sammler's Planet</i>: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Life, when it was like this, all question-and-answer from the top of intellect to the very bottom, was really a state of singular dirty misery. When it was all question-and-answer it had no charm. Life when it had no charm was entirely question-and-answer. The thing worked both ways. Also, the questions were bad. Also, the answers were horrible. This poverty of soul, its abstract state, you could see in faces on the street. And he too had a touch of the same disease—the disease of the single self explaining what was what and who was who. The results could be foreseen, foretold. So, then, brought down Broadway in high style, Sammler visited his own (what did Wallace call it?) his own <i>turf</i>. As a tourist.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Joyce's unanswered questions are healthy antidotes to the disease of the single self (or its literary counterpart, the omniscient narrator), explaining what was what and who was who. These questions give us the freedom, not of the tourist, but of the genuine quester after facts (many of which prove to be wrong or worthless) and truths (many of which prove elusive or painful). It is a freedom that Joyce's modern quest epic gives us by founding its own identity in the place of incertitude. In return for our willingness to entertain questions without definitive answers Joyce rewards us with the multicolored, multiform, and multitudinous sensations, impressions, and images of life that, like the garments Bloom gathers as he ponders the self-involved enigma of human identity, can adorn the soul (whatever <i>that</i> is, wherever it may be). </p>

<p>No need, then, to feel defeated or dejected by the prospect that the puzzles and unanswered questions of <i>Ulysses</i> may never be answered. We should instead gratefully attend to the questions that Joyce poses for us, questions as irresistible as Molly's, "Is he dreaming (and) am I in it." We might even hazard to answer them: "Yes, Molly he is"; "Yes, Molly you are." These are answers, we can take comfort in knowing, that have the merit of not pretending to settle the question. 	 </p>

We might take these questions that do not call or even expect immediate answers to be expressions of what Roland Barthes, in <i>S/Z</i>, terms more pacifically, "reticence." By reticence Barthes intends "a narrative incommunicativeness" that mobilizes a whole series of devices—"the <i>snare</i> (a kind of deliberate evasion of the truth), the<i> equivocation</i> (a mixture of truth and snare which frequently, while focusing on the enigma, helps to thicken it), the <i>partial answer</i> (which only exacerbates the expectation of the truth), the <i>suspended answer</i> (an aphasic stoppage of the disclosure)<i>, </i>and <i>jamming </i>(acknowledgement of insolubility)." These devices work "to <i>arrest</i> the enigma, to keep it open." For Barthes these strategies "to <i>maintain</i> the enigma in the initial void of its answer" are properties of the readerly text and its wish to play on the expectation and desire for solutions, but we might be bolder and say only the novel has the courage to ask questions without expecting an answer in every single instance. The novel's unanswered questions are rhetorical vehicles supremely effective for approaching and apprehending the real without divesting it of its aura of mystery and unanswerable poignancy.

<b>Abstract</b>
<p>In December 1924 the couturier Jean Patou brought six American fashion models from New York to Paris because, he claimed, the American mannequins' lean and leggy physique was needed to sell his clothes to his American clients. This paper focuses on the American mannequins' Paris debut alongside their French counterparts in Patou's February 1925 fashion show. It explores how Patou's presentation and marketing revealed a set of wider concerns about commerce, culture, gender, and work in the 1920s. The mathematics of fashion was translated into visual seduction on the catwalk as business methods became visual and were imprinted on women's bodies. In particular, Patou's modernist styling of the mannequins' bodies pictured both the Fordist aesthetics of 1920s fashion and the Taylorist management techniques that pervaded the couture houses. In this way, Patou's modernism, rather than belonging to the artistic avant garde, was part of the social and economic rationalization of the body in the early twentieth century.</p>

<p id="lead">The central focus of this article is a single, two-hour fashion show that took place in Paris in February 1925, Jean Patou's fall-winter 1925 collection. No pictures of the show, if any were ever taken, survive, but there are extensive written accounts, from both press and memoirs. These reveal the designer's choice of models, his staging of the show, and his manipulation of the press, connected to a set of wider concerns about commerce, culture, gender, and work in the 1920s. In particular, Patou's modernist styling of the models' bodies pictured both the Fordist aesthetics of 1920s fashion and the Taylorist management techniques that pervaded French couture houses. In this way, Patou's modernism, rather than belonging to the artistic avant-garde, was part of the social and economic rationalization of the body in the early twentieth century. </p>

<p>In November 1924, an advertisement appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>MANNEQUINS WANTED FOR PARIS</p>
<p>Jean Patou, the Parisian couturier, desires to secure three ideal types of beautiful young American women who seriously desire careers as mannequins in his Paris atelier. Must be smart, slender, with well-shaped feet and ankles and refined of manner. Sail within three weeks. Attractive salary proposition, one year's contract and traveling expenses paid both ways. Selection to be made by a jury at the offices of Vogue, 14<sup>th</sup> Floor, 19 West 44<sup>th</sup> St. Apply Friday morning, 10 to 1:30.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In response, five hundred young women turned up at the offices of <i>Vogue</i> where a group of semi-finalists were selected 

<b></b>

and asked to present themselves again at the Ritz ballroom. There the final selection was made by a jury comprising Edna Woolman Chase, the editor of New York <i>Vogue</i>, Condé Nast, its publisher, the interior decorator Elsie de Wolfe, the photographer Edward Steichen, and the couturier himself, Jean Patou. Due to the high number of applicants, the jury selected six mannequins rather than the original three. The <i>New York Times </i>of 14 December, 1924, however, described nine successful applicants, but photographs taken on their arrival in France in December 1924 show Patou with seven; by February 1925, when they were photographed with Patou in the small stage at Maison Patou in Paris, they had apparently shaken down to six.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  (<a href="#1"> 1</a>) Only one, Lillian Farley, whose professional name was Dinarzade, was a professional mannequin who had modeled for Lucile in New York. The others were recruited from society, stage, and screen. Carolyn Putnam was a society girl, Rosalind Stair a "'Flapper' Manikin Who Has Appeared in the Movies With Famous Players," Dorothy Raynor an artists' model who had sat for Charles Dana Gibson, Edwina Pru an actress, and the red-haired Josephine Armstrong an "Artist's Model, Who . . . Has Appeared in the Movies" (<i>NYT</i>, 14 December, 1924). </p>

<p>One was blonde, the others were mid-brown or chestnut-haired. Patou avoided dark-haired mannequins because he felt the brunette denoted a Latin origin and he was looking for "the distinctly American type." For Patou, this included the "flapper type" who was, he noted, much younger than her French counterpart. He claimed that, whereas a young and unmarried French girl scarcely signified in French society, in America it was quite otherwise and accordingly, "I take back two flappers to build dresses for youthful Americaines. One is but sixteen, fancy! Her mother goes with her" (<i>NYT</i>, 23 November, 1924). She was Rosalind Stair; Edwina Pru was barely older, at seventeen. </p>

<p>Passing through New York a fortnight before his advertisement appeared in the paper, he had announced from his hotel suite that he was there to study the "style needs of American Women." He noted that, "It is inspiring to create for American women; they have a distinct style and they are very chic. They have res especially suited for beautiful gowns. I have named it the silhouette type." Patou then illustrated this with gestures: "'the Anglo-Saxon has the re so'—making stiff, perpendicular motions—'the French are so'—making curved lines from side to side" (<i>NYT</i>, 2 November, 1924). At the mannequin audition, the desirable American re appeared to be one without hips. Dinarzade recounted that Patou was curiously interested in the slender ankles specified in the advertisement; after that "he deigned to look at the hips or where the hips should have been. None were wanted."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Later, Patou pronounced that, "The American woman is a charming creature. . . . Women here have so many varied interests and activities that it keeps them young. They go in for sports and that causes them to retain their splendid res. And their feet and ankles are the most perfect in the world" (<i>NYT</i>, 23 November, 1924). To the<i> Washington Post </i>he declared, "When I find that a French woman is especially chic, it is because she approaches the American type—she has those elegant, elongated lines. The Juno and Diana type is not beautiful in the mode of today."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Later still, however, Patou modified this statement

<b></b>

 and was careful to stress "the exquisite desirability of both the rounded French Venus and the slender American Diana" (<i>AV</i>, 163), a comparison which he consistently invoked in interviews: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I went to America for my mannequins for many technical reasons. In the first place, there is a great difference between the French and the American silhouette. Sport has made a great plastic difference. The French girl is a Venus and the American a Diana, with muscles well developed, short bust and long, fine legs. I am persuaded that on Olympus Venus was dressed like Diana, for Diana is the typical "young demoiselle" and Venus the typical woman.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The debate about "the race question," as the <i>New York Times </i>archly dubbed the discussion of the supposed differences between French and American women, raged long after Patou and his mannequins had left New York. In February 1925, the newspaper returned to the point in an article titled "The Judgement of Paris": </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Paris of Troy was not more seriously put to it than the Parisian dressmakers. A national and indeed a racial problem is involved. Each successive style they promulgate must be worn by all French women and also by all Americans. The Anglo-Saxon Nordics are slim and rangy; but the French, being of Mediterranean stock, are rather short from the waist downward. (<i>NYT</i>, 15 February, 1925)

<p>The problem is knotty, but M. Jean Patou has a solution. Never for a moment does he doubt what he calls "the triumph of Diana over Venus." To his discerning mind, it is easier to make over Venus than to make over the current style. So he has imported a bevy of American mannequins who are not only to display his gowns to transatlantic customers, but to "serve as models" in the flesh to French women.</p>

<p>According to Patou, fashions designed on French mannequins lost their appeal when made for American clients; the American re and style was so unlike the French that his designs had to be modeled directly on Americans.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In promoting the idea of a different American physique he tapped into an existing stereotype. From the beginning of the century American magazines such as <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Harper's Bazar</i> (<i>sic</i>) sought to differentiate the two. In 1910 in an article entitled "American Women I Have Met" the French author Marcel Prévost wrote, </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>for us Europeans there certainly exists a physical type of American woman . . . not small, dark-skinned or plump but, rather, . . . a tall person, rather slender, though vigorous looking . . . through hygiene and sports and doubtless, too, through a sincere and well-directed effort of the race towards beauty, a real American type has been formed . . . tall and strong, with dazzling complexions and attire, who, to our eyes, incarnate the physical type of the American woman.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In the 1910s and 1920s the fashion press frequently referred to the need to modify the cut of French clothes for American women. One American article reported with some national pride on the reverse situation, whereby French women were "striving heroically to mold their res on American lines" as the French couturiers "continue to approximate as closely as possible the greyhound silhouette dear to their American clientele."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Patou, too, made this claim on his return from the United States, when he announced that the more active lives of modern French women would, in future, train their res to become more "American." In an article subtitled "Contest Between American and French re Has Apparently Been Won by Former" he declared that, "Even in France . . . the increased outdoor life of women and the development of their limbs by tennis, golf and swimming is causing the round, relatively short res of the last generation to disappear" (<i>NYT</i>, 2 February, 1925). </p>

<p>The distinction, however, was largely symbolic and, insofar as it was real, was based on money rather than leisure pursuits. <i>Fortune</i> magazine looked back on 1920s fashion in economic terms: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>That fashions are influenced by social and economic forces—this is a dull statement. It grows exciting, however, when one notes that the fluctuations of Paris fashions in the past decade closely paralleled the fluctuations of the franc. It was essentially a struggle between the American woman and the <i>Parisienne</i>. . . . The American woman dominated the mode during most of the last decade. She liked the short skirt, so perfectly adapted to her free, athletic life—and to showing off her slim legs and ankles. It was a feminist fashion.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 

<b></b></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The article went on to outline how such American fashions did not suit the less athletic, more rounded, and "feminine" physique of Frenchwomen, before moving seamlessly to a comparison of their respective currencies: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>But the franc was falling, falling, falling all those years from 1919 to 1926. The American dictatorship flourished, and Paris did not dare oust the tube dress and short skirt, which became the uniform of the decade. . . . In 1926 the franc sank to thirty-one to the dollar, and exportations (and with them the American influence) reached their height.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In this way, the journalist mapped economic values (currency) on to cultural ones (images of women), linking the two by association and reminding the reader of the economic base of these supposedly anatomical comparisons.  </p>

<p>Having selected his American mannequins, Patou sailed for France on 19 November, 1924 on the French liner Paris, followed a week or so later by the mannequins on the liner Savoie. Philippe Ortiz, the director of French <i>Vogue,</i> made the same crossing as Patou but it was the editor of American <i>Vogue, </i>Edna Woolman Chase, who was photographed with Patou and his mannequins in the publicity shots taken on board ship on their arrival at Le Havre (<i>NYT</i>, 19 November, 1924). (<a href="#2"> 2</a>) She is the re on the far right of the line of mannequins. Patou, in the center, was extremely tall, and the mannequins' heights, which ranged between 1.76 and 1.80 meters, can be gauged by comparison with his, which was around 1.93 or 1.96 meters. Dinarzade, on the far left, was the tallest. The mannequins' linked arms, jaunty smiles, and brisk stride, with best foot forward, prere the chorus-line formations that Patou would soon deploy when he staged their first mannequin parade in the couture salon.  </p>

<p>The French press greeted their arrival with little enthusiasm, despite, indeed perhaps because of, Patou's lavish endorsement of the American type in the U.S. press. Importing American mannequins to Paris was a tremendous provocation in a France where the Frenchwoman was considered to be the personification of allure and chic, and Paris both the symbolic center of fashion and the economic center of haute couture. The French newspaper response was vociferous, chauvinist, and protectionist.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  A year later, on the expiry of their contracts and their return to the U.S., the French press remained hostile.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  One mannequin, Dorothy Raynor, recalled how "The Paris newspapers ridiculed us or, rather, Americans in general for presuming to show Parisians how to wear clothes to advantage."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  She reported that the French mannequins were not exactly hostile—on the contrary, they gave the Americans helpful advice on how to deal with the inopportune advances of Frenchmen in the street—but their reactions were inevitably influenced by the newspapers, and they complained at both the high wages and the flat chests of the Americans. </p>

<p>Only Colette, writing in French <i>Vogue</i>, was neutral. She reported that, "Un aventureux couturier apporte en France une demi-douzaine de mannequins américains" ("an adventurous designer has imported into France half a dozen American mannequins"). Comparing them to their Parisienne counterparts, whom she characterized as "doubles ponettes françaises, latines râblées, dures à la fatigue, rebelles à la maladie" ("sturdy French ponies, stocky Latin types, resistant to tiredness, intractable to illness"), 

<b></b>

Colette predicted that, "Cette escouade d'archanges va, d'un vol chaste que nulle chair ne retarde, entraîner la mode vers une ligne toujours plus svelte" ("this squad of archangels, in a chaste flight unimpeded by the flesh, will reorient fashion towards an increasingly slender line").<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Colette's reference to the chaste flight of the Americans recalled Patou's description of them as Dianas; other contemporaries characterized the American woman as asexual by comparison with the French woman. The couturier Paul Poiret went so far as to describe the American woman as "beautiful . . . but passionless" and praised Frenchwomen's use of artifice and make-up and a certain louche appeal: "they have the lure of the naughty. They have more pep. They may be a little tired—but they are very agreeable" (<i>WP</i>, 12 April, 1925). </p>

<p>On the evening of 5 February, 1925, the American mannequins debuted in Patou's Paris salon in the rue Florentin, with its studio equipped with a "miniature stage lighted by the most improved methods for photography."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  This notwithstanding, no photographs of the event survive, and quite possibly none was taken. There are a number of written accounts, however. The mannequins "made their entrance walking down a ramp" into the most decorative of the main salons.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Dinarzade, who modeled in the parade, recalled:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>As I went through the door to show my first dress, I had the impression of stepping into a perfumed, silk-lined jewel casket, the atmosphere was so strongly charged. The men in their correct black tailcoats with the sleek, pomaded hair; the women in gorgeous evening dresses, plastered with jewels. It was hot, so hot, and the air was stifling with the mixed 

<b></b>

odours of perfumes and cigarettes. It was nearly one o'clock when the collection was over . . . twenty of us had shown five hundred models. </p>

<p class="continued">In fact it was more like 350, so each mannequin modeled approximately eighteen dresses in a show that lasted over two hours. Patou declared himself delighted with his new mannequins: "I am enchanted with them. I made them keep their flapper slouch, instead of assuming the traditional French mannequin walk."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Edna Woolman Chase described how "Patou employed an amusing bit of showmanship": realizing his audience would expect distinct differences in the dresses designed for the French and American mannequins, he opened the show by sending them all out dressed identically in the thin cotton wrappers they usually wore between fittings, thus suggesting that they were all the same beneath the skin. Chase recalled that, "In view of the advance publicity, this demonstration that the female form, whatever the difference of contour, was still composed of head, limbs and torso, and was all that a dressmaker had to work on, caused a good deal of laughter and started the show off in high humour" (<i>AV</i>, 166). The Paris newspaper <i>Les Echos</i> reported a slight variation on this, in which the show was opened not by twenty but by twenty-five mannequins in identical dresses in two different colors who each presented bottles of perfume to members of the audience.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  The newspaper made no comment as to whether the two colors represented the two nationalities, as opposed to the first evening show in which the mannequins were dressed identically. It is possible that Patou presented both versions at different times, as the show was repeated daily over a period of several weeks. </p>

<p>While there are no pictures of the first show in which all the mannequins wore identical wrappers, a photograph in <i>Le Quotidien</i> newspaper on 2 March, 1925 showed a line of eight American mannequins wearing the same plaid wrappers they wore in the first show. (<a href="#3"> 3</a>) There, Patou's run of twenty, identically dressed, French and American models gliding through the salon in their geometric checks must have reduced the mannequins' bodies to abstract patterns by replicating them to recreate the look of the chorus line on stage. That the look of the chorus line had entered the visual lexicon of the fashion show by the 1920s is evidenced by the French magazine <i>Femina</i>'s Grande Nuit de Paris of 1927, an annual charity fashion show modeled by society women rather than professional mannequins, which grouped them according to similarities of height and dress. (<a href="#4"> 4</a>) </p>

<p>In 1927 the German writer Siegfried Kracauer likened the chorus line to modern industrial mass production, arguing that it was a symbolic representation of the capitalist system, in which the individual identity of each chorus girl was subsumed into a "mass ornament."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  The abstract patterns produced by the massing of bodies in the sports stadium and theater produced, according to Kracauer, an image of the conveyor belt and factory production line. The leisure pursuits of the modern worker (popular theater and sport), he argued, unconsciously reflected the organization of the workplace: the chorus line thus revealed a hidden truth about the reified and mechanical nature of modern industrial society. When Patou opened his fall-winter 1925 fashion show with a line of identically dressed mannequins, he pictured this problematic in much 

<b></b>

the same way. Despite the luxurious late-night setting of Patou's fashion show, with its party atmosphere, heady with perfume and cigars, and clients in evening dress, his modernist styling graphically matched the look of the industrial production line, the mannequins in their checkered wrappers a reified visualization of the standardized body of modern industrial production. </p>

<p>The look of standardization and an industrial aesthetic was commonly perceived to be an American one. As early as 1923 the<i> Washington Post</i> ran an article, "For the First Time French Subordinate Themselves in Bidding for Trade," in which it noted that the franc had sunk to a third of its prewar value by 1923, and asserted that the "American style" had come to dominate the Paris collections now that Paris was increasingly dominated by American buyers (<i>WP</i>, 29 April, 1923). Another American fashion journalist differentiated "standards" from "standardization" in dress, declaring that, "Foreign women, accustomed to originality in dress, are amazed at the sameness with which American women garb themselves all after the same pattern. They say our 'mass fashions' are atrocious! . . . In France . . . the significance of the word individuality is instinctive." The article cited a French modiste who championed individuality in dress and said, "not until we have standardised women can we have standardised dress for them."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  It was this idea of the American physique as standardized, as well as sporty, that linked Patou's choice of American mannequins to the aesthetics of modernism, specifically through the tubular forms and mechanical bodies of 1920s art and design, spanning the painting and sculpture of Léger and Duchamp to the architecture and theories of Le Corbusier and the Bauhaus. 
<b></b>

</p>

<p>In foregrounding the uniformity of his American mannequins, Patou's show, staged once at night in a party atmosphere for the private clients, and repeated in the cold light of day on subsequent afternoons for international buyers, revealed a contradiction at the heart of the French dressmaking business. Haute couture had two distinct markets: selling exclusive gowns to private clients and model gowns to international mass-market buyers for copying. Patou, like all Paris couturiers, was obliged to woo three different categories of American customer: firstly, the couture customers, secondly, the uptown, Francophile stores such as Bergdorf Goodman with whom he maintained close links, and thirdly, the Seventh Avenue wholesalers. Whereas the uptown stores bought what were effectively franchized models to copy, the American wholesalers might buy thousands of dollars worth of designs from one house in a season, in order to make cheaper copies for the mass market.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Dinarzade went on to describe the trade show the following day: "The next afternoon was the opening for the American buyers. They came in droves. There was a totally different feeling from the party-like atmosphere which had prevailed the previous evening. These men and women were there on business. The European buyers came the next day and the salons sounded like the Tower of Babel" (<i>AV</i>, 167). The American buyers were the most important, and the<i> Washington Post </i>reported that  

<b></b>

the leading couturiers showed approximately 3,000 dresses between them that season and that "Paris is thronged with American buyers" (<i>WP</i>, 15 February, 1925). Over the following week, Patou's show was oversubscribed, and "there were ten applications for every invitation . . . everyone wanted to see his American mannequins in action."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  The collection was well received by the American press: one of many accolades was that his designs "combine the freshness and simplicity of American taste with the chic of France."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Even those journalists who knew, at heart, that Patou was selling American ideals back to Americans, also knew that they still needed the cachet of Paris: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>After seeing the American flapper in her proper <i>milieu</i>, one Parisian couturier went back home and caused his designers to make his whole season's line to fit her personality, even going so far as to import American flapper types to wear them. The reaction of the American buyers who sat through the initial showing of his Americanised line were amusing and enlightening, to say the least. Their attitude was a ludicrous mixture of disappointment, of consternation and of bewilderment. One heard excited comments on every side: "But these are exactly what we've been making at home for years!" or, "I'm not going to order here; I can get hundreds like this on Seventh Avenue, with no duty to pay!" Or again, "Smith &amp; Jones in the garment center has a better line of these things which I can buy at one quarter the money!"</p>
<p>We looked at one another in surprise. Had we been asleep all these years? Here was a couturier we had all depended upon for something new that we wearily chased all over Europe, and he had quite unintentionally shown us the charm of our own ideas. Poor dear, he had with the most selfish intentions, unselfishly pointed us to our own markets.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, so consistently and thoroughly had that couturier's prestige been exploited by American department stores that none of the buyers dared flout his collection, even though buying his models was definitely a carrying of coals to Newcastle.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Such shows were staged exclusively for the buyers, whom the private clients never saw; they were strictly segregated and never attended the same shows, although in a very few houses (not Patou's) private clients might be seated next to journalists from the more upmarket magazines such as <i>Harper's Bazar</i> or <i>Vogue</i>. All haute couture depended on fostering the illusion that both private clients and buyers were buying an exclusive design, or at least the rights to reproduce one. Thus the industrial base of haute couture had continually to be disavowed and yet, like the return of the repressed, it emerged in the staging of the elite, evening show for private clients that, for all its exclusivity, nevertheless mimicked its industrial connections. The same New York daily newspaper that carried Patou's advertisement for American mannequins carried regular daily advertisements for a range of French, or French-inspired, fashions—from genuine imports of Patou dresses worth $285 and discounted to $135 at Russeks of Fifth Avenue to Wannamaker's "newest interpretations" of Paris fashions at $98 for a cloth coat made in Wannamaker's American workshops that combined "Lanvin's favourite melon muff cuff, the long shawl collar of which Chanel is so fond, the flare from the knee of Patou coats" (<i>NYT</i>, 13 and 12 November, 1924). Just as the abstracted fashions of Patou's show atomized the models' bodies into moving patterns, so too did the Seventh Avenue dressmakers and tailors atomize fragments and design details of model dresses knocked off from Paris designs in their mass produced garments.

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>Even the dress designs in Patou's fall-winter 1925 collection had a certain uniformity that matched the styling of the show. The<i> Washington Post </i>reported that, "Patou's show is international, with English, American and French mannequins showing pronounced influences of their New York visit. The models [i.e. the model dresses] in all displays are monotonous through lack of novelties except in fabrics and trimmings" (<i>WP</i>, 15 February, 1925). The<i> New York Times </i>also reported that, "Patou seems to have derived a good deal of his inspiration from the American mannequins whom he brought over. His walking and afternoon frocks showed especially well on the slim res of the American girls" (<i>NYT</i>, 6 February, 1925). Later that year, Patou repeated the effect as, in May 1925, his American mannequins modeled at the <i>Ambassadeurs </i>in Cannes: "The evening dresses are shown by five young girls; each of these dresses, exactly alike in design, is executed in a different colour and each has the same cloak of bronze lamé and black fox fur. The effect is amusing, and people applaud."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Despite the luxurious setting, Patou's styling of the modernist body, both in the Paris salon and on the Riviera, graphically matched the aesthetics of automation. So too did the scenography and staging of other 1920s designers' mannequin parades, such as those of Jenny and Chéruit that grouped the mannequins' bodies into abstract machine-like formations on stage. In this way, the "hard technology" of the production line was incorporated into the body and subjectivity through modernist aesthetics. The visual effect of repetition and abstraction was taken up by a range of designers. Even the more conservative Paul Poiret modified his opulent style to use fashionable geometric checks like Patou's in 1925, and this industrial, or Fordist, aesthetic of repetition dominated mid-1920s fashion design and marketing. The little black dress pioneered by Coco Chanel was heralded in American <i>Vogue</i> by the caption "the Chanel 'Ford'—the frock that all the world will wear—is model '817' of black crêpe de chine," a reference to the Ford Model T automobile and to Henry Ford's dictum that, "Any customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants so long as it is black."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  In Chanel's evening suit ensemble of 1926, consisting of the plainest possible tubular skirt and cardigan jacket, both evenly covered with a veneer of sequins, the designer's anti-decorative rhetoric translated into the rational, streamlined body of modernism. Despite the abundant use of sequins, the machine aesthetic was exemplified by the suit's metallic sheen, straight lines, and tubular forms. </p>

<p>Thus 1920s fashion design and fashion shows used the modernist styling of the body to map business creativity on to culture through the visual language of art and design. In the fashion show in particular, the mathematics of fashion was translated into visual seduction on the catwalk as business methods became visual and were imprinted on women's bodies. The modernist rhetoric of the production line was mobilized in cultural production to express industrial structures that were not new but, rather, that dated back at least fifty years. From the 1870s, the Parisian couture house had become increasingly bureaucratized along proto-Taylorist lines, even before the American Frederick Winslow Taylor had completed his exhaustive research into the "scientific management of the workplace," initiated in the Midvale Steel Mills in the 1880s. In the same decade, French haute couture houses grew in size and inaugurated new 

<b></b>

types of bureaucratic organization that were to persist well into the twentieth century. The Taylor system was finally published in the U.S. in 1911.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Essentially, it deskilled individual workers by allocating to each one a set of specific, repetitive, and prescribed physical tasks, so that, for example, an individual worker was no longer allowed to use his judgement, or to break off work to sharpen the tool he worked with. The former task was allocated to a manager and the latter to a dedicated tool sharpener. Between approximately 1910 and 1920, the principles of Taylorism became well established in France, partly through their enthusiastic promotion by the pneumatic tire manufacturer Edouvard Michelin. Taylor's book was translated into French and applied during the First World War to French government factories by the chemist le Chatelier. French journalists often used its language and concepts in their descriptions of the couture house, and its internal organization suggests why.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  </p>

<p> A photographic album recording the entire inner workings and organization of the Paris house of Worth in 1927 shows the female staff arriving at work, the organization of the ateliers, the stockrooms and administrative offices, as well as the kitchens and staff dining rooms. Luncheon was provided in three to five separate sittings on the premises, so that staff could return to work within the half hour and had no need to leave the premises, in line with the Taylorist idea that treating workers well promoted efficiency. This was not a moral or ethical imperative but a business choice. Mannequins too were closely supervised and not allowed to leave the building during work hours; Patou's <i>chef de cabine </i>even kept an eye on them at home. The Worth album shows all the dressmaking and office staff at work in their designated spaces: the sketchers in one atelier, the tailors and cutters in another, the dressmakers in a third, the embroiderers in a fourth, and so on. The album provides visual evidence of the way in which, behind the scenes of the couture house, there was strict division of labor that not only facilitated production but also, more importantly, militated against staff piracy. Few employees were permitted to move between rooms. Instead, the dress or garment pieces in the course of construction were carried between ateliers by the privileged few who acted like human cogs in a giant chain of production. Despite being peculiar to the craft-based nature of French couture, the atelier system constituted a model of rational, if not quite industrial, production that preceded Henry Ford's moving assembly line of 1913. The system also prered the kinetic economies of Taylorism, albeit without its claims to being a "science," since French couture developed organically in the late nineteenth century as a consequence of the hugely increased size and scale of the houses. </p>

<p>Although the French dressmaking business was largely craft-based, its connections to the industrialized American garment industry were vital: the economic mainstay of haute couture was the provision of model dresses for the American industry. And while couture <i>chefs </i>were not consciously adopting Taylorist ideas, by the 1920s couturiers like Patou and Lelong were acutely aware of the relevance to them of contemporary forms of industrial production such as Taylorism and Fordism. An anonymous couturier interviewed in 1923 declared that, "Le grand couturier, qui est un artiste, doit être aussi un chef de maison, un directeur de banque, un patron d'usine" ("The haute couturier, who is an artist, must also be a company director, a bank manager, and a factory 

<b></b>

owner").<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Indeed, as early as 1901 <i>Femina </i>magazine described the house of Redfern as "une véritable usine d'élégance" ("a veritable factory of elegance").<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  By 1926 Patou's business had been restructured, "aux nouvelles méthodes d'organisation rationelles et scientifiques . . . l'organisation de son affaire est complètement industrielle" ("according to new, rational and scientific methods of organization . . . the organization of his business is completely industrial").<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  The metaphors of the bank and the factory haunted the couture house, just as the wicker mannequin on which nineteenth-century clothes had been displayed haunted the reified re of the living mannequin as an uncanny double that revealed the mechanical heart of the capitalist process. </p>

<p>In the couture house, the mannequins moved between their <i>cabine </i>backstage, where they gossiped and chatted, to the front of house salon, where they modeled gowns on demand for the individual clients in a leisurely parade that belied the backstage frenzy and bustle. This de luxe service was designed to make the customer feel she had the individualized attention of both vendeuse and mannequin; it was the opposite of Patou's industrial imagery that treated the mannequins as infinitely repeatable single units. Yet the very act of modeling was one of serial repetition. Contemporary commentators unfailingly remarked on the repetitive nature of the mannequin's work, regardless of whether she modeled to individual clients or to international buyers. They focused on the fact that her actions were neither genuine nor individuated but a <i>répétition</i> (which in French has the double meaning of both performance and repetition). What offended them was the inauthenticity of her performance. They pondered the difficulties of modeling the same ten dresses ten times a day to ten different clients, each time as if it were the first. They agonized over the thought that her smile, so beguiling, was not unique but repeated for each client, and hence could not be genuine. They worried that the mannequin was "un objêt" ("an object"), that she had "un sourire industriel" ("an industrial smile"), and the couture house was nothing but a huge, well-oiled industrial plant producing luxury by the meter, with the mannequin as its front-of-house emblem.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup> </p>

<p>The mannequin embodied the contradiction between the multiple and the one-off that Nancy Troy has identified as a tension in early modernism that also lay at the heart of prewar haute couture.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Individually striking, once in the mannequin parade she became part of a "mass ornament" that visualized the behind-the-scenes Taylorist organization of the house, and its concealed links to Fordist production via its sales to overseas buyers. Just as the calibrated and standardized movements of the Taylorist worker made him a mere cog in the scientific management of the workplace, so too the repetitive and stylized gestures of the mannequin in the parade incorporated her as a living part of the machinery of the couture house, a huge, coordinated mansion of regulated and divided labor. While her languid poses might invoke couture luxury and individualism, the mechanical exactitude of her performance suggested modern rationalization and productivity. The mannequin parades thus revealed, in Kracauer's words, "significant components of reality [that have] become invisible in our world."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The mirrored interiors of the couture house added to the effect, by reflecting the mannequin's striking individuality to infinity. (<a href="#5"> 5</a>) The visual tropes of repetition 

<b></b>

and doubling were thus built into the fabric and protocols of the couture house, and it was this visual knowledge that Patou mobilized when he opened his 1925 show with a row of identically dressed mannequins. As in the chorus line, so too in couture house modeling, individuality was renounced in favor of military precision, and it is perhaps no accident that Patou's principal influence on the way he ran his business came from his military experience of command and control in the First World War. </p>

<p>More than any other Paris based couturier at this time, Patou favored American business methods over more conservative French ones: "Parisian as he is in his ideas of dress design, Jean Patou is known as the most American of Frenchmen in his business methods."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Charles Creed the younger, scion of Henry Creed, the conservative Paris couture house specializing in English tailoring, praised Patou for his "strong affinity with America" and his "wonderful flair for publicity." He described how Patou had "rocked Paris to the core by importing American model girls."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Indeed, Patou always maintained good links with American department stores. Andrew Goodman, son of Eddie Goodman of the New York store Bergdorf Goodman, was apprenticed to him in Paris. Apart from his promotion of sportswear, itself an American innovation, Patou made many commercial innovations inspired by America. He paid close attention to marketing, staging his fashion shows "with little tables crowded together as at a night club, butlers moving about with sandwiches and champagne, and Patou lipsticks, in Cartier cases, as favors for the ladies."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  He installed an "American Bar" on the premises

<b></b>

 and played American music at his fashion shows (<i>NYT</i>, 31 July, 1926). He used American press agencies to syndicate his publicity across the States and meticulously recorded it in his press albums. One page from Maison Patou's press cuttings album has a single article covering the fall-winter 1925 show surrounded by clippings that demonstrate it was syndicated in forty-nine different U.S. newspapers, not dissimilar from the way that Patou's show had replicated and multiplied the mannequins' image. (<a href="#6"> 6</a>) Patou's publicity budget was large, his salaries high, and his prices relatively low. He introduced daily staff meetings and profit shares for executives, and extended the bonus system to mannequins who, like actresses, were traditionally only employed on short-term seasonal contracts. </p>

<p>In the words of a contemporary writer, clearly versed in the language of both Fordism and Taylorism, Patou's principal innovation to the atelier system was the introduction of some elements of "the piecework and assembly plan of production" as he reorganized his couture house along the lines of the "scientific management of the dressmaking plant."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  It was above all in his understanding of the role of the mannequin that Patou revealed a Taylorist-like analysis of his workforce as his best business asset. According to the same author, Patou replaced "the trade's valuation of the mannequin as a piece of necessary furniture" with his own idea of "her as an important factor in the sales organization."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  One of the French mannequins in his employ from as early as December 1924 was Lola Tessier who may well have modeled alongside the Americans in the fall-winter 1925 show. Her physique was not noticeably different from that of the Americans. (<a href="#7"> 7</a>) The following description suggests that she may even have outsold them: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>He [Patou] says his mannequin Lola is the best in the world. While she is a striking looking girl, in beauty she is overshadowed by golden-haired Gladys, a Scotch mannequin in Patou's establishment. But Lola sells twice as many gowns as Gladys, and Patou says she can outsell an ordinary mannequin six or seven to one. The reason is her great chic, a seemingly spiritual quality whose value in actual francs and centimes Patou's efficiency department shows to him in graphic business charts.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Thus Lola's chic could be calculated actuarially. The mannequin, tall and slender in reality, could also be represented as a tall and slender column in a bar chart, the taller the better, as Patou's "efficiency department" made the translation from centimeters to centimes. The act of fashion modeling was directly converted into an economic value, exactly like Taylor's obsessive system of measuring bodily movement and gesture that resulted in his "scientific system" to increase the workers' productivity by regulating and rationalizing their every move. In this way, the mannequin's body was directly approximated to profit, her generative powers understood in terms of sales. In the U.S., John Powers, who opened the first model agency in 1923, referred to his models as "commodities which must meet certain requirements" and himself as a "broker in beauty."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  By 1930 he had over 400 mannequins on his books. </p>

<p>But if mannequins were commodified by the protocols of modeling, they also commodified themselves—they were, as Walter Benjamin described the nineteenth-century

prostitute, "both seller and wares in one."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup> In France, the first mannequins scandalized their audience not because they displayed their bodies in public, or in a state of near nudity, but because they wore fashionable clothes for money rather than for its own sake.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  In 1925 Colette described the mannequin as a re caught between high and low culture, between art and industry. She was a "collaboratrice inquiétante" ("a disturbing collaborator"), "comme une proie chargée de butin" ("like some plunder-laden prey"), "le vivant appât" ("a living bait"), "la passive réalisation d'une idée" ("the passive realization of an ideal"), and "son travail consiste à simuler l'oisiveté" ("her work consists of simulating idleness").<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Yet she was also a prime example of the working girl, a modern "type", and a New Woman—a vigorous emblem of modernity. A photograph shows Dinarzade on board ship returning to New York at the beginning of 1926, after her year modeling in Paris. (<a href="#8"> 8</a>) She wears her own wardrobe of Patou clothes and, while she may be a "plunder-laden prey," she is also a relatively affluent, autonomous, working woman, successful in two continents and apparently in charge of her own destiny. The American press was more sympathetic to the idea of the mannequin as a working girl made good, particularly when she married a millionaire. The wedding of Josephine Armstrong in June 1926 to Erskine Gwynne, a Vanderbilt cousin, was covered by over thirty American newspapers with headlines such as "How an American Working Girl Won the 'Vanderbilt Playboy'."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Yet the mannequin continued to trouble some contemporaries. By the 1920s her uniform appearance was guaranteed by her modernist dress, short hair, make-up, and gamine style, be she a professional model like Dinarzade, or a society woman like those who modeled in the 1927 <i>Femina </i>charity ball (see <a href="#4"> 4</a>). The very uniformity of 1920s fashions was disturbing to some critics, and the New Woman's appearance increasingly troubled moralists in the 1920s precisely because, masked in heavy make-up, with shingled hair and "flapper" mannerisms, the wife of the respectable industrialist could no longer be distinguished from the working girl.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup> Like the fake jewelry that Chanel popularized in the 1920s, the fashion show strung the mannequins together like false pearls: too lustrous, too uniform, and too perfect for plausibility, they incarnated the treacherous and uncanny instability of appearances.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup> </p>

<p>The effect was enhanced by their near silence as they modeled. While it was the job of the vendeuse to speak, including in fluent English, the mannequin remained largely mute in the salon (as opposed to her lively chatter backstage in the <i>cabine)</i>. From time to time she spoke to the client, but only when called on to do so, and then simply to give the name of the model and its price. Lucile's mannequins, who modeled in Paris and New York, came from working-class London suburbs and were never allowed to speak, and barely to smile. When the journalist Alison Settle interviewed Paul Poiret for the London <i>Daily Mirror</i> in 1920 they lunched in the presence of four of his mannequins dressed in uniforms of green and gold with peaked caps. The writer recalled that when she attempted to speak to them, "Poiret put a hand on my arm, warningly. 'No, mademoiselle,' he said, 'do not speak to the girls, they are not there.' Quite definitely they were, but not socially, he was indicating."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>

<p>Yet by 1925 mannequins did have a social and symbolic presence: they were eloquent icons of modernity, even in their silence. From the beginning of the century, journalists had identified the mannequin as a new kind of career girl, distinct from the vampish demi-mondaine or actress.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  While some of these descriptions were adulatory, others were tinged with ambivalence: in the re of the mannequin who wore fashionable clothes for money rather than for pleasure, something that should have been concealed—the commercial nature of the transaction—had been revealed. The re of the mannequin points to the commercialization of lovely women, and the gaze itself objectifies the mannequin. In the late nineteenth century reprographic technologies led to the rise of the popular press in which women were increasingly represented as spectacle, and this scopic regime produced a taxonomy of feminine types including the actress, the chorus girl, the mannequin, and the femme du monde.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> The look itself became a distancing device, and industrial aesthetics provided the ideal packaging for the estranged body-object of the New Woman, both a defence and a social sign of a new professional "type": cold, unavailable, detached, at work. </p>



<p>Fears about the increasingly dehumanizing effects of the machine can be traced back to Karl Marx's descriptions of the worker's alienation from his labor under modern conditions of factory production.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  They are conflated with fears about the mechanical woman in texts such as Villier de l'Isle Adam's <i>L'Eve Future </i>published in 1886. In the 

<b></b>

fashion show two kinds of alienation converged: the alienation of the worker in the production line, and the alienated and alienating form of the New Woman.  </p>

<p>If, as Jennifer Craik argues, the fashion model is "the technological body of the Western consumer," hers is a body freighted with contradiction.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  From the early twentieth century, the mannequin was variously represented as both an object and a subject: she might be forced to stand for hours like a living statue as the couturier realized his designs on her inanimate torso, on the one hand. Yet, on the other, her style, confidence, and panache more than matched the distinction of the society woman, with whom she was frequently compared. The fashion show was associated with individuated luxury consumption, yet it was also a symbolic representation of the processes of modern industrial production. That conceit was made visible in a <i>Harper's Bazar</i> illustration bringing the new Paris fashions for fall 1927 to New Yorkers, in which the massed mannequins hold hands like the linked arms of Patou's American mannequins on their arrival in France. (<a href="#9"> 9</a>; see also <a href="#2"> 2</a>) They are arranged not in a straight line but around a central hub to suggest a giant cog or industrial wheel, which is in fact a clock face, with fashions from all the major French houses pointing to the hour of the day. The image relies on the convention that there were different dresses for day, afternoon, and evening wear, while also suggesting the inexorable passage of time in an industry predicated on rapid style change. It combines time and motion in a single pictogram, a conjunction at the heart of Taylorism, and simultaneously invokes the Fordist aesthetic of 1920s fashion, reinventing the nineteenth-century "wheel of fashion" illustrated by Grandville in the 1840s to suggest that production and consumption are not distinct but part of a single, indivisible process. </p>

<p>In the interwar period, standardization was seen on both sides of the Atlantic as quintessentially modern and American, determining not only industrial production but also social life and subjectivity. The mannequin parade thus touched on a series of contradictory ideas and ideals about national identity, women, and modernity. Fears about increasing mechanization and the changing role of women were projected on to the uncanny re of the fashion mannequin who was seen as new kind of career woman, chilly and distant, unlike the cosy actress or vampish femme fatale, her modernity measured by her sleek and uniform appearance in the mannequin parade. The visual and commercial complexities of the mannequin's presentation had been implicit since the early 1900s, if not earlier. Patou's fall-winter 1925 fashion show simply made visible the connection via an industrial aesthetic that by the 1920s had become modish. In the first three decades of the twentieth century in which the profession of the fashion model—or mannequin—became established, the model was a cipher for many of the commercial, cultural, and national tensions in early-twentieth-century modernity: between creativity and business, between France and America, and between elite consumption and mass production.

<b>Abstract</b>
<p>In November 1919, the Weimar Republic was a year old, yet no domestic consensus seemed in sight. The international military conflict had transformed into a war at home, where assassinations, street ting, and protests disrupted public order. Through all this, law enforcement agencies in Berlin worked alongside other civic and private institutions to establish a sense of day-to-day normalcy and security. In the case discussed in this essay, a fictional manhunt known as "Augen auf!" or "Open Your Eyes!" sponsored by the <i>Berliner Morgenpost</i>, representatives of the newly reformed local criminal police helped to set the tone of the popular discourse on civility and sociability in the nascent democracy.</p>

Sensational Circumstances? 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>In November 1919, the Weimar Republic was already a year old, yet, with the exact terms of the Versailles Treaty still under consideration, no true domestic consensus seemed in sight. The international dispute had transformed into a war at home, where political assassinations, violent clashes on the streets, and partisan protests disrupted any sense of public order. In this atmosphere of upheaval, law enforcement had begun working alongside private and civic institutions such as the press, small and large businesses, and entertainment venues to mollify people's concerns in an effort to establish some sense of normalcy and security in everyday life. At the same time, these institutions made the most of the sensational value of current events to entice and engage the public as readers, audiences, consumers, and concerned and affected citizens.  </p>

<p>These conditions were particularly extreme in Berlin. Berlin's newspapers addressed their audiences with both hard and soft news, reminding readers of the common investment they held in the outcome of national debates, while simultaneously keeping their minds occupied with such local aspects of daily life as weather and social events. One such example of this mixture of news and features appeared in the <i>Berliner Morgenpost </i>(one of the city's most popular papers) on the morning of Wednesday, 12 November, 1919. Its regular column "Berlin's Latest" featured such brief and seemingly disconnected items as "Out With the Prisoners of War!" and "Where Is This Early Snow Coming From?" The column also informed readers of a city-wide manhunt, announcing:

<b></b>

 </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p><i>Berliner Morgenpost</i> Contest<b>.</b> Today our readers will see a poster displaying a picture of a wanted man hanging on advertising pillars. A 2,000 mark reward has been offered for the person who arrests him tomorrow, Thursday. Readers will find all the relevant details in tomorrow's edition of the <i>Berliner Morgenpost</i>.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">By withholding the details for twenty-four hours, the paper's editors strategically left their readers curious. Why was this man wanted?—was he a counterfeiter, a burglar, a pickpocket, a political dissident, or even a murderer? How could Berlin's citizens protect themselves in the meantime if he was in fact dangerous? What was the connection between this case and the morning paper offering the reward? Were the police behind this criminal pursuit? </p>

<p>The answers to some of these questions appeared the next day under an oversized headline declaring, "2,000 Mark Reward. <i>Berliner Morgenpost</i> Contest. Open Your Eyes!"<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Here, readers discovered that the manhunt did not involve an actual criminal. The editors of the morning paper were in fact fabricating the pursuit and staging it with real-life props such as wanted posters, a mug shot, and press reports. The role of the man at large was to be played by an anonymous member of the newspaper's editorial staff whose photo would be plastered throughout the city. Weeks later the wanted man was revealed to be Egon Jacobsohn, a popular reporter on urban affairs, especially crime news and film culture. This would-be fugitive was to take the streets from eight in the morning until eight in the evening, during which time the city's residents were instructed to locate, identify, and apprehend him. The citizen's arrest could be performed by calling out the words "<i>Augen auf!</i>" ("<i>Open your eyes!</i>"), whereupon the journalist would willingly turn himself over to his "captor," who could then take steps to claim the cash prize from the offices of the Ullstein publishing house responsible for the <i>Morgenpost</i>.  </p>

<p>The elaborate description of the 1919 <i>Berliner Morgenpost </i>contest published the day after the first small announcement characterized Berlin as the site of rampant crime in a tenor recognizable from today's sensationalist television news broadcast. While in principle the game sounded fun, its publicity emphasized public anxiety about crime, violence, and social disorder with the following images: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The lack of security in Berlin has in no way declined despite all the efforts on the part of the authorities. Every day new and audacious robberies take place on open streets, in densely populated apartment buildings, and even in hotels. It seems to be impossible to capture the culprits and to bring them to justice. Every week in Berlin at least one murder is committed, and in many cases it is left unsolved. Almost every day reports pour into police headquarters stating that people inexplicably fail to return from their walks through the capital city. They were last seen by an acquaintance here or there—then, they disappeared without a trace. An accident? Crime? Murder? No one knows.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">According to this passage, every person inhabiting Berlin on that day was vulnerable to assault; the city's citizens could fall victim to random violence in any place where people came into contact with one another.

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>Post- and counter-revolutionary street ting had made crossing public space less safe and secure than it had ever been before, and stories abounded of people disappearing without a trace, or turning up dead in the urban canals. The most prominent case of kidnapping and murder was that of Spartacist activists Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, who had been assassinated by right-wing extremists in January of that same year. But the newspaper's campaign drew readers' attention to key personal questions: Was that fate something that the average reader of the <i>Morgenpost</i> should fear for him or herself? What was the perceived correlation between those kinds of events and random individual crime? Was there a connection between news of such events and the sense of general insecurity on the part of average citizens? Yet the inaugural article painted its threatening picture without offering empirical information on Berlin's dangers, thus cultivating audience interest by offering just enough of a dose of reality to inspire the creation of elaborate, perhaps unsubstantiated, fantasies about personal and collective vulnerability. To be sure, common crimes against persons and property remained just that—common—even during this time of political flux. However, a lack of reliable statistical crime records from the time makes it difficult to test the validity of this sensationalist description of the dangers of life in the city. In 1882, the German government had begun compiling systematically a common set of criminal statistics representing events in the unified nation, publishing an annual edition of <i>Statistik des Deutschen Reichs</i>, but it did not publish numbers for Berlin or Prussia during the postwar era. On the basis of the available scattered data, today's historians agree that there were more property crimes during and after the war than before. However, property crimes are not the same as the murders and disappearances described in the <i>Morgenpost</i> article.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  By describing such acts without referencing specific events or statistics, the text revealed itself to be tapping into and perpetuating a vague but popular idea among readers that the metropolitan milieu of Berlin was rife with violence. The fantasy and the reality were and remain virtually impossible to separate, which may have been a source of the appeal of the newspaper game. </p>

<p>Half a year earlier, the new Social Democratic President of the Republic, Friedrich Ebert, had chosen to convene the Constituent Assembly in the city of Weimar because Berlin was still too unsafe a place for high-profile officials to meet. Neither the legitimacy of that form of government and of Social Democratic rule nor the status of Berlin as the seat of that government was taken for granted. Cultural critics on the far left opposed any sense of continuity and direct transmission between the Second Reich and the Weimar Republic, while some on the right argued that the only promising course for German political life would be one that moved away from the terminal locus of Berlin. The violence on the streets that sent the first government officials to Weimar made it questionable to people of all political leanings that Berlin would ever be calm enough to be an appropriate government headquarters. The very tag line for the contest resonated remarkably with the political conflicts of the day as a familiar imperative to readers who might have picked up some of the many partisan leaflets circulating through the city since the war's end. In 1918 alone, two left-wing publications appeared whose titles invoked this exact phrase. The non-partisan Independent 

<b></b>

Organization for German Workers' Peace put out one issue in their larger series of flyers entitled "Arbeiter, macht die Augen auf!" ("Workers, Open Your Eyes!").<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Late in the year the Social Democratic Party published a seven-page flyer appealing for votes to the National Assembly in the January 1919 election, which bore the title "Die Augen auf!"<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In these contexts the phrase instructed workers and returning soldiers to view critically the militarism of the previous regime and the current parties vying over its re-establishment, while also warning readers to steer clear of the political violence being fomented by parties on both extreme ends of the spectrum. The following questions thus loomed behind the newspaper's description of its city and its invocation of the "Open Your Eyes!" imperative: How in 1919 was Berlin, and so Germany, to regain the social order and the rule of law? How could the re-establishment of law and order occur when power had been wrested from the hands of precisely the agencies that should enforce national order? What role could and should citizens play in the determination of Germany's future?  </p>

<p>In the view of certain critics, not only had the Social Democrats been proven an impotent source of national power by virtue of their concession to the imposed conditions of the Entente, but those who could have stood up for the preservation of strong national principles had simply bowed out when faced with violence and danger. The revolution involved a series of events that weakened and decentralized the traditional source of authority in Wilhelmine Germany: the military. Sailors' rebellions initially triggered the political upheaval at the war's end; workers' and soldiers' councils evolved; and the <i>Freikorps</i> troops split off from the armed forces and became embroiled in the street level political turmoil. The German army had disintegrated on both fronts and, in conservatives' eyes, had been stabbed in the back and humiliated by national representatives who had agreed to the terms of the Entente and the Versailles Treaty. As a result of this combination of perceived internal weakness and external betrayal, the military no longer possessed the authority to enforce public order during internal political disputes and uprisings, something that had been a significant part of its mandate during the imperial era.  </p>

<p>According to various Prussian laws codified between 1820 and 1841, if any uprising or rebellion were seen to threaten public safety, the government could declare a state of emergency, upon which the armed forces would take over all policing duties and law enforcement officers would then answer to the higher authority of the military.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  These laws did not change until the ratification of the Weimar Constitution on 11 August, 1919. Any authoritative action on the part of the army on the occasion of domestic uprising prior to August had been proven untenable because of the military defeat and the abdication of the Kaiser. There existed a palpable power vacuum in the arena of public safety. The crisis of the capital city was a crisis of domestic order. If Berlin were to be viable as government headquarters, someone would have to keep the rebellious forces in check. Yet, skeptics queried, who, in the absence of the armed forces, could possibly reassert any kind of authority and stability?

Turning to the People 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Although the liberal Berlin paper approached the above questions from an angle different from that of the conservative critics of the revolution and emergent republic, they permeated the texts introducing the <i>Open Your Eyes! </i>event. Rather than asking who could step in from on high to reassert public order in the event of radical street-level political activity, the <i>Morgenpost</i> staff asked what the people could do to establish safety and order on the city streets in the face of base criminal activity. As different as they sound, these questions were deeply enmeshed with one another. The second paragraph of the 13 November article introducing the journalistic manhunt insisted that survival in this dangerous city required concerted cooperation between the public and the authorities. Unlike conservative critics, who might have attributed all disorder in the capital city to the misguided activity of leftists and the weakness of the armed forces, the <i>Morgenpost</i> article attributed the state of social disorder to flaws in the attitude of the citizenry. The article continues:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Just why does no one know?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: Because people do not pay attention to one another any more. Nowadays all consider themselves to be so busy with their own affairs that they can muster neither the time nor the desire to concern themselves with their fellow citizens as well. Whereas Berliners used to be famous all around for their curiosity, and for their tendency to complain about and get upset over whatever concerned them—and especially that which did not concern them—Berliners have now become quite accustomed to being ambivalent toward everything and everyone, an ambivalence that could almost be considered deadly. Precisely in these times it is more necessary than ever that Berliners lay aside this rather unmetropolitan "What's it to me?" attitude and attend better to their neighbors as well as to themselves . . . .<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This portrait of Berlin's average citizen charges that a verifiable self-absorption had been hindering efforts in crime prevention and solution in the German metropolis. The reference to the nosiness for and of which Berliners were traditionally both maligned and proud exhibits the humorous and self-ironizing tone characteristic of much of the the <i>Morgenpost</i>'s local entertainment and society reporting<i>. </i>In this particular case, that tone was used to encourage participation by amusing the reader while also establishing a self-effacing distance that urged self-consciousness. </p>

<p>The article went on to argue that the most striking relevant difference between earlier and current modes of social interaction was the citizens' unwillingness to come forth and provide eyewitness testimony to the police when called for: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The information provided by eyewitnesses is often so valuable! How many murders and crimes before the war owe their solution to the watchful eyes of a Berliner!  . . .  Each one provided observations, regardless of how tiny, that were of great service to the police in leading to revelations about the crime. The public participated cheerfully in police service because people knew that the officers were working for them and their safety alone.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 

<b></b>

 </p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This paragraph marks the First World War as the historical divide at which a stable relationship between the general public and its protective authorities was ruptured. Previously, according to the newspaper, Berliners had known that the police worked for the sake of public order (under imperial rule), and it was out of this assurance that they had taken an active stance toward their own self-protection. But a crisis of mistrust had developed on both sides: the public was no longer sure it could count on the police (perhaps because it was not sure what authority the police represented), and according to the adamant terms of the article, the police could certainly no longer count on the public.  </p>

<p>Boosting readership in a media landscape saturated with a variety of competing newspapers, many of which came out with multiple editions each day, was but one of the goals of the <i>Morgenpost</i> promotional event. Another was to render a vast expanse of urban space more navigable and accessible to a diverse reading public (see <i>RB</i>, 16–17). Healing the rift between the public and police and creating an improved sense of concern on the part of the city's residents were two others. Interestingly, the newspaper did not act alone in its efforts to achieve these goals. The contest involved an oversight committee made up of res from a variety of cultural and civic institutions, whose names and affiliations were all listed at a roster at the end of the 13 November article: Arnold Rieck from the <i>Lustspielhaus </i>theater, the author Hans Brennert, Fritz Goetz from the Ullstein publishing house, and Otto Robosky, the editor-in-chief of the <i>Morgenpost</i>. At the top of the list stood the name of Police Superintendent Vonberg of the Berlin <i>Kriminalpolizei</i>. As the contest unfolded, Vonberg became the most visible of the committee members. He was the only one to publish his own by-lined article about the events on the day of the contest, and his name came up repeatedly in the coverage of the ensuing reaction on the part of the paper and the public.  </p>

<p>The superindendent first became such a vocal participant when no one managed to identify the fugitive during his twelve-hour adventure through the city on the original contest date. The editors and readers were left wondering why the stunt had failed. The picture on the poster had borne a true likeness and the mystery man had conformed to all the rules outlined for the game: Jacobsohn wore no disguises; he stayed in publicly accessible locales (entering private property was forbidden to him); he lingered nowhere for longer than half-an-hour; and over the course of the day he visited all of the densely populated neighborhoods of the city that were on the original agenda. It became incumbent upon Superintendent Vonberg, the member of the evaluating board with the most experience in the arena of surveillance, personal identification, and criminal detection, to try to explain why even a playful manhunt with a substantial monetary reward had not elicted a better performance from the public. He responded first by explaining the investment the criminal police of Berlin held in the event, asserting in an article he penned for the 17 November issue of the paper: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In light of the great interest that the public has expressed for the <i>Berliner Morgenpost</i>'s idea to stage a search for one of their editorial staff members by means of wanted posters, it seems reasonable that the criminal police should make a statement about the case. For it is precisely they who will profit from this effort. After all, the main idea behind 

<b></b>

it is the intention to get the public more actively involved in the non-political events of the day.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Superintendent Vonberg's assertions echoed conservatives' arguments about disorder on the streets of Berlin and the messages of the left-leaning flyers bearing the same tag line as the contest. With his own statement that people should be more involved in the "non-political activities of the day," Vonberg indirectly and euphemistically referred to a variety of political activities that were otherwise taking place in the city's public spaces, ranging in intensity from leafleting to ting bloody battles. From a centrist, early-Weimar law enforcement perspective, political conflict and dissent in public space amounted to public disorder—whether the cause motivating the clash was justified or not. By getting people involved in the playful games sponsored by the popular morning paper, Vonberg and his colleagues hoped to divert them from the politics of the street as a first step towards improving safety and general order. By distracting people, they could begin to establish some sense of normalcy in public life, normalcy that could hopefully translate into acceptance of—if not support for—the parliamentary democracy and the Social Democratic administration at its helm.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> </p>

<p>Those considerations make it no less remarkable that in an effort to establish normalcy and political stability, the organizers of the event would choose to structure the event around the pursuit of a pseudo-criminal. Public officials could just have easily concluded that even an obviously made-up public and police pursuit could reinforce a damaging sense of the ubiquity of crime in contemporary life and thus further destabilize the greater sense of order and faith in the new administration. In the fall of 1919, images of the prevalence of dangerous crime were expected to be reassuring in comparison to images of the recent war and the present political upheaval. The t against illegal activity was hoped to establish a common enemy against which Berliners of all political leanings could mobilize together—instead of warring among themselves. According to the terms of the event publicity, crime was not only inevitable, but it was something that the average citizen could and should do something about. By learning to do so with pleasure, the participants in the game were expected to become more amenable to doing so in other, more serious contexts. Politics, on the other hand, should now best be left to the rightful executors in the newly formed governing bodies.  </p>

<p>The <i>Open Your Eyes! </i>contest was thus intended not only to bond community members to one another, but also to reinforce the positive qualities of their relationship with state authorities. Ever since public disciplinary activities in Prussia had become centralized in the state institution of the police over the course of the nineteenth century, law enforcement officers had become one of the main points of daily contact between the state and the people. Ideally, crime detection and prevention could serve as the primary arena where the general populace, which was feeling itself to be at a loss in terms of power and personal security, could co-operate with the democratic administration, whose representatives claimed to have the interest of that people at heart. Therefore in 1919, police officers had the potential to function as primary agents in bringing the message and the means of democratic reform to the citizenry. Working hand in hand with the press strengthened this position.

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>However, as mentioned earlier, one of the premises underlying the <i>Open Your Eyes! </i>contest was that a certain amount of trust had been lost between the police and the public, which did not bode well for the kind of democratic co-operation that seemed to be the goal of the new administration. Although other representatives of the police would elaborate on this phenomenon elsewhere, nowhere in the coverage of the event did either Vonberg or the <i>Morgenpost</i> staff offer a systematic or historically reflective explanation for this phenomenon.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Indeed, the explanation that Vonberg provided overtly avoided addressing how this lack of trust might relate to specific actions or events in the administration of law enforcement. Instead, he placed the onus on the general population. In his 17 November statement, he reiterated the position articulated in the 13 November article introducing the contest rules, asserting that any current lack of efficacy or faith in law enforcement could be attributed to a failure on the part of the public to work with the authorities. The criminal investigator chided: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In fact, in recent years the police have had ample opportunity to condemn the public's lack of interest in their concerns, concerns which in truth are nothing other than the concerns of the public itself. Were it otherwise, were the public to keep its eyes open, there would be no doubt that crime would be significantly reduced. To a certain degree all people can protect themselves and others from harm on their own, and without the help of the police.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Superintendent Vonberg went on to offer his own explanation for this specific failure of perception and socialization, which had in the meantime been confirmed by the lack of a contest winner: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Those of us who have experience in such matters might have predicted this outcome, for we have come to know the difficulty involved in locating an unidentified individual on the basis of a picture alone. On the street and in covered spaces, where a large number of people gather together, the eye of the city resident is not focused on individual persons. For most, another person is but one of many a number and is only there to help one to reach a specific goal. This is different than in a small town, where people know one another and where newcomers draw attention and criticism. Only here, where a person exists within a limited circle or a specific environment, can one count on likely success. There was nothing resembling this involved in this task. To the contrary, the sought-after man was very mobile. He moved quickly between streets and city sectors and could thereby move unnoticed among the crowds of people. Were he to spend more time in a confined area among fewer people, then he would be in danger. . . .<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup></p>

The Metropolis and Social Life 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>The above passage by Vonberg demonstrates the degree to which social theories addressing the fate of the subject in urban modernity had been streaming into common parlance. In particular, the terms of Simmel's 1903 essay "The Metropolis and Mental Life" appear to play a central role in the investigator's articulation of how urbanism had impacted human consciousness and, as a result, social life (see <i>RB</i>, 84). Arguably, to 

<b></b>

this date Simmel had offered the most cogent reflections on the experience of urban modernity, articulating the argument that, in order to understand the nature of the city, one must investigate the mental forms of subjective and intersubjective life in it and vice versa. According to this view, not only are emotional and psychological states affected by the unique conditions of modern urban life, but so are neurological and perceptual states; the external world necessarily becomes part of our inner world. The monumental differences between life in a small town and life in a metropolis guarantee that the big city resident (or <i>Großstädter</i> as Police Superintendent Vonberg refers to the target audience in the original German of the <i>Morgenpost</i> article) experiences his or her environment differently than the rural individual would.  </p>

<p>Indirectly underscored by Simmel's principles, Vonberg's article theorizes a historically determined way of interacting and of seeing that is produced by, and productive of, the modern economic, social, and physical environment. The superintendent is eager to condemn Berliners for their inability, and primarily their unwillingness, to spot a deviant in a crowd, although he provides no in-depth analysis of how the urban dweller has become so unobservant. The phrases that he offers by way of explanation seem to indicate that the answers to that question already offered by Simmel in 1903 have become self-explanatory by 1919. The superintendent vaguely alludes to instrumental attitudes and the ways that crowds, the built environment, and modern modes of transportation facilitated the preservation of anonymity in the city.  </p>

<p>In "The Metropolis and Mental Life," Simmel had concluded that intellect and reason did in fact dominate the metropolis because of its status as the seat of the money economy. Performing economic exchanges by means of currency had encouraged the assumption of a matter-of-fact attitude toward objects, an attitude that sought in them only their monetary value. This calculating attitude toward objects translates into an equally calculating attitude toward other people, subsequently reduced to their equivalent in usefulness and efficiency. Simmel further argues that as participants in a market economy, the players in an urban economy usually engage in producing or handling objects for consumers who never entered into their field of vision. Understanding someone in visual terms of recognition is downplayed in favor of formulating abstract and calculated conceptions.  </p>

<p>Police Superintendent Vonberg deduces that the city dweller no longer bothers to look at those around him or her because face-to-face interaction has become less and less a factor in the formation of the relationships most valued in the urban social economy. At the same time that the metropolitan individual finds less to be gained by engaging visually with those around him or her, any efforts to do so are thwarted by factors such as mobility and crowding. Again echoing Simmel, Vonberg contrasts the physical and social quality of life in a big city to that of a small town, where for a variety of reasons residents keep an eye on one another and are able to notice any changes or unusual behavior, a more basic form of community watch that Simmel describes as "a supervision of the citizen by the citizen."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> </p>

<p>In 1919, the police superintendent expected that the implementation of participatory programs such as the <i>Morgenpost</i> event could instill in the capital city the qualities of 

<b></b>

a small town. He was personally invested in changing the fact that, as described in the headline of an article of 15 November, "Berlin was not paying attention" to the fugitive journalist as he visited the Wertheim department store, strolled on the posh boulevard Unter den Linden, sent a telegram from the post office, stopped by the police headquarters, took the subway and the streetcar, took a turn in a downtown amusement park, and even stopped by the subscription office in the Ullstein building.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> </p>

Reframing the History of Vision 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>The sense of vision was failing Berliners, and not only on bustling city streets, and in hotels and crowded tenements, but also in some of the locations that housed the very modern institutions and technologies that should have been connecting people to one another: high speed public transportation, the telegraph, and the press. Instead of moving society forward, the modern urban capacity to travel and communicate faster and across further distances seemed to be making city residents far-sighted. Even though it had become impossible for residents of the highly dense and relatively mobile metropolis to meet all their neighbors or to recognize even a fraction of those encountered in a day, the newspaper offered the <i>Open your eyes!</i> contest as a tool for transmitting a way of seeing more of the city's faces in better detail, a way of seeing that should be hostile to criminality. This mode of vision would be one adjusted to the porous contours of undulating urban street-life.  </p>

<p>As the title of the event makes clear, the <i>Morgenpost</i> promotion relied on the language of vision to express its aims. All of the texts accompanying the event are replete with references to visual vigilance as the key to a re-establishment of social order. One in particular, a pithy poem, stands out for both its format and its tone. It appears in the upper right-hand corner of the middle column along with the 13 November article describing the procedures for the contest. Entitled "Where Is He Hiding?" it is credited to a Kurt E. Weckwarth (certainly meant to be a coy pseudonym, given the vigilant implications of the name "Weckwarth," which translates roughly into wakeful watch or guard) and its second verse reads: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Each pair of eyes That looks, peeks, and spies <br />

Examines in an exacting way <br />
If perhaps, could it be—where is "he"?<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">This little piece strays from the rest of the predominantly imperative address of all of the articles instructing Berliners on how to get involved in the game and it bears none of the officiousness of Vonberg's article of a week later. Instead, its clever and entertaining tone emphasizes the fun side of learning how to see the other people in the city. Poetry has the capacity to reconre and delimit meaning through the substitution 

<b></b>

of denotatively equivalent but connotatively distinct words. In this case, this linguistic function is part of an effort to effect an actual transformation in perceptual modes, which was the stated goal of the event. Over the course of the verse, the casual act of looking around is transformed into a goal-directed activity, a visual act of detection-cum-identity determination. Reading about and participating in the event (activities that, as Peter Fritzsche has argued become inseparable by virtue of the community-building, participatory model of reading encouraged by Berlin's urban press) were intended to change the urban mode of vision, which should in turn change urban social life (see <i>RB</i>, 51–86). In <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> texts such as the poem, the cityscape was staged as both site of, and product of, socially constructive, mutable ways of seeing. </p>

<p>This literal and rative emphasis on seeing and being seen as a formative, yet transmutable, aspect of urban mental and social life continues the conversation with Simmel's writings from the beginning of the century. Over the course of the Weimar era, the idea that the new and sometimes incomprehensible shocks and jolts of the big city had caused people to develop a protective sensorium that both benefited and suffered from the qualities of distraction and absent-mindedness would be further developed by such cultural theorists as Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Kracauer. More recently, film scholar David Bordwell has directed an important challenge to today's cultural historians (film historians in particular) who have developed what he describes as a "history-of-vision doctrine" that is based on an interpretation of Benjamin and Kracauer (acolytes of Simmel) and which surmises that the anatomical mechanism that we call vision had over a period of less than one hundred years actually adapted physiologically to the new urban environment.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Bordwell insists that in terms of human evolution this is a highly implausible conjecture and encourages historians of visual culture to speak not of changes in vision per se, but instead of changes in "habits and skills, of cognitively monitored ways of noticing or contextualizing information available in new surroundings" (<i>HFS</i>, 142). While that formulation may seem like only a slight shift in emphasis, Bordwell insists that it is not. He argues that </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>. . . the habits and skills demanded by modern urban vision will be like other habits and skills in important respects. They are distributed unevenly across a population. They are intermittent, specialized and transitory. They can be picked up and cast off; they can thrive and wither. If acquired habits and skills are the most pertinent and plausible sources of changes in visual experience within culture, we need not posit a pervasive, entrenched and uniform "way of seeing." It is very likely that a wide variety of perceptual abilities is at work in any given period, and this state of affairs casts doubt on the initial assumption that a single "mode of perception" rules an epoch.</p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Bordwell's argument makes perfect sense when considering the rhetoric of vision scaffolding the <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> contest of 1919. While it is true that Vonberg and the <i>Morgenpost</i> writers argue that the sense of seeing has somehow changed for the worse as a result of urban development and recent historical events, they hold the view that different modes of vision might be more or less applicable and useful in different social or material circumstances and that the newly altered urban mode of 

<b></b>

vision might be influenced to mutate to one more appropriate for the maintenance of social order. They thus mobilize their own version of a "history of vision" distinct from that attributed to Benjamin and others by the "revisionist historians" criticized by Bordwell. Theirs is one that implies a diversity of ways of seeing within modern perceptual and social life.  </p>

<p>According to Bordwell, once we recognize that the modern mode of vision is not absolute, the usefulness of the "history-of-vision" doctrine in its entirety must be reconsidered. The same can be argued for cases such as the <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> contest, where the modern mode of vision, while posited as distinct, was not necessarily theorized as absolute. Bordwell is resolute that, "given the social determination of perception, there would seem to be no voluntary going back. If people can slip out of synchronization with the new mode of seeing or slide back to earlier modes, the history-of-vision account loses a good deal of explanatory power" (<i>HFS</i>, 143). In answer to those theorists who would argue not for singular, but for plural and uneven, development, Bordwell counters: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>But to accept this view we would need a more refined historical account than we have yet seen. How did very sweeping economic and social changes create different ways of seeing among various groups? Did the clerks and shopgirls who flocked to the cinema possess a different mode of perceiving the world than blue-collar workers who stepped in fresh from the assembly line? Middle-class citizens were exposed to advertising, traffic and sidewalk crowds; shouldn't they have developed the same distracted perception as other classes?</p>

<p class="continued">He rightly insists that those investigating shifts in modes of vision in this time period should pay careful attention to the different experiences of different classes (and, as he implies very indirectly, gender) in order to account for disparities among both perceptual and representational practices. </p>

<p>In addition to offering an opportunity to understand the state of society and culture in Berlin in the immediate postwar era, the <i>Open </i><small class="caps">y</small><i>our </i><small class="caps">e</small><i>yes!</i> event issues an invitation to meet Bordwell's challenge to pay much closer attention to the historical circumstances affecting perception and to the precise terms mobilized when theorists of the time described the relationship between history and vision. A more rigorous historical analysis of this kind might allow us to diversify our understanding of the history of vision without having to jettison the validity of that pursuit altogether.  </p>

<p>Even if we could in fact test scientifically how, and how well, vision operated in 1840 as opposed to 1919 or in the city compared to a small town, we would still remain unable to access directly the physical operation itself because the semiotic screens of 1840, 1919, and our own time and place would always mediate our understanding of the results. That given, the question that arises when we attempt to answer Bordwell is, what are the historical circumstances that determine the network of signifiers to which the subject was in fact subject in a given time and place? To proceed any further, it becomes necessary to investigate the motivations and methods of the institutions that have placed a vested interest in the operation of vision in not just the cultural 

<b></b>

and economic, but also the social and political, spheres of modern urban life. In the particular case of the <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> event, we are able to understand how specific agents representing specific agencies mobilized certain standards of vision in a specific political and social context. The most relevant agencies in the <i>Open Your Eyes! </i>case are the press and the police. </p>

<p>Since they are not intended to offer a fully elaborated philosophical or cultural theory of vision, the texts surrounding the <i>Morgenpost</i> contest do not indicate whether the agents and agencies involved believed that in earlier times and in rural environments vision was somehow purer or more direct; they simply argue that it was more reliable. Vision in those scenarios was always already experienced in terms that had been negotiated socially and linguistically, regardless of whether this is acknowledged in the texts.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  What is most important is to notice that recent events in Berlin's history had created a historical field in which the senses were felt to have become inappropriately distorted, and the police and the press set about mitigating that distortion in order to affect the social and political field.  </p>

<p>With the mitigation of visual and social distortion as their goal, Vonberg and the <i>Morgenpost</i> staff do not rhetorically separate the physiological act of seeing from the social interactions in which it was operating. In that regard they can be seen to follow Simmel's theory of urban perception more than they presage Benjamin's Weimar texts, which are much more direct and universalizing in their argument on the shift of the sensory apparatus. Like Simmel, Vonberg formulates the shift in perception in geographic terms (rural versus urban) that have temporal implications (before urban modernity and since). The temporal terms had permeated the preceding <i>Morgenpost</i> articles, but his was the first to make the geographic angle of the argument explicit. Vonberg built on, for example, the 13 November article that had insisted that the Berliner of today must give up his or her current habits and go back to a mode of observation and interaction characteristic of "then" (in German <i>damals</i>), an unnamed earlier time. Through this emphatic use of temporal markers such as "then," "today," and "now," the <i>Morgenpost</i> articles contributed to a much broader cultural discourse characterizing modernity's social changes in the specific terms of lawlessness and breakdown in communal life. A fabled golden age of decency, civility, tolerance, and mutual respect had given way to the uncomfortable realities of the contemporary city<i>, </i>wherein anonymity and carelessness promoted a lack of accountability and social authority. The advance of time, with its concomitant material and cultural shifts (including not just urbanization, but also war and revolution), appeared to have brought with it a flood of crime and violence. Despite the fact the <i>Morgenpost</i> texts did establish a distinction between the ways of the past and those of the present, the event organizers cannot be said to have taken a strictly anti-modern position. Rather than insisting upon turning back the hands of time and returning to the traditional social forms of an earlier era, the contest was intended to attempt to forge a third option by reconciling the notions of urbanity, attention to others, and community life.

Establishing Information Networks
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Lest the police come out of this complex cultural conversation badly, Vonberg insisted on underscoring in his 17 November article that problems related to crime and public disorder in the modern city were not to be blamed on the criminal justice system. That is to say, they were perceptual and social, but not administrative. According to his rhetoric, it was the press and the individual resident of the city that needed to improve, not the fundamental organization of the police. According to Vonberg, the reason that the 13 November manhunt had failed was in part because the <i>Morgenpost</i> had not supplied the public with the right kind of supporting documentation. Without the appropriate information, how were people supposed to see in a productive way? In this game of make-believe, the press had not gone far enough in assuming its pedagogical role. Vonberg insisted that in its second attempt the paper should offer written materials that could teach people to act in a cooperative way once they recognized what they saw. The suspect's photograph had been taken in the unofficial setting of the portrait studio at the Wertheim Department store, not meeting the specifications of an official mug shot taken under the conditions stipulated by the Bertillon system. Vonberg predicted that the participants would do better if they were given a detailed personal description and more background information about the wanted man's habits and traits, details that would in reality be compiled in a modern police file.  </p>

<p>One week later, the journalist returned to the streets, but by this time the public had read three articles recounting exactly where the journalist had gone on his first day of playing the fugitive (one of which was written by the reporter himself), as well a report on letters written by readers in response to the contest. They had also read a detailed outline of exactly what parts of the city Jacobsohn would be traversing during a specific time period on the second day. This time, the posters bearing the personal photo would more closely resemble a wanted poster; beneath the photograph they were to display a personal description written by Vonberg himself in the style of a police bulletin (the earlier description had been written by the <i>Morgenpost</i> staff). In its second form, the contest became even more like an actual criminal investigation. The language of the coverage changed accordingly by including more references to the contest as a "criminal experiment" and to the audience as witnesses.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In concert with this development, the 18 November <i>Morgenpost</i> notice describing the revised conditions of the search reiterated the goals of the contest and placed the role of the police even closer to the center than had been the case in any of the earlier texts. The notice stated that, "Should members of the public be inspired by the promoting of <i>Open </i><small class="caps">y</small><i>our </i><small class="caps">e</small><i>yes!</i> no longer to be occupied solely with themselves and instead to devote more attention to their fellow human beings, then they will also once again become valuable helpers to the police in criminal cases. And then the goal of the our experiment will have been met."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup> </p>

<p>The police in Berlin had already been using the printed media to report on criminal activity and recent arrests and to solicit eyewitnesses throughout the late nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, and the 1919 contest was part of their effort to renew 

<b></b>

and further formalize their programmatic commitment to doing so in the wake of the revolution. At this time, various divisions of the law enforcement apparatus were being reorganized according to principles better suited to the new democracy, and the public was being addressed as both the beneficiaries of, and potential participants in, reformed law enforcement efforts. For example, when the homicide division of the Berlin police was revamped in August 1919, an article published in the Social-Democratic paper<i>, Vorwärts</i>, announced the police force's intention to inform the city press immediately of all capital crimes in the hope that members of the public could be encouraged to come forward with useful clues.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Like the <i>Morgenpost</i> contest that was to follow three months later, this resolution acknowledged that the city's residents and the press held stakes in police activities and that they could play a proactive role in crime prevention and solution. It gestured inclusively toward individual citizens by announcing that they would now be privy to information about all—not just some—capital crimes. Yet at the same time, this August 1919 initiative made the careful stipulation that only important criminal investigators could be present at the crime scene itself. While the public and the press were being more directly invited into the process of solving murder cases, the conditions of their participation were being more strictly defined. </p>

<p>This paternalistic double movement of inclusion and restriction can also be observed in the newspaper contest. Because active collaboration with law enforcement had been proven to require a substantial degree of discernment and know-how, the police had to instill in city residents a strong sense of their rights, responsibilities, and accountability. They needed to instruct them on why, when, and how to report suspicious activity or information relevant to an investigation. The daily press offered itself as a channel for this lesson in civic participation. As adept as Vonberg was in his efforts to obfuscate a discussion of police authorities' responsibility for the disintegration of trust between themselves and the public, by voicing his concern at all, he signaled that the police were experiencing a significant legitimacy crisis.  </p>

<p>While the Social Democratic administration strove to resituate law enforcement within the context of the new parliamentary government, the public remained wary of the intentions and methods of the institution as a whole. Voices from across the political spectrum were quick to point out instances where the police may have contributed to the current social disorder—whether by responding with hostility, taking sides in the street ting, or by simply having allowed public violence to proceed unchecked. Critics on the left were especially cynical about the sincerity of the Social Democrats' claim to be distancing the new Weimar police from the law enforcement units of the Second Reich, which had served the political purpose of keeping the imperial system of governance intact. The issues of intervention versus non-intervention and of continuity versus change were particularly thorny because, according to democratic standards of policing, law enforcement must remain beyond politics. It was incumbent upon the new Weimar police force to emphasize their democratic principles and thus to distinguish their philosophies and methods from those of the earlier era without seeming to endorse a specific party (even though it was clear to all that by upholding the rule of law in 1919 they often found themselves responsible for defending the Social Democratic administration).

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>In terms of social ordering, the potential effects of the <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> contest went beyond quieting criticism of the police. They also included encouraging the community to collaborate with law enforcement officers. Berlin's citizens were converted into the coproducers of police services, both discursively through the texts addressing them in their morning paper and physically through their participation in the fictional detection event. In the reporting on the event, Vonberg and the <i>Morgenpost</i> writers openly acknowledged the public's power to coauthor the course of law enforcement. Under the new democratic administration, it was now the people's place to authorize and legitimate police power. At the close of his 17 November <i>Morgenpost</i> article, Superintendent Vonberg himself alluded to the connection between the contest results, criminal justice, and the stability of the new state with the words, "We hope, however, that this incentive might contribute to revitalizing public collaboration on recent grave cases, and that it will thus ensure the calm and peaceful work that will be the foundation for the renewal of our state."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
Sense and Self-Sufficiency 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>The amateur detection event effectively reinforced the centrality and visibility of the law enforcement apparatus, all the while contributing to the Berlin police force's effort to transform its image from that of an irritable, brutal, and imposing imperial police force to that of a calm and stable institution working cooperatively with an integrated citizenry. The new regime of control moved even farther away from old-fashioned repressive, spectacular law enforcement towards distinctly modern techniques of power at work through more superficially visible, but less forceful, networks of productive social discipline. Superintendent Vonberg's contributions to the <i>Morgenpost</i> event amounted to a cultural experiment, infiltrating and playing off aspects of the lives of Berliners that seemed separate from the imperatives of law enforcement, such as entertainment and leisure activities. The already existent popular appeal of the press and urban mass culture served as a means to naturalize surveillance and informing as an ordinary, everyday, and even enjoyable activity. The declared purposes of the game were expressed in ennobling terms such as community building, self-sufficiency, national security, and personal safety, all implicit dimensions of the new democracy. The goal was that the event would performatively transform the metropolis from the site of crime to the site of public detection and thus into a more viable national capital in the local and national imaginary. </p>

<p>According to Vonberg, the <i>Open Your Eyes! </i>project was aimed at recalibrating vision in order to produce in the citizenry a high degree of self-sufficiency: if the whole community regulated itself, the police would need to be called in as a repressive and arresting force in only extreme situations. Another promotional article from 21 November reinforced this message with its call to action: "Who will it be—civilian, patrolman, officer or imperial solider? Who will think they recognize in any old person our staff member, the one who has been shown on the posters? Who will call to him the magic words, 'Open your eyes!'?"<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  No longer the sole domain of the military and the police, 

<b></b>

law enforcement activities could just as easily be performed by a "civilian." Rank was broken with the amateur detective considered as capable as not only a patrolman, but even a high-ranking officer. By merging the reception of popular culture with police work, the event organizers aimed to reinforce and extend the law enforcement apparatus across a vast social terrain by extending its functions to the masses. </p>

<p>The contest thus falls into place as an extension of the general rise of disciplinary power described so famously by Michel Foucault in <i>Discipline and Punish</i>. Becoming ever more elaborate in its operation since its emergence in eighteenth-century European society, modern discipline has entailed a mobile, diffuse network of power within culture. While it does involve supervisory institutions such as the police, discipline also extends to institutions that are assumed to be serving functions other than surveillance, penalization, or incarceration, enforcing what Foucault describes as "a whole set of instruments, techniques, procedures, levels of application, [and] targets."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Tony Bennett's reinterpretation of Foucault's description of the Panopticon in the context of the modern museum provides a useful framework for discussing how and why certain kinds of visual activities have been mobilized by the state and its institutions to win over city audiences.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Unlike Foucault's model, where individuals become docile out of their internalization of an awareness of being visually supervised without looking back at the invisible authorities, the <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> event urged everyone to take a participatory role in the task of seeing and then acting on the basis of what one has seen. In this regard, it functioned as a modern urban spectacle in the sense of the term as described by Vanessa Schwartz. It reconstituted the masses of Berlin as a collective of urban spectators enjoying a shared visual experience and thus contributed to the effort to democratize social and political relations.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> </p>

<p>By rewarding a participatory rather than passive mode of looking (spotting the suspect) and asking readers to then act on the basis of that looking (arresting the man), the contest organizers introduced the notion of play and allowed the public a different, if not stronger, sense of voluntary cooperation and mobility than had been the case in imperial social ordering efforts. This did, however, cost them a degree of control, for with participatory play comes uncertainty and the potential for transgression. Exact outcomes were not predictable, but the goal was that these outcomes would always be socially productive. </p>

<p>Indeed, the <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> idea failed on the first day, putting into question whether Berlin's populace was up to the task of participating in the regulation of their own city space. The contest finally ended two weeks later when a thirteen-year-old boy named Willi Czerwinski managed to identify the anonymous journalist on the basis of a photograph that he and his brothers had ripped from a poster hung on one of the city's ubiquitous advertising columns, or <i>Litfaßsäulen</i>. Ironically, their success was predicated not only on the destruction of public property, but also on taking the image out of the view of other participants in their neighborhood. Yet it aroused no direct criticism from the authorities. The small insurrection was reported in the <i>Morgenpost</i> with a laughing tone of tolerance, for ultimately the boys' gesture helped them and their competitors who read about their success to see the city according to the contest's terms. Even 

<b></b>

though they tore the poster down, they still played along and consequently were treated as harmless adolescents on their way to becoming good citizens.  </p>

<p>Although the reporting made it clear that young Willi was not exactly the winner the paper organizers had originally had in mind, in the overall picture he fit the bill. He came from a family of five children being raised in a working-class neighborhood on the southeastern side of Berlin by a widower mother and <i>Morgenpost</i> subscriber struggling to make ends meet. He and his family thus belonged to exactly the group that the Social Democrats needed to work the hardest to win over from the more radical causes on the left and right. According to the paper, Willi was a public hero for a day. His arrest of Jacobsohn inspired crowds to gather and emit glory cheers for the young man who had done what none of them could—outwit the clever journalist and win a victory for the people.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In contrast to the newspaper's view, in his mother's eyes Willi's vigilance was impressive not because of what it signified about the boy's wit or participatory ethic. Her remarks in the paper made it clear that Willi's win was meaningful to her because of the much-needed money it brought into their household.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  (She had little positive to say about in the boy in general. When he had originally set out to find Jacobsohn, she had told him he never would because he was simply too dumb too succeed.) It would seem from the tone of the <i>Morgenpost </i>reporting that her devotion to the paper and the centrist positions it stood for were all but assured after this event; however, because her good feelings were based on economic rather than political grounds, her support for the paper was more tenuous than the <i>Morgenpost</i> claimed.  </p>

<p>Reading the paper, watching their fellow citizens vigilantly, and reporting on crime were cultural and social means by which such urban subjects could gain agency and satisfaction. All the same, it is important to recognize that such rewards were available to them only as participants in already existing mechanisms of power centered in law enforcement. By mobilizing the language of the senses in the mass media, journalists and police representatives naturalized this process of civic involvement by locating its functions within the parameters of the citizen's very body. Such a model of disciplining (or calibration in Fritzsche's terms) was geared equally toward generating faith and trust within the populace and placing the police at the center of civil society. Events such as <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> used the media to put the function of policing into the hands and eyes of the citizenry, which had the effect of inscribing law enforcement more broadly into daily life. Neither the police nor the paper ever intended to allow detection to be loosed from its gravitational center at police headquarters, which for the time being was a Social Democratic establishment. </p>

<b>Abstract</b>
<p>Focusing on the period from 1910 to 1915, this article argues that Richard Wagner's work was crucial to the development of American cinema. Critics and artists not only advocated Wagner's composition techniques for film accompaniment, but also turned Wagner into an emblem for far broader reforms. These reforms included a greater integration of music and film, a conception of film as a high art, and a conception of film as a medium for national purification and bourgeoisification. These reforms, and their connection to Wagner, helped set the stage for the use of "The Ride of the Valkyries" in D. W. Griffith's <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> .</p>

<p id="lead">On 21 June, 2003, <i>Reuters</i> issued the following report: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>BAGHDAD—U.S. troops psyched up on a bizarre musical reprise from Vietnam war film "Apocalypse Now" before crashing into Iraqi homes to hunt gunmen on Saturday, as Shi'ite Muslims rallied against the U.S. occupation of Iraq.</p>
<p>With Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" still ringing in their ears and the clatter of helicopters overhead, soldiers rammed vehicles into metal gates and hundreds of troops raided houses in the western city of Ramadi after sunrise as part of a drive to quell a spate of attacks on U.S. forces.</p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The reference, of course, is to the famous sequence from Francis Ford Coppola's <i>Apocalypse Now </i>, the aerial charge on a Vietnamese village where Colonel Kilgore "psyches up" his troops by blaring "Ride of the Valkyries" out of his approaching attack helicopters. Coppola's scene, in turn, satirizes the "Ride of the Valkyries" accompaniment to the climactic charge of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Colonel Cameron, at the end of D. W. Griffith's <i>The Birth of a Nation </i>. Throughout the <i>Apocalypse Now</i> sequence, Coppola plants clues—the horse-head "cavalry" emblem on the nose of the copters; the similar names of the charging officers (Colonel Cameron, Colonel Kilgore); the racist invective of Colonel Kilgore ("Yeah, I use Wagner—scares the hell out of the slopes!")—to make his satire of <i>Birth</i> explicit. Flying with Kilgore's cavalry, we are returned to a primal site of American film, and simultaneously to a source of modern performance technology: to <i>Birth</i> and to Bayreuth. Fast-forwarding back to twenty-first-century Baghdad, with seven generations 

<b></b>

of Valkyries at our back, the motif refuses to die. But the motif is repeated, this time, with cynical rather than satiric intent, as Coppola's critique of Griffith's use of Wagner becomes just another soundtrack to war. </p>

<p>American film music continues to be deeply indebted to Wagner's techniques of composition and orchestration, particularly his conception of the total work of art (or <i>Gesamtkunstwerk</i>), his technique of composing with leitmotifs, and his idea that an opera score should comprise a single, unending melody.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Contemporary American film composers such as John Williams, with his pulsing, neoromantic scores, his readily identifiable motifs marking both characters and themes within the film, and his attempt to make the film score a symphonic whole, are simply unimaginable without Wagner—and that is to say nothing of the subject matter of many of the films Williams scores, such as the six-part <i>Star Wars</i> epic, with its narrative of galactic salvation by an order of mystic, pure-blooded knights. Moreover, the "Ride of the Valkyries" motif in particular has a complex history in American film, beginning with its use in <i>Birth</i> and passing, after American entry into the Second World War, into satire and parody. In works such as Disney's anti-Nazi short "Education for Death" , Chuck Jones's Bugs Bunny short "What's Opera Doc?" , and the Dan Aykroyd/John Belushi vehicle <i>The Blues Brothers</i> , the motif's associations with stereotypically Germanic bloodlust are put to comic effect. </p>

<p><i>The Birth of a Nation</i>, however, is the first and most famous of these Wagnerian references. Griffith's film is of course seminal in film history; it is also, more specifically, the most important work in the history of Wagner and American cinema.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  But <i>Birth </i>was not <i>sui generis</i>. Indeed, the discussion of Wagner's importance for the transformation of American film—and, more broadly, for the transformation of American culture—predated <i>Birth</i> by at least five years. Understanding the discourse of Wagner and film in the years before 1915 helps us make sense of Griffith's use of Wagner in <i>Birth</i>, as well as Griffith's indebtedness to a larger process of film reform. But it also makes clear the startling originality of Griffith's contribution to American Wagner reception. "It is like writing history with lightning. And my only regret is that it is all so terribly true," was Woodrow Wilson's famous (if possibly apocryphal) reaction to <i>Birth</i>. Wilson's description had it half-right: <i>Birth</i> was anything but "terribly true," but it was spectacular, blinding, electrical. Griffith's masterpiece marked a new chapter not only in the integration of film elements with one another, but in the integration of Northern and Southern whites, two totalizing projects produced under the sign of Wagner. </p>

<p>For a sense of Wagner's influence on early American film we should first turn to a weekly entitled <i>The Moving Picture World </i>(henceforth abbreviated <i>MPW</i>), an influential

<b></b>

 advocate in the 1910s for fundamental reforms in the way films were produced, exhibited, and received.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  In the five years prior to the release of <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>, regular contributors to <i>MPW</i> regularly advocated Wagner as a model for the transformation of film into a high art. In the pages of the periodical, Wagner was made to play both symbolic and practical roles in this process of transition from a cinema of attractions to a cinema of narrative integration. Symbolically, Wagner was held up as an icon of the aesthetic unity toward which film reformers were striving in the early twentieth century. More practically, Wagner's composition techniques were urged on film composers as useful tools for the construction of the film scores that might complement the longed for art-film of the future. </p>

<p>The earliest advocate of Wagner in <i>MPW</i> was a practicing accompanist named Clarence E. Sinn<i>. </i>His column "Music for the Picture," which appeared regularly from 1910 to 1916, ran beneath a banner associating "the 'Cue Music Man'" with the church organist and concert pianist, thus implying the column's mission of raising the lowly film accompanist to loftier artistic status. (<a href="#1"> 1</a>) While the regular column began on 26 November, 1910, Sinn's first essay for the journal was a four-paragraph piece that appeared on 16 April, 1910. Sinn took the occasion of his first essay to point to Wagner as an inspiration for the future of film music. After complaining about the "anachronisms and absurdities" that disturb film exhibition (he was particularly upset by one pianist who played the mock-chivalric music-hall ballad "I Dreamt That I Dwelt in Marble Halls" as accompaniment to a Biblical film), Sinn wrote: "Just as Wagner fitted his music to the emotions, expressed by words in his operas, so in the course of time, no doubt, the same thing will be done with regard to the moving picture" (<i>MPW</i>, 590). The reformation of the art of film accompaniment—indeed, the understanding of film accompaniment <i>as</i> an art—implied much broader reformations in the industry. Sinn singled out the first tentative moves by some film companies to print bulletins describing what sort of music to play alongside their pictures. It was a promising development, but "only one step, and that a preliminary step, towards the provision of proper music." In subsequent columns Sinn continued to applaud the issuing of cue sheets with films, and began, on 17 December, 1910, to offer his own musical settings for particular pictures. Similarly, he encouraged exhibitors to complement their "display of moving pictures by good music, both vocal and instrumental" (25 June, 1910; <i>MPW</i>, 1092). One New York theatre furnished a "good example" of this by combining "High-grade Motion Pictures" with "selections from Rigoletto and Lucia" by the Grand Opera Quartette in a "clean, cool, airy, home-like Auditorium" (25 June, 1910; <i>MPW</i>, 1092). Opera selections, even when not by Wagner, tended to raise the grade of film exhibition, and, at least in principle, the class of film audiences. </p>

<p>Nine months later, Sinn's column included a letter from G. H. Hummel of Chicago, a fellow film accompanist and Wagner enthusiast. After complaining that "nine out of ten piano players don't know how to play for a picture," Hummel described his own technique: 

<b></b>

 </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>First of all I read all the stories of moving pictures, and make it my business to see them before they are shown at the theatre where I am employed. But there, when playing the pictures myself, I follow the rules laid down by the great R. Wagner in his splendid music dramas, by using the leading motives of the "Nibelungen Ring," "Tristan and Isolde," etc. I attach a certain theme to each person in the picture and work them out, in whatever form the occasion may call for, not forgetting to use popular strains if necessary.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(14 January, 1911; <i>MPW</i>, 76)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->




<p class="continued">After excerpting Hummel's endorsement of Wagner, Sinn returned to his old, related theme of the need for film cue sheets. Here again he supplied accompaniment suggestions of his own, this time remarking that a film entitled "The Wise Druggist" should end with the "Bridal chorus from 'Lohengrin'." </p>

<p>The following week, Sinn was once more exploring the issue "of working up dramatic pictures in accordance with the thematic principles as laid down by Wagner" (21 January, 1911; <i>MPW</i>, 135). Sinn examined Wagner's importance in greater detail than before, focusing on the leitmotif in particular. After directing his readers to "Wagner's theoretical writings, 'Art and Revolution,' 'The Art-Work of the Future,' and 'Opera and the Drama,'" Sinn boiled down Wagner's methods to what he considered their essence. </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>To each important character, to each important action, motive, and idea, and to each important object (Siegmund's sword, for example), was attached a suggestive musical theme. Whenever the action brought into prominence, any of the characters, motives, or objects, its theme or motif was sung or played. . . . Such a method of applying music to the pictures is the ideally perfect one, and if it could be universally carried out, would leave nothing to be desired.</p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">While leitmotifs may prove the ideal form of film music, Wagner had more to teach the film accompanist than motif structure. "In addition to his leitmotifs," wrote Sinn, "Wagner employed scenic, or descriptive music, and this idea, too, comes well within the lines of moving picture music."  </p>

<p>And yet, for all of his enthusiasm, Sinn initially had trouble distinguishing Wagner's compositional style from that of melodrama. "I have touched on this thematic idea several times in previous articles," Sinn noted, "although I was merely following the old melodramatic form of attaching a certain easily-remembered melody to each of the principal characters. The germ of the idea is much the same, though of a simple and primitive form" (21 January, 1911; <i>MPW</i>, 135). While the Wagnerian method is essentially an "elaborate" form of the "old melodramatic" technique, Sinn saw it as a 

<b></b>

useful system for accompanists, who must learn not only to attach themes to specific characters but to fit their themes into the larger mood of the picture: "The principal theme of the story centers around the principal character, or characters, of course, and any musical themes given to these characters must be in harmony with the general tendency of the picture."  </p>

<p>Sinn's appeals to musical and thematic unity were characteristic of the larger project of film reform pressed for by <i>MPW</i>. A good example of this project may be found in the same issue as the column just quoted. Alongside such typical features as an essay urging that screenwriting be treated as an art form and a column on film's potential for mass education and improvement, we find a screed against so-called "Jackass Music" by Louis Reeves Harrison, a regular columnist for the journal.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  (<a href="#2"> 2</a>) Harrison's target was the supposedly slipshod and attention-grabbing musical accompaniment that marred film exhibition. Harrison personified the problem in the character of "Lily Limpwrist": </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>O, what a noise when the lights are turned low and Lily Limpwrist takes her place at the usual instrument of torture! With a self-conscious smirk she gives a poke to her back switch, dabs her side teasers with both patties, rolls up her sleeves and tears off "That Yiddisher Rag." She bestows a calm smile on the box-of-candy young man in the first row, but the presentation on the screen fails to divert her "I-seen-you" glances any more than if it was the point of the joke.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>MPW</i>, 124)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Harrison's gendering of the bad accompanist recalls Kathy Peiss's point that "movies altered women's participation in the world of public, commercial amusements." Comprising 40 percent of the working-class movie audience in 1910, women found in nickelodeons a public space that "transcended generational lines and marital status." As a result, "many middle-class reformers and writers expressed a concern that the nickelodeons, like the dance halls, would quickly become public spaces for undue familiarity between the sexes."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  </p>

<p>There are racial and ethnic implications to the attack as well. Harrison's reference to "That Yiddisher Rag" recalls the frequent association of "bad" working-class urban culture with Jewishness, and suggests the threat of a Jewess on frivolous young dandies. But Jewishness is only one of several ethnic codes here. In the accompanying illustration, Lily is pictured singing the popular mock-Irish music-hall ballad, "Has Anybody Here Seen Kelly?", the chorus of which ran, "Sure his hair is red, his eyes are blue, / And he's Irish through and through, / Has anybody here seen Kelly? / Kelly from the Emerald Isle." (<a href="#3"> 3</a>) Finally, Lily's flared bottom in the illustration recalls a stereotype of another sort: the racist grotesques of black female physiognomy, with their pendulous thighs and bulbous buttocks. Lily, then, is presented as a hybrid of threatening racial codes—Jewish, Irish, and black—all of which, in combination, suggest the danger of urban mongrelization. As such, Lily personifies the (troubling) heterogeneity of early cinema spectatorship.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Moreover, Lily's gender and race(s) are inextricably linked to her aesthetic crime: the fact that she destroys any hope for a unified artwork at the nickelodeon. In the illustration, while Lily makes eyes at her "gentleman friend" and bangs 

<b></b>

out her Irish tune, she ignores the film above her, which shows a "DEATH SCENE" of what is apparently a small child mourned by its parents. In a manner characteristic of the journal, Harrison depicted the heterogeneity of the nickelodeon as threatening cacophony. "All other parts of the theatrical working force move in harmony, like the wheels of a clock, but these fatheads against the stage apron are like the clock alarm that goes off when you don't need it and never when you do" (<i>MPW</i>, 125).  </p>

<p>For film reformers such as Sinn and Harrison, what film performance desperately needed was a systematic unification of its component parts. The period when these essays appeared (1910–11) was a transitional one in American film history. Coming between what Tom Gunning has called the "cinema of attractions" (roughly pre-1907) and the "cinema of narrative integration" (roughly post-1913), the issues of <i>MPW</i> that first discussed Wagner's importance for film were part of a general transformation.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In many ways closer to the performance practices of circuses, exhibitions, lectures, and vaudeville than to those of subsequent cinema, the "cinema of attractions" emphasized heterogeneous performance, audience agency, and explicit demands for spectatorial 

<b></b>

attention. According to Gunning, "the cinema of attractions directly solicits spectator attention, inciting visual curiosity, and supplying pleasure through an exciting spectacle—a unique event, whether fictional or documentary, that is of interest in itself. . . . It is the direct address of the audience, in which an attraction is offered to the spectator by a cinema showman, that defines this approach to filmmaking."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The emergent "cinema of narrative integration," by contrast, placed greater emphasis on suspense, depth of character, moral judgment, and unity of performance, and it sought to create an audience that would be "absorbed in a coherent fictional world, attentive to character cues and immersed in following a story."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  The transition is also one of steady bourgeoisification of the cinema, transforming it from the entertainment of the nickelodeons, frequently identified with the working class, to the entertainment of "respectable" theatres and, eventually, movie palaces, identified with the middle class. This liminal period culminated in the appearance of feature films and, ultimately, what has come to be known as "classical Hollywood cinema." </p>

<p>More specifically, writers such as Sinn and Harrison remind us that an important aspect of the transformation from a cinema of attractions to a cinema of narration was a fundamental change in the musical accompaniment of film. The cinema of attractions called for musical accompaniment that was frequently improvised, often to films that were being viewed for the first time by the accompanists themselves; it was a style of accompaniment that owed much to the practices of working-class musical halls and vaudeville, and many film accompanists also found work in such venues. The result was a relatively fragmentary and free-form interaction between picture and music, with some pictures, or some sections of pictures, being displayed to no accompaniment whatsoever, and others displayed to accompaniment that might be regarded as inappropriate.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  On occasion, this lack of unity between music and picture was a deliberate choice on the part of the accompanist. While it is difficult to tell just how often accompanists intentionally played against the grain of the picture, such deliberate disturbances occurred often enough to excite the ire of film reformers. Harrison, for example, lamented the accompanist whose "star act, the one that gets a laugh, is his imitation of a baby crying, no matter whether the one on the screen is nursing or merely dying" (21 January, 1911; <i>MPW</i>, 124). And Sinn described a similar instance: "A picture was shown some time ago containing a scene wherein Pharaoh's daughter discovers the infant Moses in the bulrushes. The pianist played 'Oh, You Kid.' He got a laugh which is probably what he wanted, but at what a sacrifice. The whole picture was dignified and serious, and the music should have sustained that character throughout." Against accompanists both slipshod and subversive, Sinn, like Harrison, pleaded that "unities be preserved" in film exhibition (26 November, 1910; <i>MPW</i>, 1227).  </p>

<p>This plea for unity led Sinn back to Wagner. In a later issue, Sinn's broad-brush understanding of Wagnerian technique was refined by another contribution from Hummel, whose second lengthy letter on Wagner's musical innovations Sinn excerpted in his column. After stressing Wagner's style of "bold chromatics and enharmonic progressions," Hummel went on to offer a two-paragraph account of Wagner's leitmotif technique (4 February, 1911; <i>MPW</i>, 235). He noted that Wagner "made of these 

<b></b>

leading motives the very framework of his music drama," demonstrating the point by leading his readers through the intertwining motifs of "Siegfried's Funeral March." The distinction between Wagnerian and melodramatic techniques of accompaniment was becoming clearer both to Sinn and to his readers: Wagnerian music-drama, unlike melodrama, is a complex and unified system of integrated leitmotifs.  </p>

<p>But if the distinction was being asserted more strongly, then so, too, was the fact that such a sophisticated musical setting would require better pictures, better accompanists, and better conditions for musical preparation and film exhibition than the old melodramatic technique of simply playing a character's musical "calling card" upon entry. Thus, after introducing Wagner's method on 21 January, Sinn lamented that, "there are films which do not so readily work out in this manner. Some of the more active ones are just one piece of 'business' after another, without developing anything in particular, until the thousand feet are up. All you can do is follow the action and not bother about motives and themes. Why should you, when the originators don't?" (<i>MPW</i>, 135). A Wagnerian mode of film accompaniment, in short, demanded a cinema of narration rather than a cinema of attractions. The transformation entailed fundamental reforms in the production and exhibition of films. In an era of enormous turnover in single-reel pictures, when many accompanists were viewing the film for the first time along with the audience, Sinn noted the necessity of having the "opportunity to study the pictures beforehand" in order "to be able to get good results." In a subsequent column, Sinn turned his attention to screenwriting, which must also be reformed if films are to become unified artworks. </p>

<p class="continued">As usual in the pages of <i>MPW</i>, reform in one branch of film implied reform everywhere.  </p>

<p>Sinn's advocacy of Wagner, then, must be set within the context of a much broader project of film reform—and indeed of social reform. It was this broader project that was subsequently taken up by another writer for <i>MPW</i>, W. Stephen Bush. Bush was a regular contributor to the journal, publishing essays there from 1908 to 1916. Like other film reformers, Bush championed the arts of screenwriting, film-music composition, and musical accompaniment, and advocated mass aesthetic and moral improvement through film. Lamenting the persecution of film by the press and the courts, Bush wrote with the hope that  </p>

<p class="continued">
He was particularly enthusiastic about adaptations of classics, and often reminded his readers that "the motion picture has taken its inspiration from Shakespeare, from Tennyson, from Robert Browning, from Longfellow, from Balzac, from Hawthorne, from Victor Hugo, from Goethe, from Cervantes, from Zola, from the two Dumas, from Mark Twain and a galaxy of other names, illustrious in the annals of mankind" (26 March, 1910; <i>MPW</i>, 462). Appropriately enough, Bush coupled his work as a film critic with appearances in New York and Philadelphia as a film lecturer. In this capacity he presented edifying films with suitable music and his own commentary, by which means he hoped to do his own part in raising the level of the masses.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> </p>

<p>Bush, like Sinn, saw Wagner's music and methods as essential to the progressive reform of film. "Every man or woman in charge of the music of a moving picture is, consciously or unconsciously, a disciple or follower of Richard Wagner," Bush wrote in the 12 August, 1911 issue, under the heading "Giving Musical Expression to the Drama" (<i>MPW</i>, 354). Bush followed this dramatic pronouncement with a short lesson in the history of opera for the readers of <i>MPW</i>. His lesson is clear: before Wagner, drama was utterly subordinated to music, with librettos serving as shoddy vehicles for great composition: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Strictly speaking, the modern school before Wagner (to distinguish it from the music of the ancient Greeks) did not as its primary object seek to give "musical expression to the drama," but subordinated the drama to the music and the libretto became more or less of an excuse for clever orchestration. . . . As a result we have some of the finest operas, supported by librettos that border on the idiotic.</p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Pre-Wagnerian opera, in Bush's view, was more an occasion for the exhibition of musical virtuosity than of great art. As though writing a capsule version of Wagner's own <i>Opera and Drama</i>, Bush described the halting attempts by "pre-Wagnerian masters" to break free from sorts of "narrow and technical rules" personified by "<i>Hans Sachs</i> in the 'Meistersinger'" (presumably Bush meant Beckmesser). At last salvation arrived, as "Wagner with the boldness of genius cracked the old molds and once more gave back to music its noblest function, which must always be that of 'giving musical expression to the drama'." Quoting at length from Bernard Shaw's argument in <i>The Perfect Wagnerite</i> that Wagner's <i>Ring</i> perfectly integrated music and drama, Bush at last brought his thesis to bear on film practices. Like Sinn and Hummel, Bush stressed Wagner's leitmotif technique, emphasizing that these motifs (unlike, implicitly, the use of musical themes in nineteenth-century melodrama) are "susceptible of variation and adaptation," offering "new and wonderful opportunities for splendid moving picture music" (<i>MPW</i>, 355). More than this, Wagner's suitability for film suggested that "Wagner's music-dramas could be adapted for the moving picture theatre." Such an adaptation would be possible even "without synchronization in the strictest sense of the word"; that is, film technology would not need to wait for the arrival of synchronized sound (which might, after all, prove impossible) before attempting a film adaptation of a Wagner opera.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Indeed, as Bush pointed out in a subsequent article, such a film had already been attempted and had proven at least a partial success. <i>Parsifal</i> , directed by Edwin S. Porter (responsible, just the year previously, for <i>The Great Train Robbery</i>), was cinematically daring in that it was produced with the initial intent of synchronizing the picture with music prerecorded on Edison cylinders, and was heavily advertised by Edison. While this early experiment in synchronized sound soon proved a failure and was dropped before the film's release—the film was an eventual box-office disappointment—Porter's <i>Parsifal</i> nevertheless suggested possibilities for the integrated film of the future.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  The film was, according to Bush, "done very creditably indeed" despite the fact that, in the end, "there was no attempt even at musical synchronizing," and that "moving picture audiences at that time were not ready for productions of this kind" (2 September, 1911; <i>MPW,</i> 608). Bush predicted that such enterprises would only improve with time, both in quality and popularity, and was especially enthusiastic about the possibilities of a film version of <i>Tristan and Isolde</i>, which, if produced, would not only advance film towards its highest ideal, but advance, too, the arts of screenwriting and film music: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Here the possibilities for moving picture adaptation with a number of strongly developed central themes from the opera as musical accompaniment lie on the surface.

If the two last-named work together intelligently and both are possessed of some understanding of Wagner, theoretical as well as practical, the production of a great and attractive novelty in the moving picture field seems reasonably certain.</p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Screenwriting and musical accompaniment for film—barely considered art forms at all in the period—were now elevated to "sister-arts" along Wagnerian lines. To make the point clearer, Bush proceeded to quote at length from Wagner's theorization of the sister-arts in <i>Artwork of the Future</i>, and ended his column by throwing down the gauntlet to film producers: "What manufacturer, in alliance with musical skill and genius, will give us the first example of instrumental synchronization of Wagnerian opera?"  </p>

<p>A fully synchronized Wagner film was not on the immediate horizon, but Wagner's operas and music were nevertheless increasingly present in American moviehouses.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Indeed, the very next year, 1912, saw the international release of two new film versions of Wagner operas, <i>Parsifal</i> and <i>Siegfried</i>, by the Italian company Ambrosio Films.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  More broadly, musical motifs and selections from Wagner operas were becoming frequent features of film-accompaniment cue sheets and collections. When Erno Rapée's popular <i>Encyclopedia of Music for Pictures</i> was published in New York in 1925, for example, it told film accompanists that Wagner was "the greatest dramatic Composer of all ages," and that the long history of opera from its origins to Wagner is "a transitory period which we may neglect because it was Richard Wagner who established the fundamental principles of the music drama of today." Moreover, Wagner's technique of the "'Leit Motiv'" "is the one which can best be applied in scoring pictures." Rapée 

<b></b>

further noted that, in the previous few years, "excerpts from the Wagnerian Operas such as the Valkyries Ride, Wotan's Farewell, etc." had entered the "repertoire of every fair size movie orchestra."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The main function of Rapée's <i>Encyclopedia</i> was to provide recommendations of musical selections to match different moods or scenarios, and selections from Wagner feature prominently throughout the volume. While the volume came a decade after <i>The Birth of the Nation</i>, it indicates how widespread the use of Wagner had become by the mid-1920s.  </p>

<p>In the first two decades of the twentieth century, Wagnerian fragments and motifs were rapidly becoming a staple of American film music. Simultaneously, the advocacy of cinema as high art, of narrative cinema, of film music composition as an art form, of a more seamless integration of music and film, of the use of film for mass improvement were all linked to Wagner's music, his drama, and his method. All these elements of film reform would be sharply advanced by <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>. <i>Birth</i> featured, not incidentally, the most fully integrated score of its time, and climaxed in the repeated strains of Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries."  </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
<i>The Birth of a Nation</i> and Wagner 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>When <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> was released, many saw in it not only the depiction of a nation reborn but the birth of a whole new aesthetic form: the motion picture masterpiece. "Few who have seen <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> would deny the birth of a new art—and a new artist," read Sir Herbert Tree's <i>New York Times</i> article of 30 January, 1916. The response was entirely typical. "If there is to be a greater picture than <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>, may we live to see it" (<i>Dramatic Mirror</i> [New York]); "Griffith is the present day Homer of the motion picture" (<i>Motion Picture News</i>); "[<i>Birth</i>] goes to prove that when Americans are willing to take time and pains they can produce artistic results as remarkable as those attained in any other country" (<i>The Globe</i>); and so on.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Such enthusiasm was not limited to critics. According to Epoch Producing Organization and D. W. Griffith, Inc., the film had shown to over 100 million people by 1924; by 1955 that number had roughly doubled.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  This unprecedented popularity—countered by expressions of outrage also unprecedented in American film history—made <i>Birth </i>far and away the most profitable film of its time, a mark that would not be surpassed until the release, more than two decades later, of <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i>.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The composer of <i>Birth</i>'s score, Joseph Carl Breil, was a film reformer at the forefront of the nascent art of film-music "compilation" and composition. Breil had earlier conducted as well as shaped the score to the Italian epic <i>Cabiria</i>  in its performances in Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Widely celebrated as the most professionally produced and most musically integrated film prior to <i>Birth</i>, <i>Cabiria </i>was met with acclamation by American film reformers. In Sinn's words, <i>Cabiria</i> was "perfectly standardized and can be set to music once and for all, as perfectly as a glove fits a hand" (19 December, 1914: <i>MPW</i>, 1690). For Sinn, <i>Cabiria</i> marked the first great step toward "a combination of music and drama [that] will be established as a permanent form of art"; it suggested that the long predicted "wedding" of music and film "must 

<b></b>

come." Breil's pioneering work on <i>Cabiria</i> and a 1912 Sarah Bernhardt vehicle, <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, led the <i>San Francisco Chronicle </i>to dub him, in 1914, a "Future Wagner" of the "New Art Form" of "Music and 'Movies'."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>   </p>

<p>If <i>Cabiria</i> was the engagement ceremony of music and moving picture, then <i>Birth</i> was the marriage. Accompanied by orchestras ranging up to fifty pieces in size (and, after the post-First World War revival of the film, up to ninety pieces), <i>Birth</i> introduced many audiences not only to a new sort of film, but to conventions of grand opera and symphonic music (the latter of which was largely unheard on the West Coast before 1915).<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  <i>The Chicago Examiner</i>, like numerous publications from the period, marveled over the film's integration of music and picture: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Of importance is the music. It consists of an elaborate symphony score arranged after Griffith's suggestions of the musical motifs of the leading characters. Now grave, now gay; now sounding the loud diapason of war; again sweetly harmonizing love's sighs and rhapsodies; anon bringing back the old plantation melodies, or the crash of riot and rapine. . . . It fits the changing scenes like a flowing, beautiful garment.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>In a 1916 essay in <i>Metronome,</i> Breil discussed the development of his compositional style from <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> through <i>Birth</i>. Echoing the aspirations of the film reformers of <i>MPW</i>, Breil wrote that, with <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, he "suddenly awoke to the possibilities of the 'Moving Picture.' Here was a real drama played by the greatest of artists. I realized at once that trivial musical work would not do, and set to work to write a score that would portray human emotions from a truly dignified point of view." The demand for a more "dignified" picture led Breil, as it had Sinn and Bush, straight back to Wagner. "With the limited means of a small orchestra put at my disposal then, I set to work and wrote a dramatic score built very much upon the motif lines set down by Richard Wagner. That was about six years ago, and the score to <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> was the first original score ever composed (in the world) for a 'Movie'." Describing the development of his composition style after <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, Breil wrote that "the seed sown at that time has borne fruit" in <i>Birth </i>and <i>Intolerance</i>—but hoped, also, that some day the film score would be "entirely original in composition and construction."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> </p>

<p>It was contact with Griffith that enabled Breil's style to "bear fruit." For Griffith too placed great importance on the thorough integration of film and music, an integration he placed at the heart of his work on <i>Birth</i>. He had "decided notions on the arranging of music for pictures," according to Grace Kingsley's column in the<i> Los Angeles Times</i> on 8 February, 1915. The article, one of the first to mention Breil in connection to the film, emphasized not only Griffith's "grand-opera" aspirations, but more specifically the use of leitmotifs to capture both characters and moods.  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This reconception of film along operatic lines, and especially in ways that recalled Wagner, was a very conscious decision on the part of both Griffith and Breil. The ambition marked a fundamental transformation in film scoring. Griffith was one of the first, if not the first, to list his composer in the film credits, and, to a degree unprecedented in film history, the score to <i>Birth </i>was a complex creation closely integrated into the larger organic unity of the moving picture. </p>

<p> Indeed, so heavily involved was Griffith in the scoring of the film that it remains debatable just how much of the score was contributed by Breil and how much by Griffith himself. The composer and the director spent two months working on the score together, and Lillian Gish recalled them collaborating closely. In Gish's account, they particularly fought over the use of Wagner, and, even more particularly, over the use of the "Valkyries" motif. </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Mr. Breil would play bits and pieces, and he and Mr. Griffith would then decide on how they were to be used. . . .</p>
<p>The two men had many disagreements over the scoring of the film. "If I ever kill anyone," Mr. Griffith once said, "it won't be an actor but a musician." The greatest dispute was over the Klan call, which was taken from "The Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner. Mr. Griffith wanted a slight change in the notes. Mr. Breil fought against making it.</p>
<p>"You can't tamper with Wagner!" he protested. "It's never been done!"</p>
<p>This music wasn't <i>primarily</i> music, Mr. Griffith explained. It was music for motion pictures. Even Giulio Gatta-Casazza, General Director of the Metropolitan Opera, agreed that the change was fine. Finally Mr. Breil agreed to it.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">On the surface, it was a predictable debate between a Wagner purist and a director hoping to use Wagner's music for his own ends. But to frame the debate in this way would be to obscure the fact that Griffith, in insisting that the "Valkyries" motif be altered to better serve the aesthetic whole, may have been truer to the spirit of the total work of art.  </p>

<p>Praising the film as a remarkably successful "marriage of music and spectacle," Harlow Hare, writing for the <i>Boston American</i>, enthused that, </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>one of the most effective features of <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> production is its really brilliant musical setting. During the two hours and a half which the big film requires, the orchestra plays <i>an arrangement which perfectly fits the unfolding story</i> and which includes many of the finest bits of melody extant. The library of the old masters and the collections of <i>songs and ballads of the 60's have alike been rifled to make up the score of The Birth of a Nation</i>. (my italics)<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> 

<b></b>

 </p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">For Hare as for other period reviewers, the "perfect fit" between music and image was a noteworthy element of the production. But there is a telling juxtaposition in this description as well. On one hand, in the manner of a film reformer, Hare celebrated the <i>Birth</i> score as a symphonic synthesis—not only of "music and spectacle" but of "the finest bits of music" with one another. On the other hand, in the manner of a "cinema-of-attractions" accompanist, he wrote enthusiastically of the musical libraries and collections having "been rifled to make up the score." And, indeed, the mélange of popular tunes and "great works" excerpts mentioned by Hare startles with its disparateness. In his account of the standards that Breil incorporated into his score, Hare provided a remarkably detailed, and largely accurate, list: "Comin' Thro' the Rye," "Bonnie Blue Flag," "Dixie," "My Maryland," "Marching through Georgia," "Tramp, Tramp, Tramp! the Boys are Marching," "Kingdom Coming," "Girl I Left Behind Me," "Home, Sweet Home," "Taps," "The Star Spangled Banner," "America," "In the Gloaming," Suppe's "Light Cavalry Overture," Weber's "Freischutz Overture," Grieg's "In the Halls of the Mountain King," Breil's own "Perfect Song," Tscaikowsky's "1812 Overture," the "'Gloria' from Haydn's Mass in C," Hermann's "Cocoanut Dance," the "Zampa Overture," Wagner's "Rienzi Overture," the "Fire Music from 'Die Walkure' and 'The Ride of the Valkyries,'" plus assorted "Wagnerian operatic crashes" that "accompany the cannonading and infantry charging at Petersburg." (Intriguingly, the only piece Hare lists that does not actually appear in the score is the "Fire Music" from <i>Die Walküre</i>.) While intended to suggest something like grand totality<i>,</i> such a list comes dangerously close to mere concatenation.  </p>

<p>Synthesis or pastiche: this is the dilemma that <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> never fully resolves. All the more so since the musical fragments of <i>Birth</i>'s score were generally, according to Martin Miller Marks, "inserted into the score by means of scissors and paste."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Ironically, this musical collage technique may have been especially true of the film's climactic use of Wagner. As Marks has shown, Breil's score linked together two distinct passages from the beginning of Act III of <i>Die Walküre</i>, and compressed two of Wagner's measures into one. The whole excerpt was meant to be inserted into the film at two points: during the first Klan rescue at Piedmont, and the second at the cabin.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Most tellingly, the second playing of the "Valkyries" motif was meant to be repeated until the accompanist saw the title screen "Disarming the blacks," whereupon the accompanist was immediately to cease playing the "Valkyries" motif and proceed to "Dixie," which would be played through a scene of blacks dropping their weapons and running away. (<a href="#4"> 4</a>) As a result, the "Valkyries" motif would very likely have been, in performance, abruptly broken off mid-phrase. Cutting away from "Ride of the Valkyries" and starting "Dixie," the accompanist not only reinforced the film's analogy between Valkyries and Klansmen, but also unwittingly drew attention to the underlying pastiche form of the supposedly integrated whole of the film. </p>

<p>The danger of disintegration into pastiche threatened the score, but it was also a narrative concern. Griffith's audacious film techniques—in particular, what he called his "switchbacks," or cross-cuts, which allowed for narrative multiplotting—could be pushed too far and confuse viewers still unfamiliar with the style. Indeed, in the eyes of many contemporary audience members, and many critics since, Griffith's 1916

<p class="continued">epic <i>Intolerance</i> failed largely for this reason.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  A solution to the problem of narrative fragmentation exacerbated by Griffith's cross-cuts and multiplotting was another technique mastered by Griffith: the ride-to-the-rescue sequence. One of Griffith's most famous narrative devices, cross-cutting rapidly between villain, victim, and rescuer, it often served to bring parallel storylines together in a climactic release that was also a reunion of the film's multiple parts. The ride-to-the-rescue, its tension heightened by Griffith's groundbreaking mastery of cross-cutting, sped toward the resolution of the very cinematic technique that enabled it. It exacerbated the tension of Griffith's cross-cut multiplotting to an almost unbearable point, and, ultimately, resolved the matter by emphatically reunifying the narrative. </p>

<p>From his earliest conception of the film, Griffith understood that its highpoint would come with the final ride-to-the-rescue of the Ku Klux Klan. In Griffith's account, when he first read Thomas Dixon's <i>The Clansman</i>, he  </p>

<p class="continued">The climactic Ride involves repeated cross-cutting between two parallel episodes. The first episode shows a horde of black soldiers ting their way into a hut desperately defended by (both Northern and Southern) white heroes and their loyal black servants; a baby-clutching maiden-in-distress heightens the terror. In the second episode, the KKK (led by the film's hero, Col. Ben Cameron), is charging to the aid of the besieged band. Accompanying this charge are the whipping rhythms of the Valkyrie cry, which, after a series of modulations, is bombastically restated in B major as the Klansmen sweep the black soldiers aside. By Griffith's own account, the ride-to-the-rescue would be far grander than any he had ever filmed before. "Instead of saving one little Nell of the Plains," Griffith wrote, "this ride would be to save a nation."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  </p>

<p>It is a section that, as Michael Rogin has argued, straightens and resolves many of the troubled images of the Civil War episodes of the film: where the fraternal soldiers of the War had been tragically indistinguishable, the white-clad KKK riders and the black mob are a study in opposites; where the Civil War images had lingered on suffering, the Ride images exalt in glory; where the "Little Colonel" had been alone in reaching enemy lines, he is joined in the end by "a massed, invincible Klan"; where the Civil War battle lines had been curved and chaotic, the lines of KKK riders are straight and ordered; and where Civil War panoramas had reduced the size of the soldiers, the Klansmen are depicted as giants. The impression gained from all of these juxtapositions is clear: "The dead soldiers of the Civil War battlefields rise up, an 'Invisible Empire,' and ride to regenerative victory."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  To Rogin's reading we can add that the message of regeneration was combined with an assertion of cinematic unity. The Ride addressed the threat of "jackass music" through repeated evocations of Wagner, for film reformers such as Breil the ultimate emblem of aesthetic unity. And it addressed the potential 

<b></b>

fragmentation of the cross-cut multiplotting though a grand unification of narrative strands in a final, redemptive resolution. The Ride was the section that insisted most forcefully on synthesis, rather than pastiche, as the aesthetic principle of the film.  </p>

<p>This aesthetic strategy had a political analogue, since social synthesis <i>of the right sort</i> was precisely what the film advocates. Through both narrative and imagery, Griffith makes it clear throughout the film that social synthesis <i>of the wrong sort </i>results in such grotesque hybrids as black soldiers and mulattos. This bad hybridity is juxtaposed, particularly at the film's end, with "images of white Northerners and white Southerners unifying as blood brothers against a common racial enemy." The film, like Harrison's "Jackass Music," presents its audience with a choice between reunification and mongrelization. The climactic scene, of white Union veterans ting alongside Klansmen and goodly black servants, defending white women and children against an invading horde of black Union soldiers, neatly encapsulates the film's lesson in good and bad forms of American mixing. The fact that this scene is performed to the almost incessant accompaniment of the "Ride of the Valkyries" underscores the point that signs of aesthetic and political synthesis are most tightly interwoven in the film's climax. </p>

<p>The world premiere of the film in New York, following a nearly successful ban on its exhibition, was marked by protests that verged on violence. Outraged by the film's racist characterizations, its falsification of Civil War and Reconstruction history, and its valorization of the Klan, many New Yorkers were vocal in their opposition. As Griffith described the scene: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The opposition was there in full force at the premiere. A riot was brewing. Over the boos, catcalls, and hisses were the whistles and applause. It became a contest. The booers tried to drown out the applauders and vice versa. We were frightened out of our wits for fear of a riot—and that would have been the end of <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">While such protests continued, in New York and elsewhere, after the film's premiere—and attempts to ban the film gained force in some regions—paying audiences became far more univocal in their expressions of enthusiasm. Reports of overpacked and rapturous audiences for <i>Birth </i>are widespread from the period, but at no point was their Dionysian transport so pronounced as during the section dominated by "Ride of the Valkyries." W. Stephen Bush described the New York response for <i>MPW</i>: "When these 'crusaders of the South' are seen mounted on superb horses, dashing furiously through field and forest and river to rescue innocent maidens from brutal assault or to punish 'wicked Africans,' the audience never fails to respond, but applauds while the spectacle lasts" (13 March, 1915; <i>MPW</i>, 1586). In Boston, too, positive audience response seems to have reached its peak with the ride. "Just a flash of the ghostly horsemen, the big Ku-Klux call, and the spectators become almost frenzied in their applause," reported <i>The Boston American</i>.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>   </p>

<p>If such "frenzied" responses were common in northern theatres, then they were at least as typical of southern exhibitions of the film. Once again, the emotional apogee was the Ride of the Klan. <i>The Atlanta Journal, </i>for instance, described the audience reaction to the sequence thus: <b></b>
</p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>
Then the KKK gathers. The scenes which follow defy description. In the little town of Piedmont the blacks are celebrating, far away across the hills the Klan assembles. Back and forth the scene changes—one moment a street in Piedmont swirling with mad negroes, the next a bugle blast from the orchestra and out in the distance the riders of the Klan sweeping on and on. Back to the street and a house where a white girl trembles in fear before the black horde without, back with the bugle blast to the onrush of the Klan. They are coming, they are coming!</p>
<p>GALLERY GOES WILD</p>
<p>You know it and your spine prickles and in the gallery the yells cut loose with every bugle note. The negro mob grows wilder and wilder, the white-shrouded riders are tearing nearer and nearer. Then, with a last mighty blast from the bugle, they sweep into the town and with a shattering volley hammer into the crowd. They fire back, they break, they flee. The Klan beats on them and over them, here a rider knocked off his horse and there another whizzing clean out of the window to the back of his steed—on them and over them to rescue and retribution and final triumph.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>In the Ride of the Klan above all, the Wagnerism of <i>Birth</i> was brought to the fore in an outburst of communal ecstasy, or, more precisely, in a marriage of the integrative techniques of the <i>Gesamtkunstwerk</i> with the full-throated audience-response conventions of American melodrama. In this marriage of aesthetic integration with melodramatic audience response, the climactic section of <i>Birth</i> countered central threats, both aesthetic and political. As such, the Ride became the guarantee of synthesis on which the film as a whole relied. Aesthetically, the Ride countered the threat of musical pastiche through an urgent repetition of Wagner as symbol of unity, and countered the threat of narrative dissolution through a climactic reunification and redemption. Politically, it countered regional conflict through an assertion of racial unity, and fears of mongrelization through an alternate form of synthesis.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>   </p>

<p>To a remarkable degree, <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> realized the dreams of reformers such as Sinn and Bush. But it did something more as well. One of Griffith's fundamental contributions with <i>Birth</i> was that he recovered a darker Wagnerism, one that recovered certain aspects of his oeuvre only intermittently present in the pages of <i>MPW</i>. What he resuscitated and Americanized was a certain Wagner—the Wagner of essays such as "German Art and German Politics" and "Judaism in Music"—the Wagner whose hopes of artistic and national rebirth were inextricably linked to a project of racial purification.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Foreshadowed by essays such as Harrison's "Jackass Music," Griffith's use of Wagner married some of the most reactionary energies of Bayreuth to groundbreaking techniques of filmic integration that proved crucial to the development of classical Hollywood cinema. Griffith's attempt to synthesize music, moving image, and redemptive violence was a significant development in the history of mass culture that realized some of the most audacious as well as most troubling aspirations of early film reformers. And Griffith's attempted synthesis, inevitably, entailed another: that between cinema and life.

<p class="continued">Early in Proust's <i>Le temps retrouvé</i>, we are given a conversation with Robert, Marquis de Saint-Loup, in which he describes a German zeppelin raid he had witnessed on a Paris rooftop the previous evening. He speaks of the ensuing battle "as he would formerly have spoken of some spectacle of great aesthetic beauty." The air raid sirens are "Wagnerian," the whole performance a gorgeous "show" of "constellations," a magnificent "'apocalypse' in the sky." "He seemed to take pleasure in this comparison of aviators to Valkyries," observes the narrator, "and explained it, moreover, with purely musical reasoning. 'By Jove, the music of the sirens certainly was like a "Ride of the Valkyries"'."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The year of this conversation, 1915, is the same as the year of <i>Birth</i>'s release. The coincidence of these two bands of Valkyries, as the "long nineteenth century" crashes into the twentieth, marks the emergence of a constellation that has come to define a significant aspect of modern culture: a constellation of Wagner, spectacle, and war. But the constellation looks very different through Saint-Loup's eyes than through Griffith's, and the distance between their appreciations of the theater of war is the difference between autonomous art and melodrama. The flaneur of depersonalized violence hears a very different "Ride," and sees different deaths, than the melodramatist. Taken together, Saint-Loup and Griffith stand as two poles of the spectatorship of catastrophe. At one pole, a spectacle of violence is enjoyed, with a knowing wink, for its sublimity. At the other, a spectacle of violence is enjoyed, without irony, as redemptive triumph of the forces of good over the forces of evil. </p>

<p>In 1915 these two poles stood in opposition, but does this opposition still stand? Has the connoisseurship of catastrophe been reconciled, in recent decades, to the melodramatic imagination? Have we learned, over the course of the twentieth century, to appreciate war simultaneously as <i>l'art-pour-l'art</i> and as black-versus-white? If so, then the <i>Reuters</i> report referred to at the beginning of this paper may prove prescient. When American troops re-enact "for real" Coppola's cinematic satire of Griffith, are we witnessing melodramatic fervor, or the coolest of cool ironies? Playing "Ride" on their nightly raids, are they closer to Griffith or Saint-Loup?  </p>

<p>Immediately after their conversation on Wagnerian bombardment, Proust's narrator proceeds to discuss the use of dissimulation in battle strategy. It is the narrator's position that "imitation battles" and "sham attacks," such as the strategic feint, have been rendered obsolete by innovations in artillery bombardment and aerial reconnaissance. But Saint-Loup, who is wiser in such matters, disagrees: "those ruses will be used again and they will succeed, for a trick is never fully exposed for all time; it worked once because it was effective and it will always work."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  We have traveled far from the world of the film reformers and farther still from Bayreuth, and today most Americans, if they recognize Wagner's music at all, would be unable to identify its author. And yet 

<b></b>

Wagner, like Griffith, still exerts a subterranean pull on American culture, and the old ruses continue to beguile. </p>

Largely because of enthusiastic overstatements of earlier film scholars, it has recently become fashionable to question the importance of <i>Birth</i> in the history of film. While much of this critical corrective has been valuable, there is now a danger of the pendulum swinging too far in the direction of diminution. Miriam Hansen has put the matter well: "Although the status of <i>Birth</i> as a mythical watershed has rightly been challenged by economic and social historians of the cinema, we should not underrate its impact as a catalyst of institutional change, nor its paradigmatic function for the cultural self-definition of classical cinema. Besides establishing Griffith's reputation as an artistic 'genius' of the industry, the film marks a point of no return both in economic terms and in terms of public discourse on the cinema." Miriam Hansen, <i>Babel and Babylon: Spectatorship in American Film</i> (London and Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1991), 163. With <i>Birth</i>, Griffith also pioneered and popularized, even if he did not invent, many techniques of the classical cinema.  </p>

The 1904 <i>Parsifal</i>, directed by Porter and produced by the Edison Film Company, was a twenty-five minute short based on a New York stage production of the work. The film, shot entirely from a fixed-camera position from the rear of the auditorium, is filmed theater at its stagiest. Robert Whittier, the film's Parsifal, subsequently found a way to capitalize on his performance, using the film in a lecture circuit entitled <i>Wagner from Within and Without</i>.

The 1912 <i>Parsifal</i> was the work of director Mario Caeserini, who also directed the <i>Siegfried</i> film the same year (the two were originally packaged together, as <i>Parsifal e Sigrido</i>). The three-reel film arrived in the U.S. soon after its Italian release, with the <i>MPW</i> notice appearing on 28 December, 1912. Dispensing with the static camerawork of Porter's <i>Parsifal</i>, the Ambrosio production sharply altered the plot of Wagner's opera by, oddly enough, expanding it (<i>MPW</i>, 1307–8). The plot changes are too numerous to mention, but the film spends a good deal of time with the "backstory" of Amfortas's battle with Klingsor and Kundry (who are, in this version, allied magicians), as well as Parsifal's upbringing by his saintly parents. One of the few structural similarities with Wagner's opera is the use of the Eucharistic ritual as a framing device, which the film emphasizes even more strongly than the opera: the film ends, as it begins, with the celebration of the Grail.

Actions against the film were launched in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Ohio, Denver, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, New York, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis, among other cities and towns.

<p><a name="FOOT37" href="#REF37">37</a>. In his review of <i>Birth of a Nation</i> for <i>MPW</i>, Bush found himself predictably torn between the film's aesthetics and its politics. "It would be difficult to overpraise the spectacular part of these reels," Bush wrote, while also singling out Griffith's mastery "in creating and prolonging suspense to the agonizing point," his use of close-up, the acting of his cast, and the realism of his sets. At the same time, Bush worried that "[t]he tendency of the second part [of the film] is to inflame race hatred. The negroes are shown as horrible brutes, given over to beastly excesses, defiant and criminal in their attitude toward the whites and lusting after white women. Some of the details are horrid and repulsive" (13 March, 1915; <i>MPW</i>, 1586–87). Already in 1915, in other words, Bush had staked out what would become a standard liberal response to the film: celebration of its mastery of film spectacle coupled with condemnation of its racist politics. Bush's division between aesthetics and politics reminds us that Bush was at once a social progressive and an unambiguous Wagner enthusiast.  </p>

<span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Freak Dandies: <div id="subtitle">Decadence in the 1930s</div>
</div>

<div id="body">
<p>
      In the first chapter of Djuna Barnes’ <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, Baron Felix Volkbein “owe[s] his first audience with a ‘gentleman of quality’” to the Duchess of Broadback, the trapeze artist otherwise known as Frau Mann.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Like the “Duchess” and the “Baron,” Count Ontario Altamonte’s claim to aristocracy is suspect, and among the “impossible people” who gather to receive him, only Felix, devoted as he is to the “great past,” seeks to pay him homage (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 13, 9). When Felix arrives, however, he finds that instead of the Count, it is Dr. Matthew O’Connor who is holding court. Rather than being received by royalty, Felix becomes part of an “audience” for an entirely different performance: the discursive dexterity of the putative doctor. The centerpiece of that performance is O’Connor’s account of Nikka, “the nigger who used to t the bear in the Cirque de Paris” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 16). “Tattooed head to heel with all the <span style="font-style:italic;">ameublement</span> of depravity” (ibid), Nikka’s body brings together the tattooed man and the African savage, two standard exhibits of the American freak show stage. Like O’Connor, Nikka is a performer, and O’Connor’s account of him is thus a meta-performance in which the Coney Island freak shows that Barnes knew so well converge with the decadent aesthetic which informs virtually everything she wrote.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>
      As embodied in Nikka, the freak show performer becomes heir to the Decadent Aesthetics of the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> as read through the historical context of the 1930s, the decade in which avant-garde modernists witnessed the simultaneous consolidation of fascism in Europe and the culture industry on both sides of the Atlantic.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Like Nikka, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s neo-Decadent performance is inseparable from the discursive and material effects that attend  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> both of these historical events. For if, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, a critically appropriated version of the Decadence of the 1890s paradoxically registers the novel’s protest against fascism, its debt to the traditions of the American freak show underscores the extent to which the novel recognizes the famed aesthetic autonomy of the Decadent subject as dependent upon the liberal capitalism from which it emerged. Despite the fact that writers associated with Decadence in the last decades of the nineteenth century variously negotiated commodity culture, as Walter Adamson has recently argued, avantgarde modernists, particularly throughout the interwar period, came to understand their own projects as breaking with Aestheticist “religions of art” dependent upon “the illusion of autonomous control over culture by intellectuals.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Equally informed by the changes in the American culture industry observed by Barnes in her journalism and by a Decadent Aesthetic borrowed from abroad, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> presents a dandy that is always and inevitably a freak.
    </p>
<p>
      Celebrating Nikka as a “depraved” savage, O’Connor complicates the discourse of the “noble savage” particular to the modernist avant-garde, its appropriation of the “primitive” as an alternative to the ossified forms of Western art and subjectivity, and he does so by rendering Nikka not only the object of his art, but a decadent performer in his own right. A juxtaposition of eclectic quotation, Nikka’s tattooed body can surely be seen as a “mimesis of subjection,” for written on his body is “an iconography of Western racist and colonial discourses.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> In addition to the Shakespearean “Desdemona” tattooed on his penis and the words “I can” tattooed across his knees, O’Connor reveals that Nikka has adorned his body with an angel from Chartres, a Jansenist quotation from a book of magic, two “arrow-speared hearts” dripping blood, a trade ship, and references to both the Houses of Tudor and Rothschild (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 16). Yet while Nikka’s subjection is written on his racialized and sexualized body, as a textual performance his body can also be seen as a parodic resignification of Church and State in which the borders between the spiritual, the erotic, and the aesthetic are themselves subject to decay.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> With Jansenist allusions across his buttocks, the angel of Chartres on his belly, Desdemona on his penis, and the “swart rambler rose copied from the Hamburg house of Rothschild” along his legs, Nikka’s body spiritualizes the erotic, eroticizes the spiritual, and renders both aesthetic.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Heir to the aesthetics of Joris-Karl Huysmans, Oscar Wilde, and Aubrey Beardsley, Nikka performs a Decadent art that serves as an immanent critique of the hegemonic order that would delimit and circumscribe his self-making. Inseparable from the fascism of the 1930s, it is an order prone to the conflation of Decadence with degeneracy. Challenging the discourses that would identify him as degenerate specifically through his Decadent embodiment of them, Nikka’s performance locates the political stakes of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s privileged performative subject: its Decadent resistance to fascist instrumentalization.
    </p>
<p>
      In so far as Nikka turns himself into an aesthetic object because he “loved beauty and would have it about him” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 17), he is the inheritor of a Decadent Aesthetic practice whose resurrection in the 1930s represents a critical appropriation tailored to, and reflective of, its own historical moment. Distinguishing Nikka and <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> from their dandified precursors of the 1890s, and even from their <span style="font-style:italic;">flaneur</span> ancestors  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of the mid-nineteenth century, is neither their commodification nor their awareness of that commodification. Rather, what marks <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> and its freak dandies as <span style="font-style:italic;">neo</span>-Decadent is the extent to which their Decadence requires an overt disavowal of aesthetic autonomy, a disavowal made requisite by the construction of desire under liberal capitalism in the post-Keynesian era and by the illusion of autonomy propagated by culture industries on both sides of the Atlantic. A pastiche of “improbable juxtapositions” advertising their “perverse irony,” paradox, and “enigmatic symbolism,” Nikka’s body is a paradigmatic Decadent text put in the service of the culture industry.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> With Nikka, the dandy has become a freak, a spectacular commodity fetish and the subject/object of what the Nazis would name degenerate art. In Barnes’ novel, the only way to counter fascism will be within the terms of the commodity fetishism perfected in the marketplace of the liberal capitalism contemporaneous with it.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>
      It is in the 1930s, after all, that Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer famously identify the commodity fetish as the product of the American culture industry and associate it with the provocation of a desire that is “endlessly prolonged,” immune to satisfaction.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> However, the notion of economic health premised on the production and prolongation of desire was considerably more widespread, pervading sexual theory, economic theory, the advertising industry, and business strategies of the decade. As critics such as Walter Sussman, Rita Barnard, and Michael Tratner have detailed, the 1930s is <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> decade in which the production of desire becomes an essential activity of a capitalist economy premised, on the tide of the Keynesian revolution, on expenditure.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> As Tratner writes, it is in the context of Keynesian economics that “[s]timulating consumption involved increasing desires and, what is more important, creating them.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Desire is the watchword of the discourses of political and libidinal economies in the 1930s, Tratner maintains, at once a civic duty and the road to economic and sexual health. At the center of these overlapping economies, then, is the commodity fetish, charged as it is with the production, stimulation, and prolongation of desire. Hence, as <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s freak dandies prolong and suspend desire, they perform the very “ritual of Tantalus” that Adorno and Horkheimer attribute to the commodity fetish.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Rather than aesthetic or individual autonomy, Barnes’ novel presents a subject/object whose Decadence is defined by an explicit rejection of both. In the form of its freak dandies, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> makes subjectivity and art the stuff of the commodity fetish, for it is only by soliciting and prolonging desire, the very work of the commodity fetish as it was conceived in the 1930s, that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s freak dandies can remain disowned.
    </p>
<p>
      As it argues that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s resistance to fascism within and without the fascist state lies specifically in its revival and revision of the Decadent Aesthetics of the 1890s, this essay offers an alternative to the two most important studies of the novel’s relationship to fascism, Jane Marcus’ “Laughing at Leviticus: <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> as Women’s Circus Epic”  and Erin Carlston’s “‘The Learned Corruption of Language’: <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Failed Flirtation with Fascism” .<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Written amid and for the invaluable “reevaluation of Djuna Barnes” undertaken in the 1980s, Marcus’ essay reflects both the feminist perspective that informs much of that work and the enormous impact of the translation of the work of Mikhail Bakhtin on the literary scholarship of that decade. Bringing  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> together Julia Kristeva’s theorization of the abject and Bakhtin’s construction of the “carnivalesque,” Marcus’ argues that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is a “feminist-anarchist call for freedom from fascism,” a “book of communal resistances of underworld outsiders to domination [whose] weapon is its laughter, a form of folk grotesque derived from Rabelais and surviving in the circus”(“LL,” 221). Political and liberating, the carnivalesque reversals and transgressions Marcus identifies in the text allow her to celebrate <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> as a collective rebellion of “outsiders” against the rise of fascism. She writes, “I believe <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is the representative modernist text, a prose poem of abjection, tracing the political unconscious of the rise of fascism, as lesbians, blacks, circus people, Jews, and transvestites—outsiders all—bow down before Hitler’s truly perverted Levitical prescriptions for racial purity”(“LL,” 231). In Marcus’ hands, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> prophesies the Holocaust and rebels against it, and it does so specifically through its carnivalesque transgressions of “Levitical prescriptions.” Marcus’ carnival, equated with the circus, becomes “redemptive.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>
      The differences between Marcus’ position and my own reveal themselves in a critical reframing that requires a paradigmatic shift from the “carnival” to the “freak show,” for in its deployment of the carnivalesque, “Laughing with Leviticus” implicitly denies both the emphasis on spectacular performance that informs the art of the novel and the context of the liberal capitalism in which those performances take place.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> By identifying the novel with the freak show rather than the carnival, I am insisting that in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> there is no utopian, pre-capitalist democratic space outside of “the society of the spectacle” or the instantiation of liberal capitalism that Guy Debord rightly identifies with it in postwar France.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> As “the opposite of dialogue,” Debord argues, “the spectacle subjects living human beings to its will to the extent that the economy has brought them under its sway. For the spectacle is simply the economic realm developing for itself—at once a faithful mirror held up to the production of things and a distorting objectification of the producers.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Here, Debord very nearly defines the spectacle as a freak show, the realm of “distorting objectification” that proponents of the carnivalesque, like Marcus, seek to evade. The carnivalesque aesthetic Marcus identifies in the novel would presumably destabilize the subject-object divide upon which spectacle depends, thereby contesting the objectifying power of the economic realm that produced it. Yet, to make such an argument is to evade the historical and economic transformations that render Bakhtin’s carnival necessarily obsolete. <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> does not conjure a pre-capitalist utopia any more than it voices “the struggle of an emerging subculture,” and its appropriation of an aesthetics of spectacle indexes its complicity with capitalism and the immanence of its critique of bourgeois rationalism.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> If Debord’s “society of the spectacle” had not yet emerged in France in the 1930s, Barnes’ novel, informed as it is by the American culture industry, offers a prescient representation of it.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>
      In rejecting Marcus’ utopian claims, my argument follows in the footsteps of Erin Carlston, to arrive, however, at different conclusions. “The Learned Corruption of Language” explores what Carlston sees as the overlapping ideological traces of decadence and fascism in Barnes’ novel. Her work implicitly poses the central question animating  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> my own study: What does it mean to be decadent in 1936? Carlston answers this question by way of Walter Benjamin, concluding that the Decadence of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is the mark of its engagement with fascist ideology. Citing Benjamin’s famous contention that fascism is “the consummation of <span style="font-style:italic;">l’art pour l’art</span>,” she contends that the aestheticization of life intrinsic to Decadence becomes the pre-condition of its aestheticization of politics, and it is precisely this aestheticization of politics that Benjamin identifies as the signature accomplishment of fascism.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> For Carlston, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Decadence thus becomes an index of its ambivalent alliance with fascism. “It is only with regret,” she concludes, “that Barnes finally dismisses fascism’s utopian fantasies of immediacy and fusion with the mother/tongue at the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>.” “[W]hile decadence is neither equivalent to nor totally assimilable to fascism,” she insists that the two are genealogically and ideologically linked.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> It is on this point that my argument definitively diverges from Carlston’s own: I contend that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> reveals the logical and historical problems inherent in reading Decadence as an indexical sign pointing inexorably to fascism.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>
      In the following pages, I suggest that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> represents neither an ill-fated romance with fascism nor a revolutionary protest against it. Rather, as a Decadent freak show, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> performs an immanent critique of fascist instrumentality, one that challenges the equation of Decadence with degeneracy performed under the aegis of fascism. In the process the novel offers an implicit critique of a significant body of critical theory that has established Decadence as the unwitting progenitor of fascism. <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s neo-Decadence thus makes visible the critical limits that attend the claim that Decadence leads inevitably and necessarily to fascism, even as the novel reveals the aesthetic autonomy associated with the Decadence of the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> as an illusion with its own potential for instrumentalization.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Between Decadence and Fascism: Imagined Pasts</h1>
<p>
	The title of Andrew Hewitt’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascist Modernism: Aesthetics, Politics, and the Avant-Garde,</span> published in 1993, speaks forcefully to the growing awareness among cultural critics that the well-policed borders separating fascism from modernism, so firmly established in the aftermath of World War II, could no longer be maintained. As Hewitt writes, “Fascist modernism is not just a branch of modernism, not a quirk nor an exception; it is instead—theoretically if not empirically—<span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> single most pressing issue for theories of the avant-garde.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> If we accept Peter Bürger’s contention that the avant-garde is defined as an attempt to reintegrate art with the praxis of life, Hewitt demonstrates, fascism is as central to the historical avant-garde as dada, surrealism, and Russian constructivism.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> It is only because of his own leftist proclivities, his refusal to see the implications of his own definition of the avant-garde, that Bürger fails to admit either futurism or fascism into the hallowed, if compromised, halls of the avant-garde. Carlston’s study of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is informed precisely by her recognition of the intercourse between fascism and modernism charted by writers like Hewitt. Yet, following Hewitt, I would contend that the numerous correlations she adeptly draws between  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s neo-Decadence and the fascism of the 1930s actually convey their mutual place in the historical avant-garde, rather than their ideological or political affinities. From this perspective, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s neo-Decadence is no more or less fascistic than any other avant-garde practice contemporary with it.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Admittedly, posing the Decadent, half-Jewish, and falsely titled Baron Felix Volkbein next to Nikka apparently invites a contrary conclusion, for one could well argue that it is in precisely in their Decadence that they confirm the two most influential theories linking fascism to Decadence. As it combines Shakespearean allusion with Jansenism, the Houses of Tudor and Rothschild, the “indecent” and the “Gothic,” Nikka’s tattooed body pays tribute to the Decadents’ tendency to “seek out the aristocratic and spiritual trappings in an imagined old regime,” the very project most explicitly undertaken by Felix Volkbein in his quest for “the great past.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> It is hence not surprising that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> enmeshes Felix in a Decadent genealogy. If his father is a “gourmet and a dandy” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 1), his son is “born to holy decay”: “emotionally excessive, an addict to death” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 119), the embodiment of Decadence at the end of the line. Inheritor and progenitor of a decadent tradition, it is Felix who worships the past, “what he termed ‘Old Europe’: aristocracy, nobility, royalty,” searching “for the correct thing to which to pay tribute” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 9). It is precisely because of his desire to revive his “imagined old regime” that Felix pursues and marries Robin Vote, for he views her as “newly ancient” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 42), carrying “a sort of odour of memory, like a person who has come from some place that we have forgotten and would give our life to recall” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 118). Searching for something to bow down to, seduced by an enigmatic embodiment of the archaic past, Felix seems to be waiting with uncanny precision for nothing so much as for fascism. In Felix, Decadence not only resembles fascism; it seems to be the very condition for its emergence.
      </p>
<p>
	The fact that both Felix and fascism define themselves through the project of reviving “an imaginary old regime” suggests that Decadence paves the way for fascism for the very reasons asserted by Georg Lukács and Walter Benjamin.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Yet, while both Lukács and Benjamin would allow for provocative readings of Felix and the novel in which he appears, neither reading will ultimately suffice, for in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, Decadence is neither a sentimental education (Lukács) nor an aesthetic training ground (Benjamin) for fascism. Even if Felix’s seduction by the archaically-coded Robin Vote in some way represents the conversion of the Decadent subject to fascism, it is a seduction that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> subjects to relentless critique. The marriage between the two is a short-lived disaster that results only in the birth of a child whose “sanity is an unknown room” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 120). Thus, if in his longing for the imagined past Felix displays a structure of feeling and/or a will to aestheticization that fascism exploits in its own ideological constitution, it is because, as incarnations of the historical avant-garde, Decadence and fascism respond to similar perceptions about modernity, that is, to the dislocations, alienations, and rationalizations that might encourage a desire to revive a prior (a)historical moment. Because they respond to similar circumstances, however, in no way suggests that Decadence is equivalent to fascism or the reverse, that fascism is inherently Decadent in the literary/aesthetic sense of the term.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Moreover, neither the Aestheticism of Felix nor of the novel in which he appears can be identified with a fascist aesthetic. Obsessed by “Old Europe,” its ruins and its aristocracies, Felix would be anathema to the cult of youthful masculinity, populism and vitalism central to fascism, especially as promulgated in Italy. If, as Jeffrey T. Schnapp writes, fascist modernity is defined by the tensions between a “revolutionary activism and institutional conservativism, between the celebration of heroic individualism and corporate conformity, between elitist and populist values, between cultural internationalism and nationalism, between antihistoricism and historicism,” Felix’s arch-conservativism hardly fits the bill.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> So, too, in 1936, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> appears as a compendium of the features that the Nazis would denounce in their massive “Degenerate Art” exhibition the following year. It is not simply that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> revolves around Jews, lesbians, and a homosexual man given to transvestism and liturgical heresy; rather, the very stylistic features that make <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> such an exemplary Decadent text are the features that ensure its status as fascism’s aesthetic other, “degenerate art.” <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s “elaborate, highly artificial, highly ornamented, often tortuous style”; its tendency to “disruption, fragmentation, and paradox”; its delight in “perverse irony” and subjectivism, all make it as stylistically unassimilable to fascist mimesis as to the normative agenda of fascist idealism.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Thus to suggest, as readers of Benjamin are especially tempted to do, that there is a simple teleological link between Decadent art and fascism, is to deny the dialectical nature of Benjamin’s thinking, for it is a conclusion that requires the critic to assert the independence of ideological and aesthetic domains. To thus separate ideology and aesthetics is an admittedly serious temptation for critics, given that Decadents themselves often made that claim. Yet it is precisely as Decadence revalues the uselessness of the Aesthetic, its resistance to assimilation by rationalizing forces of modernity, that it reveals its ideological and political investments. If, as Andrew Hewitt writes, a decadent praxis results only in a “decadent decadence,” one that negates itself in its very assertion, the conundrum is in no way specific to the fascist moment; Decadence has always been Decadent, in the sense that <span style="font-style:italic;">l’art pour l’art</span> has always been a dissent against ideological hegemony.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Art for art’s sake, in other words, has always been <span style="font-style:italic;">for</span> something else.
      </p>
<p>
	As an exemplary neo-Decadent text written against the background of Mussolini’s consolidation of power and Hitler’s rise to dominance, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> testifies to the fact that it is simply not possible to give Decadent Aesthetic form to the fascism of the 1930s without altering its ideological content. That is not to deny that Decadence shares with fascism the currents of thought common to their historical moment, or that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> engages with the same discourses of biological racism and degeneration as did the Nazis. Rather, it suggests that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Decadence cannot suffice as an index of the text’s fascist sympathies. On the contrary, in the face of fascist instrumentalization within and without the fascist state, Aesthetic Decadence in the 1930s inevitably constitutes a praxis.

	What <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Decadence does index, however, is the novel’s debt to liberal capitalism, a fact made visible in a comparison of the novel with Matei Calinescu’s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> distinctly liberal reading of Decadence. In contrast to Lukács and Benjamin, Calinescu offers an analysis in which Decadent Aestheticism implicitly holds the potential to negate, if not to subvert, fascism. In his conclusion to an analysis of Paul Bourget’s seminal <span style="font-style:italic;">Theorie de la decadence</span>, Calinescu seems to celebrate the individualism and anarchism Bourget attributes to decadence. “To prefer decadence to its radical opposite (that is, barbarism) appears, at least culturally, to be a legitimate choice,” Calinescu writes, for “a style of decadence is simply a style favorable to the unrestricted manifestation of aesthetic individualism, a style that has done away with traditional authoritarian requirements such as unity, hierarchy objectivity, etc.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Thus Calinescu offers “aesthetic individualism,” as personified in the Decadent dandy, as both an extension of liberal individualism and an alternative to a “barbarism” he associates with “nationalism and militarism,” that is, with fascism. Decadence thus not only rejects “the tyranny of tradition,” but the tradition of tyranny, and it is an unmistakably bourgeois dandy who saves the day.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>
	As in Calinescu’s assessment, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Decadent freak show effectively counters fascism’s instrumental subject, along with its aesthetic. However, the freak dandies it exhibits as aesthetic subject/objects emerge from no space prior to or outside of the scene of their aestheticization, the capitalist marketplace; it is only by exploiting the very structure of desire intrinsic to liberal capitalism, as it was conceived in the 1930s, that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s freak dandies resist rationalization—whether that rationalization be conducted under the aegis of national socialism or liberal capitalism. Barnes’ novel thus reveals the anarchic, subversive individualism that Bourget and Calinescu celebrate in Decadence as a product of liberal capitalism; from the perspective of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, the subject of “aesthetic individualism” is, inevitably, the commodity fetish.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Between the “Invert” and the “Jew”:The Missing Link</h1>
<p>
	Any interpretation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s relationship to the fascism contemporaneous with it turns inevitably to the problem of the novel’s portrayal of the Jew, for there is no doubt that the language used by the narrator and by O’Connor to characterize Jews partakes of the same essentialist and anti-Semitic language employed by the Nazis.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> “What had formed Felix from the date of his birth to his coming to thirty was unknown to the world,” the narrator writes, “for the step of the wandering Jew is in every son. No matter where and when you meet him you feel that he has come from some place—no matter from what place he has come—some country that he has devoured rather than resided in, some secret land that he has been nourished on but cannot inherit, for the Jew seems to be everywhere from nowhere” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 7). Nomadic, voracious, mystically disinherited, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> every Jew is a “Wandering Jew,” the threatening and denigrated other required by a fascist subject defined ideologically in terms of the entitlements of “blood and soil.”
      </p>
<p>
	Yet as <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> constructs its Wandering Jew as a freak dandy, it also creates the Decadent subject/object of desire that resists rationalization. Mobilizing a freak show aesthetic of indeterminacy accomplished in the interplay of the visual art of tableau and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the verbal art of spiel, Barnes’ novel turns the Wandering Jew into a privileged re for the “stylized irresolution” that characterized the Decadent art of the 1890s.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Forty years later, that signature irresolution performs an immanent critique of instrumental reason as promoted within and without the fascist state. By turning the Wandering Jew into an exhibit for the freak show stage of the 1930s, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> allows him to escape, to wander away from the discourses of eugenics and degeneration theory that would hold him in place.
      </p>
<p>
	While the practices of freak show exhibition have varied considerably even within a given historical moment, archival research and the collection of personal testimony has made it possible to identify the main elements of freak show display as they were conventionalized in the U.S. in the nineteenth century. Following Robert Bogdan’s groundbreaking research into “the social construction of freaks,” a body of criticism emerged that details the historically specific ways that, as Rosemarie Garland Thomson writes, unusual bodies were fashioned into freaks.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Within this “freak discourse,” she contends, are “four entwined narrative forms”:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  [F] irst, the oral spiel—often called the “lecture”—that was delivered by the showman or “professor” who usually managed the exhibited person; second the often fabricated or fantastic textual accounts—both long pamphlets and broadside or newspaper advertisements—of the freak’s always extraordinary life and identity; third, the staging, which included costuming, choreography, performance, and the spatial relation to the audience; and fourth, drawings or photographs that disseminated the iterable, fixed, collectible visual image of staged freakishness that penetrated into the Victorian parlor and family album.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Garland Thomson thus describes the freak show as a multimedia spectacle including two verbal components, oral performance and written discourse, and two visual components, the live freak on display and the photographic portrait. I call the verbal components <span style="font-style:italic;">spiel</span>, in order to emphasize the performative character and the play intrinsic to both the impresario’s address and promotional materials such as the “true life” pamphlet.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> The visual components, by contrast, I call <span style="font-style:italic;">tableau</span> in order to emphasize the silence and stasis that traditionally marks the freak performer in his or her live and photographic exhibition.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> All accounts of the aesthetic legacies of the nineteenth-century freak show depend upon the relationship they assert, however implicitly, between spiel and tableau.
      </p>
<p>
	Most often approached from the perspective of sociology or cultural studies, scholarly explorations of the freak show generally have not explicitly taken up the issue of aesthetics, and thus the relationship between spiel and tableau has received only passing attention. A survey of the field, however, reveals that studies almost always subscribe to one of two theories, one premised on an aesthetic of coherence and the other on containment. In his sociology of the freak show, for example, Bogdan contends that the visual presentation of the freak—on the stage or on the <span style="font-style:italic;">carte de visite</span>—confirms the verbal spiel of the lecturer and the “true life” pamphlet: “dressed in a style that was compatible with the story, the exhibit would behave consistently with the front,”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> he maintains.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Bogdan implies that the “story” precedes and dictates the terms of the visual consumption of the freak on display. Moreover, he suggests that the verbal and visual components of the display are allied in the production of a consistent object. The cultural studies collected in <span style="font-style:italic;">Freakery</span> tend to favor a second alternative, one implied in Garland Thomson’s description of the “narratives” of the freak show.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> By naming the four elements of the freak show “narratives” or “discourse,” she suggests that even the visual image and display of the freak were ultimately narrativized and that the containment of the freak’s transgression lies in this narrativization. Both Bogdan’s sociological method and Garland Thomson’s cultural studies approach privilege the narrative elements of freak show display, identifying narrative as that which delimits the signification of the exhibition.
      </p>
<p>
	Yet, as Rachel Adams writes, the narrative components of the freak show did not consistently “give coherence to bodies that otherwise suggested an intolerable fragmentation and dissolution of meaning.”<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> On the contrary, a study of the extant verbal and visual artifacts of the freak show suggest that, in the name of curiosity and the profits that could be derived from it, freak display often developed as a contest between visual and verbal assertions, between spiel and tableau. In that contest, narrative did not necessarily provide the viewer with the comfort of mastery, resolution, or the confirmation of “a permanent, qualitative difference between normality and deviance.”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Rather than comforting certainties, freak show exhibits functioned as provocations to a state of suspense in which the incommensurability of word and image threaten to reveal the authorizing discourses of “the real” and “the true” as radically insufficient. Hence, one of the most popular freak performers of the nineteenth century was William Henry Johnson, a microcephalic African American billed as “Zip, the What is it?” Dressed in a monkey suit, Johnson posed as a “missing link,” and his exhibition exploited questions both about the Darwinian descent of man and the humanity of African Americans that preoccupied his Victorian American audience.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> Contrary to the aesthetics of coherence or containment at which Bogdan and Garland Thomson arrive through their respective emphases on narrative, Johnson’s exhibition depended on an aesthetic of indeterminacy arrived at through the competing claims of spiel and tableau.
      </p>
<p>
	In his role as “the missing link,” the exhibition of William Henry Johnson is no exceptional case; alongside the aesthetics of the “coherent front” and “narrative containment” a nascent aesthetic of indeterminacy emerges, one in which the hyperbolic and contradictory art of verbal spiel repeatedly points its audience to a visual tableau that refuses to confirm its claims. The result is desire—epistemological, semiotic, and often, libidinal. These freak show exhibitions are themselves premised on a “missing link” between verbal and visual assertions. So, too, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s freak dandies all the beg the question “What is it?” and, as they do so, specifically reveal the missing links between and within discourses of “the invert” and “the Jew” forged as part and parcel of fascist instrumentalization.
      </p>
<p>
	The narrative presentation of Hedvig and Guido Volkbein that opens the novel demonstrates <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s appropriation of a freak show aesthetic of indeterminacy and the discursive intercourse between the “invert” and the “Jew” that informs the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> novel’s consequent parade of decadent and transgendered freaks. Like Nikka, these freak dandies embody the slippage between racial and sexual discursive registers. Just as Nikka’s performance serves as an immanent critique of Western colonial discourses, the novel’s narrative exhibition of Hedvig and Guido represents an immanent critique of a fascist discourse that would conflate decadence with degeneracy. As a freak show, the novel begins, we can say, with what Robert Bogdan has named the “aggrandized mode” of freak display. As Bogdan explains, “with the aggrandized mode the presentation emphasized how, with the exception of the particular physical, mental, or behavioral condition, the freak was an upstanding, high-status person with talents of a conventional and socially prestigious nature. . . . One, some, or all of the following attributes were fabricated, elevated or exaggerated, and then flaunted: social position, achievements, talents, family, and physiology.”<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> In its presentation of Hedvig and Guido Volkbein, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> translates the aggrandized mode into a Decadent register. As the characters aggrandize themselves, they create the theatrical sets of their own freak tableau, and their will to Aestheticism becomes the measure of their freakishness.
      </p>
<p>
	Like Nikka, Hedvig and Guido’s enfreakment depends upon a highly stylized Decadence. As the narrator tells us, they live in a home that has become “a fantastic museum of their encounter” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 5), a theatrical set, recalling Des Esseintes’ elaborate hermitage in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Rebours</span>, against which they perform their false aristocracy. Moreover, the narrator describes this theatrical set in the torturous syntax and digressive sentences typical of the decadent novel, as in: “The long rococo halls, giddy with plush and whorled designs in gold, were peopled with Roman fragments, white and dissociated; a runner’s leg, the chilly half-turned head of a matron stricken in the bosom, the blind bold sockets of the eyes given a pupil by every shifting shadow so that what they looked upon was an act of the sun” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 5). In its own “whorled design,” the sentence reproduces the baroque aggrandizement it describes, revealing the practice of a Decadent art of which Guido and Hedvig remain, ironically, unaware. Together with the French windows, Venetian blinds, a “thick dragon’s-blood pile of rugs from Madrid,” and “stuffs from Tunis,” the Volkbein home is a pastiche of “dissociated” historical, national, and aesthetic styles (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 5). Rather than a monument to the “blood and soil” of fascist nationalism, it is a Decadent cabinet of curiosities that monumentalizes nothing so much as the rootlessness it ostensibly veils. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, Decadence thus first emerges as the compensatory aesthetic of the Wandering Jew.
      </p>
<p>
	Against this theatricalized set, the narrator presents Hedvig and Guido in a pair of displays that mirror the portraits of the prevaricated Volkbein ancestors that adorn their study and emphasize the freak show art of tableau. In these portraits, “reproductions of two intrepid and ancient actors,” the res are captured in arrested action: the lady is posed “expecting a bird” and the gentleman is seated on a charger and captured in “the execution of a falling arc” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 6). So, too, the novel opens with Hedvig, captured in tableau:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  Early in 1880, in spite of a well-founded suspicion as to the advisability of perpetuating that race which has the sanction of the Lord and the disapproval of the people, Hedvig  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Volkbein—a Viennese woman of great strength and military beauty, lying upon a canopied bed of a rich spectacular crimson, the valance stamped with the bifurcated wings of the House of Hapsburg, the feather coverlet an envelope of satin on which, in massive and tarnished gold threads, stood the Volkbein arms—gave birth, at the age of forty-five, to an only child, a son, seven days after her physician predicted that she would be taken.
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	  [<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 1]
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Once again the excess of detail in this description reflects the excess of the decor and adds to the aggrandizement of the social position and lineage of the freak on display. Moreover, Hedvig’s description is clearly an exaggeration of a decadent and disappearing royalty, characterized by its “massive and tarnished gold threads.” In the last gasp of royal privilege, under the “bifurcated wings of the House of Hapsburg,” Hedvig offers her biracial offspring to the disapproving people. Underscoring the tableau quality of the description, the narrator freezes Hedvig in the act of thrusting her child from her “with the gross splendour of a general saluting the flag” (ibid). Thus, Hedvig’s freakishness is twofold; she is at once the aggrandized “Baroness” in an age that has de-legitimated its royalty, and a masculinized re giving birth.
	</p>
<p>
	  Hedvig’s freakishness is constructed around her false title and aggrandized stature, but her physiology is the center of the display. In the narrative spiel that accompanies her tableau, Hedvig is the embodiment of fascist masculinity. She is the possessor of “great strength and military beauty,” as well as a “massive chic” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 4). She even plays the piano “with the masterly stroke of a man in the tempo of her blood” and turns the dance floor into “a tactical maneuver” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 9, 4). If, as Marcus suggests, Hedvig is the re for the Aryan in the novel (“LL,” 230), her place in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is undoubtedly parodic. Not only does the Aryan sacrifice her life to give birth to a half-Jewish child, but the novel’s insistence on her as the embodiment of a masculinity defined by “great strength and military beauty” reveals the privileged fascist subject—the male soldier—as a transgendered woman. In addition to Felix, her half-Jewish son, Hedvig is the narrative progenitor of a host of sexually ambiguous and transgendered freaks, including Frau Mann, Nikka, Matthew O’Connor (who calls himself “The Bearded Lady”) and Robin Vote, “The Missing Link.”
	</p>
<p>
	  Guido’s tableau foregrounds the traffic between gender and race that plays such a central role in the novel. As in the case of Hedvig, the narrator similarly emphasizes Guido’s physical freakishness within a tableau that flaunts his self-aggrandizement, his wealth, and his transgression of pre-established boundaries, but if Hedvig is freakish as a transgressor of the categorical imperatives of gender, Guido’s freakishness comes ostensibly from his transgression of racial boundaries:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	    Guido Volkbein, a Jew of Italian descent, had been both a gourmet and a dandy, never appearing in public without the ribbon of some quite unknown distinction tinging his buttonhole with a faint thread. He had been small, rotund, and haughtily timid, his stomache protruding slightly in an upward jutting slope that brought into prominence the buttons of his waistcoat and trousers, marking the exact center of his body with the obstetric line seen on fruits—the inevitable arc produced by heavy rounds of burgundy, schlagsahne, and beer.
	  </p>
<div class="attrib">
	    [<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 1]  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Since, in the contemporary discourse of eugenics and degeneration, “the Christian” and “the Jew” represent racial categories, Guido is guilty of miscegenation, and yet his illicit union is made manifest in a physiological description that confuses his gender. His racial degeneracy is red as feminization. Guido’s body becomes visible as the comic bulging of the buttons on his waistcoat “marking the exact center of his body with the obstetric line seen on fruits.” The obstetric line separates him into symmetrical halves, making visible their unnatural union and, simultaneously emasculates the Jew in terms typical of fascist anti-Semitism. While the military and mannish Hedvig gives birth in the first paragraph of the novel, in the second it is her husband, Guido, who carries the pregnant physique, the “obstetric line” revealing the false lineage of the Volkbeins he has conceived. Guido, like Felix, is “heavy with impermissible blood.”
	    </p>
<p>
	      As their traditional genders are transposed onto one another, Guido and Hedvig remind us not only that degeneration theory produced a feminized Jew, but also, as Dana Seitler writes, “that twentieth century conceptions of sexual degeneracy, promiscuity, and desire surfaced out of a racial and racializing context that shaped and disred the human body according to its logic.”<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Hence, the marriage between Hedvig and Guido preres the discursive intercourse between the queer subject and the Jew in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, an intercourse that not only renders the racial subject a pervert, but also renders the queer subject a “Jew.” In becoming Jew, the queer subject becomes a member of a rootless, degenerate race of miscegenated subjects motivated by monstrous, unnatural appetites. In becoming Jew, in other words, the queer subject becomes Decadent, an ideological stance that, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, produces the subject/object of desire.
	    </p>
<p>
	      In keeping with a freak show aesthetic that is designed to exploit the epistemological stance of indeterminacy, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> accompanies its tableau of the Wandering Jew as a pregnant man with a series of conflicting explanations that work with and against the scientific racism of the 1930s.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> In the spiel surrounding Guido and Felix, Decadence is apparently equated with degeneration, and it is by dint of this equation that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s narrator seems to ventriloquize the contemporary racial discourse of Nazi fascism. As Carlston writes, “Barnes undoubtedly understood what her symbols, particularly the image of the Jew, meant to the (fascist) age.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Regardless of what Barnes did or did not understand, as the Jew is nonetheless submitted to the freak show aesthetic of indeterminacy accomplished in the play between spiel and tableau, he becomes a model not only for otherness as such, but also for the freak dandy’s resistance to rationalization. At different turns and even, at times, in the space of the same sentence, Jewishness becomes a function of biology, an effect of history, and an aesthetic style and subjective stance vis-à-vis the hegemony of bourgeois rationalism.
	    </p>
<p>
	      The instability of the term “Jew” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> ironically manifests itself in its relation to “blood,” for in yoking the two terms together the novel only ostensibly confirms the biologically-based anti-Semitism of Nazi discourse. As it turns out, “blood” is as unstable a signifier in the novel as is “Jew.” Certainly, the assertions that Guido and Felix are “heavy with impermissible blood” and that their counterfeit ancestors are an “alibi for [that] blood” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 7), suggest that Jewishness is inescapably biological, yet the narrator radically complicates this equation directly before introducing the decadent circus freaks with whom the Jew identifies:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		It takes a Christian, standing eternally in the Jew’s salvation, to blame himself and to bring up from that depth charming and fantastic superstitions through which the slowly and tirelessly milling Jew once more becomes “collector” of his own past. His undoing is never profitable until some <span style="font-style:italic;">goy</span> has put it back into such shape that it can again be offered as a “sign.” A Jew’s undoing is never his own, it is God’s; his rehabilitation is never his own, it is a Christian’s. The Christian traffic in retribution has made the Jew’s history a commodity; it is a medium through which he receives, at the necessary moment, the serum of his own past that he may offer it again as his blood.

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		Both the Christian and the Jew in this passage are ostensibly defined biologically—by their bloodlines. Yet, as the paragraph asserts the commodification of Jewish history, the Jewish subject becomes reliant on a re-collected past, that is, on culture. The confusion between biological determinism and cultural construction is further evident in the final sentence of the passage. Jewish history is here likened to blood metaphorically as the “serum” of the past, but it is manipulated so that the Jew may present this culturally constructed and commodified past as “his blood,” the biological signifier. As a kind of reverse Darwinism, history is passed off as biology.
	      </p>
<p>
		Anti-Semitic and relentlessly essentializing, the narrator’s spiel is filled with assertions, with claims to knowledge and understanding of the aestheticized objects on display. And yet, as in the case of typical freak show spiel, the contradictions and hyperbolic quality of those claims create suspicions. <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s spiels exoticize and mystify their objects. Rather than granting the readers an appropriating gaze of the tableaux placed before them, Hedvig and Guido are rendered unassimilable to contemporary sciences of race. Hence, while Carlston sees their resistance to rationalism as an example of the novel’s kinship with fascism, it is, rather, part and parcel of the novel’s immanent critique of degeneration theory as it thrived within and without the fascist state.<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>
		The essence of Jewishness for Guido is persecution and humiliation, but the essence of Jewishness for <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is the Aesthetic Decadence through which Guido’s identification is forged. As Lara Trubowitz has emphasized, Guido’s “racial memory” of the ordinance of 1468 which demanded that “with a rope about its neck, Guido’s race should run in the Corso for the amusement of the Christian populace” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 2) is only apparently the key to his interpellation as a Jewish subject.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> Rather, the moment of ideological interpellation is offered in a sentence interrupted by a similitude that likens the “racial memory” to Aesthetic Decadence: “this memory and the handkerchief that accompanied it had wrought in Guido (as certain flowers brought to a pitch of florid ecstasy no sooner attain their specific type than they fall into its decay) the sum total of what is the Jew” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 2). As this <span style="font-style:italic;">fleur du mal</span> de-historicizes “the sum total of what is the Jew,” Trubowitz demonstrates, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> transforms the Wandering Jew into a wandering trope. For Trubowitz, it is a trope for the style of the text itself, a mode of storytelling dependent upon self-erasure. While I concur that Jewishness in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> detaches itself from the re of the Jew himself, in my reading the “Wandering Jew” res not as self-erasure but as the “florid” Decadence of the freak dandy, a spectacular subject/object of unrequited desire. For this reason, I affirm Trubowitz’s conclusion  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that “Robin finally is the principal Jew of the novel” .<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Nomadic, voracious, and ultimately unassimilable to the rationalist discourses that would explain her, Robin not only marries a Jew; she becomes more Jewish and more decadent than the Jew from whom she wanders away. If, as Seitler asserts, in Robin “<span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> makes visible a model of sexual personhood that is constitutively homeless, irrational, and perpetually mobile,” it is precisely because she assumes the decadence of the Wandering Jew.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>
		Like Guido, Hedvig, and Nikka, Robin enters the novel in a tableau that emphasizes the artificiality and excess of decadence, along with the showmanship and physical anomaly of the freak show. Yet where the exhibition of Guido and Hedvig partakes of the aggrandized mode of freak display, Robin’s is relentlessly exotic. In the exotic mode, Bogdan tells us, “showmen presented the exhibit so as to appeal to people’s interest in the culturally strange, the primitive, the bestial, the exotic.”<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> Unlike the “aggrandized mode,” which invited the audience to identify with the exhibit, the exotic mode emphasized the exhibit’s difference. Recalling Hedvig’s tableau and foreshadowing O’Connor’s, Robin is placed on a bed and in a highly detailed set. In keeping with an exotic mode of freak show display, her head is “surrounded by a confusion of potted plants, exotic palms and cut flowers, faintly oversung by the notes of unseen birds” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 34), all of which aid in the conveyance of Robin’s specific form of freakishness: atavism. In a passage that seductively pairs Decadence with degeneracy, Robin emerges as a romanticized version of an old freak show standard, the “missing link”:
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		  The perfume that her body exhaled was of the quality of the earth-flesh, fungi, which smells of captured dampness and yet is so dry, overcast with the odour of oil of amber, which is an inner malady of the sea, making her seem as if she had invaded a sleep incautious and entire. Her flesh was the texture of plant life, and underneath it one sensed a frame, broad, porous, and sleep-worn, as if sleep were a decay fishing her beneath the visible surface. About her head there was an effulgence as of phosphorous glowing about the circumference of a body of water—as if her life lay through her in ungainly luminous deteriorations—the troubling structure of the born somnambule, who lives in two worlds—meet of child and desperado.

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Like the “florid ecstasy” of the flower that turns immediately from effulgence to decay, the “phosphorous glowing” around Robin’s head is a function of “luminous deteriorations,” and hence, like the Jew, Robin res both degeneration and Aesthetic Decadence. Moreover, like Felix, Robin embodies the transgression of racial boundaries such that her very humanity is questionable. She is not only the “meet of child and desperado”; she is also an evolutionary throwback to the momentary hybridity of plant life and animal life and, finally, as the “beast turning human” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 37), to the convergence of animal and human life forms. Robin is atavistic, uncanny, the insinuation of the archaic and pre-historic in the twentieth century. Because the throwback has historically threatened the reversal of human development, Robin is a re for degeneration and devolution. Only apparently anomaly, the <span style="font-style:italic;">frisson</span> of the “missing link” lies in the possibility that evolution at any time may reverse its course. Robin is “the infected carrier of the past” who attracts by soliciting the desire for consumption:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> “before her the structure of our head and jaws ache—we feel that we could eat her” and in so doing, gain access to the archaic past, to press, as the narrator puts it, “our face close to the blood on the lips of our forefathers” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 37). Robin’s degeneration is our Decadent seduction.
		</p>
<p>
		  Yet between the two extended passages that lyrically introduce Robin as the conflation of the Decadent with the degenerate, a freak show aesthetic of indeterminacy intervenes. It is, as we have already seen in the novel’s treatment of the “Wandering Jew,” an aesthetic that provokes and prolongs desire through the contest it stages between the verbal art of spiel and the visual art of tableau, and its result is curiosity, desire held in suspense. It is an aesthetic that simultaneously renders the human curiosity indeterminate and, at the same time, reveals its identification with the commodity fetish. Without this aesthetic intervention, it might be possible to conclude, along with Carlston, that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Decadence reveals its alliance with fascism, for tasting the blood on the “lips of our forefathers” sounds a great deal like the fascist fantasy of immediate fusion with a primitive past. The revival of the archaic past for fascism, however, was marshaled in the name of regeneration, not degeneration. At least in the eugenic version of fascism promulgated by the Nazis, the degenerate and the Decadent were embodied most forcefully in the re of the Jew, whose elimination was the guarantee against racial decay. Thus, if <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> conveys a desire for an archaic past similar to that of fascism, it does so for utterly different reasons. In the spiel surrounding Robin, the desire is for regression, not regeneration. Moreover, the extended spiel is interrupted by allusions to freak show conventions that undermine the romance with regression so hyperbolically voiced by the narrator.

<p>
		  More than either the exhibition of Hedvig or Guido, Robin’s tableau emphasizes the artificiality and theatricality of her display, playing havoc with the lyrically-tuned assertions of the “missing link” spiel:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    Like a painting by the <span style="font-style:italic;">douanier</span> Rousseau, she seemed to lie in a jungle trapped in a drawing room (in the apprehension of which the walls have made their escape), thrown in among the carnivorous flowers as their ration; the set, the property of an unseen <span style="font-style:italic;">dompteur</span>, half lord, half promoter, over which one expects to hear the strains of an orchestra of woodwinds render a serenade which will popularize the wilderness.
		  </p>
<div class="attrib">
		    [<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 35)]
		  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		    In this tableau, the evolutionary discourse and degeneration theory exploited by the narrative to construct Robin as atavistic are both revealed as accoutrements to a public performance designed for mass consumption. Her stage, promoter, sound track, and the artificiality of the “jungle trapped in the drawing room,” all emphasize the freak show sleight of hand, the constructedness of the freak on display. Rather than the embodiment of the archaic, pre-historic, and pre-human past, Robin represents the desire for that past, the fantasy of regression, that experience of the uncanny exploited by Rousseau, the avant-garde, and fascism alike. Here it is demystified as the canny art of show business, the decadent commitment to artificiality put in the service of “the society of the spectacle.” If Robin is “thrown in among the carnivorous flowers as their ration,” it is part and parcel of a spectacular exhibition aimed at producing  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> curiosity as an object and as an epistemological stance, aimed, that is, against fascist instrumentalization.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Underscoring the demystification of Robin as a freak of nature, the text offers Robin’s exhibition as the site of O’Connor’s double hoax. “Half dompteur” and “half promoter,” he awakens the “sleeping beauty” by throwing water on her face, passing himself off as a doctor all the while (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 35). Second, he “prepares his audience for a miracle” that they entirely miss. While adorning his face with Robin’s makeup, he distracts the audience with a series of “honesties” and “reache[s] out and cover[s] a loose hundred franc note lying on the table” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 36). Robin’s exhibit, then, is a performance space for the hoax of authenticity, a site in which Aesthetic Decadence joins hands with degeneration theory in the production of a myth as fantastical as the unicorn or Sleeping Beauty. If Robin references the fascist goal of fusion with an archaic past, then <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> conveys that ideology as a popular myth passed off as science by a charlatan scam artist after a quick buck, or, as it were, “a hundred franc note lying on the table.” As the narrator makes clear two pages later when she asserts that “we feel we could eat her,” the carnivorous flowers reflect the voracious desires of the viewers themselves, desires to consume, to incorporate, to make Robin their own. Such, of course, is the desire of Felix, Nora, and Jenny, and it is through their attempts to rationalize—and thus possess—Robin that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> conveys a fascistic impulse detached from the fascist state.
		  </p>
<p>
		    As its protection against the threat of incorporation, competing explanations of Robin vie against one another in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, thanks largely to the strategic and protracted interventions of O’Connor, contradicting one another and casting each other into doubt. Originally exhibited as a “missing link,” Robin’s racial ambiguity in the first set of tableaux emerges as a function of her sexual ambiguity, her queerness. In addition to the science of degeneration that attends her earliest display, the discourses of contemporary sexology and Freudian psychoanalysis attempt, as O’Connor charges, “to dress the unknowable in the garments of the known” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 136). Playing the contrary assertions of these discourses against one another, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> ultimately refuses to explain Robin or her desires, and instead offers an immanent critique of bourgeois rationalism and its instrumental subject. As a Wandering Jew, Robin evades the grasp of those who would claim her and persists, to the end, as a freak dandy, a decadent subject/object of unrequited desire.
		  </p>
<p>
		    While critics have often identified O’Connor as the authoritative voice of the novel, a closer look at the context of O’Connor’s claims about Robin reveals the strategic ways he marshals degeneration theory and psychoanalysis against the claims of the two characters whose libidinal and epistemological desires are most dangerously directed at Robin: Nora Flood and Felix Volkbein. That is, rather than defining Robin, O’Connor’s hyperbolic assertions and elusive digressions work to un-fix Robin from the appropriations of Nora and Felix. O’Connor’s construction of her as a “missing link” thus represents not the novel’s commitment to fascist ideology or degeneration theory, but, rather, his effort to render Robin indeterminate and, hence, free. Thus, in the chapter entitled “Where the Tree Falls,” when faced with Felix’s own exotic portrayal of Robin’s uncanny embodiment of the archaic past, O’Connor responds with  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the parable of “the horse who knew too much” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 113), materializing Robin’s elusive affect as a function of wartime trauma.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> Only when Nora presents her love for Robin, and lesbian desire as such, as narcissism, does O’Connor exoticize Robin in terms that reproduce her initial display, as “outside the ‘human type’—a wild thing caught in a woman’s skin, monstrously alone, monstrously vain; like the paralyzed man in Coney Island . . .” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 146). Degeneration theory becomes a strategic mystification marshaled against the rationalization of psychoanalysis.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Although Nora confesses that she has “dressed the unknowable in the garments of the known” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 136), her confession does not stop her from continuing to discursively devour Robin. Each version of love she develops is a love defined as narcissistic incorporation, a love that destroys subject and object relations and hence allows Nora to “possess” Robin as part of herself. “Robin is incest,” she tells O’Connor, “I can’t live without my heart” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 156). “On her mouth,” she insists, “you kiss your own” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 143), and her final fantasy of eternal love is for the two of them to have “moulted our parts, as res in the waxworks are moulted down to their story” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 158). Within this context, O’Connor’s insistence on Robin’s otherness, her monstrosity, represents a counter-discourse both to the violence implicit in Nora’s account of love and to Freudian accounts of homosexual desire as a pathological manifestation of narcissism.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Yet, O’Connor himself turns to Freud in “Go Down, Moses,” the very same chapter in which he portrays Robin as an uncanny beast-turning-human. For those with samesex desire, O’Connor turns to the language of the “invert” and “the third sex,” terms he manipulates, like the evolutionary discourse of degeneration theory, to counter Nora’s account of same-sex desire. It is precisely when Nora characterizes same-sex desire as a will to power that O’Connor turns to his fairytale account of “this love we have for the invert” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 136). “And I, who want power,” Nora temporarily concludes, “chose a girl who resembles a boy,” a pathological explanation to which the doctor responds by asserting the essential and natural bisexuality of the child: “for in the girl it is the prince, and in the boy it is the girl that makes a prince a prince—and not a man” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 136). In the context of the conversation, O’Connor’s use of a Freudian vocabulary bespeaks neither his nor the novel’s conviction in psychoanalytic constructions of inversion so much as his efforts to counter Nora’s instrumental logic and thus to repair Robin and the same-sex desire she embodies to the realm of uncertainty.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">“A Fixed Dismay”</h1>
<p>
		    It is precisely because Robin is the subject/object of desire that she can and must remain disowned. In the pages of “The Possessed,” the novel’s final chapter, Decadence and degeneration apparently join hands to present a scene of gothic devolution. Robin wanders through the countryside and into churches, eventually arriving, as if drawn by supernatural forces, to the “decaying chapel” on the grounds of Nora’s farmhouse. There she arranges a “contrived altar,” placing flowers and toys before a Madonna and two candles. On the fateful night that closes the novel, Nora’s agitated dog leads Nora to the chapel door. Nora “plunges into the jamb” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 169), but as if from her point of view, the narrator reports:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		      Standing before them in her boy’s trousers was Robin. Her pose, startled and broken, was caught at the point where her hand had reached almost to the shoulder, and at the moment Nora’s body struck the wood, Robin began going down. Sliding down she went; down, her hair swinging, her arms held out, and the dog stood there, rearing back, his forelegs slanting; his paws trembling under the trembling of his rump, his hackle standing; his mouth open, his tongue slung sideways over his sharp bright teeth; whining and waiting. And down she went, until her head swung against his; on all fours now, dragging her knees. The veins stood out in her neck, under her ears, swelled in her arms, and wide and throbbing rose up on her fingers as she moved forward.

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		      Here, the beast-turning-human apparently makes good on its threat to reverse course; Robin seems to become a beast, and according to some critics, engages sexually with the dog she terrorizes. Down on all fours, she is the fantasy of sexual personhood beyond the reach of psychoanalysis and sexology, an obscene wish fulfillment that is also, at the same time, the brutal fantasy of return to an archaic past or to the imaginary realm of the mother. Equally brutal, however, the novel indicates its own awareness of the scene as a desperate fantasy. “Grinning and whimpering” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 170), Robin doesn’t turn into a dog; she <span style="font-style:italic;">acts like a dog</span>, and it is a performance that she cannot sustain. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, there will be no escape, no romantic return to nature, no feminist return to the mother or fascist return to the archaic past, not even a decadent return to the aestheticized cloister of the Catholic Church. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, there is no refuge, no place outside of the symbolic order of the “society of the spectacle,” and the only place from which to resist rationalization is from within that society. It is thus not surprising, then, that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> ends with a scene that tempts the reader to turn to the very discourses of rationalization thwarted in the preceding chapters as a basis for interpretation: psychoanalysis and degeneration theory. “Lying out, her hands beside her” and the dog’s head “flat along her knees” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 170), Robin is a study in stylized irresolution; her indeterminacy is her saving grace, that which allows her to remain dis-possessed.
		    </p>
<p>
		      As freak dandy, Robin solicits epistemological and libidinal desire, desire that, I have argued, remains unrequited to the end. For from the moment she is introduced, Robin functions as the absent center of a narrative devoted to the failed efforts of its characters to explain her, to claim her by way of asserting an understanding of her desires and the desires she provokes. Against eugenic and psychosexual discourses that would fix the subject, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> offers a decadent freak show that moves toward a state of “fixed dismay” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 157), reproducing in verbal form the “stylized irresolution” emblematized in the work of Aubrey Beardsley and representative of the Decadent art of the “Yellow Nineties.”
		    </p>
<p>
		      At the same time, Barnes’ neo-Decadent novel critically transforms that earlier aesthetic by explicitly identifying its privileged subject, the dandy, with the commodity fetish. In so doing, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> suggests that the aesthetic autonomy and the aesthetic individualism associated with Decadence at the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> are illusory conceits no longer possible in the context of contemporary liberal capitalism. Precisely because <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> takes “the society of the spectacle” as the ontological condition of subjectivity, it regards aesthetic autonomy as warily as the fascism that would absorb Decadence into degeneration theory. Rather than asserting aesthetic autonomy, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s immanent  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> critique works toward a state of doubt and uncertainty, a decadent state of arrested desire. And in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> it is the privileged state of resistance to instrumental reason and <span style="font-style:italic;">embourgeoisment</span>, the only place, as it were, left to go.

			  I am contesting a commonplace in the criticism contending that Barnes outgrows Decadence by the time she writes <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>. See especially Carolyn Burke’s “‘Accidental Aloofness’: Barnes, Loy, and Modernism” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Silence and Power: A Reevaluation of Djuna Barnes</span>, ed. Mary Lynn Broe (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991), 67–80, and“Djuna Barnes: Rue St.-Romain,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Women of the Left Bank: Paris, 1900–1940</span>, ed. Shari Benstock (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1986), 230–267. Burke is perhaps the most insistent on this point. She suggests that Barnes published the Beardsley-esque verbal and visual images of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Book of Repulsive Women</span> “as if it were necessary to kill off the old images of women before a different vision might become possible” . As Erin Carlston aptly concludes, the problem with Decadence for Burke, as for Benstock, is what they perceive to be its “internalized misogyny and homophobia.” <span style="font-style:italic;">Thinking Fascism: Sapphic Modernism and Fascist Modernity</span> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998), 49). I contend, along with Carlston, that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> exemplifies the extent to which Decadence continued to inform Barnes’ art, and that to the extent that its art is no longer misogynist or homophobic, it bespeaks a revision of Decadent Aesthetics, rather than an outright rejection of them.

			Just as fascism developed without uniformity in the many countries in which it traveled, so, too, did the culture industry evolve variously. It was not until the postwar period, for example, that French Marxists like Guy Debord and Henri Lefebvre responded against the rapid socioeconomic changes they identified with “Americanization” and its culture industry. On the other hand, even under Nazi control, Germany could boast a lively culture industry that the Nazis used to foster the illusion of individual and cultural autonomy. As Lutz Koepnick writes, “unlike the homogenizing rituals of the Nuremberg rally grounds, the commodity spectacles of Nazi mass culture entertained the individual with the utopian illusion that certain spaces remained beyond control, beyond politics, beyond the effects of coordination.” “Fascist Aesthetics Revisited,” <span style="font-style:italic;"></span> 6, no. 1 : 52. My point is that in the 1930s, avant-garde modernists necessarily and simultaneously confronted fascism and the culture industry as inescapable threats equally capable of instrumentalization.

In other words, until Marcus came along, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> had been celebrated as an illustration of an apolitical “high modernist decadence” (ibid.). In arguing that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is actually a protest against “sexual and political fascists” (“LL,” 221), Marcus not only makes a compelling case, but opens the door to serious study of the political implications of the text.

			  Writers like Susan Stewart and Mary Russo have demonstrated that the freak show is antithetical to the carnival in precisely the same way that spectacle is to Bakhtin’s carnivalesque novel: the freak show relies on the distance and distinction between actors and spectators that the carnival so aggressively denies. Stewart draws this distinction succinctly: “While the grotesque body of carnival engages in this structure of democratic reciprocity, the spectacle of the grotesque involves a distancing of the object and a corresponding ‘aestheticization’ of it. . . . On display, the freak represents the naming of the frontier and the assurance that the wilderness, the outside, is now territory.” <span style="font-style:italic;">On Longing: Narratives of the Miniature, the Gigantic, the Souvenir, the Collection</span> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> University Press, 1993), 107, 110. Unlike the carnival, it is not laughter that overcomes terror in the freak show, but the distance imposed by spectacle, negotiated in the interaction of the barker’s spiel with the freak’s tableau.

			My approach here follows closely that of Diane Chisholm, who sees the novel as a “final front against rationalization and <span style="font-style:italic;">embourgeoisment</span>” (OM, 195), but identifies its aesthetic not with Decadence, but with the “profane illumination” Walter Benjamin attributes to surrealism. “Obscene Modernism: Eros Noir and the Profane Illumination of Djuna Barnes” in <span style="font-style:italic;">American Literature</span> 69, no. 1 (March 1997): 167–206. I would contend that if the novel’s celebration of the détraqué and his “intoxication with all the processes of degradation” are part of its surrealism, then they point as well to surrealism’s debt to Decadence. Chisholm, “Obscene Modernism,” 189. The same is true for the works of the Marquis de Sade that Robin “sleeps with” , according to Chisholm, and which were revived not only by the surrealists but by the Decadents of the 1890s.

			Invaluable for its insistence on <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Decadence, Carlston’s study overlooks the fact that fascism and the neo-Decadence of the 1930s are both informed by the larger historical context of modernity, and that context in large part explains their common ground. Moreover, Carlston’s conclusions seem to miss the extent to which <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> critiques what her study takes to be the most important commonality between fascism and <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, its characters’ fantasies of immediacy and fusion. “The Learned Corruption of Language” thus stumbles as it tries to negotiate its recognition that immediacy and escape from the symbolic order are utterly undermined by the style of the novel, which luxuriates in the semiotic thrall so typical of the decadent text. As Carlston concedes, “Barnes’ language, in defiance of the central aesthetic principle of fascism, has ‘ceased to be organic.’ Her artifice, that antagonism to ‘Nature’ which makes her so inimical to Marxist criticism, is, equally, a rejection of the fascist literary ideal of mimesis” . Carlston is thus forced into separating the text’s ideological implications from its aesthetic such that it becomes impossible to say that decadence is the precondition of fascism. Her compromise is to make the novel’s “flirtation” with fascism a failure. The romance ends on aesthetic grounds; ideologically, they can still be friends.

			Here I am admittedly countering Bürger’s claim that the Aestheticism of the 1890s is the negative pre-condition of the avant-garde, rather than an avant-gardist movement itself. To my mind, there is no re that more explicitly embodies the integration of “art” and “life” than the dandy and, as I demonstrate in the following pages, that integration represents a critical praxis, a resistance to bourgeois rationalism and its repressive institutions.

			  Tracing Decadence back to Romanticism, Lukács sees it as a symptom of liberal capitalism that reaches a twin apotheosis in bourgeois modernism and in fascism, for, in Lukács’ eyes, fascism is the logical end of capitalism. Lukács suggests that if Decadent literature does not exactly produce a fascist ideology, it does “cultivate feelings” and “awaken instincts” vulnerable to fascist seduction. “Marx and the Problem of Ideological Decay,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Essays on Realism</span>, trans. David Fernbach, ed. Rodney Livingstone (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1980), 131. However unwittingly, decadent literature implicitly offers the model of subjectivity to the petty bourgeoisie that fascism would so effectively exploit. If literary Decadence is the precondition of fascism, then Felix’s father, the decadent Jewish  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> dandy who aesthetically produces a false past for his son to worship, unwittingly and ironically prepares the sentimental ground for his progeny’s seduction to fascism.
			
			  Whereas Lukács largely charges Decadent literature with a sentimental education for fascism, Benjamin suggests that in its attempt to make an art of life, Aestheticism lays the ground for the aestheticization of politics and, as Andrew Hewitt maintains, the “aesthetic in which politics is aestheticized is assumed to be decadent and reactionary.” <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascist Modernism: Aesthetics, Politics, and the Avant-Garde</span> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1993), 24. Thus, it is not simply that in Felix’s Decadence lies the will to aestheticization that fascism will take to its logical conclusion. Rather, in Felix, the aura of autonomous art has already transferred to politics and with it, what Russell Berman calls the “modes of behavior—silence, inaction, submission”—that Benjamin identifies with the auratic work of art. See Berman, “The Aestheticization of Politics: Walter Benjamin on Fascism and the Avant-garde,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Culture and Critical Theory: Art, Politics, and the Legacy of the Frankfurt School</span> (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989), 38. In Felix, Decadence has already aestheticized politics; Felix worships royalty for royalty’s sake.

			In her celebration of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> as an antifascist call to freedom, Marcus contends that the novel’s “antifascism is apparent only when it triumphs over its own anti-Semitism, when we realize that its characters—Jews, homosexuals, lesbians, transvestites, gypsies, blacks, and circus performers—were all to perish in the Holocaust” (“LL,” 229). In other words, for Marcus, the first chapter of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, which features the strongest anti-Semitic language, is anomalous and naïve, a fact that the rest of the text evinces as it includes the Jew in the sisterhood and brotherhood of outsiders it celebrates as the other of fascism.

			  Critics have interpreted differently the conflicting constructions of the Jew. For example, while Karen Kaviola sees them as part and parcel of the narrative’s ambivalence toward fascist ideology and discourse, Seitler argues that they register the extent to which <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> exploits “the polysemic renditions within degeneration theory”  or, in other words, that it plays with the contemporary instability of degeneration theory.

			Here my argument both parallels and diverges from Seitler’s. She argues that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> “play[s] with the uncertainties of scientific doctrine” and thereby “willfully reimagines the terms of sexual inversion at the same time that it redeploys them in yet another drama of degeneration.” “Down on All Fours,” 545. While “scientific doctrine” regarding sexual inversion in 1936 may well be uncertain and unresolved, the same cannot really be said of the racial degenerate.

<div class="contrib"><a href="#back">Dennis Denisoff</a></div>
</div>
<div id="body">
<p>
      The garden of the Decadents had always been rather crowded. While Charles Baudelaire tended his flowers of evil, Joris-Karl Huysmans rested bemused by his collection of sterile hybrids and Vernon Lee, off in the middle-distance, consumed the pulsating hills and valleys of Italian landscapes and other more carnal terrains. Simeon Solomon’s pouting Bacchi slouched their way across Walter Pater’s springing violets and ripening corn, and Arthur Machen’s and Aubrey Beardsley’s precocious Pans trampled through George Egerton’s forest glades. But when Gilbert and Sullivan, in their 1880 comic opera <span style="font-style:italic;">Patience</span>, brought attention to the “greenery-yallery” dandy-aesthetes, the reference was not to their thumbs. The correlation of Decadence with the natural environment conflicts with the standard characterization of the phenomenon from the mid-Victorian period to the present day as insensitive to humans’ links to nature. The dominant tendency in twentieth-century scholarship had been to describe the historical movement as either a withered, deviant offshoot of Romanticism, which boasted its own vigorous nature worship, or an early formulation of modernism’s investment in urbanism, artifice, and the unnatural. Decadent depictions of ritualized pagan acts have likewise more often been read as signifying the self-display and performative awareness of the sexually unconventional aesthete poseur, rather than seen as exploring any sort of sincere communion with nature.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>
      While the naturalism of twentieth-century modernism has received considerable attention over the years, Decadence has remained a sort of marker of extreme artifice, and so has been presented as either dysfunctionally solipsistic or daringly  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> avant-garde. The seeds of this formulation can be found in the works of Decadents themselves, including Aubrey Beardsley, the Goncourt brothers, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Rachilde, and Oscar Wilde. It was commentary on the movement such as Max Nordau’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Degeneration</span>  and Arthur Symons’s “The Decadent Movement in Literature” , however, that most forcefully developed the early critical association of Decadence with the unnatural, the deviant, and the sickly. Symons, for example, makes no acknowledgement of nature’s positive influence on Decadence; rather, he argues that Decadent art and literature’s “very artificiality is a way of being true to nature” because modern society is so utterly artificial itself.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> “Nature” here is not used to refer to the products of the earth, but as a synonym for “context.” While this artistic mirror on the modern world can be condoned as a form of honesty, Symons argues that this does not make the work admirable. Instead, he reasserts as superior the notion of nature as biologically essential. Of Decadence, Symons declares, “healthy we cannot call it, and healthy it does not wish to be considered” (ibid.). Notably, in this piece Symons found “Decadence” most appropriate as an umbrella term encompassing various developments including Symbolism and Impressionism, but he changed the title of his study for its re-publication in 1899 to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Symbolist Movement in England</span>. Through this public revision of the importance he himself placed on the Decadent Movement, he directly contributed to its decomposition, shifting it from a position of cultural authority to one of a more subordinate status, especially in comparison to the more aggressive vigor of Symbolism.
    </p>
<p>
      It is accurate to say that Decadence was heavily invested in the aesthetic and symbolic potency of urbanism and artifice, but many of the Movement’s artists and writers—from the mid-nineteenth century into the twentieth, and from Britain as well as elsewhere—also relied heavily on nature and nature worship for conceptualizing and articulating their non-normative tastes and social values. Like Pater, most contributors to the movement were not pagans in ritual earnest—and this is, in part, my point. Rather than the confrontational posturing that has come to characterize the key proponents of the Aesthetic Movement and the historical avant-garde, Decadent authors and artists often encouraged a more subtle permeation of the modernist era with a disquieting pagan atmosphere. I am compelled to follow the practice in queer studies since Jonathan Dollimore’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Sexual Dissidence</span> and describe such a maneuver as dissidence, which he defines as the act of challenging normative identity models either by offering anti-essentialist critiques of depth models of identity or, conversely, by claiming non-normative desires as essential to one’s nature.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Decadence often reflects the rebellious attitude characteristic of dissident strategies. In order to foreground the interest in counter-humanist deindividuation and species intersubjectivity held by Pater and other contributors to pagan Decadence, however, it is more appropriate to adopt the notion of dissipation than dissent. A dissipative model highlights not only the lack of clear lines of confrontation, but also the role of agents that are often inconstant and deindividuated. This emphasis accords with key perspectives that existed not only in the classicist, polytheistic pagan discourse of the nineteenth century but also in the more politically explicit eco-paganism being articulated today.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> The paganism of Decadence  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> rarely if ever shifts into overt environmentalist rhetoric, tending instead to sustain its presence by permeating other aesthetic discourses, motifs, and allusions. Nevertheless, recent pagan and post-humanist notions of intersubjectivity help underscore the eco-political potential pulsing through the pagan vein of Decadence.

<p>
	Paganism gained popularity on the waves of the Romantic and the German folk movements of the nineteenth century. Deriving many of its views from ancient Greece and Rome, as well as from Northern European cultures such as the Celtic and Scandinavian, it was influenced as well by imperialist ideas of primitive paganism, the growing interest in archaeology and Egyptology, and written reports—often far from factual—of secret societies and witches associated with things such as spells, nocturnal rituals, and Christian demonology. Margot Adler, Ronald Hutton, and others have noted references to nineteenth-century rituals practiced in Britain that distinctly parallel classical pagan ceremonies. “Sketches of Superstitions,” an article published in November 1839 in <span style="font-style:italic;">Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal</span>, makes apparent a widespread recognition in Victorian England of the correlations between ancient Greek and Roman pagans and “those uneducated persons of the present day who believe that the winds can be raised by incantation, and that bodily illnesses are an effect of the evil eye.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> At the end of the century, similar material could be found in a publication such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderland</span>, the journal edited by W. T. Stead, best known as the moral-crusading journalist behind <span style="font-style:italic;">The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon</span>. Defining itself as a “psychical quarterly,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderland</span> included articles on paganism as well as apparitions, astrology, clairvoyance, folklore, occult studies, and spiritualism. While the publication included some stories, its emphasis was on nonfiction and the serious study of these subjects and their current practice around the world.

<p>
	An anonymous article entitled “Witches and Witchcraft” that appeared in an 1897 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderland</span> serves to illustrate the period’s fascination with paganism.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Discussing Irish celebrations of the Celtic religious festival of Baeltine, the piece details recorded cases of women changing into hares: a process reminiscent of the interspecies transformations common to the classical events celebrated by Pater in the essay “The Bacchanals of Euripides” and elsewhere. Victorians’ awareness and understanding of this polymorphous pagan movement was further enhanced by the formation of a popular discourse through not only publications such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderland</span>, but also cultural developments such as spiritualism and the Decadence. As James Obelkevich concludes, in reference to the period, using the term “paganism” to refer to “the non-Christian elements in popular religion is convenient but misleading, since like popular religion as a whole, it was not a distinct and conscious movement or organisation but a loose agglomeration of religious phenomena.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Today’s paganism has arisen from an equally diverse array of spiritualities and philosophies reflecting a global web of earth-centered values and concerns.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> These various pagan systems are related to one another through an acceptance of polytheism  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and a determination to respect the diversity and multiplicity of reality and individual experience. Classics scholar David Miller suggests the political potency of such views in his observation that “polytheism is eternally in unresolvable conflict with social monotheism, which in its worst form is fascism and in its less destructive forms is imperialism, capitalism, feudalism and monarchy.” Polytheism, he argues, “is not only a social reality; it is also a philosophical condition. It is that reality experienced by men and women when Truth with a capital ‘T’ cannot be articulated reflectively according to a single grammar, a single logic, or a single symbol system.”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> As with the feminist, lesbian, gay, and queer rights movements whose histories parallel that of today’s pagan movement, paganists’ rejection of a single, coherent discourse with which to articulate its value systems has fostered an intense wariness among current pagan groups toward organized authority and fixed laws or tenets.
      </p>
<p>
	In “The Ethics of Paganism,” Emma Restall Orr observes that one of the characteristics distinguishing today’s paganism from other religions is its “lack of necessity to believe blindly in anything at all. As a spiritual tradition founded on the power of nature, the tenets guide the individual not into belief but into genuine experience.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Paganism’s difficulties with institutions that aim to establish universalizing truth claims and rigid classificatory methodologies accord with its animist belief that all natural things (including flowers, rocks, humans and insects) have forms of vitality that are worthy of respect. Pagan animism challenges the notion of “speciesism,” the anthropocentric privileging of humans over other animals and life forms.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Peter Singer writes, “what we must do is bring nonhuman animals within our sphere of moral concern and cease to treat their lives as expendable for whatever trivial purposes we may have.” A key mechanism for speciesism, he points out, is that of making “the boundary of the right to life run exactly parallel to the boundary of our own species.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Centuries before the modern animal rights movement, pagan animism had already argued against such classificatory segregation.
      </p>
<p>
	In this regard, one of the strongest conceptual models within contemporary paganism is that of the earth or universe either as a single organism or as an intersubjective mass of indistinguishable organisms. Writing in 1972, Isaac Bonewits describes the universe as “a huge Web of interlocking energy, in which every atom and every energy wave is connected with every other one.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Otter Zell similarly defines paganism as a philosophy that sees humanity as a “functional organ within the greater organism of Life.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Just a few years later, chemist James Lovelock advanced what would become the most popular of these models: “The evolution of organisms,” he argues, is “so closely coupled with the evolution of their physical and chemical environment that together they constitute a single evolutionary process, which is self-regulating.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> In all such intersubjective models, humans are seen as influential but non-essential components of that organism.
      </p>
<p>
	Lovelock declares himself not to be a pagan and situates his hypothesis effectively within scientific discourse. He does, however, indirectly acknowledge the influence of paganism on his science in calling his argument the “Gaia Hypothesis.” His term is taken from the classical myth in which Chaos gives birth to the siblings Gaia and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Eros, who are mother earth and the god of sex, lust, and love. The myth personifies the earth as a living goddess, a formulation in accordance with pagan animism, while also offering an extremely early fusion of earth-centered spirituality and non-normative sexuality—the pagan and queer perspectives that characterize modernist Decadence and current pagan politics alike.
      </p>
<p>
	The term “Gaia” has attained popular usage among today’s pagans, most of whom are not only interested in how the planet is formulated but who, unlike Lovelock, are also drawn to a spiritual dissipation of the self within a natural collective. The desire to experience one’s self as an indistinguishable part of a larger organism or some other type of intersubjective entity, on the one hand, and the political impetus to articulate pagan values and concerns through a humanist world view that assumes individual responsibility, on the other, constitutes a challenge for today’s pagans. As Thom van Dooren warns, for pagans “to lose sight of the individual in favour of more ‘holistic’ understandings of the world is to fail to recognize and honour all of the ways in which we are different from one another, both those of our species and others.”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Paganism’s equal-but-diverse holism appears to run the risk of formulating its own homogenizing hypothesis.
      </p>
<p>
	This conundrum echoes the philosophical bind of nineteenth-century liberalism, where the values of independence and personal growth were constantly being weighed against the rights of society at large and the importance of collective stability. In <span style="font-style:italic;">On Liberty</span> , John Stuart Mill attempts to formulate a collective utilitarian ethic that would support, yet minimally impinge upon, the freedom of the individual.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> As van Dooren and others note, however, today’s paganism recognizes nonhuman species within the notion of the collective. The conception of multi-species subjectivity suggests that much of Victorian liberal philosophy framed its debate in terms that presupposed a humanist elitism that actually undermined, in spirit, the values espoused by philosophers such as Mill, even accounting for the ambivalences within his work.
      </p>
<p>
	In <span style="font-style:italic;">On the Basis of Morality</span> , Arthur Schopenhauer turns explicitly to animal rights to address the notion of individual liberty. In considering Kant’s dictum that every rational being exists as an end in itself, Schopenhauer can only conclude that the statement is a contradiction and that to argue that a human only has a duty to other humans is “revolting and abominable.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Noting the ways in which Western European thinkers struggled to conceive of humans as fundamentally and crucially different from other species, Schopenhauer argues that, according to these views, ultimately “animals would be quite incapable of distinguishing themselves from the external world and would have no consciousness of themselves, no ego!” (<span style="font-style:italic;">OBM</span>, 176). For Schopenhauer, however, “to answer such absurd statements, we can point simply to the boundless egoism inherent in every animal, even the smallest and lowest” (ibid.). And because all animal species demonstrate self-consciousness and “the <span style="font-style:italic;">will</span> of the individual,” they deserve rights and liberties (<span style="font-style:italic;">OBM</span>, 178). In this study, Schopenhauer assumes his full understanding of the perspectives and mental capabilities of all species, making no particular caveat for the possibility that, if all animals are individuals, their minds might well function with equal distinction. Working with these generalizations, he concludes that humans can  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> be differentiated from other animals specifically through their ability to reason. As he then points out, this competency differentiates only the brains of humans from those of other animals, while leaving the rest of all living beings indistinguishable from one another (<span style="font-style:italic;">OBM</span>, 178). The limited dissimilarity of the ability to reason is not sufficient for denying rights to animals in themselves.
      </p>
<p>
	Individuality and self-reflection are fundamental premises of liberty for Mill as well. The key distinctions between humans and other animals, he posits, are that while nonhumans work by instinct, humans are self-reflective and can act on choices that will bring about change in the future. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Utilitarianism</span> , he critiques Epicureanism for suggesting that life has “no better and nobler object of pursuit” than beastly pleasures:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  If the sources of pleasure were precisely the same to human beings and to swine, the rule of life which is good enough for the one would be good enough for the other. The comparison of the Epicurean life to that of beasts is felt as degrading, precisely because a beast’s pleasures do not satisfy a human being’s conceptions of happiness. Human beings have faculties more elevated than the animal appetites, and when once made conscious of them, do not regard anything as happiness which does not include their gratification.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	In this passage, Mill’s speciesism blinds him to the possibility that nonhumans might have pleasures of which he is unaware. He is also confident that few people “would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast’s pleasures.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Despite Mill’s willingness to consider the possibility of animal rights, his assumption of a species hierarchy, his metaphoric use of the culturally degraded swine to signify all nonhumans, and his debasement of sensual pleasures through a language of nobility expose his interest in reinforcing an essentialist subordination of nonhuman creatures. No attempt is made to recognize a multi-species perspective or the possibility that human perspective itself is limited. Of equal note, Mill also assumes that all people would prefer individual agency to deindividuated pleasure.
      </p>
<p>
	Looking to the end of the century, Wilde, in “The Soul of Man under Socialism,” repeats the pleasure-based distinction between humans and other animals but also notes its ambiguity. “Sympathy with pain there will, of course, always be,” he affirms, “It is one of the first instincts of man. The animals which are individual, the higher animals, that is to say, share it with us.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Echoing Schopenhauer, Wilde asserts that animals share the capacity to sympathize with others’ suffering. As Henry S. Salt points out in his 1894 <span style="font-style:italic;">Animals’ Rights</span>, there is in fact a string of people from history who have argued for animal rights based on similar views. Salt himself concludes that animals of various species possess “a distinctive individuality and, therefore, are in justice entitled to live their lives with a due measure of that ‘restricted freedom’ to which Herbert Spencer alludes.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>
	While the divide between humans and other animals was viewed skeptically throughout the nineteenth century, the language used by Mill and others frequently implied notions of differentiation and hierarchy. The mingling of humans and other species also has become central to recent inquiries into the place of the humanist individual  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in our own assumedly posthumanist times, although we now find a greater sensitivity to claims regarding the relevance and even provability of distinctions and categories. Cary Wolfe’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Animal Rites</span>  offers an in-depth theorization of the relationship of modern species categorization and the humanism underlying aspects of posthumanist theory.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Wolfe’s interest in animal distinctions in this work is motivated not by the question of animal rights per se, but by the question of what it means to be human. In <span style="font-style:italic;">When Species Meet</span> , a sustained meditation on “the Great Divide between humans and other critters,” Donna Haraway aims to locate “the rich multiplicities and topologies of a heterogeneously and nonteleologically connected world.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Likewise, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Thousand Plateaus</span>  has proven a foundational text for theorizing the deflation of binary distinctions between species, arguing that an individual’s identity is not a set entity—as van Dooren and others assume—but an ongoing, protean process. According to Deleuze and Guattari, there is no pre-existing individual who performs identity or on whom identity is affixed. Foregrounding the anti-humanism of their model, they describe identity not simply as an act of becoming but as one of “becoming-animal,” thereby replacing the idea of identity self-fashioning with that of the multiplicity and mutual contingency that characterizes life forms that operate in swarms or packs.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Claire Colebrook’s summary of Deleuze and Guattari’s notion of “becoming-animal” through modern conceptions of desire suggests its relevance to pagan theory:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  Whereas most theories of desire imagine desire as directed towards possessing what one lacks or has lost, or as directed to what lies beyond life, Deleuze and Guattari do not set desire against life. Life is desire, and desire is the expansion of life through creation and transformation. Becoming-animal is, therefore, not a being or having. In becoming-animal you do not wear a cat-suit or imagine humans and animals as equal members of some grand ecological community where “we” are all the same. [. . .] Becoming-animal shows that becoming is not a series of actions directed towards some image that we hope to replicate; it is a transformation at each point of action with no external end.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Deleuze and Guattari’s model reinforces the important role of the performative in recent sexual and pagan politics. With queer activism, public acting up and acting out is a strategic repeated performance, a ritual by which queer proteanism becomes imbedded within mainstream society. Similarly, today’s paganism has taken what were once often private group rituals and extended their function to include the performance of spiritual events in public as a means of bringing attention to concerns regarding environmentalism, animal rights, and religious persecution.
      </p>
<p>
	Despite these similarities, Deleuze and Guattari’s attention to the blurring of species subjectivities that Cartesian humanism has struggled to deny cannot be read itself as an explicitly politicized environmentalism. Nevertheless, the dissipative nature of becoming-animal foregrounds the same symbiotic relationships among life-forms that are reflected in eco-paganism’s efforts to diffuse self-identity within a larger natural collective. Similarly, Deleuze and Guattari’s interest in the ongoing process of becoming-animal echoes concerns that were central to Decadence. Even the language  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Thousand Plateaus</span> often sounds explicitly inflected with Decadent aesthetics, as in the claim that
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  Werewolves are bands, and vampires too, and [. . .] bands transform themselves into one another. But what exactly does that mean, the animal as band or pack? Does a band not imply a filiation, bringing us back to the reproduction of given characteristics? How can we conceive of a peopling, a propagation, a becoming that is without filiation or hereditary production?<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	To answer their own question, they propose a model that chooses “epidemic to filiation, contagion to heredity, peopling by contagion to sexual reproduction, sexual production. Bands, human or animal, proliferate by contagion, epidemics, battlefields, and catastrophes. Like hybrids, which are in themselves sterile, born of a sexual union that will not reproduce itself.” Maintaining that “unnatural participations or nuptials are the true Nature spanning the kingdoms of nature,” they argue that “contagion, epidemic, involves terms that are entirely heterogeneous: for example, a human being, an animal, and a bacterium, a virus, a molecule, a microorganism.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> This view of the “unnatural” as that which acknowledges the inconstancy and volatility of the natural environment is a common trope in works of the Decadent Movement as well.
      </p>
<p>
	Whenever Victorian monsters are conflated with unnatural sexuality and disease, Nordau’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Degeneration</span> and its attack on all things Decadent comes to mind. Here, however, Deleuze and Guattari’s imagery and rhetoric replace the heteronormative, anthropocentric model of reproduction with something more inclusive of diversity, something more queer and more pagan. Meanwhile, the theorists’ language of vampirism, animalism, disease, and contagion indicates their desire to take an anti-normative, anti-humanist philosophical and ethical stance. Advocating a model of propagation that applies as readily to microorganisms as to humans, and that conceives of sexuality as the result of amoral, impulsive acts, Deleuze and Guattari work to destabilize not only the notion of the individual but also that of the species, a project initiated by the Decadents themselves.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Pagan Decadence and Ritual Dissipation in Walter Pater</h1>
<p>
	Many Western pagans today would appreciate the notion of ongoing becoming, but Deleuze and Guattari’s theory does not address their sense of responsibility toward maintaining personal agency and ethical purpose. According to Emma Restall Orr, sharing “the existentialist’s suspicion of the individual’s submersion into the collective, the Pagan emphasizes retaining personal moral responsibility.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> For many pagans today, one of the most popular ways of harmonizing this sense of one’s ethics and agency with the desire to sublimate the self in a collective transformation is through bodily ritual, a practice presented by Pater and other members of the Decadent Movement as a fundamental component of the pagan aesthetic life.
      </p>
<p>
	In recent years, the political potency of Pater’s aestheticism has been analyzed closely through queer methodologies rooted in Foucauldian theory. Michael F. Davis advises  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> us, however, to question this approach, in light of it itself having become “a dominant discourse that delimits the range of inquiry into, and our understanding of, the function of same-sex desire in Pater’s writing.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> For Davis, our reliance on Foucault has obscured the Decadent author’s own uniquely politicized aestheticism. Pater’s work puts forward its own queer way of envisioning—or, more precisely, of enacting—a subject’s relationship to the environment by encouraging, in Davis’s words, “the nonspeculative, non-metaphysical thinker [. . .], or to be more exact, the physical thinker, one who ‘thinks’ through and with the body.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Enhanced attention to Pater’s interests in the body’s materiality, Davis argues, circumvents the scholarly tendency to rely on theories based on institutional discourses and counterdiscourses. Such a redirection of focus, I would argue, also encourages scholars to recognize subtler, more dissipative forms of interaction, including non-speciesist experiences.
      </p>
<p>
	The attribution of the term “queer” to nineteenth-century conceptions of thinking as a bodily process suggests that equal sensitivity need be given to the fact that the body historically has been conceived of in myriad ways and as consisting of varied forms and parameters. Pater, for example, formulates his own ideas of thinking through the body using a classical notion of the human as part of an animist collective. In “A Study of Dionysus,” he describes a process of development in the worship of Dionysus that began with a “primitive tree-worship” that grew “out of some universal instinctive belief that trees and flowers are indeed habitations of living spirits.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> According to Pater, this changed into a “spirit of a severe and wholly self-conscious intelligence” that eventually became “the entirely humanised religion of Apollo” (<span style="font-style:italic;">GS</span>, 35). The Apollonian self- conscious intelligence—that is, rational mental thought—is juxtaposed explicitly here with an instinctual sense of being that is not characterized by a humanist notion of the self or even necessarily of the human species. Although Pater implies a developmental trajectory from the primitive to the humanized, he also declares that what he calls the Greek spirit “belongs to all ages”; Apollonian religion may be “entirely humanised” but living beings are not necessarily entirely Apollonian (<span style="font-style:italic;">GS</span>, 17). Pater reminds his readers of “the feeling we too have of a life in the green world”: “Who has not at moments felt the scruple,” he asks, “which is with us always regarding animal life, following the signs of animation further still, till one almost hesitates to pluck out the little soul of flower or leaf?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">GS</span>, 11) At the same time that he addresses what he calls, in his essay “Winckelmann,” the “pagan manner” of aesthetic sensuality, Pater also explores the philosophic implications of paganism’s animism and veneration of nature. Describing his mythic fiction, M. F. Moran suggests Pater’s extension of his queer sympathies into the realm of animism. She refers to the return of such pagan conceptions during the Victorian era as heralding “a reassessment of perspectives and qualities previously deemed evil, if acknowledged at all. And as the community comes to tolerate the difference of Denys or Apollyon, so its members are brought to self-knowledge and maturity, expressed in personal, social, and artistic terms.”<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Today, Moran’s language of tolerance and openness to diverse qualities once deemed immoral brings to mind queer politics sooner than the pagan myth on which her analysis focuses. In Pater’s writings, however, the two are not readily distinguishable.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	In his conclusion to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Renaissance</span>, Pater addresses the perceived tension between pagan collectivism and the Apollonian or humanist notions of the individual that came to dominate modernity. Here, he famously describes “the individual in his isolation, each mind keeping as a solitary prisoner its own dream of a world” (<span style="font-style:italic;">TR</span>, 221). He begins the piece, however, with an image of the individual as not isolated either in space or in time. Referring to the transformations that occur during any given moment, he declares:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  Our physical life is a perpetual motion of them—the passage of the blood, the waste and repairing of the lenses of the eye, the modification of the tissues of the brain under every ray of light and sound—processes which science reduces to simpler and more elementary forces. Like the elements of which we are composed, the action of these forces extends beyond us: it rusts iron and ripens corn. Far out on every side of us those elements are broadcast, driven in many currents; and birth and gesture and death and the springing of violets from the grave are but a few out of ten thousand resultant combinations.
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	  [<span style="font-style:italic;">TR</span>, 22]
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  When Pater refers in this piece to the individual in isolation, he is referring to a person’s inability to perceive reality in the same way as anybody else. The experience is described as one of isolation from other human beings specifically. But when he describes the individual as part of a collective, he imagines a person not only as a cluster of interactive organs and other bodily materials, but also as contributing to a global design that is part of a larger, natural web (<span style="font-style:italic;">TR</span>, 221). In addition, he situates this interactive web within the natural transformations of birth, death, decay, and, through the image of “the springing of violets from the grave,” animistic rebirth. He suggests, furthermore, that a person gains life energy through this boundless process of regeneration.
	</p>
<p>
	  Pater’s essay “The Bacchanals of Euripides” similarly res Dionysus not as an individual but as a dissolution of being into ongoing transmutations among the singular and the multiple, among one gender and others, among one species and others and so on. This is most apparent here in his depiction of Dionysus’s female followers, the maenads. In Greek mythology, the maenads were known to practice nighttime spiritual rituals and to go into raving frenzies that at times resulted in eating raw meat and killing other humans. During these states, they were also known to perform acts of transmutation, such as getting wine or milk to flow from the earth. In “The Bacchanals of Euripides,” Pater describes the maenads’ use of ritual to celebrate the start of spring as a form of transmutation itself, in which
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

<p class="continued">
	      Imagining Dionysus as “a woman-like god,” Pater’s transgendered depiction is part of the rhetoric by which he saturates his aesthetic with sexual potentialities, a queering upon queering subsumed within the de-individuation of pagan spirituality. The maenads’ gradual shift from personal isolation—“one here and another there”—to a single hyper-sensual collective is gradually reconred as the god himself. The sublimation of the subjects into the collective experience of pleasure leads to a new notion of the phenomenon called Dionysus, it being more appropriate now to conceive of the god as a collective process of transmutation rather than an individual, even a supernatural one, with secondary followers. Thus, in “A Study of Dionysus,” Pater represents the god not as a being but as “a single imaginable form, an outward body of flesh presented to the senses, and comprehending, as its animating soul, a whole world of thoughts, surmises, greater and less experiences” (<span style="font-style:italic;">GS</span>, 10). Pater describes Dionysus “becoming, in his chase, almost akin to the wild beasts—to the wolf” (<span style="font-style:italic;">GS</span>, 47). Pagan human sacrifice is, in this context, a symbolic performance of the sacrifice of liberal humanism itself, “the beautiful soft creature become [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] an enemy of human kind” like the “werewolf.”
	    </p>
<p>
	      In Pater’s work, Dionysus is the manifestation of a collective passion that includes the enthusiasm of both the maenads and the author’s own fervor for the bacchanals, as well as his dissemination of pagan passion among young, educated males. According to Pater, as the religion of Dionysus gained popularity and moved from the rustic vineyards to Athens, it became embodied by “noble youths” and “urbane young men” (<span style="font-style:italic;">GS</span>, 39). It was to them, “sitting together at the banquet, that those expressions of a sudden eloquence came, of the loosened utterance and finer speech, its colour and imagery.” That a contemporary version of this group was one of the intended audiences of his work is apparent from his well-known claim to have removed the conclusion from the second edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Renaissance</span> because “it might possibly mislead some of those young men into whose hands it might fall” (<span style="font-style:italic;">TR</span>, 239).

<p>
	      Yopie Prins recognizes in this personified contagion “the prototype of the Decadent aesthete.”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> It is not the individual that defines the aesthete, but the heightened sensitivity to diverse pleasurable sensations animated through a sensory communication with—or more accurately, permeation through—the natural environment. The aesthete’s agency is apparent in the ritual of self-submission to the fully diverse pleasures offered by the banquet of life. Pater describes his Decadent aesthete as a dissipation of personality within a broader permeable experience where, as he says in “The Bacchanals,” “the aroma of the green world is retained in the fair human body, set forth in all sorts of finer ethical lights and shades” (<span style="font-style:italic;">GS</span>, 62). The sensuality characteristic of Pater’s work is most apparent here in the lingering language describing “the fair human body,” but the description actually emphasizes the porosity of the carnal. In one sense, the aroma of pagan nature is distilled and intensified within the bodily form of the individual. But without attaining any sort of solidity, it has already begun to dissipate through a range of ethics, pleasures, and sensualities enhanced by the pagan Decadents’ sensitivity to their own diversity.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	      Attacks on the paganism and sexuality of Decadent works during Pater’s lifetime reflect the fact that the refined, exclusionary language of such writings did not deter the spread of its various lights and shades. Indeed, the considerations of paganism and nature worship put forward by Pater and others continued to be addressed at the end of the century and beyond in works such as Kenneth Grahame’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Pagan Papers</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Wind in the Willows</span> , in William Sharp’s journal, <span style="font-style:italic;">Pagan Review</span> , and in the Celtic-influenced works Sharp published into the twentieth century under the pseudonym of Fiona Macleod. Pagan Decadence also appeared in somewhat diluted form in other poetry and fiction as a sort of sensual nature worship and in a more threatening, often gothic form in works by Arthur Machen and others. But as the pagan Decadent influence expanded, it also came into more blatant conflict with the tenets of immediacy and spontaneity that were increasingly being seen as characteristic of modernist art and literature. G. K. Chesterton’s 1905 critique of pagan Decadence therefore voices distaste for artistic excess, delicacy, and detail in just such terms. As he dismissively states, “Of the New Paganism (or neo-Paganism), as it was preached flamboyantly by Mr. Swinburne or delicately by Walter Pater, there is no necessity to take any very grave account, except as a thing which left behind it incomparable exercises in the English language.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Never catching on as effectively as “New Woman” or “New Journalism,” the term “New Paganism” often carried with it the tone of mockery perceptible in Chesterton’s commentary. His glib tone, however, belies the more earnest concern, shared by many, with the persistent menace of pagan Decadence.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Chesterton’s critique of New Paganism arose in his consideration of an article by Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent Review</span>. As a gay Classics scholar, Dickinson potentially could have been lost among the Decadents who flourished during the last two decades of the century. One of the best known of his publications was <span style="font-style:italic;">The Greek Way of Life</span> , which, like the author himself, co-mingles a pagan philosophy of being with same-sex desire. In light of Wilde’s incarceration the previous year, the gentleness with which Dickinson incorporates discussion of homoeroticism and male friendship is understandable, although it just as strongly reflects the dissident strategy characteristic of Decadence itself. Dickinson stands out from many of the other participants within the Decadent Movement, however, in part because his pagan and queer values were engrained with a sense of political purpose. He developed an interest in a spiritualized form of socialism explored also by his friend Edward Carpenter, worked on a farming cooperative, gave lectures for the University Extension program in England, which arose in large part to address the lack of educational opportunities for women, and protested the First World War. His influence on the Bloomsbury Group, on Kenneth Grahame, and on E. M. Forster, who published a biography of Dickinson in 1934, makes it apparent that Chesterton’s attempt to curtail the influence of pagan Decadence did not prove especially effective.
	    </p>
<p>
	      In his discussion of Dickinson, Chesterton declares that New Paganism, as most clearly exemplified in the work of Pater and Swinburne, “never at any time bore the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> smallest resemblance to Paganism.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> He is correct in recognizing that the paganism of the Decadent Movement was less than wholly devoted to pre-Christian religions, for it had been intent on not simply addressing classical paganism but on exploring more fully people’s relationship with the natural environment, through avenues that included Celtic culture and African mythology. As such, pagan Decadence not only problematized the false divisions between humans, other animals, and nature in general, but also acknowledged the impact that humans’ material and spiritual reliance upon nature has on the transience and diversity of identity. According to Ronald Hutton, the boldness that had come to characterize paganism by the end of the nineteenth century was undermined by Wilde’s incarceration. The pagan Decadent works produced during the high modernist period suggest, however, a more diverse set of causes behind this change, including shifts in modernist aesthetics, the commodification of Decadence and aestheticism, and the familiarity and contempt that are bred by any cultural movement’s success. As Hutton himself notes, what followed the 1890s “was not so much a decline as a more subdued and thoughtful continuation.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> He finds an example of this shift specifically in Dickinson’s work, arguing that “in many ways the less provocative and flamboyant use of this language of paganism made it all the more effective and ingrained in British culture.” As is made clear by the parodies of Decadence and aestheticism, as well as its co-option by popular advertising, the dissipation of decadence into the mainstream that Hutton describes began nearly the same time as the Decadent Movement itself.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> The difference in the 1890s was that the mainstream was not so much scandalized by pagan Decadence—however much it was entwined with the queer desires being condemned along with Wilde—as bored and irritated by the self-commodified poseurs seen to be still carrying its torch.
	    </p>
<p>
	      The skepticism that characterized pagan Decadence and stimulated its continuation in a more dissipated form is especially well captured in W. B. Yeats’s “Rosa Alchemica.” This story, published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Savoy</span> in 1896, directs its condemnation not at paganism itself but at the eccentric display that had come to typify the public image of the movement. When Yeats wrote the story, he himself was still seriously exploring what paganism had to offer, and was considering setting up on an Irish island a mystical order combining ancient Greek and Roman paganism and Christianity with Irish folklore and nationalism.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> In “Rosa Alchemica,” the narrator tells of his close escape from “pagan ceremonies and mysterious idolatries” when he flees a college run by a close-knit pack of practicing alchemists on a remote Irish headland.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> While the narrator eventually returns to the Christian faith, the pagan practitioners are ultimately stoned to death by “a mob of fishermen, stone masons, and small farmers.” Notably, the violent swarm is made up of people who literally live off the country—one popularly recognized derivation of the word “pagan” being from the Latin <span style="font-style:italic;">pagunu</span> meaning “villager” or “one from the countryside.” Yeats signals his displeasure here not with pagan Decadence itself but with the clutch of elitists who are staking their claim of authority over it. The representation also reflects his sad sense that the Irish “country” folk had been unnaturally separated from their authentic pagan roots. From this standpoint, the piece is an indictment of normative Christianity and colonialism as catalysts for the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> demonization of a natural spirituality whose own authority was otherwise deindividuated and thus seen by these institutions as uncontainable and uncontrollable.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Yeats makes clear that the group of modern pagans are educated recluses whose hyper-artificial ritualism has dangerously distanced them from the materiality and emotion of the “real” world, signified by the common laborers and their natural environment. The over-refined pagans come across as caricatures of heroes from Decadent fiction such as Huysmans’s Des Esseintes, Vernon Lee’s Alice Oke, and Wilde’s Dorian Gray. It is to a Paterian discourse, however, that Yeats’s narrator turns to describe their philosophy:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		Their doctrine was no merely chemical phantasy but a philosophy they applied to the world, to the elements, and to man himself; and that they sought to fashion gold out of common metals merely as part of an universal transmutation of all things into some divine and imperishable substance; and this enables me to make my little book [“Rosa Alchemica”] a fanciful reverie over the transmutation of life into art, and a cry of measureless desire for a world made wholly of essences.
	      </p>
<div class="attrib">
		[“RA,” 56]
	      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		We are given a pack of Decadent pagans who seduce their victims through an excess of sensuality aimed paradoxically at venerating anti-materialism. That the “universal transmutation” should subsume “man himself” appears, in its anti-humanism, to be the greatest of threats to the narrator.
	      </p>
<p>
		Yeats most blatantly associates the group’s practices with the populist Aesthetic Movement when its members are seen to draw the narrator into extending their philosophy to notions of domestic beauty. With a “pagan’s delight,” he replaces portraits of historical interest with old Flemish tapestry covered in blue and bronze peacocks and mortgages his house in order to fill it with antique bronze gods and goddesses (“RA,” 57). Echoing the fastidiousness of Des Esseintes, he has each of his books bound in leather whose color reflects the spirit of its author. This section of the story effectively conflates the consumerism of “House Beautiful” culture with the superficiality of the elitist aesthete whose tastes are defined not by originality but by clichés of cultural refinement. As the shallow hero says of himself, “I gathered about me all gods because I believed in none, and experienced every pleasure because I gave myself to none” (ibid.). The main concerns are the lack, in this version of paganism, of the veneration of nature and the sacrifice of one’s self to diverse pleasures, setting up in this veneration’s place an exclusive superficiality characterized by the urbane aesthete poseur.
	      </p>
<p>
		Yeats’s “Rosa Alchemica” distinguishes between, on one hand, the environmentally sensitive paganism that Pater admired and, on the other, the fin-de-siècle artifice and elitist self-display that would come to characterize movements within the historical avant garde. Despite the difference between Pater’s conception of Decadent paganism and Yeats’s summation of its turn-of-the-century popular image, however, both writers reinforce the fact that the queer character of Decadence could not be separated from its pagan respect for the natural environment. Pagan animism and ritual de-individuation carried an implicit challenge to both compulsory heteronormativity and speciesism, and thereby reinforced the Decadent interest in and respect for sexual diversity. For  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Decadent paganism, as for the eco-pagan politics of today, the queer is far from against nature. Giving due recognition to paganism’s spiritual investment in the natural, one is able to sense beneath the Decadent Movement’s surface of artifice and urbanism not only the throbbing vein of paganism, but also the becoming of later environmentalist and queer politics.

		  While a number of scholars today choose to capitalize the term “paganism” when referring to its contemporary manifestations, the practice lacks a consistent definitional boundary. Some refer to today’s paganism as “neo-paganism” or “neopaganism”; this attempted distinction, however, fails to recognize the fact that the same terms were used popularly in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries to distinguish contemporary from classical paganism. Rather than adopt yet another variation on the term, I have tried in this essay to remain clear as to which pagan era is being discussed.

		  Contemporary paganism is, by some calculations, the fastest growing spiritual movement in the United Kingdom and other industrialized countries. Because it is also distinctly politicized, we have witnessed recently the mainstream accommodation of various pagan rituals: for example, we have seen officially acknowledged pagan burials for U. S. Army soldiers, employment of pagan chaplains at Canadian universities, and legally recognized pagan marriages in Scotland. Pagan marriage actually appears to be attaining legal status in various countries as quickly, and with less contestation, than same-sex marriage.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Translator’s Preface</h1>
<p>
	This text by Théophile Gautier (1811–1872) was originally published on 31 May 1855 as a chronicle in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Moniteur universel</span>, the official newspaper of the Second Empire, where Gautier had arrived as an art and drama critic shortly before the Universal Exhibition. Gautier’s essay on the British Pre-Raphaelites “Messrs. Millais and Hunt,” translated in English here for the first time, was part of a series of fifty-two articles in which he reviewed the art exhibition held at the same time in the temporary Palais des Beaux-Arts on the avenue Montaigne. (The articles were later collected in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Beaux-Arts en Europe</span>.) While artists from all over the world had reputedly been invited, only the major European countries were substantially represented. British artists—more than three hundred of whom were present—seized this opportunity to assert themselves as an articulate and powerful school, fully capable of challenging French hegemony in the field of art. They did meet with undisputable success in Paris. But while artists such as Landseer or Mulready gained a European reputation, the most successful and most talked about artists were arguably the Pre-Raphaelite painters then almost unknown in Paris. They attracted the attention of most of the approximately eighty reviewers who emphasized their strangeness and often their English “eccentricity.” Pace Delacroix’s severe criticism of Gautier’s prose in his diary entry of 17 June 1855, this article reveals a sharp and subtle understanding of the Pre-Raphaelites’ originality. Gautier is very receptive to their revolutionary use of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> pure colors and accurately highlights what distinguishes their relationship to the past from that of the German Nazarenes. Gautier successfully conveys to his readers what makes the realistic, if not hyperrealist, manner of the Pre-Raphaelites so unique and in a way so modern. Though he never refers to Millais or Hunt as Pre-Raphaelites in this text, he would characterize them as members of “the British Pre-Raphaelite sect” in a later article of the series (14 June 1855). Here Gautier praises their “naïve” way of painting in conjunction with their nostalgia for the late Middle Ages, and contrasts their formal and controlled realism—or more accurately, naturalism—with Courbet’s more radical and unmitigated representation of the real, which Gautier condemns for an often brutal, vulgar, and mannered ugliness.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Messrs. Millais and Hunt</h1>
<p>
	Whereas Mulready is a direct descendant of Hogarth and Wilkie, a true English painter of the old school displaying all the qualities and the faults of his lineage, except for an idiosyncratic quality that distinguishes him from his ancestors, Mr. Millais has no affiliation to the past or present British school. He goes off on his own and completely isolates himself in his own originality as if up in an ivory tower, and there, under the gothic-structured vault of the rotunda he uses as his studio, under a ray of light filtering through a peephole, he keeps working, as if from olden days onward Time had not yet rotated its secular hourglass more than four or five times; using Memling’s genuine simplicity, Van Eyck’s stained-glass colors, and Holbein’s minute realism. Like certain archaic German painters, Mr. Millais seems capable of throwing Raphael out of Paradise as a mundane Mannerist.
      </p>
<p>
	Mr. Millais’s three paintings are certainly the most unusual in the Universal Exhibition, and it is impossible, even for the most distracted visitor, not to stop in front of them.—In our time, wavering between so many theories, painters have looked for the “naïve in the arts,” especially on the other bank of Rhine, but no one has taken this system to its ultimate conclusion. What distinguishes Mr. Millais’s works from comparable attempts is that he does not merely reproduce more or less successfully old paintings in facsimile, but rather studies nature with the soul and the eyes of an artist of the fifteenth century. Nothing is further from Overbeck’s style, although Overbeck tried to go back in time too, and to strip himself of modern science as of a profane cloth in order to substitute the straight-pleated robe of a Catholic ascetic.—Through an astonishing capacity of abstraction, Mr. Millais has put himself outside of time.
      </p>
<p>
	We will analyze these strange and remarkable objects with the care that they deserve: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Order of Release</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Return of the Dove</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ophelia</span>, which represent the author’s talent in three different ways, realistic, mystic and fantastical.
      </p>
<p>
	At first sight <span style="font-style:italic;">The Order of Release</span> shatters all our former ideas of painting gleaned from visiting museums, galleries, exhibitions and studios—it is covered by a piece  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of glass, the way English people protect works they regard as precious. At first the technique escapes an artist’s attentive investigation. Is the painting made out of egg tempera, paint mixed with turpentine, oil paint, encaustic, glazed distemper, watercolor or gouache? Nobody knows. Is the support made of wood, canvas, a sheet of remounted paper, a fabric of silk? The brushwork reveals nothing, and one would have to look at the back of the frame to be sure. The brushwork is not less disconcerting to those eyes who pretend to understand it; you find none of the recognized ways colors are applied to painting: no impasto, no glaze, no scumble, no track of brushstroke, but a kind of stippled drawing, as in a miniature, with here and there imperceptible hatching, a patient and mysterious handling which seems to like being kept secret. This scene, painted as if by an image maker of the School of Bruges in the Middle Ages, has nonetheless nothing Gothic about it, at least in the subject, or the costumes which suggest a subject taken from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Heart of Mid-Lothian</span>. But let us leave aside anecdote and concentrate instead upon the purely human aspect:—The <span style="font-style:italic;">Release</span>, as the title puts it, represents a poor prisoner who is freed. Mr. Millais has given to this quite simple motif a very special interest through his rendering and conceptualization of it.
      </p>
<p>
	Against a dark setting formed by bituminous shadows in which one can vaguely discern the walls of a jail stands an extraordinarily lifelike group which makes you doubt whether you are in front of a painting or whether you are looking through a spy hole into a cell; for a moment you do not know if it is good or bad, in line with tradition or against it, falling short of art or lying beyond it. You lack the criteria to judge a work so eccentric, strange, and unconventional that it can look both wonderful and detestable.—But slowly you become familiar with it, and it starts to exercise its fascination upon you; you begin to like this picture which at first seemed extravagant and shocked your habitual ways of seeing. Nature tears away this veil of bizarre execution, and reveals strong, vivid, deeply felt details, seen as if through a magnifying glass, with an uncompromising truth and such a deep realism that it makes Courbet look like Van Loo.
      </p>
<p>
	Half obscured by the open door, a soldier holds a bunch of keys in his left hand posing on the door frame, and in his right hand, where a well-seasoned pipe is still smoking, an order of release which he re-reads suspiciously as if wanting to verify the signature. Nothing is more real and yet more strange than this re divided by a perpendicular line, with his head leaning forward, his arm held straight, and only one leg visible. The face, seen as in profile, with dark skin, a strong, creased face, and freshly-cut beard, presents the perfect re of a soldier. The white-lined three-cornered hat, the blue-trimmed red garment, the little white military tie, the leather accoutrements, the gaiters are all so well rendered as to project a perfect illusion.
      </p>
<p>
	The prisoner who wears his grey jacket held like a dolman because a sling prevents him from putting his arm in the sleeve, bends, with an expression of grateful joy, over the shoulder of the woman whose intervention has granted him his freedom; his green, blue, and yellow squared kilt, his bare legs, and stockings, identify him as a child of the Scottish Highlands, probably thrown in jail after some brawl with Lowlanders.
      </p>
<p>
	The woman is superb; her eyes sparkle, and her cheeks burn, so swiftly has she walked there. A scornful smile swells her lower lip; she seems to say: “You can finally open  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> this door, which I visited and wept before so many times!” In a pleat of the blue plaid which frames her head and goes down like a mantilla around her arms, a curly headed blond baby lies asleep, oblivious to the situation, and whose sleepy little hand drops a hand-full of small wild flowers he probably gathered for his father on the way.
      </p>
<p>
	In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hunchback of Notre-Dame</span>, there is a chapter on the pink heels of babies, which mothers are mad about and could smother with kisses; we do not know if Mr. Millais has read this lovely passage, but you could suppose it by the love with which he caresses this dear creature’s feet so well arranged in his mother’s lap. We have never seen anything finer, more delicately true, by the Gothic painters, trained as they were by painting the infant Jesus to express the grace of children.
      </p>
<p>
	English people have a special fondness for dogs; Mr. Millais has put a four legged actor in this pathetic scene; it is a tall spaniel, which possessing the wonderful canine empathy for matters of the heart—unique to man’s humble friends,—cheerfully draws itself up to participate in the common joy and licks the joined hands of the spouses.
      </p>
<p>
	This painting is the supreme effort of English realism, so different, as you can see, from that particular type of realism which uses extremely brutal methods, copying the vulgar crudely without being any more faithful; ugliness can itself be a mannerism, and one can be false by affecting a predilection for the horrible.
      </p>
<p>
	Despite the slender, tiny brushstrokes, the general aspect is broad and the color frank. The artist has the courage of his reds, blues and purples, and does not break his genuine colors with grayish half-tones which people now use to achieve a too easy harmony.
      </p>
<p>
	Should we take this title—<span style="font-style:italic;">The Return of the Dove to the Ark—</span>literally or should we look at it as a mystical invention? It is hard to accept that these two maidens could belong to Noah’s family—they demonstrate neither the facial type nor the appropriate costume. The only women actually on the Ark—as far as the Bible mentions them—were Shem’s, Cham’s and Japheth’s wives, and they probably did not wear such long dresses or dalmatics as these. They should in addition look older: Mr. Millais’s res seem to be only fourteen or fifteen years of age. One, with loose hair and an emerald green dress, whose intense tone reminds us of the glass painters’ palette of precious stones; holds with one hand the panting and tired dove close to her breast, while her other hand reveals the olive tree branch she has taken from its beak. The second girl, wearing a purple tunic upon which a kind of white chasuble is draped, presses her hand on her companion’s arm and with a gentle stroking movement kisses the poor frightened bird whose heart you can imagine beating underneath its feathers. The background is so brown and dark that you cannot distinguish any form. On the floor lie crossing blades of hay and stalks of straw painted with the most studied and minutest finish: each has its own clear-, its half-tone, its shadow, its nodes, its filaments and cracks and it would not be possible in this jumble to mistake a stalk of straw for a blade of hay.—Poor Delaberge, who made sixty sketches in front of a thistle, would be defeated by such tireless patience.
      </p>
<p>
	The heads, with plenty of blood-red and purplish tones, lack the fashionable distinction that English painters usually give to their feminine creatures; but how naïvely and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> religiously true they are! How strongly they evoke a sensation of <span style="font-style:italic;">déjà vu</span>, how their chaste gentleness and genuine sincerity bring back your vague childhood memories! Your young sisters had such friends, whose gentle names you try to remember in front of the picture. The youngest one’s hand lying on the older one’s green sleeve is a masterpiece. This is not the soft, white pulp, softened by almond cream and veined with blue lines that Lawrence used to stroke with his rapid brush, no, it is a good hand, a little reddish from being washed with crude fountain water and modestly tinged by the fresh blood of virginity.
      </p>
<p>
	From a distance, I must agree, Mr. Millais’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Ophelia</span> does look rather like a doll drowning in a basin; but upon coming closer, you will be delighted by a prodigious world of details. The canvas will come alive, and will swarm before your eyes.—You will have the illusion of lying on a riverbank and seeing thousands of forms slowly emerging from what first appeared as a confusing green mass. At every moment, a novelty, some unexpected accident will reward your attention.
      </p>
<p>
	What a fresh dampness, what aquatic and dreary greens! What dark blue, deep water under the bending trees! What a beach for Elves and Nixes! And how gladly night laundresses may come here to pound their shirts by moonlight! The willow’s gnarled, deformed and bowed trunk juts forward and bears a crown of branches whose ends graze the water. Watercress drinks, water lilies spread their large leaves, alisma becomes green like moss, the forget-me-not opens its turquoise eyes, the ribbon-reed unrolls its long leaves, the purple-loosestrife shakes its purple ears, the wild rose loses its petals, the iris waves its flower like a blue butterfly, the dragonflies perform their waltzes, the redbreast presents its bloody breast, and the kingfisher’s flight cuts the water which splashes back onto its lapis-lazuli wing. The bank is slippery; you simply must go on towards the stream which sings to you in sweet murmurs.
      </p>
<p>
	So does Ophelia, abandoning herself to the treacherous waters with the childish trust characteristic of madness; she is delighted at being carried along by the softly, gently undulating current buoyed up by her gowns which have become soaked and sag with white lace swirling around like foams; her head is lying on a watery pillow which supports her hair all mixed up with straw and wild flowers. Her necklace made of blue bells and poppies, the jewelry of dementia, still floats, and her hand has not yet released the oat-grass, buttercups and daisies that it clasps. Her mouth half open in an ecstatic smile, showing the white row of her teeth, exhales even now the vague tune of a ballad about to be drowned by the next wave.
      </p>
<p>
	In the charming and naturalistic ingenuity of this picture there is something bizarre which might be more appropriate to the subject than a more reasonable approach. No one could have spent more time working on mad Ophelia; but do not expect from this description anything romantic or Shakespearean in the usual sense of these terms: it is a fantasy made out of patience, and the most accurate botanist could not find a single wrong leaf, or nerve, or petal, or pistil in this prodigious mass of vegetation.
      </p>
<p>
	Mr. W. Hunt belongs as an artist to the same congregation as Mr. Millais. Which is the master, which the pupil? Or did they both arrive at the same result by similar ideas? This is a question we do not have to discuss.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Antiquity shows us Diogenes with a lantern in hand seeking for a man in full daylight; Mr. W. Hunt shows us Christ on patrol at night and seeking an awakened soul in the sleeping universe: “<span style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I stand at the door, and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me</span>.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> He probably has already knocked at many doors, this divine prowler in the night, and nobody has opened them, since he looks tired and discouraged under his golden crown woven with thorns. The wet grass has tinted green the range of his brocade dalmatic, and the light shines less strongly on the frame of his lantern. Will he be happier on this doorstep that neglect has obstructed with brambles, stinging nettles, ryegrass, and all kinds of malevolent plants? It seems improbable; the rap of the knocker will not be heard—it will be drowned by the caroling of revelers, or the snoring of the bestial.
      </p>
<p>
	The head in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Light of the World</span> radiates the kind of unctuous melancholy and pitiful sadness that a neglected Divinity might feel. Regarding the details, they are incredibly finished such as only Albrecht Dürer, Schoorel, or the most delicate primitive German painters could have painted with the utmost care. One can even make out the dew drops at the tip of the grasses illuminated by the reflection of the lantern.—Our neo-Gothic painters never went so far. And if you once admit that art does not necessarily have to be contemporary, but may choose whatever milieu, century, or faith it wishes, then you must admire without any reserve Mr. Hunt’s work, just as one would if coming upon it in Cologne Cathedral or in the Boisserée brothers’ collection.
      </p>
<p>
	Mr. Hunt’s second picture <span style="font-style:italic;">Claudio and Isabella</span> represents a scene from Shake-speare’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Measure for Measure</span>. Claudio is in jail, standing next to the barred window of his cell, holding with his hands the weight of the iron ring that encircles his leg; he wears a crimson, fur-lined surcoat, and purple knitted tight fitting trousers somewhat faded by his detention; he is listening to the gentle exhortations of Isabella, wearing a nun’s wimple, who presses her hands on his heart and urges him to be patient. Through the window there is a sliver of smiling blue sky and a ray of light gilds the semi-transparent belly of a mandolin which hangs on cherry-colored ribbons, while the blooming almond trees are showing their young branches powdered with pink snow through the bars. A dungeon visited by love and sun is not actually sad, even if it is much better to engrave your sweetheart’s name on the bark of a beech tree than on the panel of a jail wall.
      </p>
<p>
	This canvas is painted in the bizarre manner we have already noticed in Mr. Millais’s works, and which we can hardly explain; the degree of rendering, and of finish is carried to the very limit, not for the purpose of pleasing the superficial amateur with its extreme polish, but to express truth in all its utmost optical details.
      </p>
<p>
	We assume that Mr. Millais and Mr. Hunt will have followers in England. Their system will seduce precise minds with its quality of absoluteness, but we actually doubt if our realists will ever imitate them: this method requires too much time, care, will, and observation. Although we give them the credit they deserve and may not generally receive because of their strangeness and shocking originality, we fear that they will be defeated in their hand-to-hand battle with nature.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	What frightens us is Mr. Hunt’s picture titled <span style="font-style:italic;">The Strayed Sheep</span> where the painter fully engages in a battle with nature and throws down the gauntlet to reality: escaping from their pasture, some sheep have strayed among brambles and rocks and bleat for fear that they will not find their way back to the sheepfold. We have already referred to Delaberge, regarding Mr. Millais’s stalks of straw.—Do you remember the sheep tended by an old woman in one of the painter’s last exhibits? This sheep, whose wool smelled of grease, and which you could have sheared yourself, was just a rough draft, an easy sketch, compared to Mr. Hunt’s animals.—And the landscape?—Stop for a while to gaze at it, it is well worth it. Soon enough, under the strange green of the grass, bathed in blue shadows and bronzed by the sun, you will discover plants which have been trampled by the hoofs of the sheep and places where hidden waters trickle. This is a work to drive a Chinese mad; but the painter, determined as he is not to sacrifice anything, remains for all his subtlety unable to reduce mathematically one league of horizon to a foot square of canvas, with the result that details attain the overwhelming importance that a microscope gives to objects, and a grass blade looks as important as a tree. Strange phenomenon! There is maybe no other painting in the Salon able to shatter the eye like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Strayed Sheep</span>; the picture which looks the most false is actually the truest to life.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

      Mrs. Pugh, first name unknown, received an unexpected present upon moving into her new home at 114 Cambridge Street, Pimlico, London, in June 1895. The previous owner had left behind a two-sided oil painting.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> On one side of the canvas is a portrait of a woman from the waist up, what in cinematic terms is called a medium-shot. <span style="font-style:italic;">A masked woman</span> (c. 1894) is painted as if mediated through the soft focus of a camera lens. The blackness of her scoop-necked dress and her frizzy black hair highlight her white face and neck. The woman wears a black mask, which draws attention to her white skin and conceals her face so that the viewer cannot tell if she is beautiful or ugly. In front of the woman, a small dead white mouse lies on a brown table. On the opposite side of the canvas are two res, each painted softly on an olive-brown background. In the foreground of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Caprice</span> (c. 1894), a white woman in a long black dress stands stiffly, looking posed. Her arms jet from her shoulders at uncomfortable angles. Only her white skin, white muff, and the white and blue feathers of her headdress keep her from melting into the darkness of the canvas. The other smaller, eye-catching re stands at one half the height of the woman. He wears a bright red costume with a white neck ruffle which, along with his bright red hat, makes his black skin stand out prominently. The artist who left these oil paintings behind in 1895 at 114 Cambridge Street was Aubrey Beardsley, the boy genius illustrator of <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> Decadent Aestheticism. These two creations, the only surviving oil paintings Beardsley produced, would have been lost to art and history had it not been for the fastidious cleaning habits of Mrs. Pugh. The  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> paintings engage issues of gender, sex, and race that vexed not only Beardsley, but also the generation of modernist artists that would follow him. Beardsley’s two forgotten oil paintings, along with his many illustrations, allow us to trace a proto-cinematic moment to one that would be realized later in film.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>
      In many ways, the male modernist artists of the early-twentieth century performed the same kind of act of forgetfulness as did Beardsley. Clearing a path for their own work by rejecting the romantic Decadent artists of the 1890’s, they left behind, whether consciously or unconsciously, part of the identity that shaped and influenced them as artists. H. D. might be regarded as a modernist version of Mrs. Pugh, at the ready to rescue them from their own forgetfulness. She had, in fact, “found” the modernist artist in Beardsley, quite by accident, through her involvement in the 1930 film <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, in which she played the role of “white demented Astrid.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Beardsley’s “proto-cinematic” work intersects uncannily and metaphysically with H. D.’s role as actress, muse, promoter and editor for Kenneth Macpherson’s film in relation to gender, sex and race.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Beardsley and H. D. are, admittedly, more concerned with questions of gender and sexuality than race. Nevertheless, that he should position the black male body as sexual plaything in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Caprice</span> suggests his interest in the intersections of race, sexuality and gender. His preoccupation with the notion of the racial Other as plaything is demonstrated further in the illustration Beardsley created from this painting, No. I of “<span style="font-style:italic;">The Comedy of Marionettes”</span>  (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>). Had Beardsley not died at the age of twenty-five, I speculate that he would have produced more texts focused on racial issues. In the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline,</span> the film is clear in its intention to explore race as it intersects with gender and sexuality. Through her role as the racist Astrid, H. D. gives voice to the problem of racism, which was largely without a voice in the Decadent and Modernist eras.
    </p>
<p>
      Questions of gender and sexuality saturated the lives and works of both Beardsley and H. D. Beardsley’s androgynous looks and dandyish affectations caused speculation about his sexuality. Oscar Wilde joked about Beardsley’s “freakish asexuality,” advising, “don’t sit on the same chair as Aubrey . . . it’s not compromising.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Brigid Brophy writes, “Beardsley kept a foot in either camp—a foot wearing, moreover, a kinky boot,” an allusion to his purportedly bisexual inclinations.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Beardsley never admitted to having been either hetero- or homosexual, preferring to leave people guessing. He ambivalently assumed the role of the androgyne, sometimes delighting in it and, at other times, railing against it. Beardsley enjoyed, on the one hand, being the naughty school-boyish imp who continually shocked Victorian society. In late 1893, for example, he jokingly wrote to his friend Robert Ross about his “amusing” notices from his exhibition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl and a Bookshop</span>  (<a name="2-text" href="#2">2</a>) at the New England Art Club Exhibition: “[The art critic from the magazine] <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Opinion</span> sets me down as belonging to the Libidinous and Asexual school.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> He also referred playfully to himself as “the solitaire,” the nickname he gave a virginal character in his story of Venus and Tannhäuser (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span>, 217). On the other hand, when <span style="font-style:italic;">St. Paul’s</span> art critic Haldane MacFall called his work “sexless and unclean” in 1895, Beardsley composed an angry letter to the editor in response: “As to my uncleanliness, I do the best for it in my morning bath, and if he [MacFall] has  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> really any doubts as to my sex, he may come and see me take it.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Here, the impish androgyne evaporates, leaving only the boiling anger of the man who (passive) aggressively invites an art critic to watch him prove his sexual prowess.

      H. D. shares with Beardsley a distinctly androgynous quality, although she embraced her bisexuality and formed significant sexual attachments to men and women throughout her life. She was involved, moreover, in intersections of sexual desire that haunted and encompassed the formation of the POOL group in general and <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> in particular.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> As Anne Friedberg notes, “‘pool’ may have seemed a suitable metaphor for the fluid and yet quite complicated relationships that existed between H. D., Bryher and Macpherson.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> H. D. began a sexual affair with Macpherson in 1926, and Bryher, H. D.’s lesbian lover “agreed to screen [the affair] by marrying Macpherson in 1927.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Macpherson envisioned H. D. as “an adorable androgyne; he wrote her, in the dawn of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> their love affair: ‘I knew I had seen god or goddess in you then.’”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> “Adorable androgyne” seems an odd moniker to give one’s lover, yet the androgynous quality projected by H. D. not only made her right for the role of Astrid, but also probably contributed to her attractiveness to the bisexual Macpherson.
    </p>
<p>
      The intricate mixture of sexuality and gender that exist at the heart of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, both in the lives of those involved in making the film and within the film itself, is complicated by the question of race. In her excellent introduction to H. D.’s “<span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> and the POOL Films,” Friedberg succinctly captures the knotty-ness (and perhaps naughtiness!) of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>: “the racialized sexual politics of the film operate within the binary metaphor of borderline—white/black; hetero/queer—presenting a complex matrix of racial and sexual tensions.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Susan Stanford Friedman traces the “real life” sexual intricacies among those who participated in the making of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>: the bisexual Macpherson, along with his homosexual friend Robert Herring (the piano-player in the film), were involved in the Harlem Renaissance scene, which introduced Macpherson to many young black male artists with whom he had affairs, much to the chagrin of H. D., who was sexually involved with him during these subsequent homosexual affairs (“MSR,” 97–99). In relation to the star of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, Paul Robeson, Friedman observes: “Robeson himself may have been the object of Macpherson’s attraction for black men. Macpherson’s fascination with Robeson’s beauty as a body to film is evident in his stills, sketches, and montage” (“MSR,” 100). Although H. D. was attracted to Robeson, there is no evidence suggesting the two had an affair (ibid).
    </p>
<p>
      As for the “reel life” among the actors in the diegetic world of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, the “white/black” and “hetero/queer” borderlines are threaded and crossed. The film depicts a heterosexual affair between (white) Thorne (Gavin Arthur) and (black) Adah (Eslanda Robeson). The (white) barmaid (Charlotte Arthur) also flirts with (black) Pete (Paul Robeson). She links arms with him and coyly places a flower behind his ear (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>). As for the “hetero/queer” dynamics, the barmaid also links arms and flirts with the manageress (Bryher). The piano player (Robert Herring) harbors a crush on Pete and keeps photograph of him pinned on his piano. When Pete leaves town, he puts the photo in his wallet, and then places his wallet into his jacket, signifying his desire to carry the photo (and his memory of Pete) close to his body. The piano player then lets out a deep sigh and returns to his playing, which shows that although he pines for Pete, life must continue. The film seeks to provide a location where sexual orientation is not judged.
    </p>
<p>
      H. D., unlike her male modernist counterparts, strived to provide a place free of sexual judgments not only through her collaboration on <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, but also through her poetry. Cassandra Laity argues that female modernists like H. D. “responded differently to the powerful feminine subjectivities of their early reading that were presently driving their male contemporaries toward a foreboding masculinization of poetry.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> H. D. used the “Decadent topoi of the femme fatale and the male androgyne and their attendant tropes, forms, and linguistic practices in works by the Pre-Raphaelites, Swinburne, Pater and Wilde . . . to fashion a modernist poetic of female desire.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> While I agree with Laity that the Victorian <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> artists influenced and infused  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> H. D.’s art, I would add an additional artist to Laity’s list—Aubrey Beardsley. Although Beardsley was not a Pre-Raphaelite, Edward Burne-Jones discovered him, giving him a Wittgensteinian “family resemblance” to the pre-Raphaelites.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Beardsley’s work persistently negotiates the same metaphysical and artistic space as H.D.’s in <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>. The work of both res reveals a shared interest in four areas: first, in gender conflation, particularly involving a specific trope I call the “repellent femme fatale”; second, in gender/sex conflation, particularly in depictions of the masculinized woman and the feminized man; third, in sex, race and racism in relation to the Othered “male” femme fatale; and fourth, in sex, race and racism beyond the specific trope of the Othered “male” femme fatale. Before going on to explore these “uncanny intersections” in Beardsley and H. D.’s work, I’d like to consider more closely the historical and artistic connection, linking Beardsley and H. D.—a connection that ultimately demonstrates that modernist artists need to embrace their Decadent and Aesthetic roots.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Connecting Beardsley and H. D.: Linking Decadent Aestheticism and Modernism</h1>
<p>
	H. D.’s position as a woman modernist in a profoundly male-dominated artistic era made her more receptive to the gender fluidities of the Decadent and Aesthetic eras, which reached their pinnacle in the illustrations of Aubrey Beardsley. Male modernists dismissed the “feminine” as the soft, squishy, and blurry emotional side of art that often found representation in the tropes of the castrating femme fatale and the homoerotic aesthete, both res that blur the lines between masculinity and femininity and that frightened male modernists away from the overly decorative, dandyish works of <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> artists. As Laity notes, “theories of modern poetry authored by Eliot, Pound, Yeats, and others repeatedly raise the specters of the femme fatale and the Aesthete to warn against the ‘hedonism’ they believed had plunged Romanticism into decadence and decay” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HDV</span>, xi).
      </p>
<p>
	The modernist disavowal of decadent artists like Beardsley is unfortunate, given that his work is eerily prescient of the type of filmic devices that modernism would come to embrace, and that can be seen throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>. Susan McCabe writes that the “medium of film opened up a new vocabulary for modernist poets not only to challenge modes of mimetic representation but also to explore and reconstruct cultural tropes of fragmented, dissociated corporeality,” as can be seen in the work of the modernist artists, such as Marcel Duchamp, who participated in the 1913 Armory show.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> These artists “underscored modern art’s capacity to blur, to enlarge, to cut away outlines, particularly those which fix or delimit gender morphology.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Although Beardsley never references film, his illustrations herald the filmic medium’s ability to morph and fragmentize through the formal cinematic tools of the cut, the close up, and the use of light.
      </p>
<p>
	H. D. employed this “new vocabulary” of modernity, fragmenting Macpherson’s corporeality by merging his body with the work/art he produces: “Kenneth Macpherson,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> at work, is a hard-boiled mechanic, as if he himself were all camera, bone and sinew and steel-glint of rapacious grey eyes” (“B,” 226). Although predating the Armory show by twenty years, Beardsley’s illustration <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl and a Bookshop</span> (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>), also suggests a dissociated corporeality that challenges “modes of mimetic representation.” The <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl</span> is stiff and mechanical looking, like a wind up toy. She is comprised of disassociated body parts—her arm is too long for her body, and her foot, peeking out from the hem of her skirt, is perched at an unnatural angle in relation to her body and appears unable to support her body weight. Her body seems cut and fragmented in the same way that bodies are fragmented through the rapid editing of clatter montage used in <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>. Her body mimics the stiffness and unnaturalness of the trees around her. The three trees all are broken (fragmented), their trunks truncated by the picture’s borderlines. The artificiality of the tree in the upper left corner is highlighted by the supports around it, as if the tree were too weak or decayed to stand on its own. Beardsley’s positioning of the girl in the upper left side leaves the entire bottom half of the drawing blank, evoking a kind of “no-man’s land” of white space, anachronistically (for Beardsley) reminiscent of the wasted space of the no-man’s land of World War I, a war which haunted H. D.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Whereas Beardsley seems presciently proto-modern in terms of his representation of a fragmented corporeality, H. D.’s preoccupation with questions of aesthetic beauty gestures backward toward Decadence. In the “<span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> Pamphlet,” she asserts: “There is no such thing as any fixed art standard. This is beautiful, this was beautiful, this may be beautiful. There is one beauty, it is the beauty of belief, of faith of hope” (“B,” 226). H. D.’s concept of “no fixed standard for art” is rooted in the same Decadent Aestheticism that fueled Beardsley’s imagination and excitement over his periodical project, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Yellow Book</span>. In an interview, Beardsley and co-editor Henry Harland explained that their “sole criterion for acceptance would be artistic distinction; the treatment of the subject was crucial. ‘If you were to bring us a bad picture of the Crucifixion,’ the editors explained, ‘we should not take it; but it you brought us a good picture of a pumpkin; it’s highly probable we should” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span>, 190–91).
      </p>
<p>
	In May 1928, H. D. wrote an article for <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-up</span> on the film <span style="font-style:italic;">Expiation</span>. She describes the female lead as “angular, bird-like, claw-like, skeleton-like and hideous. . . . Beauty is too facile a word to discuss this, this woman is a sort of bleak young sorceress, vibrant, febrile, neurotic, as I say, almost cataleptic.” Her face, moreover, “can be termed beautiful in the same way that dawn can be termed beautiful rising across the stench and fever of battle.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> This actress, Alexandra Khokhlova, is said to have been H. D.’s inspiration for the character of Astrid.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> H. D. argues that Khokhlova’s exquisitely beautiful “hideousness” trumps the usual cinematic definition of “beauty,” which she describes as the post <span style="font-style:italic;">Joyless Street</span>-fashioned Garbo, who was no longer “this Nordic flower,” but now a “wild camellia . . . the most blatant of obvious, crepe tissue-paper orchids.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Such sensibilities are aligned closely with Beardsley’s: for while H. D. prefers an exquisitely well-executed image of an ordinary, ugly object (Khokhlova) over an artificially beautiful, revered object (the “camellia” Garbo), Beardsely prefers a “good picture of a pumpkin” to a “bad picture of the Crucifixion.” The striking visual  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> similarities between Astrid and Beardsley’s Women illustrations establish yet another connection between these artists. Although H. D. may have had Khokhlova in mind when she created Astrid, her real roots lie in Beardsley’s decadent New Woman illustrations.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Gender/Sex Conflation in Beardsley’s Art and <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>: The Repellent Femme Fatale</h1>
<p>
	Both Beardsley’s women and Astrid can be said to possess “a contrast of sweet beauty with repulsive ugliness.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Heyd uses these words specifically to describe Beardsley’s women, but they also apply to Astrid. And while H. D. describes <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>’s barmaid character as “sweet gone stagnant,” the description better fits her own character of Astrid (“B,” 233). The past potentiality of beauty exists in Astrid, but it is a “stagnant” beauty that has turned from peak ripeness to rot. Beardsley’s women, like H. D.’s Astrid (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>), still possess a residue of beauty in spite of appearing ugly, and even repellant, at times. Beardsley and H. D. capture these women on paper and on film in true decadent fashion after they turn from sweetness to stagnation or from ripeness to rot, forming a trope that I call the repellent femme fatale. This “turn” to the repellent  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> femme fatale occurs at the point at which the iconic femme fatale finds her feminine beauty and masculine power turning to masculine (read: unappealing) “beauty” and feminine (read: lost) power.

<p>
	This iconic femme fatale derives from the archetypal fatal woman, a mythic creation common to most cultures, for “[w]oman = sex = death is an equation inscribed into mass consciousness around the world, common to the postmodern West and the pre-modern East.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> The iconic femme fatale is unknowable and sexually dangerous; her unknowability shrouds her in a mystery that stems in part from her hidden, and therefore unknowable, genitals. This possession of a secret transforms her into a puzzle that the male must solve in order to prove his intelligence and superiority. The iconic femme fatale also carries with her the threat of castration: she is the “bearer of the bleeding wound; she can exist only in relation to castration and cannot transcend it.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Using her hypnotic sexual attractiveness, the femme fatale lures the male and then threatens to castrate him (metaphorically) by stealing his power of reason. He loses his head, so to speak, unable to think reasonably and logically in her presence. Although hyper-feminine in her attractiveness, the femme fatale codes as masculine in her ambition for power and her desire for control over men.
      </p>
<p>
	In contrast to the iconic femme fatale, the repellent femme fatale has lost her feminine beauty, which is her source of power over men. She also codes as excessively feminine in that she is womb personified, and her hysterical machinations make her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> dangerous. An out-of-control monster, the repellent femme fatale injures the white male from a position of instability rather than from a position of power. At one point in time, she held the position of the iconic femme fatale. Unlike her cinematic sister, however, the repellent femme fatale becomes “knowable” because she allows the male to see how much she needs <span style="font-style:italic;">him</span>. The power paradigm shifts; the mystery is revealed and the source of her power evaporates, and with it, her ability to castrate. At this point, the repellent femme fatale undergoes a kind of castration herself, having lost the phallus (the sense of her power). Modernist male authors had particular scorn for the iconic femme fatale; as Laity maintains, she is reinscribed “by the modernist prohibition against the brazenly sexual and ‘pathological’” woman (<span style="font-style:italic;">HDV</span>, 23). Although the repellent femme fatale would not be threatening to the modernist male as she no longer had the power to control him through her sexual allurement, she still could provoke scorn because of her “pathological” turn into hysteria. H. D.’s decision to portray a repellent femme fatale suggests that she looked to the recent past of Decadent Aestheticism, and particularly to Beardsley’s fascination with the re of the repulsively beautiful woman, to explore this trope—a trope ignored by male modernists who feared becoming infected with the feminine.

	In Beardsley’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A masked woman</span>, the viewer comprehends the easy metaphor of cat equals femme fatale; nevertheless, this painting represents not femme fatale-ness, but <span style="font-style:italic;">potential</span> femme fatale-ness. Whether the masked woman’s powers are at their ripest or  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> are starting to rot is up for debate. Does she wear the mask to appear mysterious and sexually alluring, or to cover a flaw in her looks that renders her repellent? Beardsley’s use of softening lines suggests that she wants to hide an imperfection from the spectator, like an aging film star might request a camera lens be covered with petroleum jelly or cheese cloth before agreeing to submit to its gaze. The painting captures the masked woman just as she has caught and killed her prey, leaving undetermined a host of other questions about the future. Had Beardsley chosen to capture his subject five minutes into the future, the image of her might have been gruesome: her black dress sullied with blood and fur, her mouth dripping with blood as she devoured her prey. Or perhaps we should have seen the mouse being stolen away from her, by a man she no longer enchants or by an iconic femme fatale at the apotheosis of her beauty. As <span style="font-style:italic;">A masked woman</span> remains frozen in the moment at which Beardsley painted her, the spectator can never know for sure what this mask masks.
      </p>
<p>
	Unlike Beardsley’s masked woman, <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>’s Astrid has no mask behind which to hide. The film exposes her fully, revealing her to be a repellent femme fatale. In her description of the heroic effort put forth by Macpherson to get the film completed, H. D. writes of his “turning” the camera with the precision of a metronome in order to get the perfect rhythm of each scene (“B,” 229–30). Likewise, Astrid’s “turning” from iconic femme fatale into repellent femme fatale occurs with precision. While Susan McCabe argues that Astrid is “a femme fatale stripped of charisma,” I would like to argue that one way of looking at the repellent femme fatale is to imagine applying a layer of hysteria to her psyche and body following this stripping of charisma.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> We sense that Astrid, prior to the advent of the film, could have been an iconic femme fatale: for with her high cheekbones and well-proportioned features, Astrid’s face implies a long-ago beauty, while “H. D.’s weathered face offers another image—the aging woman, the loss of beauty, the beating taken from life.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> As Judith Brown righly notes, H. D. herself describes Astrid as having “a weathered woman-face,” which “beats through the film like the very swift progress” of the wings of the dead, stuffed bird in Astrid’s hotel room on “doomed wings . . . already extinguished in ‘borderline’ existence” (“B,” 223). Macpherson aesthetically renders the “beating” of Astrid’s face by using light adeptly in filming <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>). “Macpherson sculpts literally with light,” H. D. writes. “He gouges, he reveals, he conceals” (“B,” 227). The word “gouging” invokes a feeling of pain, a feeling mirrored by Macpherson’s lighting of Astrid throughout the film, which appears to gouge and cut her. This aesthetic choice is characteristic of filmic depictions of the femme fatale, who “ultimately loses physical movement, influence over camera movement, and is often actually or symbolically imprisoned by composition” behind either visual bars or real bars. The light that once gave her control and strength now renders the femme fatale “symbolically . . . impotent.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Light becomes even more pernicious, in the case of the repellent femme fatale, not only capturing, but metaphorically gouging, her. Where the iconic femme fatale may lose her power, her beauty usually remains intact; in contrast, the repellent femme fatale is stripped of her beauty, which renders her powerless—not a puzzle to solve, but a hideous monster to avoid. The iconic femme fatale usually dies for her sins, but dies beautiful, delivered from the repellent femme fatale’s fate, which is to become monster-like and hideous  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> prior to death. Macpherson’s use of lighting, moreover, never implies that Astrid ever had control of the camera or the male hero’s gaze since harsh bars of light already imprison her at the start of the film.
      </p>
<p>
	Beardsley’s Salome, featured in his illustration <span style="font-style:italic;">The Peacock Skirt</span>  (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>), is also a repellent femme fatale. This illustration captures the moment in Oscar Wilde’s 1894 play, <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome,</span> in which Salome speaks seductively to Narraboth in order to persuade him to bring John the Baptist to her. In the illustration, Salome stares directly into Narraboth’s eyes with her mouth open, as if she has been captured mid-word. She stands in profile; Beardsley “lights” her right eye in a white circle, suggesting that her eyes are cold, hard, and fixed on that which she desires. Her right brow arches, making her look cruel and severe, while her protruding chin signals her strength and power. In the midst of such masculine severity, however, Salome’s face still shows a trace of beauty, for her features are feminine and attractive in a repulsive sort of way. Her nose, in particular, is both delicate and feminine. Narraboth meets Salome’s stare, gazing directly into her eyes. The blackness around his eyes suggests the danger of “looking” at Salome, as if his eyes rot due to the power of her stare.
      </p>
<p>
	Astrid resembles a “Beardsley Woman” with her hypnotic stare, angular body, and strange, unnatural hairstyle. Her long shawl brings to mind Salome’s shawl-like Peacock Skirt (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a> and <a name="7-text" href="#7">7</a>). The phallic peacock feathers of Salome’s attire connote masculine power just as the balls that hang from Astrid’s shawl (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>) and the phallic candle in the background (<a name="7-text" href="#7"> 7</a>) lend her an air of masculinity. Like Salome, Astrid embodies the role of repellent femme fatale through a simultaneous display of both excessive masculinity and femininity. The latter manifests itself through the guise of hysteria, “a spectacle—of shock, of illusion which has been compared to that of early cinema.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> It was believed that hysterical patients experienced “convulsions and contractures—as well as the moments of stillness and ecstasy”; at the Salpêtrière Hospital in the 1880s, Dr. Jean-Martin Charcot captured the movements of his hysterics on film.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Discussing Joan of Arc in <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-up</span>, H. D. wonders if Joan “fumbles in her dazed hypnotized manner towards some solution of her claustrophobia? I am shut in here, I want to get out.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Astrid, whose world consists of two small rooms—one of which is covered in claustrophobic, busy wallpaper reminiscent of the pattern that drove Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s heroine insane—probably feels the same about her physical environment. Astrid’s rooms serve to exaggerate her imprisonment: she either paces, moving her angular body in jerk-like motions, or nervously plays solitaire. This claustrophobic environment serves as a factor in her descent into hysteria. Macpherson intersperses scenes of Astrid in her room with scenes of Thorne walking through meadows and woods, emphasizing his freedom as opposed to her confinement. Like Charcot’s hospitalized patients, Astrid is trapped by her physical environment and by her symptoms of hysteria manifested in bodily convulsions and catatonia during her t with Thorne over Ada. Whereas Charcot filmed his hysterics to serve as documented evidence of their authentic hysterical “performances,” Macpherson films H. D. as a performing hysteric.

Thorne emerges from the closet with a suitcase; recognizing it as Adah’s suitcase and convinced that Thorne plans to reunite with Adah, Astrid runs toward him and pounds furiously on his chest. Thorne briefly embraces her. Macpherson’s camera shows Astrid in profile, hugging Thorne’s body. Astrid’s face is stark white, which is accentuated by Thorne’s white sweater. Macpherson’s lighting highlights the contours of her eye sockets, making her look skeletal and sinister. When Thorne pushes her away, she loses control and assumes a posture resembling one of Charcot’s hysterics: raising her hand to her forehead and throwing her head backward to expose her white throat, she emits a silent scream before collapsing to the floor and playing dead, mimicking the catatonia of the hysteric. Astrid wears only black; her wing-like shawl has fallen away, causing her to look like a bird of prey with clipped wings.

	its pallor now accentuated by her black dress. Her eyes remain wide open, unfocused, and lifeless, suggesting to the audience and to Thorne that she is dead. The camera cuts back and forth between close-ups of their faces. Then, one close-up captures an ever-so-brief fluttering of Astrid’s eyelid. Thorne recoils in horror as Astrid suddenly sits up. Then, Astrid’s body cuts diagonally across the screen, her white face dominating the shot from the upper right corner as her body in the black dress seems to fade into the carpet. She looks like a floating head—a Medusa post-Perseus.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Gender/Sex Conflation in Beardsley’s Art and <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>: The Masculinized Woman and the Feminized Man</h1>
<p>
	The iconic femme fatale derives from what Judith Butler calls the “two res of abjection,” which Cassandra Laity identifies as “the masculinist woman and the feminized man” (qtd in <span style="font-style:italic;">HDV</span>, 23; ibid.). Both res existed in the Decadent era. The “masculinist woman” was embodied in the re of the “New Woman,” the name given to Victorian women who sought increased social, political, and educational opportunities. In order to counter the feminist threat, establishment res invented “degrading stereotypes” that depicted the New Woman as “ugly,” “masculine-looking,” and “sexless.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> The “feminized man” was personified in the re of the dandyish artist who, working in the romantic tradition, was “labeled ‘effeminate’ by male modernists.”<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Beardsley’s art and H. D.’s Astrid demonstrate that these two “res of abjection” are not self-contained, but that gender and sexuality are fluid categories.
      </p>
<p>
	In one of the first sequences of <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, Astrid calls Pete to tell him that Adah is with Thorne. The camera holds Astrid in a close-up, her right side exposed to the harsh light of the camera. In this shot, she resembles an androgyne, as she could be mistaken for a man with male pattern baldness. As Astrid hangs up, angry that Pete would not take her call, the camera rests on her claw-like hands that are curled around the telephone receiver. The camera cuts to a medium close-up of Astrid, focusing on the hairless chasm of her scalp. After a quick cut to Adah, the camera cuts to a close-up of Astrid’s right profile, focusing the light on the back on her neck and casting her skeletal appearance in a strange and surreal swirl of shadows and light. Occurring in rapid succession at the advent of the film, these stark, unflattering shots shock the viewer with the repellent nature of Astrid’s physical appearance. Astrid continues to be lit harshly throughout the film, as, for example, the scene in which she stares relentlessly into the camera upon realizing that Thorne is about to leave her. In this ten-second stare, the viewer sees the stark light embedding into Astrid’s skull on the left side. She wears little to no make-up, and her thin mouth suggests no hint of sexual enticement. Her eyes lock unto the camera. This hypnotic stare manifests utter desperation (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>). Astrid’s is the very antithesis of the beautiful face of the iconic femme fatale, whose heavily-hooded eyes, cast downward, invite the male gaze. This shot of Astrid has the opposite effect—it repels the viewer. The viewer wants to avert his/her eyes.
      </p>
<p>
	Beardsley’s illustration <span style="font-style:italic;">Bookplate of John Lumsden Propert</span>  (<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>), depicts women with similarly shocking and repellent features. Noting Beardsley’s tendency  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to endow his female res with masculine qualities, Brigid Brophy asks: “Are they female fops, these personages of Beardsley’s: female dandies: female effeminates, even? Or are they male hoydens, male tomboys, boy butches?”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> A menacingly large re with an unattractive face, a hooked nose, and bag-lined eyes stares from the page, her gender signaled only by her elaborate hairstyle and dress. She, too, bears markers of masculinity: dwarfing the illustration’s smaller Pierrot re, her height, body shape, and lack of appendages are suggestive of the phallus. She controls the gaze of the picture with her icy and threatening stare at the viewer. She is also masculine in that she replicates the traditionally dominant male position of power. However, she would not be considered a femme fatale in that her power does not originate, as does the femme fatale’s, in seductiveness.

	Beardsley depicts his repellent woman and her adorning Pierrot in what in filmic terms would be called a two-shot, a presentation that highlights the masculinity of the woman re. Macpherson similarly uses a two shot of Astrid and Adah in order to emphasize Astrid’s masculinity and unattractiveness (<a name="9-text" href="#9"> 9</a>). As Adah prepares to leave Astrid and Thorne’s hotel suite, Macpherson frames the actresses in medium close-up. Shooting their profiles as they face one another establishes a sharp contrast between Astrid’s white, skeletal looks and Adah’s softer, more pleasing features. A painting in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the background, in which a man’s head twists unnaturally in Astrid’s direction, as if he were shocked and repelled by her ugliness, separates Astrid and Adah. The shot’s framing cuts off Astrid’s back while leaving Adah’s back and shoulders intact, suggesting that Adah is more self-possessed than Astrid and that Adah’s presence in Thorne’s life cuts into Astrid. Astrid’s harsh profile and scalp distinguish her from Adah’s attractive hat-adorned head, while her tall, angular body contrasts with Adah’s smaller, rounder, more feminine body. Added images of penises and testicles further connote Astrid’s masculinity and contrast her with Adah’s attractive feminine qualities: two balls of fabric resembling testicles hang from Astrid’s dress and an erect phallic candle rests directly beneath her on the mantelpiece in the background.

	This shot of Astrid and Adah mirrors uncannily Beardsley’s positioning of res in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Peacock Skirt</span> (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>). The masculine-looking Salome is on the left and the feminine-looking Narraboth, the captain of the guard, is on the right. Narraboth’s dress-like tunic shows off his effeminate knock-knees. As Chris Snodgrass points out, the outline of an axe located within the contours of Narraboth’s tunic foreshadows his own death as well as John’s beheading, rendering them both castrated males.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Narraboth’s elegantly coiffed hair and smaller headdress compared with Salome’s elaborate one further code him as effeminate. The ragged edge of Narraboth’s tunic forms a series of small phallic-shaped rips. The center one, which hangs directly between his legs, resembles a small, flaccid penis while the small, double half circle of dots directly above and to the right of this  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> center rip signifies a small and incomplete scrotal sack: both render his image one less masculine than that of Salome. By making her the much larger re, Beardsley portrays the power Salome has over Narraboth. Standing erect, phallic-shaped, and armless on her sturdy, skirted pedestal, her re overpowers the illustration. Salome’s flowing skirt, which resembles a peacock’s fanned plumage, and her headdress, which mirrors the crown of the peacock’s head, align her image with that of the male peacock who exhibits his plumage to attract the female peahen. In his drab tunic, with its ragged, ripped bottom, Narraboth’s appearance suggests the dull plumage of the peahen. In this illustration, Salome is cock and Narraboth is hen.
      </p>
<p>
	Astrid, likewise, desires to make herself cock to Thorne’s hen. Her attempt to appropriate Thorne’s large knife—which is rendered impotent in her hands and then turned against her—signifies her simultaneous desire both to masculinize herself and to feminize Thorne. Using a high-angle shot, Macpherson makes Astrid appear small and powerless. He also focuses a harsh bright light on the right side of her head that highlights her skull—a lighting choice he repeats throughout the film. Astrid looks up at the camera with her head down, producing a ghoulish, frightening effect. The lighting emphasizes her eye sockets, which reinforces her skeletal signification. By relating her so obviously to a skeleton, Macpherson preres her as a corpse, and within a minute or two this shot, Astrid will be dead. Putting on her Beardsley-esque shawl that had fallen off during her earlier hysterical fit, Astrid races toward Thorne and snatches his knife. H. D. describes this scene in her “<span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> Pamphlet”: “The white woman is here, there, everywhere, the dagger is above, beneath, is all but in her heart or in the heart of her meritricious [sic] lover” (B. 230). Macpherson presents this sequence through an Eisensteinian clatter montage that makes the viewer feel disoriented and uneasy. These rapid cuts mirror the frenzy of the scene unfolding as Astrid’s frenetic and hysterical movements frighten and disorient Thorne. Astrid makes small cuts on Thorne’s face and hands. McCabe comments on this scene noting that by “making little cuts on his face” Astrid produces “the body as screen, a scriptable surface.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Just as Gilbert and Gubar have theorized that the pen is a “metaphorical penis,”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> the page then, becomes a metaphorical vagina. Astrid attempts to gain power over Thorne by feminizing him, appropriating ownership of the pen(is) and attempting to turn him into the page. Her efforts to dominate him, however, are unsuccessful: after losing the knife to Thorne, it is she who is penetrated by it in the ensuing scuffle.
      </p>
<p>
	Beardsley’s Salome, who echoes many of Astrid’s characteristics, also shares her fate. Beardsley captures the moment in which Salome is her most “hysterical” in his illustration <span style="font-style:italic;">J’ai Baisé Ta Bouche Iokanaan</span>  (<a name="0-text" href="#0"> 10</a>). This illustration depicts the moment in Wilde’s play in which Salome’s unrequited desire for John, like Astrid’s unrequited desire for Thorne, throws her into the final throws of hysteria. Like Astrid, she becomes homicidal, demanding that the man who rejected her pay with his blood—a blood lust that ultimately causes her own demise. As John the Baptist (Iokanaan) continuously repels her advances, Salome repeats, “I will kiss they mouth Iokanaan” (<span style="font-style:italic;">J’ai Baisé Ta Bouche Iokanaan</span>) over and over, like one of Charcot’s hysterical patients repeating the same movements or phrases. Salome finally demands that his severed  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	Beardsley’s direct reference to Salome’s obsessive repetition of the phrase reinforces the power of her obsession and confirms her turn to the hysterical (the overly feminine). Even her body is draped in a hospital-like gown like those worn by Dr. Charcot’s patients. Salome’s masculine face and jawline make her appear ugly and repellent, while John’s face is feminized. His eyes are closed and lips slightly puckered as if anticipating Salome’s kiss. His long, flowing hair connotes his “femme fatale” quality, while Salome’s “erect” hair conveys her masculinity. Her ability to float in mid-air suggests the strange bodily contortions of which Charcot’s patients were capable during their hysterical episodes. Salome’s head, which appears to be severed by a strand of black hair echoes the floating head of Astrid. The deaths of both women are presaged by these images of decapitation, which symbolize the castrating effects of their hysteria.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> The liquid [Blood? Semen?] dripping from John’s head morphs into a flame signifying the flame of sexual desire; it drips down snake-like into a puddle, winds itself around Beardsley’s emblematic signature, and lands at the base of a clematis flower. The turn of the flame of passion into a puddle connotes the turn of Salome’s flaming sexual allure into an extinguished puddle of her own gendered fluidity. Beardsley also implies the fluidity of gender through the use of gendered metaphors: flower and water connote the feminine, while flame and erect, snake-like hair connote the masculine. In Wilde’s play, Salome pays the ultimate price for her hysteria, her immediate execution ordered by a repulsed King Herod. Certainly this picture gives the slang phrase “giving head” a macabre twist. One that the “polymorphously perverse”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Beardsley would have relished and the male modernists would have feared.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Sex, Race and Racism in Beardsley’s Art and <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>: The Othered “Male” Femme Fatale</h1>
<p>
	In both Beardsley’s art and <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, the iconic femme fatale is not red as an alluring, dangerous woman but by a non-white man. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Peacock Skirt</span> (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>), Narraboth, as the “Syrian” captain, is an Othered racial re in relation to Salome, and he assumes the feminine position to Salome’s masculine one. In <span style="font-style:italic;">J’ai Baisé Ta Bouche Iokanaan</span> (<a name="0-text" href="#0"> 10</a>), John, as a Nazarene, is also an Othered male put in the feminine position. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline,</span> Pete, as racialized Other, embodies the “ripe” femme fatale. Although very masculine, he does not have the power to use his sex appeal to his advantage and instead becomes an object of (white) male desire, just as the iconic femme fatale operates in the matrix of heterosexual (white) male desire. Unthreatened by Pete’s sexuality, the barmaid thoroughly delights in Pete, as is evidenced by her playfully tucking a flower behind his ear (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>); in contrast, Pete’s sexuality is dangerous and threatening to the white male, Thorne, for whom Pete functions as a potential castrator, thereby placing Pete in the position of the iconic femme fatale. As E. Ann Kaplan and Susan McCabe point out, black men and white women are often similarly marginalized as “the Other” in relation to white male power. McCabe argues, “<span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> reanimates the re of the femme fatale by self-consciously racializing it, shifting the film’s erotic locus from H. D. to Paul Robeson. As such, the film invokes the femme fatale as an index for how sex and race impinge upon each other.” She continues, “Astrid is not the film’s femme fatale; instead, the film makes this trope more problematic, and through Robeson, manifests culture’s expulsion of a feminized racial other.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> While not referring specifically to <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, Kaplan considers how the “feminized racial other” fits into the white male power paradigm: “While the specificity of [the white man’s] fears of women, homosexuals and people of colour are different, all three groups share a similarity as marginalised by the white centre.” She goes on to hypothesize that mainstream films tend “to use a <span style="font-style:italic;">similar structure in relation to kinds of difference</span>. That is, Hollywood<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> puts different kinds of difference into the same position vis-à-vis the imaginary white center.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Thorne so thoroughly inhabits the “white [male] centre” that he wears his whiteness, in the form of a white turtleneck sweater, throughout the entire film.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>
	Ironically, the montage poster produced to advertise the film (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 11</a>) does not privilege this “white centre” but concentrates instead on Pete as the erotic locus. Faces, bodies, and parts of faces are cut out and pasted to form a metonymic, corporeal collage. Out of the thirteen images used in the collage, seven are of Pete. At the top left of the poster, is an image of Pete with closed eyes and puckered lips; the crouched re of Thorne, arms raised and fists clenched in a boxer’s pose, rests on Pete’s chin and mouth. The conflation of these images suggests both danger and erotic possibility: will Pete kiss or caress Thorne’s tiny body with his tongue, or devour it? The largeness of Pete’s head in comparison with Thorne’s body, codes Pete as the more sexually potent of the two men.
      </p>
<p>
	The name Pete, a nickname for penis, further evokes the trope of the sexually powerful black male. At the same time the film undermines this persistent trope by positioning Pete as a femme fatale. The scene in which Thorne places a knife by his crotch and begins to whittle a <span style="font-style:italic;">very small stick</span> suggests Thorne’s feelings of sexual inadequacy in regard to Pete, who dwarfs and threatens the sexuality of the white male while also enticing him with his beautiful body. Macpherson’s presentation of Pete  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> via lighting and close-ups unambiguously establishes him as the film’s fetish object extraordinaire. As a sexually powerful racial Other who poses a castration threat, Pete is subject to fetishization.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> His seven erotic heads in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> poster certainly imply his fetishization: Pete is cut up into pieces and displayed as body parts rather than as an entire human being. McCabe describes Macpherson’s eroticized treatment of Pete, noting how: “the camera caresses him almost to the point of soft porn, building on his cultural capital as sex symbol. The film thus idealizes, objectifies, and fragments Robeson, associating him with the femme fatale.”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Macpherson’s camera slices Pete into pieces and serves him up on a cinematic platter for sexual consumption. Numerous close-ups zoom in on Pete’s forehead and face, both in profile and in full frontal shots, as well as on his strong, veined hands and forearms, which are suggestive of an erect penis. As Judith Brown observes, “an early indication of the emphasis of Pete as (erotic) object in the film will be the framing of his hands.”<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Pete’s body in general, and his hands in particular, are so fetishized in one scene that Macpherson’s camera seems to have “had” Robeson sexually. This sequence of shots occurs almost immediately after the scene in which Thorne plays with his knife, first sticking it into his hand, then placing the knife against his face and running it slowly down his forehead and nose with his eyes closed in what could be described as sexual enthrallment. After a quick series of shots of the café, the following forty-eight second sequence of shots ensues:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot one: ECU (extreme close-up) of Pete’s face in (left) profile with only his eyes nose and mouth appearing in frame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot two: CU (Close-up) of Pete’s face in (left) profile filmed in soft focus and lit so that his nose, lower lip and forehead, are highlighted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot three: CU of Pete’s right hand gripping the right collar of his shirt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot four: ECU of Pete’s right hand in soft focus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot five: CU of Pete’s heavily veined left hand and forearm resting against his left thigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot six; ECU of Pete’s left hand in soft focus</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot seven: CU of Pete’s face in (left) profile in sharp focus. The camera then tilts slowly down the left side of Pete’s body. The camera’s focus becomes softer just as the camera hits his right hand, still clutching the collar and then in soft focus the camera continues down his body until it reaches the left hand still resting on his thigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot eight: First shot of Pete in motion, CU with blurry focus on his moving torso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot nine: Medium CU of Pete falling into his bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot ten: CU of Pete lying in bed, eyes closed. Pete then slowly turns to his right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot eleven: Medium Shot (MS) of Pete in bed, the camera showing his head, torso, and right thigh. Pete restlessly writhes in bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Shot twelve: ECU of Pete’s face, taking up almost the entire frame. Pete still lies on his back and is lit so that the shadows of a design blanket his face. This final shot lasts ten seconds.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	After cutting Pete up into various body parts, the camera lasciviously travels slowly down Pete’s body turning soft when it reaches his phallic hand as if so sexually frenzied that it loses focus. Pete’s constant writhing in bed, captured in rapid cuts, further  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> suggests sexual copulation between Pete and the camera. After the act is completed, Pete stares into space, and the strange shadows that settle on his face suggest a kind of erotic makeup that highlights his exotic Otherness. This sequence of shots reflects more than Macpherson’s aforementioned desire to bed his star, suggesting that Pete is a sexual object to be “had.” The fact that this sequence occurs almost immediately after Thorne’s knife play implies that he, as the dominant white male, in entitled to bed Pete, thereby feminizing and marginalizing the latter.
      </p>
<p>
	Beardsley’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Caprice</span><a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> also res the racialized male Other as sexual plaything, although in this case, it is a white woman who sexually objectifies a black male. The title of the painting intimates that this woman’s involvement with him is no more than a whim, a fancy, or something to occupy her time until she capriciously drops him and moves on to another sexual plaything. The clown-like outfit worn by the male re connotes him too, as an object of play. His featureless face serves also to objectify him—stripping him of ethnic and racial identity that facial features provide. In this painting, he appears to have been captured in motion, forever frozen in the middle of a dance—an obvious metaphor for sex—that is being performed for the woman’s amusement. Adding to the implication of his sexual potency is an erect feather on his hat. His positioning under an arched, vagina-like entranceway, the tip of his cap protruding into the archway, only furthers his phallic image. Despite the masculine persona suggested by his feather and his positioning in the archway, his size, dress, and role as plaything code him as feminine. The re of the woman shows a similar degree of gender fluidity. The woman directs her gaze at the male re, signifying her desire to look at him. Her elaborate dress denotes her wealth and power. Her “muff,” symbolic of the vagina, res prominently into the composition, with its whiteness highlighted by the darkness of her dress and the background. The prominence of this muff suggests she derives sexual pleasure from watching his dance. The muff also codes her as feminine, as does her dress with its pouffy sleeves and green ribbons. Her prominent hair decoration, with two large brightly colored feathers, signifies her masculine power. Nevertheless, the male re’s feathers are “erect,” while hers, although larger, appear flaccid, sending a mixed message: Is she really sexually aroused or merely amused?

<h1 class="sec-headA">Sex, Race and Racism in Beardsley’s Art and <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>: “Othered” Woman Tropes</h1>
<p>
	The racism implied through the sexual objectification of persons of color in <span style="font-style:italic;">Border-line</span> occurs not only through the re of Pete, but through that of Adah. When we first glimpse Adah, she has just been pushed to the floor by Thorne and stares up at him, looking frightened and small. A high angle shot emphasizes her powerlessness. Her chest heaves rapidly, displaying her corporeality as well as her fear of Thorne. As she collects herself, she flinches and backs against a window curtain as if pinned in place or frozen in fear. Her positioning against a window rather than a solid wall indicates the precariousness of her situation at both the literal and rative levels and accentuates her vulnerability. Although Thorne eventually channels his violent impulses into  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> smashing a porcelain re instead of hitting Adah, the film implies Thorne’s belief that it is his right to physically abuse Adah, which further emphasizes her marginalized position. Although Thorne eventually kills Astrid, he never threatens to strike her.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> The film leaves his actions in relation to Astrid open to interpretation. He might have been acting in self-defense, or the up-ended table might have caused the knife to slip into Astrid’s body.
      </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>’s fetishization of Pete and Adah as exotic playthings who can be abused raises questions about the way the film portrays race. Eslanda Robeson wrote in her diary that she and Paul “ruined their make-up with tears of laughter” over the racial naiveté of H. D. and Macpherson.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> This naiveté was undoubtedly compounded by the more covert forms of racism that typified the 1920s, for “H. D. and her white friends might fit the pattern of so many liberal whites whose disgust for discrimination and sympathy for blacks ran very deep but whose friendship and fascination were often tainted by covert forms of racism” (“MSR,” 101). The film strives to be anti-racist, using the bigoted Astrid as a conduit for its explicit anti-racist message. <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> situates Astrid so that her physical ugliness—her repellent, skeletal, and vulturesque qualities—reflects her spiritual ugliness. In the scene in which Astrid hysterically hisses, “Nigger lover,” for example, Macpherson uses a harsh light to illuminate her ugliness. Clawing at the air, she looks like a predatory animal. Still, one wonders if the desire to present an explicit anti-racist agenda somehow gets lost in the racism noted by Friedman. The way in which the film enacts its anti-racist message, by comparing Adah with monkeys, further makes the film itself appear to be covertly racist.
      </p>
<p>
	The scene in question is that in which Astrid and Thorne first quarrel over Adah. Macpherson’s positioning of Astrid directly above an ugly toy witch that sits on the mantel visually and metaphorically connects Astrid with the toy. Astrid’s gaze initially looks out beyond the frame, as if she looks at Thorne, sitting on the bed in their adjoining room. Astrid then turns her head slightly, gazing at a blurry object hanging on the wall in the center of the frame. She looks down at the bottom of the object and slowly looks up so that her gaze encompasses the entire length of the blurry hanging object. The camera quickly cuts to an extreme-close-up of Thorne gazing out beyond the frame, suggesting that he watches Astrid in the next room. Rapidly, the camera cuts back to Astrid, now in extreme-close-up, her face holding a smug, superior smirk. She remains in profile and in soft focus as she gazes intensely at the re on the wall, which is now in sharp focus. Astrid gazes smugly at three miniature toy monkeys, hanging vertically, hand over foot. The camera moves up the trio of monkeys as it follows Astrid’s eye up the chain. Macpherson then moves to a new location, indicated by a close-up on a closed curtain-adorned door, which Adah opens, entering into the close-up. This shot obliquely mirrors the opening of a theater curtain, “introducing” Adah into the previous scene, which suggests a more covert racism at work in the film.
      </p>
<p>
	The same kind of problematic associations with women and race occur in Beardsley’s work. Matthew Sturgis writes that in the 1890s “an alarmed public” considered many of Beardsley’s women “ugly and bizarre. . . . The thick-lipped ‘Beardsley mouth’ came in for particular censure as being ‘inexpressive and ugly’ and anatomically improbable; it  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> had . . . been borrowed from Africa and applied incongruously to the Anglo-Saxon face” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span>, 218–19). Indeed, many of Beardsley’s women had African or Asian features, as can be seen, for example, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Bookplate of John Lumsden Propert</span> (<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>), in the illustrations of <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> (<a name="5-text" href="#5">. 5</a> and <a name="0-text" href="#0">10</a>), and in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Design for the Prospectus of The Yellow Book</span>  (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 12</a>) and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Design for the Front Cover of The Yellow Book, Vol. II</span>  (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 13</a>). <span style="font-style:italic;">Design for the Prospectus</span> depicts an angular, unnatural-looking woman whose face has disproportionate non-Caucasian features that make her appear grotesque. The (white) Pierrot-like re minding the bookstore looks at her disapprovingly. The fact that the woman is out alone at night suggests that she may be a prostitute, or, at the very least, a woman with loose morals. <span style="font-style:italic;">Design for the Front Cover</span> depicts a woman with thick lips and slanted eyes that appear crossed as a way of indicating a lack of intelligence. The way her hair parts at her forehead to look like two white horns suggests devilish intensions, or perhaps a deviant sexuality. The presence of six large, open flowers, signifying the vagina, connote her hypersexuality. Beardsley’s women were often caricatured in <span style="font-style:italic;">Punch</span> magazine (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 14</a>) with particular “emphasis on the woman’s slanted eyes and thick lips” which “carried Asian or African racial connotations which would have reinforced the racist notion that non-European women were more primitive and sexually voracious.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Recognizing that being lampooned in <span style="font-style:italic;">Punch</span> was a sign of success, Beardsley must have realized that that his images of women were hitting upon a sensitive Victorian nerve.
      </p>
<p>
	It is unclear whether Beardsley’s depictions of these women highlight his racist tendencies, or whether they mock racist attitudes of his time. Beardsley played with the fluidity of gender and sex as a means of suggesting that male/female and masculine/feminine were not either/or binaries. Along the same lines, Beardsley’s presentation of women with varying and perhaps fluid racial features suggests that racial fluidity could also traverse preset binaries of white/Other and centralized/marginalized. Beardsley and H. D. seemed to have shared similar agendas in regard to blurring the conventional borderlines of sex, gender, and race; such efforts as they made to tackle these binaries were rare in both the Decadent and the Modernist periods.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Conclusion</h1>
<p>
	In his “Translator’s Postscript” to de Gourmont’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Natural Philosophy of Love</span>, Ezra Pound wrote that writing effective poetry was like “driving any new idea into the great passive vulva of London.”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Pound’s phrase emphasizes his distaste for the ways that the Aesthetic and Decadent movements had feminized London with their decaying romantic notions of decadence and art-for-art’s-sake. In Pound’s view, London needed to be inseminated with the hard, masculine ideas of modernism. While H. D. began her career as a hard modernist, her artistic sensibilities would soften as her career continued, for “H. D. would cast off the vanishing body of male ‘indifference’— Hermaphroditus—for exploded and explosive female bodies that matter” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HDV</span>, 119). Even while working on <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> pamphlet in and around 1930, H. D. expressed reservations about linking herself to the Decadent Aestheticism of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	the 1890s. Expressing admiration for Macpherson’s talent in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> pamphlet, she writes: “I have said that Kenneth Macpherson touches the various ‘stops’ and focus appliances of his beautiful camera like a violinist. And that presents another parallel. I have said that in the film alone can the pictorial arts be welded. They can in addition be <span style="font-style:italic;">wedded</span> and to a separate art form. And that form, music.” However, she then issues a caveat: “But here we are on difficult ground; speaking of one art in terms of another always seems the hall-mark of the ‘nineties’ or of facile dilettantism. Yet it is perhaps as necessary to-day for the modernist artist to endeavour to shock weary sensibilities as it was for the so-called ‘effete’ of that generation” (“B,” 228).

	On the one hand, she mistrusts the ease with which the Aesthetes “weld” and “wed” different forms of art; on the other hand, she acknowledges that this “welding” and “wedding” is necessary in order to “shock” people out of their perceived expectations of what art should be. H. D. comes to realize her connection with the 1890s Aesthetes  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and welcomes a welding and a wedding of her works to theirs. Eventually, she would come to see the Aesthetes’ combining of art forms, such as Whistler’s insistence that his paintings were musical, not as “facile dilettantism,” but as a means of infusing all art forms with new energy. Beardsley’s Aesthetic Decadent “energy” infiltrates H. D.’s work, and she, as Laity cogently argues, continually influenced the shape of modernity and (almost exclusively male) modernist ideas. H. D. is the Mrs. Pugh of modernism. By unconsciously “finding” Beardsley’s work, she prevents the ideas of the Decadent Aesthetics from being forever lost to the succeeding generation of modernists. Functioning as “Mrs. Pugh” to Beardsley’s “ghost,” particularly with regard to their views on gender, sex and race, H. D. becomes the artistic and historical link between Decadent Aestheticism and modernism.
      </p>
<p>
	After Beardsley’s death, Arthur Symons noted that the young artist “had the fatal speed of those who are to die young; that disquieting completeness and extent of knowledge, that absorption of a lifetime in an hour, which we find in those who hasten to have done their work before noon, knowing that they will not see the evening.”<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> Just as his <span style="font-style:italic;">masked woman</span> is caught in a moment before she reveals her true self to her audience, Beardsley too was caught in a moment of history come too soon, swallowed up by an untimely death before he had the chance to develop into one of the finest artists of the modernist era. By seeing the connections between H. D.’s work in <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> and Beardsley’s art, I feel that in some manifestation, Beardsley did become a great modernist artist despite his unfortunate historical timing. In her essay “The Cinema and the Classics III—The Mask and the Movietone,” H. D. dreams about that great new invention of modernism, the cinema. With cinema, she writes, “we are visionaries, we may become prophets.”<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> H. D. was herself that visionary, as she (unconsciously) recognized a proto-cinematic “prophet” of modernism—Aubrey Beardsley.

	    The POOL group, which consisted primarily of H. D., Bryher, and Macpherson, announced its formation in various literary magazines in the spring of 1927. Its “projects” were to include the publication of books, the production of films, and the formation of the monthly film art magazine, <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up</span>, which would “begin battle for film art.” See Anne Friedberg, “Introduction: Reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up, 1927–1933,</span>” <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up 1927–1933</span>, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Cinema and Modernism</span>, ed.

	  Beardsley’s biographer, Matthew Sturgis, reports that Beardsley met Edward Burne-Jones on Sunday, July 12, 1891 when he and his sister, Mabel, dropped by “The Grange,” thinking Burne-Jones had “open studio” sessions on Sundays. Although this proved not to be the case, Burne-Jones still welcomed the uninvited couple into his home, told Beardsley his drawings showed promise and encouraged him to continue his art (AB, 71–74).

	  I will contend that he does grab at her shirt in the café, but this maneuver seems defensive as she simultaneously grabs him. It appears that any aggression toward Astrid results from Thorne’s need for self-defense. Late in the film, he pushes her away, but this is more an act of repulsion than aggression.

<div id="body">
<p>
      When we consider late-Victorian literature through the lens of the Aesthetic Movement, what do we do with William Morris? Is he the nostalgic neo-medievalist, the “idle singer of an empty day,” or is he the socialist artist <span style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span> who, after his 1883 adoption of socialism, forged what Caroline Arscott has called “the first English-language attempt to produce a Marxist theory of art”?<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> We can appeal to chronology to answer this question: the early Morris was a Pre-Raphaelite and Aesthete, whose work deeply influenced Oscar Wilde’s articulation of “The House Beautiful” and “The Decorative Arts” on his lecture tour of America, while the later Morris was a radical who spent the last thirteen years of his life formulating a new kind of political aesthetic. But such a distinction ignores the continuities between his early and late career and fails to address the underlying question of whether Aestheticism and revolutionary socialism are indeed oppositional. If Aestheticism is defined conventionally by its insistence on the autonomy of art and the isolation of individual consciousness—“each mind keeping as a solitary prisoner its own dream of the world,” as Walter Pater put it—and, consequently, by inwardness, reflexivity, and detachment from socio-political reality, was Morris its adversary or unwitting proponent?<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Was he a socialist trapped in the Aesthetic age, or an Aesthete mired down in socialist propaganda?
    </p>
<p>
      A theory of Morris’s place within Aestheticism, and, more broadly, of the place of the political within Aestheticism, can be derived by considering Morris’s response to <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> print culture and his two major experiments in socialist print: the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> newspaper and the Kelmscott Press. These two print  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> projects formally mirror the genres of Aestheticism and utopianism in their conception of the text’s relation to political reality. Using Fredric Jameson’s recent work on the politics of Utopia, I want to suggest that Morris’s print ventures, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> and Kelmscott, construct themselves in relation to mainstream print in the same way that Utopia constructs itself in relation to present-day reality, and that both of these relationships echo Aesthetic theories of art and realism. Recognizing these parallels reframes the debate over Aestheticism’s politics—and over Morris’s politics—more properly as a debate over evolutionary versus revolutionary socialism, over reformist versus revolutionary approaches to political change, and over progressive versus dialectical theories of history. Positioning Morris and Aestheticism within the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> political moment, a moment riven by these very debates, allows us to identify the operative conceptions of the political and the aesthetic that they share, and the utopian and revolutionary features of Aesthetic form.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Morris, Print, and Utopia</h1>

	Morris’s print ventures in the 1880s and 1890s investigate the nature of print’s politics, expose and critique the political effects of mass print culture, and assert the possibility of a break from the foreseeable future of politics and print. They are situated at the intersection of idealist, Marxist, Aesthetic, and modernist discourses; conceptualized in these terms, contradictory elements of these projects mirror the variegated aesthetic landscape of the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span>, a milieu newly complicated by critics such as Ann Ardis, who argues that the “competition among emergent aesthetic and political traditions in turn-of-the-century Britain,” “the quarreling as well as the voracious borrowing of ideas,” requires “a much more detailed and nuanced topographical mapping of the period.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> In a piece that exemplifies Ardis’s vision, Toril Moi has recently excavated the aesthetic category of “idealism”—“the belief that the task of art . . . is to uplift us, to point the way to the Ideal”—and argues that its lingering resonance in the late-nineteenth century has been suppressed by modernist suspicion of idealist art.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Her recovery of idealism as a significant aesthetic and political discourse in this era bears strongly on studies of Morris, whose work exhibits features of both an older idealist tradition and an emerging modernist one, as well as on studies of Aestheticism, a movement that opposed the idealist conflation of beauty and morality, but adhered to idealism in its rejection of the ugliness of naturalism, its insistence on the artist’s freedom as a necessary condition for the creation of beauty, and its utopian belief in art’s potential to create, as Wilde put it, “a new world that will be more marvelous, more enduring, and more true than the world that common eyes look upon, and through which common natures seek to realize their perfection.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Morris’s print work hearkens back to an idealist tradition in which art occupies a higher plane and serves as an ethical model, but also draws on Aestheticism and Marxism to complicate that tradition by continually insisting on the artificiality of this ideal; in this way, his work reveals Aestheticism’s key formal similarities with the utopian genre and the political resonance of its insistence on a schism between art and social reality.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	The sense of a division between Morris and other writers of the 1890s is apparent, as Norman Kelvin pointed out in 1996, in that critics “have made less effort to see Morris synchronously with other res who shaped the decade.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Since 1996, Regenia Gagnier has identified continuities among Morris, Ruskin, and Wilde, arguing that all three write for “freedom, equality, and toleration,” but while Gagnier conceptualizes Aestheticism as more politically engaged that it is usually considered to be—as a big tent incorporating productivist and consumerist strains—Linda Dowling has likewise brought Morris into line with his Aesthetic contemporaries by identifying an essential conservatism in Morris’s thought.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> She argues that an “ideal of aristocratic sensibility unrecognized as such” lies “at the heart of the vision of aesthetic democracy inspiring Ruskin and Morris,” that Morris “repressed” this ideal in his work and his psyche, and that this repressed ideal corresponds with “Pater’s emergent and Wilde’s wholly developed aesthetic elitism.”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Since the 1890s, a great many critics have claimed that Morris failed as a writer and an artist to rise above the inward-looking practices of Aestheticism or the commodity culture that sustained them, and they have seen the Kelmscott Press, which Morris founded in 1891, as crucial evidence of this point. I want to suggest, to the contrary, that we should look precisely to Morris’s use of print to understand the concord between his aesthetics and his politics, and more broadly, to elucidate Aestheticism’s vision of the political sphere. In so doing, I am not concerned with reclaiming Aestheticism as an engaged discourse, as Gagnier does in <span style="font-style:italic;">Idylls of the Marketplace</span>, but rather with understanding the political possibilities afforded by its disengagement.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> In Morris’s two key socialist print ventures—the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> newspaper and Kelmscott Press—print is conceived as an autonomous space consciously removed from present-day reality; a detailed examination of Morris’s print practices in these forums reveals, however, how he enacts the art-life division as a politicized secession rather than an abrogation of politics.
      </p>
<p>
	Establishing Morris’s position in <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> print culture reveals important parallels between an Aesthetic notion of the ideal art object and his experiments in print, for Morris marks a transitional moment in the history of how left-wing reformers have viewed print’s politics, a pause between early-nineteenth-century conceptualizations of print as a progressive social force and twentieth-century skepticism about the political capacity of mass print. By the early twentieth century, such skepticism was as rampant among left-wing writers as among conservative modernists such as Ezra Pound.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Writing and printing in the 1880s and 1890s, Morris perceived the failure of liberal notions of print as an agent of progress and tried to reinvent print at the level of <span style="font-style:italic;">production</span> as an ideal practice apart from its reception. This inward recoil has been viewed by many as evidence of naiveté or hypocrisy on Morris’s part, since it resulted in print products with a very limited audience; certainly, it does align him with a reflexively Aesthetic focus on the work of art as a kind of artificial, manufactured perfection. At the same time, however, Morris’s print work was by no means apolitical, but rendered print itself a utopian space in which to imagine post-revolutionary art and politics.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Fredric Jameson’s recent book on Utopia suggests how a text can at once be a kind of artificial, manufactured perfection, seemingly freestanding from the social world as such, and yet still be politically revolutionary.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Beginning with the long-standing problem of how “works that posit the end of history can offer any usable historical impulses” Jameson observes that Utopias are not universal but are characteristic of certain periods of Western modernity (<span style="font-style:italic;">AF</span>, xiv). Associating utopianism with “transitional periods” and with a seemingly contradictory “distance . . . from practical politics,” Jameson theorizes that the creation of utopian space involves “the momentary formation of a kind of eddy or self-contained backwater within . . . seemingly irresistible forward momentum” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AF</span>, 15). Given Aestheticism’s emphasis on how the human mind and body are subject to nonstop change and flux—we are, Pater said, “but the concurrence, renewed from moment to moment, of forces parting sooner or later on their ways”—it is no surprise that the age of Aestheticism was also an age of Utopias, an age of eddies within the flux.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Jameson goes on to say that the “pocket of stasis” which is Utopia “within the ferment and rushing forces of social change may be thought of as a kind of enclave within which Utopian fantasy can operate” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AF</span>, 15). This fantasy work is politically productive, though it remains a “self-contained backwater,” since it “allows the imagination to overleap the moment of revolution itself and posit a radically different ‘post-revolutionary’ society” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AF</span>, 16). Paradoxically, this makes utopianism revolutionary rather than reformist:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  One cannot . . . change individual features of current reality. A reform which singles out . . . this or that flaw or error in the system . . . quickly discovers that any given feature entertains a multitude of unexpected yet constitutive links with all the other features in the system. In the area of representation, the symptom of this discovery is to be found in what we have called a representational contradiction . . . in order adequately to represent such changes, the modification of reality must be absolute and totalizing: and this impulsion of the Utopian text is at one with a revolutionary and systemic concept of change rather than a reformist one.

<div class="attrib">

	</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
	  It is no surprise to say that Morris was a utopian thinker, for his 1890 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">News from Nowhere</span> is a classic of the genre, and many of his political essays and lectures have a utopian flavor, focusing on what life would be like after the revolution.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> It is less usual, however, to consider Morris’s theory of print as utopian, or his print productions as a kind of utopian space. Morris felt that print in his day was politically incapacitated by capitalism, putting writers like himself at an impasse; this is precisely the sort of condition, according to Jameson, in which utopianism thrives, moments when change seems impracticable and the status quo entrenched. At such moments, Jameson argues, “the very principle of the radical break as such, its possibility . . . is reinforced by the Utopian form. . . . The Utopian form itself is the answer to the universal ideological conviction that no alternative is possible, that there is no alternative to the system” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AF</span>, 231–2). Morris’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> and Kelmscott enact the utopian strategy that Jameson calls “disruption,” and bear a formal similarity to the utopian genre even apart from their content. This formal strategy, in which the print pages are constituted as self-contained,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> enclosed spaces that are irrevocably separated from present-day reality, is also characteristic of Aestheticism. While I am not the first critic to suggest that there is an element of utopianism within Aestheticism—Pater claimed that the “basis of all artistic genius lies in the power of conceiving humanity in a new and striking way, of putting a happy world of its own creation in place of the meaner world of our common days”—locating this utopianism within Morris’s print practice allows us to see how he articulated the revolutionary rather than progressive politics of Aesthetic literature specifically through medium and production.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Before I turn to Morris’s print productions, I want to establish his context within a transitional moment of print, and his intervention into a seemingly inevitable, invulnerable march of print progress. Early-nineteenth-century debates about politics and print tended to be polarized between a radical position that viewed an abundance of print as necessarily democratic and progressive and a conservative position in which abundant print was viewed as an anarchic and dangerous force.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> This polarity characterized the controversy over Thomas Paine’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Rights of Man</span> and other radical pamphlets of the 1790s, as well as the 1830s debates surrounding the growth of the penny press. Kevin Gilmartin maintains that in the first half of the nineteenth century, “radical protest was at times indistinguishable from its expression in print,” and that a “libertarian campaign for the rights of the press” was central to radical thought; Ian Haywood likewise argues that in these years “the fate of popular literature . . . became synonymous with the fate of democracy.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Writing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Edinburgh Review</span> in 1833, Henry Brougham argued that the march of print would lay the path for the march of the intellect: that the penny press would allow “hundreds of thousands” to “crowd around the sources whence the streams of pure and useful knowledge flow,” which would “surely make the people more capable of judging soundly and charitably upon matters of controversy.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> This was also the position of radicals like James Mill—as John Stuart Mill recalled, “so complete was my father’s reliance on the influence of reason over the minds of mankind . . . that he felt as if all would be gained if the whole population were taught to read, if all sorts of opinions were allowed to be addressed to them by word and in writing”—and of the Chartists in the 1840s.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Articulating the conservative position in 1834, Archibald Alison instead contended that the cheap press was dangerous and “pernicious.” Just as Brougham and Mill imagined that access to ample print would “surely” improve its readers, Alison argued that it would just as surely deprave them, for “the licentious and depraved character of so large a portion, at least of the lower strata, of the press, is the natural consequence of the inherent corruption of our nature; and of the fatal truth, that the human mind, when left to itself, will take to wickedness as the sparks fly upward.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  The nature of this debate changed, however, with the decade spanning 1851–1861, which saw the dissolution of the stamp tax, the newspaper tax, and the paper duty, along with various advances in print production. A surge in cheap print and cheap periodicals followed, and the 1870 legislation of universal education with the Forster Act helped complete a shift to near-universal literacy. The years between 1860 and 1890 thus fomented a genuine mass reading public, which failed to live up to the predictions  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of radicals <span style="font-style:italic;">or</span> conservatives. By the end of the century, left-wing reformers were less inclined to see plentiful print in and of itself as a progressive social force, and more inclined to see it as an effect of unrestrained capitalism.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Rather than free print, “free speech” and “free assembly” were the galvanizing issues of late-nineteenth-century socialism—rare causes around which the Fabians, the Social Democratic Federation, and the Socialist League would unite.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> The socialist position, expressed in a leaflet advocating the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>, was that modern print is undermined by consumer culture and capitalist consolidation within the printing industry:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    Men of Labour! Whenever you show signs of impatience at your present degraded position . . . you are met . . . by the censuring shouts of what is called ‘Public Opinion.’ But what is that ‘Public Opinion’ . . . Is it a common, wide-spread, a national feeling? Not at all! Public Opinion, that is, the Press, is, nowadays, like all private enterprise, a profit-mongering, mercenary concern. The Press of to-day is established, in the first instance, to make money. . . . Beware of the Capitalist Press, and look out for and support those few papers that are working for your freedom!<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>
	  Despite his position as editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>, Morris at times wondered if print itself was part of the problem: that is, if a reproducible medium intricately tied up with industrial modernity can be expected to produce anything <span style="font-style:italic;">but</span> apologies for capitalism. In this way, Morris preres Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, who often used images and metaphors associated with printing to express the homogeneity and uniformity of the culture industry—i.e. “culture now impresses the same stamp on everything”—as though the mechanism of removable type determines the conditions of its own cultural realization.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> In an unpublished essay of 1892 entitled “Some Thoughts on the Ornamented Manuscripts of the Middle Ages,” Morris reflected on “the present age of superabundance of books” and argued that “the utilitarian production of makeshifts, which is the especial curse of modern times, has swept away the book producer in its current.” He contrasted this condition of modern print with bookmaking in the Middle Ages, when a book was “a palpable work of art, a comely body fit for the habitation of the dead man who was speaking to them: the craftsman, scribe, limner, printer, who had produced it had worked on it directly as an artist, not turned it out as the machine of a tradesman.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Morris’s horror at the “superabundance” of books echoes Marx and Engels’s disgust at the absurd “epidemic of overproduction” that characterizes capitalist modernity—the waste and superfluity that coexist with want and privation—yet books prove a problematic commodity for such analysis, as progressive reformers had long assumed that the widespread desire for books reflected a natural hunger for knowledge rather than a created need or, as Marx and Engels put it, a “new want” summoned forth by capitalism.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Advocates of democracy and classlessness had long argued that widespread reading materials were a necessary basis for an equitable society. Under such conditions, how could one object to the overproduction of books?
	</p>
<p>
	  Morris was often caught on the horns of this dilemma. In an 1891 interview with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, his hostility toward small type prompted the interviewer to ask,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> “But, Mr. Morris, is it not better to give [the millions] books with small type, which they can buy cheap, than to prevent them from reading at all, which would be the case if there were no small type and consequent cheap editions?”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> In many ways, Morris’s ambivalent relationship with print and mass print culture reflected his growing sense that books and periodicals are not passive vessels of ideas, as progressive campaigners preceding him had conceived of them, but media commodities subject to the logic of their material conditions. Aesthetic decorated books are informed by a similar recognition, as Nicholas Frankel argues with respect to Oscar Wilde’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sphinx</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Salomé</span>, but Morris’s engagement with active media and textual commodification was more overtly political than that of Wilde.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Morris did not believe that movable type, when first invented, served a fundamentally different cultural role than writing: he maintained in an 1895 lecture that “the difference between the printed book and the written one was very little. . . . The results of printing, although considerable, were nothing like so considerable as people tried to make out.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> As an active collector of fifteenth-century incunabula (the earliest printed books), Morris could even be said to fetishize print produced at this early stage in its history. He believed, however, that the nature of print as a medium allowed for its synthesis with capitalism: in an 1895 interview, he said that print’s “history, as a whole, has practically coincided with the growth of the commercial system, the requirements of which have been fatal, so far as beauty is concerned, to anything which has come within its scope.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> The implicit question here is whether the medium itself might enable the economic or political structures that, in turn, facilitate the circulation and production of print.
	</p>
<p>
	  Morris’s response to this chicken-or-egg scenario was not to abandon print altogether, but to turn inward, in Aesthetic fashion, and reform print at the level of production with two “backwaters” of utopian print: the socialist newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> in the 1880s and the Kelmscott Press in the 1890s. These two print enterprises construct themselves as utopian spaces outside the “march of progress” narrative that had long accrued to print and to capitalism, and pointedly remove themselves from the general flow of mainstream print. The last decades of the nineteenth century saw a dramatic rise in the number of printed periodicals and books: Peter Keating, citing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Newspaper Press Directory</span>, notes that in “1875 the number of weekly, monthly and quarterly magazines was given as 643,” a number that increased “to 1,298 in 1885; 2,081 in 1895, and to 2,531 in 1903,” while novels, too, boomed exponentially from 1886 to the first World War.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Literary historians often view such numbers as evidence of the developing mass market in publishing, but the numbers also point to the rise of small and specialized publications oriented toward alternative publics: hundreds of British socialist newspapers, for example, emerged in the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> era.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> As editor and printer, Morris considered that a properly made text might produce its own reality, just as, for the more conventional Aesthetes, small magazines such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span> or the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chameleon</span> offered a utopian space in which to articulate unacceptable desires or unpopular ideas. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> was printed cheaply and in large quantities, whereas the Kelmscott books were printed in limited numbers of handmade materials and were quite expensive—reaching the exorbitant price of £20 for the famous  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Kelmscott Chaucer—yet both ventures appealed to small, specialized audiences and are characterized by a utopian impulse to create whole cloth a new print reality outside the existing culture of print.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>
</h1>
<p>
	  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>, Morris’s first major printing project, was the official journal of the Socialist League; Morris founded the League in 1885 with a group who had left the Social Democratic Federation because it was too autocratic and too compromising in its tactics. Circulating in a crowded field of radical London journals, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> was part of a surge of 1880s activist publishing, but is often singled out as having been the “best” in terms of composition and style.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> It sold cheaply for one penny and had a circulation of 2,500 to 3,000 a week, which was far less than Morris had hoped, and not enough to cover the paper’s costs.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> “The Manifesto of the Socialist League,” which ran in the paper’s first issue, explained the mission of the League and its paper: “Fellow Citizens, We come before you as a body advocating the principles of Revolutionary International Socialism; that is, we seek a change in the basis of Society—a change which would destroy the distinctions of classes and nationalities.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  As the “Manifesto” indicates, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> had a specific agenda, and in that sense might seem less utopian and more directly engaged in politics, yet the paper’s political agenda was itself utopian. Morris and the Socialist Leaguers were anti-parliamentarian socialists who did not believe that running socialist candidates or participating in electoral politics would bring about radical social change. The paper dissuaded readers from voting, or from participating in political activities aimed at incremental change, including trade unionism and labor reform. E. P. Thompson has argued, in fact, that the League’s tendency during the miner strikes of the 1880s to exhort the miners to aim at a unified revolution of all workers, rather than accept the small changes promised by local strikes here and there, “was decisive in causing its failure in 1887 and 1888 to organize the opinion in favour of Socialism which was spreading among the workers,” for the League never realized the “impossibility of preaching purism to workers engaged in bitter class struggles” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WM</span>, 438). While the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> regularly reported on strikes and maintained a strike fund, the position of the League and its paper was that only wholesale revolution could eradicate capitalism and pave the way for socialism; policies that slightly improved only <span style="font-style:italic;">some</span> workers’ lots did nothing to hasten the revolution’s advent. Thus the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>’s political mission was to educate in preparation for an eventual wholesale revolution, as Morris and E. B. Bax put it in an 1886 editorial: “in few words, our function is to educate the people by criticizing all attempts at so-called reforms . . . and by encouraging the union of the working classes towards Revolution.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> This all-or-nothing insistence on a complete break from existing social reality mirrors the formal features of Utopia.
	</p>
<p>
	  Even beyond its political ideology, however, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> constructed itself as a utopian print space. A significant part of the paper’s mission was the imaginative creation, through poetry and prose, of a post-revolutionary utopian future. Morris  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> published <span style="font-style:italic;">News from Nowhere</span> serially in the paper, and other of his works published there, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dream of John Ball</span>, have strongly utopian elements. In his essay “The Worker’s Share of Art,” printed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> in 1885, Morris articulated a political theory of art that perfectly suited the age of Aestheticism: under industrial capitalism, he said, “artists, the aim of whose lives it is to produce beauty and interest, are deprived of the materials for their works in real life, since all around them is ugly and vulgar. They are driven into seeking their materials in the imaginations of past ages, or into giving the lie to their own sense of beauty . . . by sentimentalizing and falsifying the life which goes on around them.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  In stating the need for a separation between the beauty of art and the ugliness of life, and in implying that nineteenth-century realism is anything but realistic, Morris preres by several years Wilde’s Aesthetic manifesto, articulated in “The Decay of Lying”: “as long as a thing is . . . a vital part of the environment in which we live, it is outside the proper sphere of art,” he maintained. “All bad art comes from returning to Life and Nature, and elevating them into ideals,” he continued. “As a method Realism is a complete failure.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Wilde asserts a political rationale for this rift between art and life in “The Critic as Artist,” in which he wrote, “we are trying at present to stave off the coming crisis, the coming revolution, as my friends the Fabianists call it, by means of doles and alms. . . . England will never be civilized till she has added Utopia to her dominions. . . . What we want are unpractical people who see beyond the moment, and think beyond the day.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Like Morris and the Socialist League, Wilde rejects the use-value of piecemeal reform—recall his argument against charity in “Soul of Man under Socialism”—and instead endorses a complete, utopian separation of art and vision from the political reality of the present. Wilde’s interest in Morris’s theories and in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> is evidenced by his 1887 note, held in the Socialist League Archive: “Please send Mr. Morris’s tract on ‘Socialism and Art’ to Mr. Oscar Wilde, 16 Tite Street, Chelsea. Also the ‘Commonweal’ for the year beginning with the November no.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  The art of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>, a resolutely socialist journal, is surprisingly faithful to Wilde’s Aesthetic program and yet is not apolitical, as Wilde’s work is often accused of being.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> published at least one poem in nearly every issue, and typically its poetry’s political form was explicitly utopian. Wilde expressed England’s need for people “who think beyond the day,” and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> poets did that quite literally by drawing endlessly on imagery of the dawn and the morning of the day after the revolution. Of course they did not invent the poetic association between sunrise and the post-revolutionary future—Algernon Swinburne had employed it quite recently, in fact, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Songs Before Sunrise</span> —but the effect of this persistent trope within the pages of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> was to position its textual space in a wholly discrete chronology, historically broken from the present day. An obscure poet named C. W. Beckett, for example, contributed more poems to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> than anyone (writing by my count about nine percent of the journal’s poems to Morris’s seven percent) and made generous use of matutinal imagery. Beckett’s poem “It Is the Day” metaphorically conjoins the sun and Christ to create a secular poem about the dawning of the post-revolutionary future: “O Son of Man, at last, at last, / over the wide and waiting earth  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> / the herald beams are spreading fast, / glad earnest of the daylight’s birth. / The night is spent, the stars are wan, / rose are the peaks that late were grey; / lift up thyself, O Son of Man, / arise, awake, it is the day!”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Another Beckett poem in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>, “For Fellowship,” uses the image of the dawn to position itself in a utopian chronology: “For we live in the future already, / We live in the ages gone by, / . . . We are one with the world of tomorrow, / We are one with our children unborn, / . . . Come follow the Socialist banner, / Come t for the Spirit of Time.” The final line might more appropriately say “Come t against the Spirit of Time,” since the poem invites readers to “live in the future already.”<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> “A New World,” another poem by Beckett whose title indicates its utopianism, similarly employs a time-defying refrain: “Hasten we, hasten the happy morn!”<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> Arguing for a utopian collapse of time, a chronological fold that would unite the present and the future, the poetry of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> is riddled with such references to the “hastening” of time.
	</p>
<p>
	  The visual art of Walter Crane, the “artist of socialism,” also renders the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> as utopian print space, severed chronologically and spatially from the historical present. The title of his cartoon, “Vive la Commune!” (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>), literally suggests that the past event of the 1871 Paris Commune is still alive. Given away as a supplement with the paper in March 1888 and March 1889, the cartoon celebrates the anniversary of the Commune by depicting victorious workers flanking an abstracted female re of freedom. The image functions to merge the past and the future, skipping over the present altogether by simultaneously memorializing the Commune and imagining the future revolution. Its abstracted female re transcends history or exists outside of it: with a vacant expression and a wreath garland in her hair, she is not historically bound to the Commune like the male res in the picture, but evokes a timeless idea.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Brandishing the printed banner, she is the link between pictorial and textual elements in the cartoon, operating in this sense as a re of print itself, a reminder of the power of printed words to transcend time and represent abstract ideas outside of their historical moment. The cartoon thus positions the print space of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> as a utopian space detached from the present.

	  Crane’s “Solidarity of Labour” cartoon, which ran in the 24 May 1890 issue of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> (during the serialization of <span style="font-style:italic;">News from Nowhere</span>) conveys an image set in the future, a world of global harmony after the revolution (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>). Just as the Paris Commune cartoon features an abstracted female re of freedom atop a base of two workers, this cartoon depicts a female angel of freedom hovering over the workers of the world, a visual image of idealized transcendence (the sphere of art) unified with the world below. While the men in the cartoon are each identified with a particular continent, the angel of freedom is geographically unspecific, and thus embodies an abstract concept apart from geographical or historical contexts. Again, she is the word-holder: the banner she brandishes reads “Fraternity” and “Equality,” but also contains the names of all the continents. The globe itself is also festooned with a banner that reads “Solidarity of Labour.” In both cartoons, we can read the banners and the women who hold them as res for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>, word-bearers that transcend national and temporal boundaries in a self-consciously utopian manner.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	  Crane was a leader in designing the visual imagery of socialism, and like Morris, his theory of art’s relation to political reality was identifiably Aesthetic and utopian. In the 1898 issue of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Easter Art Annual</span>, Crane described the “general theory of Art which has influenced my practice, or perhaps has been evolved from it,” distinguishing between “art which springs directly out of nature . . . more or less imitative in aim” and “art which is indirectly influenced by nature—the record or re-creation of ideas, which selects or invents only such forms as may express a preconceived idea, as a poet uses words.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Crane’s cartoons clearly exemplify this second form of art, which strives to represent an abstract idea—or “<span style="font-style:italic;">inner vision</span>” as he put it—rather than an outward reality. Such work is still representational, Crane says, but represents “the power of memory and imagination, stimulated, it may be, and enriched by all sorts of direct impressions from nature, but rather used as words and sentences to express certain harmonies of line, or form, or colour, consciously created, and not necessarily founded upon some motive directly observed in nature.”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> For Crane, art deals in abstract signifiers, forms, and categories rather than signified particulars; it constitutes a utopian language that refers to what could be rather than what is.
	</p>
<p>
	  Despite the negative connotations associated with the idea of “Utopia,” the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> provides a spirited defense of its political use. Although many of its readers would have been conscious of Friedrich Engels’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</span>, published in 1880 and translated into English in 1892, Morris’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> does not hew to Marx and Engels’s anti-utopian line. Engels, living in London at this time, was famously displeased with the British socialist leaders, largely because of their utopian and idealist tendencies. He dubbed Morris “a pure sentimental dreamer” in an 1886 letter, and sarcastically commented in 1887 how “as a poet [he] is above science.” The Socialist League, he said, “has no time to take an interest in the living movement going on under its nose.” He considered Bax, Morris’s close comrade, to be an “armchair philosopher.”<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> George Bernard Shaw, writing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> in June 1886, implied that its readers identified more closely with a utopian socialist tradition—associated in Britain with the legacy of Robert Owen, for example—than a Marxist, scientific one: “one of the disadvantages of being a Socialist is that your friends . . . continually remind you of certain hard facts before which they expect your utopian ideas to wither like roses in the smoke of London.”<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Shaw was a Fabian Socialist, and thus supported socialist participation in electoral politics and advocated reform above revolution, but his contribution nonetheless rebuffs the idea that Utopia is apolitical because it rejects the historical process. Similarly, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> often references Thomas More’s classic sixteenth-century <span style="font-style:italic;">Utopia</span>, as if to provide historical precedent for its own utopian discontinuity with history. The 27 April 1889 issue contains three pertinent More quotations about wealth and poverty and an 1886 article depicts More as a man out of time, noting how “as a social reformer, More was even in advance of our own times.”<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> The formulation was characteristic of Aestheticism too: in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Renaissance</span>, Pater acclaimed artists who seem independent of their historical moment. He cites William Blake as having said, “the ages are all equal, but genius is always above its age;” claims that the “thought of Michelangelo” existed “beyond his time in a world not  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> his own;” and imagines the Renaissance itself as a curiously idealist and ahistorical era, “great rather by what it designed or aspired to do than by what it actually achieved,” and inclusive of Winckelmann, who lived in the eighteenth century.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  In its efforts to depict its pages as a space apart from and historically discontinuous with present-day society, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> created not so much a subculture as an alternative culture based in the print space of the paper. Ann Ardis describes “how the bourgeois public sphere underwent considerable fracturing at the turn of the twentieth century . . . not only because of new developments in the newspaper publishing industry but also through the emergence of a counter-public sphere of British socialism.”<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> While the newspapers Ardis analyzes, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Clarion</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">New Age</span>, represent a more moderate socialism, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> preached a radical, revolutionary vision that called for complete disengagement with contemporary politics and a total transformation of society; such a comprehensive rejection demanded the creation of a new culture. Consequently, the League hosted plays, meetings, lectures, musical entertainments, and variety shows, which successfully drew working-class audiences.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> The paper and events were mutually dependent: the events were advertised and recounted in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>, and music and words for the socialist songs sung at the events regularly appeared in the paper. <a name="3-text" href="#3">re 3</a> depicts a flyer advertising a “‘Commonweal’ Concert,” a night of entertainment including musical presentations and a performance of Morris’s play <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tables Turned, or, Nupkins Awakened</span>, which depicts life after the revolution as a pastoral Utopia. The event instantiates in physical space the utopianism of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> print space. Describing the play’s “vision of an idyllic, agrarian, post-revolutionary society achieved without bloodshed and maintained without malice,” Pamela Bracken Wiens cites an 1881 letter by Morris, who held that “those who want to make art educational must accept the necessity of showing people things decidedly above their daily life.”<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> The letter encapsulates his idea of how an Aesthetic conception of art as a thing above and separate from everyday reality could serve political ends.

<p>
	  Morris left the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> in 1890, when the League’s anarchist contingent took over, and never again took on a print project of this nature. His next paper, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hammersmith Socialist Record</span> (1891–1893), was a four-page, free, monthly newsletter that had a much smaller circulation and humbler aspirations than the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>, serving mainly as a vehicle to announce upcoming lectures at Kelmscott House and to express Morris and Bruce Glasier’s thoughts on current events.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> In December 1890, when H. M. Hyndman asked Morris to write for the Social Democratic Federation’s paper <span style="font-style:italic;">Justice</span>, Morris replied: “I have come to the conclusion that no form of journalism is suited to me” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CL</span>, 3:247). Instead, he went on to establish the Kelmscott Press, a very different kind of print project characterized by pre-industrial methods, handmade materials, and ornate typography and illustration. Although Kelmscott would deeply influence many fine and radical printers that came in its wake, the project was much opposed to the spirit and inclination of the day.

	    Morris died in 1896, and the Kelmscott Press came to an end two years later. Ironically, it was at precisely this time that Monotype was perfected and made commercially viable. . . . If 1890 had already been too late for a major revival of the hand press, the twentieth century seemed about to choke the world with reading matter produced by people with little direct control over the appearance of the end-product. Speed was all.<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>
	  Morris’s late-life venture into “slow publishing” has prompted many critics to question the connection between his politics and his aesthetics. In his 1899 study <span style="font-style:italic;">Theory of the Leisure Class</span>, Thorstein Veblen issued a damning indictment of Kelmscott, calling it a prime example of the “conspicuous waste” that characterizes modern consumption: “these products, since they require hand labour, are more expensive; they are also less convenient for use. . .; they therefore argue ability on the part of the purchaser to consume freely, as well as ability to waste time and effort.” That the Kelmscott books  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> were “edited with the obsolete spelling, printed in black-letter, and bound in limp vellum fitted with thongs” suggested to Veblen a greater concern with the beauty of the autonomous art object than with print’s sociopolitical import.<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> Dowling, too, sees in Kelmscott a “turn to political quietism.”<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> Because of their expense and exclusivity, even critics sympathetic to Morris have not traditionally viewed the Kelmscott books as exemplifying Morris’s political principles. William Peterson’s history of the press notes that the Kelmscott books were “intended to symbolize a protest against the ethos of Victorian industrial capitalism [but] became themselves, in all their opulent splendour, an example of conspicuous consumption” (<span style="font-style:italic;">KP</span>, 275). In his biography of Morris, E. P. Thompson res Kelmscott as a fundamentally apolitical enterprise, “founded in a different spirit from that in which the original Firm had been launched thirty years before. Morris now had no thought of reforming the world through his art” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WM</span>, 583). In short, Kelmscott has been viewed as being more overtly Aesthetic than most of Morris’s socialist <span style="font-style:italic;">oeuvre</span>, and consequently as being less political.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  More recently, however, critics have identified a distinctly modernist political sensibility in Kelmscott’s deliberate attention to materials. Jerome McGann argues that in the Kelmscott books, “the distinction between physical medium and conceptual message breaks down completely,” while in the Kelmscott edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Earthly Paradise</span>, “the effect is to foreground textuality as such, turning words from means to ends-in-themselves. The text is . . . thick with its own materialities. It resists any processing that would simply treat it as a set of referential signs . . . [and] declares its radical self-identity.”<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> This radical self-identity effects an Aesthetic separation between art and reality—with art existing on a plane beyond its referential faculty—but also enacts, as Jeffrey Skoblow puts it, “a rigorously materialist impulse” that is part of “a great Romantic-Marxist continuum” involving “the exploration of objectification, sensory alienation, commodification, and the negative dialectics of resistance.”<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> Kelmscott, then, can be said to unite unexpectedly Morris’s utopian idealism and Marxist materialism.
	</p>
<p>
	  Both the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> and Kelmscott make, in Jameson’s formulation, “a Utopian leap, between our empirical present and the Utopian arrangements of [an] imaginary future” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AF</span>, 147). The <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> focuses on the morning after the revolution, while Kelmscott tries to instantiate a postcapitalist mode of production better suited for the morning after the revolution than for a society steeped in invisible labor and cheap commodities, where “speed is all”. Kelmscott combines this utopian leap, however, with a resolutely materialist insistence on attention to production. In “A Note by William Morris on His Aims in Founding the Kelmscott Press,” Morris describes his efforts to create sustainable products and humane labor conditions at the press, searching diligently to find the perfect handmade paper.<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> The Kelmscott inks, as one U.S. periodical put it at the time, “are the best that money can buy in a country where vicious chemicals are unknown.”<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> Kelmscott workers were unionized and received a living wage, as Peterson describes, though Morris struggled to balance optimal labor conditions with the use of the best materials. Morris could not, of course, truly extricate the press from its capitalist present, but Kelmscott can be viewed as a Utopia based on the premise that the process of production is as politically significant as the product.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> The press attempted to estrange readers from the present day through its highly visible production values, which are simultaneously archaic and futuristic.
	</p>
<p>
	  To better conceptualize the utopian and Aesthetic continuities between the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> and Kelmscott—which are not generally considered to have much in common—I would like to focus on two Kelmscott volumes whose text originally appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>: Morris’s dream vision novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dream of John Ball</span>, and his utopian novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">News from Nowhere</span>. Both were written at the height of his career as a socialist agitator and both curiously express an anti-print or even an anti-textual sensibility. In <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dream of John Ball</span>, the narrator goes back in time, or dreams he goes back in time, to experience firsthand the primarily oral culture of fourteenth-century peasants, and suggests that the oral or verbal forms of “media” that sparked the Peasants’ Revolt were better equipped to channel revolutionary messages than the print media of the nineteenth century. Likewise, <span style="font-style:italic;">News from Nowhere</span> depicts a peaceful, prosperous future society that has undergone a socialist revolution as well as an information revolution, having virtually abandoned print in favor of oral communication. Morris’s utopian idea of print is quite apparent in these formulations: because Utopias are unnecessary <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span> Utopia, and because Morris wants to render print a utopian space, there is no print in these utopian worlds. Moreover, as Jameson has argued, ironic reflexivity is a formal feature of Utopias: “interrogation of the dilemmas involved in their own emergence as utopian texts” functions to remind us of their unreality, to secure their borders as a space apart (<span style="font-style:italic;">AF</span>, 293). Thus when Morris critiques the medium of print within the context of print, ironically deconstructing his own critique in a manner that preres Derrida’s reading of Plato, he reminds us that his Utopias are not attempts to predict the future and are not to be read as “real.” Functioning as a critique of progress, breaking from historical possibility, and destabilizing the future altogether, their very unreality constitutes their revolutionary quality.
	</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">News from Nowhere</span> ran serially in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> from January to October 1890; Chapter 17 ran on the front page of the 24 May 1890 issue, with Crane’s “Solidarity of Labour” cartoon embedded within the text (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>). The cartoon renders the physical text of the novel as a utopian space apart from the political reality of the moment. <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dream of John Ball</span>, which was serialized in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> from November 1886 to January 1887, similarly created a dialogue about utopianism via print context. The 18 December installment, for example, ran alongside the poem “Be Content” by the working-class Leeds poet Tom Maguire. Like <span style="font-style:italic;">John Ball</span>, “Be Content” challenges the idea that the poor must suffer on earth for a reward in heaven: “Said the parson, ‘Be content, / Pay your tithe-dues, pay your rent; / They that earthly things despise / Shall have mansions in the skies.’” The closing stanza reads: “Be content! be content! / Till your dreary life is spent! / Lowly live and lowly die, / All for mansions in the sky. / Castles here are much too rare: / All may have them—in the air.”<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> The poem’s point (made also by Joe Hill in the famous IWW song “The Preacher and the Slave”: “You’ll get pie in the sky when you die—that’s a lie!”) is likewise articulated by John Ball, the excommunicated priest who helped foment the Peasants’ Revolt, in a speech from Morris’s novel: “Forsooth, ye have heard it said that ye shall do well in this world that in the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

Utopias, by contrast, call attention to their unreality to suggest the indeterminacy of the future, not its predictability à la Christian, capitalist, or rigidly Marxist notions of progress.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> editions of <span style="font-style:italic;">News from Nowhere</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dream of John Ball</span> create a utopian print context for Morris’s work via the resources conventionally available to periodicals: juxtaposition, textual variety, layout, and design. Still, these editions depend problematically upon industrial forms of literary production such as the serialized novel—a nineteenth-century print genre formally suited to capitalist ideology, as Linda Hughes and Michael Lund argue—and mass print to provoke a changed consciousness <span style="font-style:italic;">against</span> industrial capitalism.<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> had a small and countercultural readership, but relied on the template of mass mediation. In transferring his labors from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> to Kelmscott, Morris focused his attention more precisely on questions of mediation and production, which made his print works more expensive and less accessible; yet as Crane argued in his defense, “the cheapness of the cheapest things of modern manufacture is generally at the cost of the cheapening of human labour and life, which is a costly kind of cheapness after all.”<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  As a utopian thinker, Morris never strictly adhered to a Marxist notion of history, though he did believe a revolution was coming; with Kelmscott, he skipped over historical process altogether to make books “in the future already.” Some of the titles produced by the Press suggest its underlying utopian vision: a Kelmscott edition of More’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Utopia</span> was published in 1893, and Morris even began designing a map of Utopia for it, though the book was published eventually without it (<span style="font-style:italic;">KP</span>, 154). The Kelmscott editions of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dream of John Ball</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">News from Nowhere</span> , unlike the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> editions, take a production-based approach to utopian print: the book becomes an end in itself rather than a means, embodying in the present a future disruption of industrial progress. Kelmscott’s <span style="font-style:italic;">News from Nowhere</span>, for example, simultaneously insists upon its own material presence while reminding us of its artifice. The rigorous literalism of the caption found on the volume’s frontispiece (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>) forces the reader to pay attention to the object at hand: “<span style="font-style:italic;"><small class="caps">this is the picture of the old house by the thames to which the people of this story went. hereafter follows the book itself which is called news from nowhere or an epoch of rest &amp; is written by william morris</small></span>.” The caption calls attention to the picture and text as representations even as it uses the present tense to reinforce the immediacy and concreteness of “<span style="font-style:italic;"><small class="caps">the picture</small></span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic;"><small class="caps">the book itself</small></span>,” which become artifacts from the future. C. M. Gere’s illustration of Kelmscott Manor that accompanies this caption visually echoes this literalism, since the perspective seems to invite readers to walk right into the house.<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a> Matthew Beaumont argues persuasively that <span style="font-style:italic;">News from Nowhere</span> engages “the perceptual problem of the present,” which is “at some level the result of the reifying effects of commodity culture under capitalism,” and “depicts a world wherein the present is finally present to itself.”<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> While Beaumont does not address the print context of <span style="font-style:italic;">News</span>, Morris’s attempt to simulate the presence of the future is all the more obvious in the Kelmscott frontispiece, which reminds us of its alterity in order to highlight our own alienation from the present it depicts.
	</p>
<p>
	  Similarly, the frontispiece of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dream of John Ball</span> challenges the reader to consider the labor at the heart of all production by calling attention to its own materiality (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>). This image, drawn by the Pre-Raphaelite artist Edward Burne-Jones, takes a famous catch phrase of John Ball as its caption: “When Adam delved and Eve span, who was  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	  then the gentleman.” In a manner quite uncharacteristic of Aestheticism, the words and picture denaturalize leisure rather than obfuscate labor; as Ruth Livesey suggests is true of much socialist art of the period, however, the image also renders the “masculine laboring body” as “an aesthetic site,” a maneuver that links Morris’s socialist aesthetics with homoerotic Aestheticism.<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> Burne-Jones originally composed this illustration for the first book edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Dream of John Ball</span> in 1888, and revised it for the Kelmscott edition, which was the first Kelmscott book to include wood-block illustrations. <a name="6-text" href="#6">re 6</a> provides a side-by-side comparison of the two frontispieces: one is a photogravure illustration and the other a wood-block print, just one of the key differences that reveals a great deal about Kelmscott’s aesthetic project, since wood-block engraving had become obsolete “almost overnight” with the onset of photographic means of reproducing images in the 1880s.<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a> The Kelmscott image uses capital letters and sharper, cleaner lines to insist on its material presence, even as it depicts a prelapsarian scene wholly detached from history. Its perspective is deep while the first image is flat. It calls attention to bodies and embodiment, with, for example, its detailed delineation of Adam’s muscles. The leafy border framing the image functions to integrate the work of art into organic nature, yet also demarcates the artificiality of the image by cordoning  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> it off. Such frames and borders, exemplified in the picture from <span style="font-style:italic;">News</span> as well as <span style="font-style:italic;">John Ball</span>, were characteristic of all the Kelmscott books, and are a feature of their utopian form: they signify that the image is not continuous with phenomenal reality, but exists in a separate space and chronology.

	  I have been arguing here for an analogy: that is, that Morris’s print ventures, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> and the Kelmscott Press, construct themselves in relation to mainstream print in the same way that Utopia constructs itself in relation to present-day reality. This formal division also replicates Aesthetic notions of art and realism, indicating that Aestheticism, utopianism, and Morris’s print work share a conception of the relationship between aesthetics and politics. Morris was not in all ways Aesthetic, and his place within conventional Aestheticism is complex. In <span style="font-style:italic;">News from Nowhere</span>, he made a great many digs at contemporary art and literature, and while some of these were aligned with Aesthetic critique—his argument about the worthlessness of realism at the end of Chapter 16, for example—others targeted Aestheticism itself, as when he calls Oxford and Cambridge “the breeding places of a peculiar class of parasites, who called themselves cultivated people . . . but they affected an exaggeration of cynicism in order that they might be thought knowing and worldly-wise. . . . They were laughed at, despised—and paid. Which last was what they aimed at.”<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">News from Nowhere</span> also, however, invokes Aestheticism and idealism in its opposition to late-Victorian naturalism; in the context of naturalist novels such as George Gissing’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nether World</span> , which took on the issue of class division with such an utterly deterministic and empirical perspective as to present it as an insoluble problem, we see how Aestheticism might provide Morris  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> with a contrasting model for addressing social inequities by detaching from them altogether. As Ernst Bloch writes, a “narrow-minded empiricism is just as dubious as the immaturity (the fanaticism) of the underdeveloped utopian function.”<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  What, in the end, was the political effect of William Morris’s utopian detachment? Does the case of Morris offer political justification for Aestheticism’s insistence on a division between Art and Reality? Does it recuperate the political potential of nineteenth-century idealism? Or does it suggest the limits of Morris’s political and artistic imagination and his inability to develop beyond the Aestheticism of his Pre-Raphaelite pubescence? I would suggest, finally, that comparing the utopianism of Morris’s print to the utopianism of Aestheticism reveals the significant late-nineteenth-century tension between revolutionary and reformist politics that informs them both. Likewise, such a comparison demonstrates Aestheticism’s engagement with a peculiarly utopian strain of British socialism. Utopianism shares with Morris’s print work and with Aestheticism a revolutionary impulse to create a new social system whole cloth, skipping over process, eschewing piecemeal reform, and calling into question progressive models of history. To ask whether Morris’s utopian print was politically useful is to ask whether the Socialist League should have compromised on trade unionism and elections; to ask whether the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> and Kelmscott should have produced less Aesthetic art is to ask whether the methods of the Fabians were superior to those of the Socialist League (and the much-discussed artistic differences between Shaw and Wilde and between Shaw and Morris would be relevant here). Viewing Morris as an Aesthete reframes the debate over Aestheticism’s politics in terms of a broader debate over revolution, reform, and Utopia.
	</p>
<p>
	  Arscott argues that “Morris’s art theory after 1883 only really concerns the role of art in socialist society; he can merely consider its adumbration in the capitalist era.”<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a> His theory of print is analogous: because engaged print seems impossible under capitalism, and because print seems to go hand-in-glove with capitalism in its history and its future, Morris actively creates a marginalized print Utopia—print forms that situate themselves outside of the historical present and outside the calcified status quo of the press and the book trade. These print projects, like the art object within Aesthetic theory, present an image of social and political otherness at a moment when capitalism seems immovable and print seems incapable of saying otherwise.

	      Morris and Aestheticism retained elements of idealism in a utopian form. Aestheticism was neither strictly idealist nor strictly materialist, but its tendency to imagine art as another and better  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> world (a utopian world) was common to Pater, Wilde, Ruskin, and Morris. In an analysis of Wilde’s Oxford notebooks, Philip E. Smith and Michael S. Helfand argue that as a student in the 1870s, Wilde divided his loyalties between Ruskin’s idealism  and Pater’s materialism , ultimately finding “in Hegelian philosophy a variety of idealism better suited … to incorporate the materialist assumptions and findings of science” (viii). Smith and Helfand’s account of Pater’s “utilitarian argument for aesthetic hedonism”  ignores, however, the utopian idealism that remains central to his aesthetic theory (Smith and Helfand, <span style="font-style:italic;">Oscar Wilde’s Oxford Notebooks: A Portrait of a Mind in the Making</span> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), viii). In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Renaissance</span>, for example, Pater describes the artistic period under analysis as “that movement in which, in various ways, the human mind wins for itself a new kingdom of feeling and sensation and thought, not opposed to but only beyond and independent of the spiritual system then actually realized” (Pater, <span style="font-style:italic;">Renaissance</span>, 6).

	    “Society of the Future” is an obvious example.

In “How We Live and How We Might Live,” Morris says that all humans should enjoy surroundings “pleasant, generous, and beautiful; that I know is a large claim, but this I will say about it, that if it cannot be satisfied, if every civilized community cannot provide such surroundings for all its members, I do not want the world to go on; it is a mere misery that man has ever existed” (Morris, “How We Live and How We Might Live,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span> (4–11 June 1887), repr. in Morris, <span style="font-style:italic;">Political</span>, 153).

	      Evangelical reformers were somewhere in the middle, tending to advocate literacy and print for the masses, but only of the “healthy” censored sort. I am not concerned with these reformers for the purposes of this essay, since I see Morris as emerging from a separate strain of left-wing social protest characterized by radicalism, Chartism, secularism, and (later) Marxism—a strain that had traditionally advocated unrestrained, plentiful print.

	    At the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>’s semi-annual conference in January 1886, H. Halliday Sparling (Morris’s son-in-law-to-be, who helped edit the paper), reported that in its first year the average issue sold about 3,500 copies, cost about £15 to produce, brought in about £7 in receipts, and had a debt of about £4. Socialist League Archive, International Institute for Social History, Folder 15. After its first year, the paper became a weekly rather than a monthly, and its circulation dropped accordingly. In a July 1887 letter, Morris wrote, “with the present circulation of say about 2800 we are losing £4 per week” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Letters</span> 2:679). In March 1889, he remarked that circulation was “going up, but too slowly”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> (3:42) and, in December 1889, that “sale of the paper has fallen off” (3:132).

	    The paper’s distribution was mainly through subscription and a small number of sympathetic dealers, and delivery to these dealers was by voluntary labor: an 1885 “Report of the Paper Selling Committee” stressed that “every member of the Council ought to make it his duty to serve at least 3 or 4 shops in the vicinity of his dwelling or workshop. . . .

	      The Leaguers perhaps misjudged the extent to which the Commune could be called upon to signify a timeless, placeless ideal, which suggests the danger of using the historical particular to represent the utopian. In a 26 September 1885 letter, George King, a Socialist League member from Dublin, wrote of a fundamentally different conception of the Commune among Irish workers: “fancy a lecturer . . . here saying a word in favour of the Paris Commune. . . . The one fact that the average Dublin working man knows about the Commune is that during the struggle the Archbishop of Paris was shot and he holds all communists guilty of the murder of an Archbishop.” Socialist League Archive, International Institute for Social History, Folder 1877. Indeed, the extent to which even English workers would have taken a positive view of the Commune is unclear, given the visceral reaction against the event that Matthew Beaumont has described. Beaumont’s article also suggests, however, that the Commune had already been red in British discourse as a utopian event that “ruptured the bourgeois faith in progress,” which suggests the aptness of Crane’s image for the particular context of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>. Beaumont, “Cacotopianism, the Paris Commune, and England’s Anti-Communist Imaginary, 1870–1900,” <span style="font-style:italic;">ELH</span>, 73 : 467.

	    In their use of abstracted female res, Crane’s cartoons exemplify the lingering idealist tradition within the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>’s utopianism. As Moi describes, idealist aesthetics required the artwork to transcend the carnal, the animal, and the sexual; thus “poetry and painting need to idealize [women] far more intensively than they do men” and “the re of the <span style="font-style:italic;">pure woman</span>” became “an icon of idealist aesthetics.” Moi, <span style="font-style:italic;">Henrik</span>, 80. Crane’s cartoons rely upon an idealist conception of art’s relation to politics, but also reproduce the gender ideology embedded in this discourse.

<div id="body">
<p>Raymond Williams tells a story about F. R. Leavis from their years teaching together at Cambridge. At a meeting in 1961 to consider a new course on the novel, Williams recalls that "There was one major argument . . . The crux was whether the paper should be the English novel, or the novel in general. [Leavis] wanted the English novel only. A majority were against him."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> After Leavis rejects the inclusion of European novels, in part because of the difficulties of translation, a committee member poses a further question: "'Then what about American novelists? Faulkner, for example'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LRI</span>, 117). Williams notes,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>At this point I have to hold onto my seat. I have the clearest memory of what was said next, and of the mood in which it was said: one of fierce pleasure in the argument but also of surprising conviction. "Faulkner!" Leavis said. "When the Americans moved in on Europe after the War, they had to have a great novelist. That's who they chose, Faulkner." Nobody knew, at the time, what to say after that.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LRI</span>, 117)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This is more than an opinionated dismissal of a major American writer. Rather, Williams's anecdote highlights the anti-Americanism that Leavis demonstrated from his earliest published work. While such sentiments might seem to participate in general anxieties about American cultural hegemony during the Cold War, Leavis's anxieties can be traced back in time to the interwar years.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Moreover, rather than a decorative flourish layered upon deeper insecurities, this reaction to America resides at the heart of Leavis's theories of literature and culture.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Although Leavis's critics have largely overlooked his abundant references to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  America, Leavis relies on the example of America, and upon transatlantic comparison, as a <span style="font-style:italic;">method</span> in his cultural analyses.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> He wields the term "Americanisation"—a rough synonym for standardization—in ways that reveal the national subtext of the "mass civilisation" that Leavis understands to menace interwar England. Leavis's position as the self-appointed guardian of Englishness, an image that persists in critical treatments of his work and legacy, is made possible by the transatlantic connections and reactions underlying his nationalist projects. While Leavis is remembered as guardian of the high, the elite, and the English, I will contend that these discourses are importantly produced by the twin processes of Americanization and transatlantic comparison.</p>
<p>It is telling that Leavis situates the American canonization of Faulkner within a European context. Leavis's image of the Americans "moving in" on Europe has a history in his writing, as well as in European thought, dating back to the period after the First World War. Indeed, his seemingly stark reaction takes part in a broader European dialogue about the transatlantic encroachment of the United States. While some in Europe perceived America as a beneficial new source of commodified pleasures such as jazz records, Hollywood films, and Ford motor cars, others saw these same commodities as a threat to European values and traditions.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Leavis shares this sense of threat, yet his attitudes are particularly revealing in their differences from those circulating in Europe.</p>
<p>Two prominent critics exemplify major, distinct styles of European reaction to the idea of Americanization between the wars: the Frankfurt School theorist, Theodor Adorno, and the French social commentator, André Siegfried. Adorno, who has often been seen as an "anti-American intellectual elitist," despite his long-time residence in the United States, famously lambasted both jazz and the popular cinema as symptoms of what he and Max Horkheimer called the "culture industry."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Like Leavis, Adorno lamented the corruption of the arts into bland fare aimed at the capitalist "consumer."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Yet whereas Adorno emphasized the value of the arts in both Europe and the United States, Leavis turned decisively to Englishness as the antidote to what he saw as a growing cultural malaise. Adorno's concern was for the fate of the arts themselves; Leavis's was for the fate of the arts <span style="font-style:italic;">in the service</span> of a nation.</p>
<p>Leavis thus shared much in common with European nationalists such as Siegfried whose interests were based more in politics than aesthetics. Siegfried's widely-reprinted and translated works, including <span style="font-style:italic;">America Comes of Age</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Europe's Crisis</span> , played on circulating fears that the United States might supplant Europe in worldwide stature and influence. In prophetic terms, Siegfried records the transition to American ascendancy: "To America the advent of the new order is a cause for pride, but to Europe it brings heart-burnings and regrets for a state of society that is doomed to disappear."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Siegfried's "heart-burnings and regrets" reflect a belief that the economic strength of the United States, often emblematized in the re of Henry Ford, was setting the stage for the destruction of Europe's cherished values and traditions. Leavis details similar anxieties in the 1930s. Yet where Siegfried chronicles the inevitable spread of the American "new order" throughout Europe, Leavis turned to literary and cultural education to prevent its spread throughout Britain. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>At the time of Leavis's most energetic cultural criticism, anti-American fears were so profuse that they sparked a range of responses, sometimes from surprising quarters. For instance, the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci lamented the "anti-Americanism . . . of the European petty bourgeois" and wondered if Henry Ford's methods might be turned to socialist ends.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Ford's potential for socialism was taken with even greater seriousness in parts of the new Soviet Union, where workers had begun to celebrate Ford and occasionally to name their children after him.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Leavis, who consistently attempted to distance himself from both socialists and the bourgeoisie, did not share any hope for Ford's revolutionary potential. For Leavis, the primary ideology in need of adherence was Englishness.</p>
<p>In Leavis's conception, England was distinct from Europe in its particular vulnerability to the mass culture—from the talking films to the gramophone recordings—of the newly-powerful nation with which it happened to share a language. Leavis's project sets him apart from prominent European intellectuals not only in its fierce, English nationalism but also in its specific turn to education for protection against the impending tide of U.S.-based styles of labor and leisure. Indeed, Leavis's tremendous influence upon the formation of the modern discipline of English studies emerged in part through his analysis of modernization and especially Americanization. Leavis's feelings about America are thus not ancillary to the story of his development of English studies. Rather, they are at the heart of his particular project of developing English studies for the English, a project whose ramifications can still be felt in English departments around the world today.</p>
<p>Before turning to Leavis's work, it is worth noting that a further implication of Leavis's rejection of Faulkner follows from its curious anecdotal recovery by Raymond Williams. As the re in British cultural studies most often placed in opposition to Leavis, Williams actively worked against Leavis's high cultural ideologies, yet he has acknowledged the enormous influence of Leavis's pedagogical aims and methods. While Leavis has been variously called a "genius" and "the single most influential re in twentieth-century English literary criticism," he has also been accused of "damaging arrogance and skepticism" and dismissed tongue-in-cheek as a "curmudgeon."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Leavis, in short, holds a highly contested yet undeniable place in the history of cultural studies, modernism, and the development of English as a discipline. In turning to his pedagogical writings, it becomes clear that Leavis's influential role in the development of English as a discipline follows from his desire to design a field of study that would save England from Americanization. Leavis's anti-Americanism has also had striking consequences for cultural studies in its influence upon Richard Hoggart's landmark 1957 text, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Uses of Literacy</span>. Leavis, it becomes clear, is not only quick to use American culture as a name for the modernization of England, but actually relies upon the example of America, as threat or prophecy, in his reactionary invention of Englishness and his attempts to teach it to the nation. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Threat of Americanization</h1>
<p>From his earliest publication, a pamphlet entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Mass Civilisation and Minority Culture</span> , later collected in <span style="font-style:italic;">For Continuity</span> , Leavis presents literature and society as mutually constitutive, leading him to make the claim, in all earnestness, that only literary criticism can save modern England.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Part Arnoldian lament, part Spenglerian paean to decline, Leavis's pamphlet announces the need for an educated elite, or a "minority," who can analyze literature fiercely enough to rescue England from popular fiction, advertising, and the burgeoning hegemony of Hollywood. In the pamphlet, Leavis draws his primary example of standardization and machine culture from "a remarkable work of anthropology," the 1929 <span style="font-style:italic;">Middletown</span>.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Yet the natives in <span style="font-style:italic;">Middletown</span> are not English but American.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> As Leavis defends his choice,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>To this someone will reply that Middletown is America and not England. And it is true that in America change has been more rapid, and its effects have been intensified by the fusion of peoples. But the same processes are at work in England and the western world generally, and at an acceleration.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 17)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here America is exemplary in the material sense: it is the embodiment of the modernization and progress that has also begun to transform England. Leavis thus presents the anthropological investigation of America as a prophetic glimpse into England's future. Yet it is a future which appropriate attention to America can forestall. Leavis explains, "It is a commonplace that we are being Americanised, but again a commonplace that seems, as a rule, to carry little understanding with it. Americanisation is often spoken of as if it were something of which the United States is guilty" , when in fact, it is that which British proponents of standardization and progress are likely to hasten. Leavis returns to <span style="font-style:italic;">Middletown</span> as a touchstone throughout his early writings; in <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span> , co-written with his former student Denys Thompson, he succinctly labels it "an account of the process of dissolution."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> At the same time, he juxtaposes <span style="font-style:italic;">Middletown</span> against one of his other key texts, George Sturt's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wheel-wright's Shop</span> , which Leavis wistfully analyzes as a tribute to the lost Englishness of the artisan's village.</p>
<p>It is appropriate that <span style="font-style:italic;">Middletown</span> should be held up against <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wheelwright's Shop</span>, because as Leavis makes clear in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mass Civilisation</span>, part of what marks the dissolution of middle America is the arrival of the automobile. In strong terms, Leavis recounts, "we see in detail how the automobile (to take one instance) has, in a few years, radically affected religion, broken up the family, and revolutionised social custom" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 16). The problem of the automobile reappears emblematically at the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mass Civilisation</span> in a discussion of Henry Ford. Ford's matter-of-fact discussion of a future world ruled by machines—"Shall we not some day reach a point where the machine becomes all powerful, and the man of no consequence"—concludes that one "need not bother" about the future (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 46).<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> In defense, Leavis intones his hope "that what we value most matters too much to the race to be finally abandoned and that the machine will yet be made a tool" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 46). His rejection of Fordist philosophy, as well as what he <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  calls "the official Ford legend," does not lead Leavis, like so many writers in the thir ties, to embrace communism. Rather, in a striking ideological conflation, he explains that the paths of both Marx and Ford lead to the machine, and disavows any need to choose between them.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In his tributes to Englishness, Leavis turns time and again to what he proposes as its opposite: the modernization and progress that can be seen most clearly in America. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span>, Leavis draws the example of America directly into his pedagogy. Unlike in his previous work, Leavis conceived <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span> as a text for teachers of high school and grammar school. Yet rather than detailing classroom methods, this work revisits a number of Leavis's chief cultural concerns, especially standardization and mass culture. <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span> explicitly presents "a literary education" as the "substitute" for all that has been lost: the English "folksongs, folk-dances, Cotswold cottages and handicraft products" that symbolize "the organic community with the living culture it embodied" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 1). What threatens the younger generation is not that they will lose their connection to the organic past of English Cotswold cottages—for such a thing is already gone—but rather that they will forget to be properly nostalgic for it. The most direct way to inculcate them with Englishness is to help them define themselves against the worst, and thereby most modern, traits of the Americans. Leavis's attempts to educate via the exercises in <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span> reveal his rative reliance upon America even more clearly than <span style="font-style:italic;">Mass Civilisation</span>. It is an oft-told tale in colonial studies that Thomas Macaulay's 1835 proposal for civil servant examinations attempted to produce British subjects through literary study.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Yet while Macaulay turned directly to English literature, Leavis would train British school children into Englishness via the negative example of America. The study of literature is Leavis's life work, but his project of cultural preservation depends on the pedagogical value of America as an example.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span> thus does not dwell on literature but rather proffers a negative analysis of what Leavis calls civilization. To this end, it is divided into short analytic sections with titles such as "Advertising," "Levelling-down," and "The Use of Leisure." At the end of the work, in perhaps its most curious portion, Leavis and Thompson offer a series of exercises for use in the classroom. The genre of the school exercise is ideal for Leavis's purposes because it provides a vehicle for Leavis to reach and thereby to rescue the masses. Quite strikingly, these exercises do not tend to ask students to read or analyze literature; rather, they focus on modern and often explicitly American culture. The exercises themselves are for the most part extraordinarily over-determined, with only one suitable kind of response. For instance, Leavis asks students to compare "the 'Blues'" played on the radio with "complicated Elizabethan part-songs" sung in "educated homes" after supper (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 126–27), encouraging them to choose English music in the drawing room over debased American jazz on the wireless. Another exercise presents the Americans themselves for study: "'In fifteen years the American people have changed from essentially a home people to an automobile and movie people.' What other changes have accompanied that described here?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 127). As the ethnographic subjects most suited to Leavis's purposes, the "American <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  people" enter the exercise as a group familiar enough to consider and yet foreign enough to contrast to the English. Leavis's purpose rests on his dual conviction that English schoolchildren will generate a list of the changes wrought in the lives of modernizing Americans while viewing the Americans objectively, as if from a great distance, and thereby consolidate their Englishness.</p>
<p>Another exercise invokes the American ethnographic subject in even more telling terms. Leavis quotes from a 1928 travel narrative: "In spite of cars and radios the American peasant is still unbelievably in the backwoods; all his reading and writing and listening-in does not make him a whit more mentally up-to-date than the illiterate Spaniard, and leaves him far behind the country Frenchman."<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Asking the student to consider "what reflections on the nature of education are suggested by this extract" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 143), Leavis seems to hope that the student will be savvy enough to follow the implied argument that cars and radios do not lead the American peasant toward mental advancement. Curiously, the identification of the American worker as a "peasant" harbors connotations of the European class system, suggesting the extent to which the passage wishes to underscore a reversal: the American, commonly imagined to be up-to-date, is here a backwoods peasant, defined by the very vocabulary of feudalism. Indeed, as Leavis consistently demonstrates, technological progress and modernization are precisely what render the American culturally backwards and easily superseded by the "country Frenchman."</p>
<p>Not only Leavis but also his collaborators place considerable emphasis upon the Americanization of England. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny</span>, Denys Thompson makes the observation that "If England is less Americanized than America, it is in the discreditable sense that less resistance to the advance of civilization has been developed."<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Thompson notes that England, ironically, is more vulnerable to Americanization than America itself, because its cultural elite has not become alarmed enough to mount a proper defense against such signs of civilization as advertising and Hollywood films. Speaking to an English audience, Thompson casts doubt upon "anyone who believes that this country is putting up a sturdy resistance to 'Americanization.'"<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> For Leavis, as well as for followers like Thompson, Americanization is the type of thing that can happen to England, because it is not tied to place, but to practices, modalities, and ways of being. Indeed, Leavis occasionally implies, not only England but also America itself might be saved from Americanization. Americanization thus cannot exactly be a process of national hegemony, nor can it be understood as the overlay of one culture upon another. Rather, Americanization, for Leavis, has become a special, exemplary name for modernization, one that is more concrete in that it harbors an example or referent to its process in its very name.</p>
<p>Thus although Leavis uses Americanization to mean modernization, the term retains the residue of its nationalist import. So the question urges itself again: if Leavis means standardization, why would he ever need the term Americanization? And if Leavis's utmost concern is with the fate of English culture, why the constant references to the United States? One answer is that Leavis has sensed, long before the Cold War debates about American hegemony and English decline, that definitions of modern English <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  culture depend upon understandings of American culture. Throughout his early work, Leavis reveals his investment in tracing how utterly transatlantic English culture threatens to become. As he implies via the exercises in <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span>, jazz on the radio has supplanted part-songs in the drawing room. The folk culture that Leavis cherishes, replete with all its homemade and quintessentially English signifiers—and English precisely because they are homemade, made-at-home, of the land itself—is now transformed into a mass culture that is marked not only by mechanization and mass dissemination but also by extra-national sources and flows. The idea of America helps to produce the idea of English culture for Leavis because the idea of America is that which must be negated—literally driven out of England—for English culture to survive.</p>
<p>Leavis's rhetorical assimilation of America into his definitions of Englishness has considerable implications for his presentation of class. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Society</span>, Raymond Williams is at pains to complicate charges of Leavis's elitism, stressing Leavis's position outside the class structure of university dons and highbrow literati. Leavis's middle-class upbringing in the town of Cambridge—his father ran a bicycle shop—puts him at odds with both Bloomsbury, which he openly denounced in his writing, as well as with the established faculty at Cambridge, where he was never truly institutionally supported. Williams applauds Leavis for attacking "the domination of the world of English by a small interlocking group" and for reducing "to its proper impotence the ordinary conception of a superior minority which happens to coincide with a particular social class" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CS</span>, 262). Yet attention to Leavis's invocations of America suggests that he marked class in England, that most important of categories to British cultural studies, in important and sometimes unnoticed ways by a transatlantic sense of national difference. That is to say, there is a way in which, strange as it may seem, Leavis's lament was that the working classes of England had given up their Cotswold cottages and village crafts and <span style="font-style:italic;">become American</span>. Interestingly enough, the designations American and English seem curiously mobile: T. S. Eliot, American by birth despite his British citizenship and ambiguous accent in the thirties, promotes Englishness while the English working classes, with their tastes in popular fiction and in cinema, seem to undermine it.</p>
<p>Leavis's particular style of distinction between Americans and Americanization is part of what permits him to assert confidently in his influential work, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Great Tradition</span> , "The great <span style="font-style:italic;">English</span> novelists are Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, and Joseph Conrad."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Of course, two of these four are not English by birth, though both James and Conrad were to an important degree anglicized.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> It has frequently been noted that two of the four are women, casting Leavis's introduction to the novel as the recuperation of a literary genre that had been taken less seriously in part because of its association with the feminine.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Yet it is also worth considering the two who are not English-born. While Leavis may have had his reservations about Faulkner, one of the small handful of high American modernists who was not for any length of time expatriate, he was quite happy to bring James into the fold. The easy inclusion of Conrad and James suggests again that it is not nationality as such but the mass cultural assault upon Englishness that Leavis would resist. Thus Leavis does not hesitate to recruit American modernists who represent high culture for the resistance to Americanization. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>For instance, Leavis was particularly devoted to Eliot's work early in the thirties, referring to Eliot as an "originator" among imitators in the late twenties and ultimately drawing on his criticism as well as his poetry.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Yet Leavis's admiration for Eliot was not always mutual. Leavis sent an early version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mass Civilisation and Minority Culture</span> to Eliot for publication in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criterion</span>. After sending Eliot a copy with requested corrections, Leavis was to receive no reply in return. <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny</span> was soon founded, and Leavis ended up publishing his pamphlet in four sections therein.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> While he never abandoned his appreciation for Eliot, Leavis would turn his attention more fully to Lawrence, who held the kind of nostalgia for pre-industrial working-class Englishness that Leavis most admired. At one point, Leavis makes the claim that Lawrence has identified "the major, the inclusive problem of our time" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 138). To illustrate Lawrence's perspicacity, Leavis quotes from <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span>, in which Lawrence notes "a gap in the continuity of consciousness almost American, but industrial really" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 138). In his analysis of this particular quote, Leavis insists that "'industrialism' is only a subheading of the problem," which can be understood better by turning to the regional and national comparisons of Spengler's <span style="font-style:italic;">Decline of the West</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>,138). While it does not account for Lawrence's canonization alongside the more experimental modernists like Eliot and Joyce, Leavis's fascination with Lawrence certainly aided Lawrence's literary reputation. Lawrence's feel for the English landscape and the horrors of industry ultimately allowed him to serve as the literary voice of Leavis's deepest concerns.</p>
<p>Not only did Leavis discuss writers now considered high modernists in his critical evaluations, but he also took on the issues that would come to define modernist poetics and prose. In "Joyce and 'The Revolution of the Word,'" a 1933 essay collected in <span style="font-style:italic;">For Continuity</span>, Leavis discusses the <span style="font-style:italic;">Work in Progress</span> that was to become <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span> with more than a few reservations. Chief among Leavis's laments is Joyce's free and neologistic play with the English language. To those who would support Joyce's rampant experimentalism, summarized by Eugène Jolas as Joyce's "right to audaciously split the infinitive," Leavis responds with tried patience: "as if any amount of splitting infinitives, mimicking the Master, pondering Gertrude Stein and E.E. Cummings and connoisseuring American slang, could revivify the English language."<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> In Joyce's hands, it seems, the English language has become insufficiently English. Yet rather than accusing him of Irishness, Leavis lights upon American poets, Stein and cummings, and American slang as the chief emblems of the Joycean assault on English. Leavis insists that the trouble with Joyce's work is that it is utterly international in scope, "a multi-directional flux" which compares unfavorably to Shakespeare's Englishness (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 213). For Leavis in this moment, Shakespeare's Englishness emerges out of nothing less than Shakespeare's pliant use of an English language that was rich enough, in the time of the Renaissance, to enable Shakespeare to be possible. Shakespeare and the English language are thus mutually constitutive, each one enhancing and creating the other. Joyce, on the other hand, takes up neologistic word play and "American slang," thus betraying the English language through his attempts to exceed it. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Leavis and the Making of English Studies</h1>
<p>Although Leavis wrote copiously on the modernists, his solution to society's ills did not emerge directly from critical discussions of the writers or works themselves, but rather grew out of his plan for education. Specifically, Leavis championed the study of the English literary tradition through the development of English as a discipline in the university. Early in his career, Leavis began to link the need for educational reform with the development of literary study. In a 1932 essay, "The Literary Mind," Leavis notes, "To revive or replace a decayed tradition is a desperate undertaking . . . something in the nature of luck is needed; the luck, let us say, that provides a centre of stimulus and a focus of energy at some university. All that falls under the head of 'English'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 65). It is quite striking to note the faith that Leavis invests in the university in general and English in particular to put a halt to the decay of tradition. Because Leavis understood English to be the university discipline that would prepare teachers for the nation's schools—and Leavis did in fact inspire a number of university youths to become schoolteachers—he imagined English to have the potential to effect change throughout the culture on a massive scale.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Commenting on Leavis's influence on the development of English studies' uniquely grand ambitions, Perry Anderson notes: "Leavis commanded his subject, within his own generation. With him, English literary criticism conceived the ambition to become the vaulting centre of 'humane studies and of the university.' English was 'the chief of the humanities.' This claim was unique to England: no other country has ever produced a critical discipline with these pretensions."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Anderson's sweeping claim for the grand, humanist pretensions of English studies reflects Leavis's utter confidence in the potential of English studies to transform the nation as a whole. While Anderson may exaggerate the uniqueness of the development of literary study in England, overlooking the importance of literary education in the British colonies and elsewhere, it is nonetheless the case that interwar England was primed for an intervention into national education in such a way as to make Leavis's ambitions possible.</p>
<p>In order to contextualize Leavis's radical pedagogical aims—and his desire to inculcate Englishness through literary study—it is necessary to consider the unusual educational climate in England after World War One. In 1918, Prime Minister Lloyd George gave a rousing speech at Manchester in which he pronounced that "an educated man is a better worker, a more formidable warrior, and a better citizen. That was only half-comprehended before the war."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Lloyd George's speech reflected, in potent fashion, the pervasive sentiment in the culture that part of England's inadequacies could be seen by a comparison of German and English education. What is most interesting about Lloyd George's speech, however, is the extent to which his cry for "a more formidable warrior" led to the reform of English studies in the schools and the reinvention of literary education. At the time, humanist sentiment fostered the belief that the task of educating children in English literature would produce not only better citizens but also better soldiers. If Lloyd George's exhortation seems like little more than bluff political rhetoric, then it is worth noting the vim with which its precepts were followed in <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the next few years. On the same platform at Manchester, H.A.L. Fisher, the president of the Board of Education, emphasized the extent to which educational reform was centrally about class. Lamenting in political catchphrase that "the rich learn and the poor earn," Fisher called for a set of reforms which could counter the class divisions in an increasingly mechanized society .<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> While investigations of all subjects were carried out, the two reports on the teaching of English, George Sampson's 1921 <span style="font-style:italic;">English for the English</span> and the 1922 <span style="font-style:italic;">The Teaching of English in England</span>, generally known as the Newbolt Report, were among the most influential and enduring. For these were the reports that made a case for a new and humanizing approach to English, one that could renew the spirit of nationalism in England as well as restructure the nation.</p>
<p>Of the two reports, Sampson's is the more readable, if the less practicable. Above all, it is an exhortation to reform English education in the schools. Denys Thompson notes in a later preface to Sampson's book that English in the schools, before the two reports, was "a somewhat dull and mechanical affair" that treated mostly grammar and composition, with the occasional recitation of poetry.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Sampson makes his case for the inadequacy of such educational methods by presenting the cultural situation as one of mechanization: "Modern mass-production does not require educated workers . . . the lift-man would work his switch no worse if he were quite illiterate and no better if he were a doctor of science."<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Education, according to Sampson, is misunderstood as preparation for the workplace. In an oft-quoted phrase, Sampson avers that "it is the purpose of education, not to prepare children <span style="font-style:italic;">for</span> their occupations, but to prepare children <span style="font-style:italic;">against</span> their occupations" (<span style="font-style:italic;">EE</span>, 27). Therefore, to return to the worker, "it is not as a lift-man that he is worth educating, but as a man. If the nation exclaims, 'What! All this education, and he only a lift-man!' it is uttering wickedness and stupidity: if the lift-man exclaims, 'What! All this education, and me only a lift-man!" he is uttering wickedness and doubtful grammar" (<span style="font-style:italic;">EE</span>, 24). Sampson's argument here tellingly gives the nation the ability to protect the worker through its attitude toward education. Sampson further insists that "English is by far the most important subject in elementary schools" (<span style="font-style:italic;">EE</span>, 34), themselves the most important for their ability to reach the greatest number. According to Sampson, the purpose of instruction in English is not to inculcate youth with grammatical rules but rather to transform society by preparing the masses <span style="font-style:italic;">against</span> their future occupations as machine operators or other caretakers of technology. Similarly, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Newbolt Report</span> poses the question, "What has English, and especially English literature, for the wayfaring man who misses the scholar's introduction."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> While an answer is not immediately forthcoming, the report assures the reader that such an answer will involve "grave national issues" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TE</span>, 252).</p>
<p>In consequence of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Newbolt Report</span> and George Sampson's <span style="font-style:italic;">English for the English</span>, English pedagogy in the schools did indeed undergo strenuous reevaluation and change. While schoolchildren did not unanimously embrace Shakespeare and Donne as a lifeline to a lost Englishness, the appearance of English literary studies in its modern and current forms importantly grew out of the cultural climate that produced these reports. This reevaluation of pedagogy at the level of primary and secondary schools was roughly contemporary with changes of a similar sort at the level of the university. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Until the mid-nineteenth century, the study of English at Oxbridge, though not in Scotland, was largely philological, while Classics held sway as the traditional study of literature and aesthetics.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Although Classics fought for its place of prominence for some time, it could not fulfill the need for renewed nationalism as could English. Moreover, Classics could not speak to as broad a range of class positions nor prepare teachers for the changing primary and secondary classrooms. In the 1880s, the teaching of English was already on the rise, but it was associated with women's education and Mechanic's Institutes. Although the first professor of English at Oxford was appointed in 1904, the feeling of many there toward this new subject was expressed by a professor of theology who opined that English study was for "women" and the "second and third rate men who were to become schoolmasters."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Leavis entered Cambridge University at a time when the Ph.D. was a recent and somewhat disreputable degree and English studies was still on shaky ground. While Cambridge had since 1883 offered a Litt.D., a doctorate based on the evaluation of published work, it did not introduce the Ph.D. until 1919. Leavis received the Ph.D. in 1924 and was mildly ashamed of having one. He even requested that the Ph.D. not be listed on the title-page of <span style="font-style:italic;">New Bearings in English Poetry</span> , insisting that it "would raise the worst suspicions, and, anyway, looks comic."<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> While Leavis may have been hampered by the indignity of holding a Ph.D., as well as by the newness of the discipline of English at an old university, he was also responsible for some of the most important changes to come to the teaching of English on the university level. As the discussion of <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span> has already revealed, Leavis saw education as the means to curb and counteract the effects of civilization in the form of industrial labor, popular fiction, cinema, and motor cars. In this way, Leavis's beliefs were concordant with those expressed in the reports of 1921 and 1922. Indeed, Leavis can be understood to posit an important ideological connection between the reforms in the schools and the creation of English as a discipline in the universities.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Because Leavis believed that the function of a university education in English was to produce schoolteachers who would inoculate children with Englishness, protecting them against the mass-produced pleasures and labors of the working class, he understood university English to participate vitally in his project of rescuing society through literary analysis. According to Francis Mulhern, Leavis saw education as the only way to change the environment, given that industrial progress could not be turned back.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> It might seem curious that Leavis therefore chose the study of literature and newly developing methods of literary criticism as the means to alter society. Yet for Leavis, literary criticism was in a certain sense the <span style="font-style:italic;">name</span> for this vast endeavor of societal change.</p>
<p>In his 1943 work, <span style="font-style:italic;">Education and the University</span>, Leavis explains that the English school at Cambridge "emancipated literary studies from the linguistic grinds."<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> With philology marginalized and Classics deemphasized, English is imagined as a new species of study, one that is neither rote nor mechanical and yet entirely relevant to the social situation of the modern moment. Leavis devotes an early portion of the text to a discussion of a theoretical work known as the Experimental College by the American educator, Alexander Meiklejohn. As Leavis quotes Meiklejohn, "Our first aim is not to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  get liberal thinking done excellently but to get it done at all. In a word, we must recognize that the drift of American life is against those forms of liberal thinking which seem most essential to its welfare" (<span style="font-style:italic;">EU</span>, 22). Leavis's commentary is consonant with his early positions on modernity and America. He avers, "For 'drift of American life,' of course, we can read 'drift of modern life': American conditions are the conditions of modern civilization, even if the 'drift' has gone further on the other side of the Atlantic than on this" (<span style="font-style:italic;">EU</span>, 22). Once again, Leavis identifies America as exemplary of the progressive tendencies of modern civilization. Yet here Leavis expresses his hope that these modern tendencies can be curbed, if not entirely eradicated, by proper education. He notes that American universities bear the scars of modernization over English universities: "Even Harvard . . . appears to have suffered a great deal more from the last half-century of civilization than Oxford and Cambridge have done" (<span style="font-style:italic;">EU</span>, 28). This suffering can be counteracted by "liberal thinking" such as that found in the exercises in <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span>. It thus seems that Leavis's curiously transatlantic definition of liberal thinking is that which counters the drift of modern or Americanized life.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Consequences for Cultural Studies: The Case of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Uses of Literacy</span>
</h1>
<p>Leavis put such time and effort into writing about education, as well as into teaching itself, because he believed deeply that only educational reform could enact pervasive cultural change and that English was the only discipline to provide the means. Leavis's aims, however curiously condensed, were influential in the development both of literary criticism as a scholarly endeavor and of English as a central discipline in the humanities. Indeed, Leavis's work on teaching is the only aspect of his scholarship that Raymond Williams deems "wholly valuable" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 261). While Williams looks askance at Leavis's belief in members of the "minority culture" as the guardians of Englishness, he acknowledges Leavis's importance in the formation of both English and Cultural Studies at British universities, claiming that "<span style="font-style:italic;">Minority Culture and Mass Civilisation</span> . . . outlined a particular view of culture which has become very widely influential" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 252). Although it is true that Leavis has influenced English and Cultural Studies in ways that persist to this day, it is also true that Leavis was prophetic in his anticipation of styles of English reaction to American culture that would become full-blown by the Cold War. While the interwar years saw English uncertainty about the transatlantic shift in power, the years after the Second World War began to make plain the extent to which British imperial decline would be accompanied by the U.S.'s economic, militaristic, and mass cultural rise. In order to consider the ways in which Leavis was <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> influential and far-seeing in his analyses of Americanization, it is worth turning to a different type of example, one drawn from the early development of cultural studies and the writing of one of its foundational res, Richard Hoggart.</p>
<p>Raymond Williams, E.P. Thompson, and Richard Hoggart are often considered the progenitors of cultural studies as it would become institutionalized and practiced in Britain.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Although Hoggart opened up the possibility for a new kind of academic practice when he founded the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of Birmingham in 1963, it was his first book, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Uses of Literacy</span> , that shocked many in England by proposing a new way of studying culture. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Uses of Literacy</span>, which Hoggart almost called, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Abuses of Literacy</span>, details the reading practices of the English working classes. Although <span style="font-style:italic;">The Uses of Literacy</span> considers the question of training the working classes in "critical judgement," it earned the disdain of many in mid-century English departments for seriously analyzing material other than literature.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Attributing part of his inspiration for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Uses of Literacy</span> to the writings of Leavis and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny</span> group, Hoggart notes the pleasure that came with his realization that "Leavisite methods . . . close analysis, listening to a text, feeling a text and its texture . . . were translatable into the study of popular culture" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>, 278). While Hoggart was capable of taking some working-class culture seriously, he was also sufficiently Leavisite to find aspects of mass culture from which the working class must be protected. In the example that follows from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Uses of Literacy</span>, the mass culture that menaces a segment of working youths is inextricable from the American culture industries—music and movies—that have produced it. This description of what Andrew Goodwin calls "Hoggart's notion of the working class as victims of American culture" reveals the way in which the nationalist definitions of culture presented by Leavis in the thirties permeated the foundations of postwar British cultural studies.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Leavis's influence can most clearly be seen in Hoggart's identification of "the juke box boys," a group of working-class youths who tend to read "comics, gangster novelettes, science and crime magazines" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>, 188). Encoded in the very name of the juke box boys is the music that entertains them: records that Hoggart notes are "almost all American" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>, 189). Hoggart describes these youths, who "spend their evenings listening in harshly-lighted milk-bars to the 'nickelodeons,'" as "boys aged between fifteen and twenty, with drape-suits, picture ties, and an American slouch" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>, 189). This is a curious description of a segment of the English working-class. It Americanizes not only their reading habits but their very corporeal style. As Andrew Goodwin has remarked, "is the British slouch then a superior posture"?<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> It seems that for Hoggart, an English or even a British slouch will not do, because the juke box boys are marked on a bodily level by their yearnings for American culture. In an even more pointed description, Hoggart observes that "the young men waggle one shoulder or stare, as desperately as Humphrey Bogart, across the tubular chairs" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>, 190). Here one must ask what it means for these markers of American culture to appear in the juke box boys' "stare" or "slouch." While Leavis indicted the working classes in their choice of popular entertainment, Hoggart suggests that their very bodies are disciplined and transformed by their fantasies of American culture. As Hoggart surmises, "Many of the customers—their clothes, their hair styles, their facial expressions all indicate—are living to a large extent in a myth-world compounded of a few simple elements which they take to be those of American life" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>,190).</p>
<p>In terms strikingly similar to those of Leavis, Hoggart distinguishes between the United States and the "myth-world" of Americanization. Particularly interesting is the way in which Humphrey Bogart's characteristic manners and "stare" take part in this mythos. Disseminated by Hollywood, Bogart's style was imitated in America <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  much as it was in England. Like Leavis, Hoggart makes clear that it is not the lived experience of Americans but the mass cultural processes of Americanization that pose the threat. In the end, Hoggart's indictment of the juke box boys—he calls them "the directionless and tamed helots of a machine-minding class" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>, 191)—embeds his references to American styles of leisure and habit within the more familiar picture of the modernization of England. Certainly, Hoggart is remembered for his work on mass culture in England and not for his occasional references to American music and film. Yet Hoggart's brief discussion of the juke box boys reveals the permeability of the concepts of mass culture and American culture and the easy ideological slippage from one to the other. Hoggart's central contribution to British cultural studies is of course his analysis of <span style="font-style:italic;">British</span> culture, yet it is revealing to discover this transatlantic stylization of the working-class, on the model of Leavis's thirties writing, in Hoggart's earliest and best-known work. While Hoggart acknowledges Leavis's influence in both inspiration and method, careful attention to the resemblances between Leavis and Hoggart reveals cultural studies, as well as English studies, to be predicated on a style of Englishness that would resist its own transatlanticity.</p>
<p>Terry Eagleton notes that Leavis not only influenced cultural studies, but that his importance to English literary studies is so fundamental as to be taken for granted. As Eagleton puts it, Leavis's reading practices, cultural ideologies, and intellectual mission have been absorbed into "the bloodstream of English studies in England" and "become a form of spontaneous critical wisdom as deep-seated as our conviction that the earth moves round the sun."<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> While many critics will attest to Leavis's centrality to the development of English studies in England, the transatlantic dimensions of his writings have less frequently been probed. Yet by turning our attention to Leavis's use of the example of America, it is possible to see how his influential development of pedagogical methods and English studies emerged in part through his repudiation of Americanization. Despite Leavis's commitment to developing, among the English working classes, a literary sensibility tenacious enough to protect them from jazz and Hollywood, Leavis's theories ultimately spread beyond the British Isles, contributing to the rise of American New Criticism. Indeed, the impact of his development of English into a core discipline of the humanities, as well as his commitment to close reading, can still be felt in the United States today. It is thus perhaps the greatest irony of Leavis's legacy that English studies in the United States emerged in part out of an intellectual project that defined itself, and the literary culture poised to rescue England, against the example of America.</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Under Cellophane Skies</h1>
<p>As the curtains opened on the avant-garde opera event of 1934, Virgil Thompson and Gertrude Stein's <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span>, the audience faced a vast sign of the production's cutting edge modernity: 1500 square feet of sky-blue cellophane was draped from the sides and ceiling of the stage, creating a semi-transparent cyclorama, glittering under bright white lights. The stark artificiality of the stage design proclaimed its relationship to the modern world and its unsurpassed hold on the new: "The cellophane set, brilliantly lit to evoke a sky hung with rock crystal, defied comparison to anything the audience had ever seen."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The set and costume designer was Florine Stettheimer, a New York painter whose close friends included Marcel Duchamp and Carl Van Vechten, and whose paintings were characterized by their light-infused surfaces and whimsical approach to their subjects (her style was sometimes called "primitive <span style="font-style:italic;">moderne</span>"<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a>). Stettheimer had never ventured into the world of stage or costume design before <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> (and wouldn't again), but her efforts were met with critical acclaim for her spectacular vision: "some thought that [her] costumes outdid the Ziegfeld Follies, and one quipped that the sets were 'Botticellophane.'"<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Plastic, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  that most twentieth-century of materials, here transformed the stage into a powerful blend of art, glamour, and the latest technology.</p>

<p>We've lost, in the intervening decades, the ability to read the early-century semiotics of plastics, and particularly of cellophane. Stettheimer's stage today, rather than looking sleek and streamlined, appears hung with the cheap plastic that wraps mattresses or other bulky household items for shipping. But what did cellophane signify? Why was it taken up not only by Stettheimer, but by the designers of lavish Hollywood musical sets and their promoters? Cellophane appears throughout popular culture in the 1920s and 1930s, generally signifying the slickly modern. Cellophane tablecloths glitter in an upscale nightclub in the Astaire-Rogers blockbuster <span style="font-style:italic;">Swing Time</span> ; cellophane also appears in an earlier Joan Crawford film, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dancing Lady</span> , in the transparent swags at the back of a dance set, and again in the Broadway musical staged within the film. Here, the cellophane appears in costume-form: a group of black-attired old women, complete with bonnets, lace collars, wire glasses, and bent-over backs make their way into a futuristic beauty parlor and emerge as modern bombshells, perfectly artificial with cellophane outfits and what might be plastic hair. Cellophane similarly appears in a swanky Chinese nightclub as the "The Girls in Cellophane" take the stage in W.C. Fields' <span style="font-style:italic;">International House</span> . Cellophane was chic and, above all, <span style="font-style:italic;">now</span>.</p>
<p>How could this plastic sheeting have connoted glamour for 1930s audiences? From its first American appearance in 1931 as the revolutionary new moisture-proof wrapper of Camel cigarettes, cellophane was an undisputed success, standing out "as the lone spot of brilliance in the otherwise dismal commercial landscape of the Depression."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">Cellophane served as a cultural reference with greater significance than the mere freshness of cigarettes: it inspired a new packaging aesthetic as well as an intensified relationship of desire between consumer and product. And the aesthetic clearly went beyond the mundane glamour of such luxuries as tobacco products. Cellophane proved <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to be a cultural force: besides appearing on the avant-garde stage, the MGM musical set, and as a backdrop to celebrity photographs, it evoked commentary of one sort or another in the pages of magazines such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Fortune, Esquire</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Yorker</span>. Even Cole Porter equaled it to Spanish nights, great art, and Garbo's salary in his 1934 hit "You're the Top" ("You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain / You're the National Gallery / You're Garbo's salary / You're cellophane!"). Cellophane was linked with glamour in its earliest marketing; one of its first advertisements announced "glamorous new transparent cellulose sheeting." Somehow, this tag line fails to convince, but historian Stephen Fenichell writes that "cellophane was defining itself as a carriage-trade product, a shimmering jewel in sheet form, the epitome of elegance and glamour in the new commercial art form called packaging."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> And customers were buying.</p>
<p>The development of plastic coincided with the Machine Age interest in streamlined design, clean lines, and the spareness that characterized modern buildings, furniture, industrial design, and so on. The prevailing design aesthetic of the early 1930s was "low, horizontal, sculptural, flowing, [and] evocative of speed"; the "streamlined design reflected the desire for frictionless flight into a utopian future whose rounded vehicles, machines and architecture would provide a visually uncomplicated protective environment . . . closed off from the Depression and marked by static perfection."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Plastics seemed to offer a thoroughly modern medium with the magical power of transmuting and perfecting form. Paul Frankl, one of a group of self-proclaimed "industrial designers" and author of several books based on the principles of Machine Age design, exclaimed: "The new alchemy! The very name invented by twentieth-century necromancers rivals those mystical elixirs of the Middle Ages! Cellophane, pyroxolia, karolyth, aladdinite, pyrolin, amerith, durez!. . . .They are truly the founders of a new language of industrial design."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> The language of synthetic chemistry—the plastics that inspired the designer's imagination—borrows its vocabulary from shape-shifting, magic, and the plasticity of language itself in a mélange that connotes glamour.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Frankl exhorted the public to employ this "new idiom," this "new alphabet" in order to learn its "unprecedented syntax."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Plastics, or "materia nova," provided a modern vernacular that could speak directly to the twentieth century and its miraculously transforming technologies. In speaking this language, one participated in its mysterious alchemy and helped to ensure its utopian results. The new plastics made one, above all, modern. American leisure, Frankl exuberantly proclaimed, must be "wrapped in cellophane!"<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Leisure, the time made available by machine labor, should be aesthetically brilliant, impervious to the elements, artificial in all the best senses of the word. <span style="font-style:italic;">Fortune</span> magazine declared that "the synthetic plastic . . . is a glamorous substance and a tribute to the powers of man"<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> and Frankl exhorted his readers to wrap themselves up in those powers, make themselves over in a shiny new substance, and celebrate the virtuosity of a transparent plastic coating.</p>
<p>I'm interested in cellophane as pure surface, as the plastic without depth that provides the transparent gloss and promises to perfect one's leisure, at least aesthetically. The paper-thin, impermeable layer of cellulose sheeting offered the modern imagination new ways of seeing the mundane world: the glassy sheen of cellophane provided a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  protective veneer from dusty reality and, like lightweight and mobile glass, cellophane could wrap anything and thus transform it into a sparkling play of light. Cellophane arrests the gaze at its glittering surface, becomes a version of the photograph, emptied of content or form. This would be a photograph without any representative function, but rather a blank surface that is endlessly appealing, seductive, though it transmits little beyond the wonder of its alchemy. Perhaps it was this blankness that Stettheimer wished to exploit as she planned her cellophane sky and the cellophane robes that some of the actors would wear. Reviewer Joseph Wood Krutch corroborates the empty effects of Stettheimer's cellophane set, claiming that "<span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span> is a success because all its elements—the dialogue, the music, the pantomime, and the sparkling cellophane décor—go so well with one another while remaining totally irrelevant to life, logic, or common sense. . . . One will find [like <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>] . . . the tendency toward form without content and toward a kind of intelligibility without meaning characteristic of surrealism and the Dadaists."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The comment is directed toward the combined effects of the opera's elements, but it certainly speaks to the function of cellophane on the stage itself. Empty of anything but the barest form, the draped cellulose film is irrelevant to life or logic, and offers nothing in the way of meaning. The empty effect was emphasized by the bright white lights that Stettheimer insisted should illuminate the gathered cellophane and made it shine like some artificial and other-worldly sky. Krutch deftly makes the link, then, between the work of cellophane and the more lofty literary modernism that emerged in the preceding decade. As pure form, or form without content, cellophane stands in, at least superficially, for some modernist formal ideals. Crisp, smooth, clear, hygienic, even icy in appearance, cellophane was a wonder wrapping and metaphor for language re-made, removed of all its "words worn thin."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> While Stein had nothing to do with the concept behind the set design, the cellophane seemed to suit, perfectly, her approach to writing.</p>
<p>For Stein, neither memory nor representation had any place in writing; instead her writing would gather its force from vibrant word juxtapositions in the flattened moment of what she termed the "continuous present."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Flatness was a consistent aesthetic priority for Stein, from the time she wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span> in 1913 to her lectures presented on her return trip to the U.S. in 1934, just following the opening of <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span>. In one of these lectures, "Plays," she refers to <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> as a sort of unmoving landscape: "A landscape does not move nothing really moves in a landscape but things are there, and I put into the play the things that were there." She continues: "Magpies are in the landscape that is they are in the sky of a landscape . . . they hold themselves up and down and look flat against the sky."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> The reader, or audience member, would be invited, then, into this flattened landscape, to experience a single plane or flattened moment rather than the progressive diachronic demands of typical dramatic narrative. Stein asserts, again in keeping with the formal innovation and transparent surface of cellophane: "After all, my thought is a complicated simplicity. I like a thing simple, but it must be simple through complication."<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Cellophane offers one version of this complicated simplicity, its empty surface reflecting a complex synthetic chemistry and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  an experimental history that spanned decades. Formal experiment defines more generally the early decades of twentieth-century literature, and certainly no re looms larger than Gertrude Stein's.</p>
<p>The production of <span style="font-style:italic;">Fours Saints in Three Acts</span> thus offers a unique opportunity to consider the relationship between modernism and the new synthetic materials of the twentieth century. One might even think of cellophane as the objective (and material) correlative to many of the aims of modernism: as an almost substance-less substance, it resonates with Stein's project to drain the signifier of its signification; it harnesses a new generation to consider the impact of the surface through an attention to form (rather than a singular focus on content); it also speaks to an increasing concern with hygiene, both in the realms of public health (preventing the contamination of food) and aesthetics (encouraging the "clean" line, shorn of all superfluous words).<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Cellophane, then, as a sign of the new, offered modernists a material with all the plasticity and possibility of language; Stettheimer's set design and Stein's text together spoke in the century's new vernacular, insistently contemporary, to an audience delighted to hear the message.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Plastic and "Limitless Control"</h1>
<p>In order to understand the excitement generated by Stettheimer's set, it helps to understand something of the drama that produced it. Cellophane is, of course, first and foremost a consumer item whose role has been largely played out <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> in the world of design, literature, or avant-garde opera, but in the manufacturing sector and marketing campaigns of such companies as Camel, Lucky Strike, Coty perfumes, and Whitman's chocolates. Its history begins in 1904 when a Swiss chemist worked to invent a waterproof tablecloth. This particular venture failed, but in the process Dr. Jacques Brandenberger created a method of producing transparent sheets of viscose film. He would form a company in 1913 called "La cellophane" (a combination of the Greek <span style="font-style:italic;">kellon</span> for "wood" and <span style="font-style:italic;">phaino</span>, or "to be seen")<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> with the goal of producing a new film stock, an alternative to the highly flammable cellulose nitrate. Again, this venture would fail (the film wasn't, after all, impervious to heat), but Brandenberger would continue to develop his synthetic film as a wrapping material, first selling it as an expensive luxury wrapper to Coty perfumes in the early 1920s. The company began production in the U.S. in 1924 and became a familiar household product with the break-through development of the "humidor pack" for cigarettes in 1930.</p>
<p>The development of cellophane occurs against the broader backdrop of a rapidly expanding plastics industry. Plastics were nothing if not diverse—they ranged from thermo-setting plastics (phenolic resins, cast phenolic, urea resins), thermoplastics (cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate, acrylic resins, polystyrene), and protein plastics (made from casein)—and included such revolutionary materials as celluloid, Bakelite, nylon, and cellophane. Plastics offered industrial designers a new material with unlimited opportunities unhampered by the various challenges of designing in wood, metal, or glass as one enthusiastic commentator on the development of plastics writes: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  "From all these limitations, imposed by the nature of materials, the designer is now free. Plastics have given him a new and almost unbelievable liberty for experiment and expression."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Now a "limitless control of material"<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> defined the designer's idiom and created a utopia of infinite design potential. The idea of infinity bedazzled the growing numbers of modernist designers, whose art would no longer be made to suffer the tyrannical control of natural materials. The "materia nova" offered unfettered access to the creative imagination without the limits imposed by the bends and warps of wood, its narrow range of color, or its limited availability as a natural resource; in this way, plastic was the most impersonal of materials, unmarred by any idiosyncracy, even untouched by human hands. It epitomized another kind of modernist ideal, then, in its cool, aloof distance from the subjective world of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>By the late 1920s, plastics production incorporated modernist design principles, although the history of plastics long predates modernism. The earliest patent of a plastic material was granted in 1855; celluloid proved to be an excellent material for fabricating billiard balls, piano keys, and various other items to resemble ivory, bone, horn, marble, or tortoiseshell. This penchant for imitation aligned celluloid with a distinctly Victorian aesthetic; not only could the nitrocellulose material be formed into highly ornamented household objects that previously only the wealthiest could afford, but its disguise pre-empted any anxiety around the newness and radical innovation of the product.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Plastics, in the guise of age-old natural products, threatened no one and thus conservative public tastes would not bar its financial success. It wasn't until the 1920s, writes Jeffrey Meikle, that the "modernist disdain for imitation as dishonest and immoral"<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> influenced the way that celluloid was produced and promoted. Those household objects such as brushes and combs were now characterized for consumers as "so radically different, so smart and so modern"<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> and did not hide the fact of their industrial production. Instead they were streamlined, designed according to function rather than according to what modernists perceived as the fussy standards of nineteenth-century ornamentation. The aesthetic of spareness (what Ezra Pound made into a kind of poetic hygiene in his principles of imagism)<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> becomes visible a decade later then on the toilet table and in the pantry.</p>
<p>Celluloid would soon lose ground to the multiple new kinds of plastics that were emerging. Meikle writes that "celebration of an approaching 'plastic age' reflected the euphoria of the industry's executives in the 1920s and 1930s. In a few short years they had witnessed their field's expansion beyond the limited materials and methods of celluloid."<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> A 1929 plastics directory, he continues, lists 84 trade names; in 1933 that number doubles, and more than triples by 1939. The amazing growth in the patenting and manufacture of plastics provided a new alphabet, indeed, for those interested in creating a new aesthetic, which would become particularly relevant for a culture making the transition from the economic boom-times of the 1920s to the tightly constrained financial climate of the 1930s. Plastics offered radically democratized access to the products of cutting-edge design: with improved manufacturing processes, plastics could be affordable for a great section of the population who wanted to share in, or speak with, this new and luxurious vernacular. Elite design and middle class incomes coincided for perhaps the first time as the Plastic Age was ushered excitedly in. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Glamour continued to be linked with plastics, both in the world of elite design and in the more everyday world of consumer goods. A 1940 issue of the trade magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Plastics</span>, for example, makes this connection in an article entitled "Vending Machine Glamour." Plastic pulls the "silent salesman" (that is, the vending machine) out of awkward adolescence and into a mature and sexy adulthood: "To the vending machine industry the plastics have given the color and brightness which is helping to transform its products from the awkward appearance of yesterday into the <span style="font-style:italic;">glamour boys</span> of today and tomorrow" (italics in original).<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> The article declares the incipient manifest destiny of this industrial marvel:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>In the ingenious and sometimes spectacular applications of plastics to more and more diversified groups of products and uses, each invasion into a new industry constitutes a chapter of singular importance. Frequently, in fact, an entire industry may gravitate in their direction and the plastics find themselves established in a new field almost overnight. That such annexation of new territory sometimes occurs in exposed and unexpected fields only makes the advance more colorful and interesting.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>As the language indicates, plastics were sweeping the landscape, conquering new and unexpected lands in a mission to liberate and beautify. The colonizing metaphor isn't, in retrospect, so far-fetched: the "freedom" and "limitless control" celebrated by Frankl reappear here in the gleeful tone of an industry recognizing the potential for limitless expansion and therefore limitless profit. The partnership of glamour and the colonial impulse, like that of glamour and the primitive, becomes a recognizable trope in the 1930s. Just as the age of colonial empire was coming to a close, an age of global industrial expansion was opening up. A universe of commercial possibilities came with it, including at times—despite Frankl's excitement about a new vernacular—a borrowed vocabulary from the more tarnished language of empire (though polished up for its new medium). <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Plastics</span> recognized the industry's bright future with its "glamour boys" advancing on the front lines, poised to bring home the sale.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Race for Plastics</h1>
<p>Enter into this climate of euphoric executives, ecstatic designers, and an emergent consuming public, the collaborative Thompson-Stein (and I will add -Stettheimer) venture, <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span>. Exploiting the vogue for everything African, Thompson had decided to use an all African-American cast for the production, claiming (somewhat disingenuously) that the superior diction of African Americans made them the best choice for the difficult language of Stein's libretto: "They alone possess the dignity and the poise, the lack of self-consciousness that proper interpretation of the opera demands. They have the rich, resonant voices essential to the singing of my music and the clear enunciation required to deliver Gertrude's text."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Van Vechten, surprisingly, given his penchant for all things Negro (he was, after all, situated at the center of the Harlem Renaissance as patron, cheerleader, photographer, and a writer of some infamy <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  after the publication of his novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>)<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> disapproved of Thompson's choice, believing that Stein's text had nothing to do with African Americans. Stettheimer also expressed her apprehension on aesthetic grounds, worrying that the "varied brown skin tones would sully the brilliant colors of her costumes"; she consequently (and apparently seriously) "proposed painting the cast white or silver."<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> The artist, whose aesthetic interests ranged from extravagant Victorian landscapes of lace to the more austere modernity of cellophane (her own apartment was decorated in draping lace and cellophane), would incorporate both materials, creating formal costumes against the wondrous vacancy of the surrounding cellophane skies.</p>
<p>When Stein herself heard of the plan to costume the black actors in cellophane, she also expressed grave doubts about maintaining the integrity of her text: "I suppose they have good reasons for using negro singers instead of white, there are certain obvious ones, but I do not care for the idea of showing the negro bodies, it is too much what the English in what they call 'modernistic' novels call futuristic and do not accord with the words and music to my mind."<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Stein apparently worried about the clash between the false futurity of the falsely modern, and her own truly modern prose of the "continuous present," a prose that had brought literature, she claimed, into the twentieth century. She made this claim about the appearance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span>, its central story "Melanctha," of course, exploiting the fascination with African masks and African American stereotypes (the story explicitly circles around Melanctha's insatiable desire as she learns to gather "wisdom" or sexual knowledge). Stein was certainly invested in representations of race—as many critical works on her explore—but in <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span>, she claimed, her interest was elsewhere.</p>
<p>Carl Van Vechten's assertion that <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> had nothing to do with African Americans seems reasonable. The opera focuses on two sixteenth-century Spanish saints, Ignatius and Therese, and is, like much of Stein's work, difficult to paraphrase neatly. The four saints of the title number more like twenty, and there are four or even five acts, rather than the promised three. The word "negro" appears twice within the text, though the use is arguably glancing: "Saint Therese. Could a negro be with a beard to see and to be. / Saint Therese. Never have to have seen a negro there and with it so."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Stein distinguishes seeing and being, producing categories of difference, and opposing ontology to superficial appearance. The "negro," with visible beard, is <span style="font-style:italic;">there</span> to see, embodied and ontologically unquestionable, despite the question form of the line itself. Eight lines later the scene ends with "Saint Therese come again to be absent." While the negro emphatically, or at least doubly, is said to "be," Therese herself comes again (in the voice of the continuous present), reappears, but only in her absence, de-realized in the visual realization of the negro. The embodiedness of the "negro," in these lines, is counterpoised to the absent body of the saint (who is paradoxically there and not there). In this sense, one sees that "being" is bestowed upon the African American (who is not absent) here; Stein uses the idea–that is, borrows the popular stereotype—that the African American is all body, closer to nature, and thus becomes the re for embodiment altogether (as she had when she created the character of Melanctha). The body of culture, on the other hand, is represented by the saint who <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is present only in her absence, in the luminosity of her halo, and who occupies the space of idea rather than any sort of solid physicality. Thompson may have reflected on these lines as he made his casting decision, but it seems more likely that he was working within a milieu that appreciated the avant-garde implications of using a cast of African-American opera singers; he was also banking on the guaranteed notoriety this would bring to the production (<span style="font-style:italic;">Porgy and Bess</span>, George Gershwin's opera featuring an African-American cast, would premiere the following year, in 1935).</p>
<p>It has been suggested that it was the prurience, if not the notoriety (she seemed comfortable with this) of showing bodies beneath cellophane that concerned Stein in the Stettheimer design, although these robes would, in the end, be worn over richly ornamented costumes (even the hands of the cast would be chastely covered with white gloves, combining two popular images of African Americans as minstrels and devout churchgoers). According to Steven Watson, "Only in the opera's 'sniplets,' as choreographer Frederick Ashton dubbed the two fleshly <span style="font-style:italic;">divertissements</span>, did the dancers reveal flesh. One of these, a dance in the second act about six angels learning to fly, featured women with bare midriffs, the shortest of skirts, and bare-chested, bare-legged men."<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Watson adds a comment on the overall effect of the casting and set design: "At just the right moment, <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span> offered a casting revolution, daring and inevitable, at once libidinous and prim, wrapped up in a gauzy candy box of a setting." This, the aesthetic of primitive <span style="font-style:italic;">moderne</span>, best characterized the opera's overall look: if there was a race for plastic, it was the African race, and in that juxtaposition the production achieved a winning effect, at least as far as the artistically minded of 1934 were concerned. The black body, at least for avant-garde audiences, signified some proximity to nature and the <span style="font-style:italic;">feeling</span> that modern culture (that is "civilization") denied its subjects. The cellophane stage, then, represented a sort of reality principle: its cold swags, reflecting the bare bright lights, produced a riveting and modern blankness. The cast members, in all the ontological <span style="font-style:italic;">presence</span> accorded the African American, appeared in relief against the modern and deeply compelling absence of the set (and against the disembodied <span style="font-style:italic;">absence</span> of the "civilized" and thus white modern subject who didn't appear at all on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> stage). The modern script that accepted the civilized/primitive binary held true, then, even on the avant-garde stage. Modernity, represented by the manufactured plastic sky, is here aligned with death or stasis, in contradistinction to the life force of the African-American cast on stage.</p>
<p>Here we see glamour as both depending upon and rejecting the other, recognizing difference as the thrill of transgression. Glamour, emerging from the new technologies signified by the appearance of plastic, the sexual availability that glamour promises and withdraws, and the implicit exclusions on which it is based, is thus founded on a paradox. The racial dividing line on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> stage marked a distinction between life—represented in the casting decision—and death, here associated with civilization and its industrial production. Cellophane, invented in an exhilarated rush of entrepreneurial energy and embraced by a generation of artists who recognized in it the sign of the new, works in conjunction, then, with death. If, as Freud succinctly claimed in 1920 when he introduced his theory of the death drive, "the aim of all life <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is death," the mass of cellophane hanging over the stage was a harbinger of that in evitable return to an earlier state of matter<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a>. Death was thus inscribed on the stage, presented against the vitality of the opera's performers, singing against the chasm, or the void that defines human life.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Regarding Nothing</h1>
<p>While blankness, absence, and transparency are not unique to the text and staging of <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span>, they produced a particularly timely demonstration of its impact on the modern stage and on the modern subject. Absence, and its suggestion of a greater Nothing, appears repeatedly in the literature of the period as a defining trope of the modern. Modernist literature often swirls around a central and structuring abyss: one thinks of the meaning-collapsing darkness of the Marabar Caves in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage to India</span>, Caddy's painful absence in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sound and the Fury</span>, the circular wandering and central lack of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sun Also Rises</span>, the missing main character of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>, or the terrifying Nothing that characterizes the work of Beckett and Kafka. This structural emptiness reflects the anxiety of a world no longer able to rely on reason, a world in which, as Heidegger characterizes it, "we hover in anxiety"<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> against a defining Nothing. Nothing is the formless void, yet even "void" suggests its status as object. It is without form, without status in our world of nouns. "Nothing" may be interpreted in numerous registers, from the psychoanalytic (one thinks of Lacan's Thing, that zone around which desire endlessly circles, the vortex or vacuole linked to the failure of language and representation, the space that stands for all we have lost in the transition from infancy), to the existential, to the metaphysical and theological. Even a generation after Nietzsche, the modernist age continued to be characterized by the <span style="font-style:italic;">nihil</span> and the death of god. In god's place, as Marxist theory argues, was the growing fetishization of the commodity: plastic, produced in the magic of synthetic chemistry and met with the public's perpetual wonder, takes up its place as fetish, then, despite the blankness of its surface.</p>
<p>But blankness isn't, after all, identical to nothing. Blankness, particularly the blankness of cellophane, merely comes to represent the nothing through the emptiness of its surface. It isn't nothing, but signifies, or better gestures toward, the nothing that generates so much anxious modernism (Eliot's paradigmatic line, "I can connect / Nothing with nothing" comes to mind<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a>). Rather than ask cellophane to bear the weight of these significant philosophical enquiries into the nothing, I simply want to invoke its power on Stettheimer's stage as metaphoric, as speaking through its shallow and shiny surface to a culture quietly hovering in the anxiety of historical change, a questionable hold on reason, and dizzying technological development. This affective response, one might note, echoes the effect of the sublime, characterized by the bewildered response to something incomprehensibly vast, outside the individual's powers of reason to contain it. Blankness, without the delimiting detail, presented the vastness of scope that the sublime generally indicates. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In his work on the sublime, artist and art critic Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe points out the growing use of blankness as a signifier in the early twentieth century:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The passage from the Victorians to modernism and beyond is one which leads from a <span style="font-style:italic;">horror vacui</span> to a displayed blankness. . . . transparency was also close to the idea of the instantaneous, whereas detail is a matter of duration, and this is the sense in which the kind of modernism grounded in an absolute substitution of transparency for detail and plenitude may be seen as a transitional period between what it despised and what takes it for granted. Before modernism, accumulation and detail, after it, blankness.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Gilbert-Rolfe suggests that transparency, here synonymous with blankness (a point to which I will return below), becomes a wider cultural ideal and signifier for all that is modern. Transparency provides a new way into time itself, which was being newly and constantly theorized during the modernist era. "Duration," in Gilbert-Rolfe's usage, is not to be confused with the Bergsonian "durée" which describes the experience of time as outside of chronology, overlaying past, present, and future in a single and simultaneous moment. The "modernist moment," the arresting of an instant in the rush of the crowded events of historical time, provided a way to open up and understand experiential time outside the tyranny of chronology. Like the instantaneous, Stein's continuous present and James Joyce's "fluid succession of presents" (a concept much like Stein's notion and produced at roughly the same time) bespeak an intimate relationship to the modernist experimentation with and theorization of the "fourth dimension."<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Captured in the transparent skies of Stettheimer's set was a vision into a complexly realized and dramatically flattened time. Her billowing sky, then, suggests this multiply constituted nothing, the window that offers no information except the glean of its own blankly transparent surface.</p>
<p>Transparency and blankness, although apparently analogous, in fact operate in different registers. Transparency relies on the logic of consumer desire: the clean, see-through material that appeared to consumers in the early 1930s offered both an unimpeded view of the product and an additional sheen that improved its appearance; its smooth, glossy surface created a relationship of desire, acting as tantalizingly flimsy barrier, between consumer and good. Transparency thus encouraged consumption through a series of promises, from the cleanliness and good health of the product to the style and modernity of its package.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Blankness, however, works on a much vaster scale and doesn't engage the desires produced by consumer goods; rather, blankness points to absence, and to the terrifying and exhilarating void that eighteenth-century theorists elaborated in their works on the sublime. Gilbert-Rolfe is most interested in charting the shifting significations of blankness through the Victorian period up to the contemporary moment. He writes: "Where [blankness] once marked the absence of the sign by being a sign for absence, it is now the sign of an invisible and ubiquitous technological presence."<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> He describes the meaning of blankness at both ends of this short historical spectrum from the realm of crowded visual detail to the silent hum of the electrical (or digital) current: for the Victorians, blankness was absence, the space to be (anxiously) filled. Blankness was not a desirable condition, but one to be <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  addressed (thus the ubiquitous wallpaper of the era). In the contemporary moment (Gilbert-Rolfe is writing in the last breath of the twentieth century), blankness itself is the sign, blankness speaks, it is "eloquent" rather than silent. Blankness today, he argues, finds expression in excess (an excess linked to the electronic and digital age) rather than absence.</p>
<p>Modernism is importantly situated between these two understandings of blankness. Gilbert-Rolfe uses the modern period in its transitional importance, as a moment of shedding the earlier demand for detail and an increasing desire for the blank surface. Yet the point shouldn't be skimmed over lightly: hardly a passive transitional period, modernism defiantly took up the empty, the blank, or the transparent, projecting it as a historical condition and aesthetic ideal. Particularly fascinating is how in the modern period, blankness was <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> the absence of any variety of things—spanning a vast categorical range from ornament to metaphysical values—<span style="font-style:italic;">and also</span>, in the re of cellophane, the sign of a newly ubiquitous, or a swiftly becoming ubiquitous, technological presence. It is the both/and that fascinates me here—how blankness during the modern period signified absence (in the form of things lost or cast off) <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> presence in the form of the overwhelming recognition of technological power. Gilbert-Rolfe refers to the pervasive techno-presence associated with the age of computer technology; cellophane, rather, and particularly on Stettheimer's stage (and also on the Hollywood set as I will discuss below), suggests the overarching, all-encompassing presence of the technologies born out of synthetic chemistry—these audiences could have no idea just how thoroughly plastic would permeate their lives, even eventually their bodies—via its consumer-driven products. Nevertheless, its blank surface, shimmering innocently (that is, as if to bear no message) in the bright lights, one might experience the vastness of its import, a recognition of the exponentially increasing power of technology over the puny human subject, and in this sense a sublime in which, as Gilbert-Rolfe argues, the infinite nature of technology replaces the formerly infinite nature of nature itself.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, nature is outdone by the velocity of technological development as Walter Benjamin has famously noted;<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> caught up in the tremendous surge of its power, the modern subject experiences a newly revised sublime. The power, one should remember, comes from chemistry, the science that shares in the magic of alchemy and shape-shifting. With the recognition that the physical universe was alterable through the new capacity to change its physical properties, anything seemed possible. The force of this revolutionary technology overtakes and carries along everything in its path—nature will not look the same again, once the industrial world has allied itself with sweeping technological change, and a new era of mass production has begun. This is more visible to us now, having the whole of the century to observe at once, but in the 1930s, technological potential was thrilling (as was the idea of conquering nature), though mixed with the anxiety that accompanies any such sweeping change and encounter with "magic."</p>
<p>Art deco design worked to maximize the tension between the blank quiet of smooth lines and white surfaces and the impending explosion of the technologized world. Van Nest Polglase, the designer behind the beautifully stark sets of the Astaire-Rogers <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  films, developed "the fixed architectural institution that soon became known as the B.W.S. (Big White Set)."<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> The signature look was one of white on white to emphasize the smooth harmony and open space of the set: "Bodies, or rather costumes, which also formed an essential part of this environment, had to be streamlined even when standing still" which added to the "total, smooth environment" of the set.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> Gloss was a premium feature of the design, and Polglase employed plastics (particularly Bakelite) to produce gleaming dance floors. The result was a calmly static set, although Polglase also exploited the effect of circles against angles to "suggest the springs and spokes of a machine, or, more abstractly, the contrast between movement and stillness."<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Polglase featured cellophane in the 1936 film <span style="font-style:italic;">Swing Time</span>, as I mentioned earlier, creating a set that was clearly artificial (even ironically so with the cellophane-clad glamour girls) and streamlined to heighten the effect of the dancers. Technology was quietly visible on stage, although the expanses of cellophane suggested calm stasis over the noise associated with industry. This was Hollywood magic at its purest, combining the beautifully engineered with the veneer of impenetrable beauty.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the greatest displays of Hollywood alchemy, and one that explicitly linked technology with the infinite, was the extravagant 6500 square foot set constructed for the final dance sequence of the Fred Astaire/Eleanor Powell musical, <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadway Melody of 1940</span>. This was the largest set ever constructed for a dance sequence and gathered all the forces of Hollywood technical wizardry. Ann Miller recalls its massive mirrored glass floor and "midnight blue cyclorama wired with 10,000 light bulbs for stars."<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> Thirty-foot mirrors multiplied the set's effect as they reflected the light, the dancers, and produced an effect of infinite depth. A giant curtain of thinly sliced cellophane hung toward the back of the set, and through it the seemingly innumerable stars shone. Twenty-five foot palm trees, also constructed from sliced cellophane, completed the effect of a desert oasis, their cellophane fronds hanging sleekly over the whole set. The Merrill Pye art deco design emphasized the seemingly infinite space, the palm trees and stars visible on every surface, producing an effect that was "clean," "slick," and entirely comprised of "shimmering surfaces."</p>
<p>The final extended dance sequence begins as a woman in sarong and head-wrap sings Cole Porter's "Begin the Beguine" in a sultry style of music appropriate to the tropical setting. The actress here is Carmen D'Antonio, though the singing is dubbed (the vocals are by Lois Hodnett). D'Antonio's filmography indicates that she worked, for the most part, as a secondary player, cast as a dancer and "harem girl," "native girl," servant to Salome, the "treasure of Kalifa," and an "Oriental dream" (she even once played the Puerto Rican love interest of Uncle Bill on the 1960s television series "Family Affair"). She offered Hollywood a pretty and generic otherness that could authenticate its fantasies of Singapore, Arabia, or Morocco. In this Astaire/Powell vehicle, D'Antonio provides an exotic and old-world counterpoint to the sleek Plastic Age features of the set. A chorus of women appears like a dreamy harem in beautifully flowing costumes, their mid-riffs bare as they sway to the sensual music. A gauzy curtain parts to reveal the cellophane trees and behind them, the shimmering cellophane swag. This gigantic MGM set is designed to produce the utmost effect of glamour, with its infinite reflections, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  its glassy surfaces, and the exotic dancers who, like Thompson's African-American cast, provide a shorthand sign for authenticity, a measure of the distance modern culture has come, and an expression of the modern desire to preserve the vision of a simpler and more sensual life (the women, swaying in unison and singing softly suggest beautiful field laborers, picturesque in their servitude). The visual spectacle, resulting from the combination of cellophane and this picture of "ethnic authenticity" literalizes the movement of the sublime from the awesome power of nature to the cool distance of glamour. The physical embodiment, or the weightiness of the authentic or natural is displaced, replaced by the physical transparency, the sleekness of the manufactured product.</p>

<p>The Carmen D'Antonio character quietly disappears as the real star, Eleanor Powell, rises before the cellophane curtain, her white costume a variation on a belly-dancer's seductive garb, but made for the athlete's body, as Powell's movement quickly demonstrates. The set gives a sense of infinite depth: Powell's re is reflected in the mirrors, she dances on the shimmery image of palm fronds, there are lights shining everywhere. Fred Astaire appears and together their feet tap in swift and complicated harmony, the exoticism of the piece undiminished in its passionate choreography. Considered "the greatest tap duet ever filmed," this choreography does not fail to awe in its technical mastery and dazzling design: the sound alone is stunning, the deftness of their tapping feet imperceptible to the eye; this is the body made machine. One might say that here is the sublime, re-realized for an eager movie-going public: the infinite sound, the depthless lights, the reference to otherness, the glassy impenetrability of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the set produce an echo of the sublime in its glamour, bolstered by the explicit use of streamlined technology.</p>
<p>But before the audience can quite make out the complex desire initiated by this sequence, it comes to a close as the couple dances off-stage, and soon reappears, re-costumed for the next segment in all-American clothes. Powell is in a ruffled knee-length day-dress, Astaire has shed his toreador costume for a comfortable suit, and the music has shifted to a more recognizably American swing-tempo. They are the picture of go-to Americans, engaged in friendly competition on the dance floor. It's good clean fun as goofy smiles replace the serious expressions and erotic overtones of the preceding segment, and the cellophane set recedes from view, as each dancer shows, again, a staggering—and this time individual—tap virtuosity. Finally, in a flurry of spins they dance off-stage, are reunited with a friend (played by George Murphy), and the three return to the stage, the image of happy, wholesome, American friends.</p>
<p>In the background, significantly, remains the chorus of women in their Easternized costumes, immobile and statuesque against the cellophane curtain. Here we see the image of American vitality against the beautiful static glamour of the background, and here the film ends. While one may argue that cellophane has played the smallest of roles here, offering some style in the form of a shiny accent, I would argue, rather, that it stands for the beckoning emptiness of the modern age, the transparent reminder of the absence at the heart of, or especially at the heart of, the most innocent American pleasures. The cellophane curtain and palm fronds, hanging like icicles, offer the cold artifice of glamour, a stillness in the background that arrests the eye, despite the athleticism and hard-working effort of the film's tap-dancing stars.</p>

<p>The giddy use of the new plastics and particularly of the candy-wrapping cellophane had, though, its detractors. <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> published a satirical image called "The Cellophane Gown" by Gilbert Seehausen in 1933 [<a name="5-text" href="#5">re 5</a>], the first year of the magazine's publication. The 1933 Chicago World's Fair (branded as "The Century of Progress") was the instigator of the image, as the above caption makes clear. In the image, a shapely model smiles as she poses in high heels wearing an extravagant and entirely transparent cellophane gown. Richly gathered folds of cellophane fall behind her, a ruffle of cellophane fans about her shoulders, and what looks to be a cellophane tiara tell us that this outfit is a version of the modern ball-gown: she is a fairy queen, though an immodest one. On closer inspection, one notices some complicating details: the gown's full skirt resembles a grass skirt belted with flowers, a flower lei is draped about the woman's neck, a bra or bikini-top is visible. Is this another modern-day primitive posed against an ultra-modern setting? Behind the smiling model, an array of skyscrapers <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  fan away from her. She balances like a beauty queen, rising up in the metropolis in all her plastic glory: Jane of the urban jungle. The image captures the recognition that plastics are on the rise, taking the city by storm, and by seduction.</p>

<p>If cellophane connoted everything modern, it shared all the failures of the modern age, including its vulgar consumerism, its reliance on the rhetoric of "progress," and its overt commodification of sex. E. B. White, in the same year as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> image appeared, wrote an impassioned pamphlet called "Alice Through the Cellophane" that bewailed the shallow commodity culture that had seemed to enwrap the public's mind and threatened society with a kind of consumer-culture asphyxiation: "The revolution began with cellophane," he complains; people are "intrigued with its new transparencies," and driven to accumulate, egged on by the empty promises of ambitious industrialists. White makes clear that "[he] should like to propose a society based on the assumption that nobody is going to buy anything, ever again."<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Cellophane, for White, stands in for all that has gone awry in a society recently impoverished and nevertheless obsessed with its purchasing power: "I can imagine no more tender or healthy sight than a group of little children making the cellophane plant rewind all the little rolls of transparent wrapping material at the end of the day, like a spider eating his own rope."<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> White imagines children, presumably untouched by the corrupt influence of plastic (unlike today's children whose toys seem exclusively made of plastic) to be the disciplinary parents, making the cellophane plant rewind all its glittery, candy-like product for the good of the adults. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The glamour of the new products couldn't last. Plastics entered into a new phase of mass production during the war and a dawning recognition of the environmental costs of the explosion of cheap disposable products chilled the utopian dreams once inspired by the alchemical marvel. What had seemed the magic of its immortal qualities, now acquired new meanings as the non-degrading plastic waste claimed more and more space. The sublime delight at the universe of possibility associated with plastics production became sublime terror at the sheer magnitude of disposal. And the semiotics shifted: what once appeared new, glamorous, and a link to the modern design world, was now cheap, disposable, and a sign of impoverishment, ranging from that of the natural world to the world of culture. Of this fall from the giddy heights of early production to the backs of our cupboards and the garbage dumps, Roland Barthes remarks: "Plastic has climbed down, it is a household material. It is the first magical substance which consents to be prosaic."<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Like the ageing star, cellophane could not hide its defects (its toxicity, its yellowing in time), nor maintain its glamour.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">CODA: Cellophane Futures</h1>
<p>I want to close by considering three more recent expressions of cellophane fashion in dress-form. Each tells us, in one way or another, how far we've come from the modernist aesthetic that celebrated the power of transparency, blankness, the dress as an empty sign. First, a Leonard Joseph design from 1968: one wouldn't guess this dress was made from cellophane, embellished as it is with gold and laden with sequins. The dress may be made of plastic, but it appears in masquerade, hardly announcing its industrial raw material. Cellophane is mere "idea" here: it carries the dress but holds onto none of its identifying features. Certainly there is no celebration of plastic in this richly textured gold shift. Instead the dress connotes a kind of luxurious royalty, à propos of the royal who wore it, "fashion icon" Lee Radziwill.</p>
<p>Second, a 2003 Givenchy Couture show featured a cellophane gown as elaborate as the 1933 <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> image: one reviewer, clearly delighted, wrote: "[Givenchy designer Julien Macdonald] threw caution to the wind only once, when a giant gown of iridescent ruffled cellophane blew along the runway."<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Yet, this gown takes up deep rich color, works with an opaque palette that resembles the rainbow of an oil-slick, and does not use, for its effects, the utopian blankness of the cellulose material. Here the vision is one of excess, a colorized plastic canvas, producing an extreme combination of vamp and vampiric, darkly threatening with lacy accents. The cellophane continues to connote deathliness, mirrored in the blank indifference of the runway model's expression, yet the Givenchy gown reaches back to a prior age, literalizing in its design the threat of plastics as a dangerous seduction.</p>
<p>Finally, a photograph from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Honolulu Star Bulletin</span>, Feb. 12, 2002, pictures a statue of Queen Kapiolani wrapped up in what could be a plastic sarong. The caption reads: "No, this isn't the latest cellophane gown from the avant-garde designers in Paris. The statue of Queen Kapiolani was wrapped up in plastic yesterday as workmen began preparations for a flower bed." Prosaic indeed: here the plastic serves only to protect <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">the queen from the mud that surrounds her as two men labor at her feet. The image echoes, in remarkable ways, the primitive <span style="font-style:italic;">moderne</span>—Thompson's African-American cast, the female chorus of <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadway Melody</span>, and the transparently clad model of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> image—yet it tells us that plastic as image no longer has any cultural power. As the emperor to his clothes, the queen to her plastic wrap: this time, however, the nothing is simply that, serving no metaphor, no artistic movement, no galvanizing aesthetic. The Nothing, the conceptual abyss that motivated so much of the work of modernism, disappears in these more recent uses of cellophane. Modernism had attempted to respond to the gaping center with its insistently gorgeous prose, its attention to the effects of a carefully contrived surface, and its own deployment of a glamour that might transfix the reader and thus transform an age. We might remember Stein's words: "And each of us in our way are bound to express what the world in which we are living is doing."<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> In 1934, when she said this, she referred to the sweeping effects of the cinema on human subjectivity. She might also have been referring to the plastics that were coming to redefine the meaning of "continuous present."</p>

Wells's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Time Machine</span>: "Any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have length, breadth, thickness and duration . . . .There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of space, and a fourth, time.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Under Cellophane Skies</h1>
<p>As the curtains opened on the avant-garde opera event of 1934, Virgil Thompson and Gertrude Stein's <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span>, the audience faced a vast sign of the production's cutting edge modernity: 1500 square feet of sky-blue cellophane was draped from the sides and ceiling of the stage, creating a semi-transparent cyclorama, glittering under bright white lights. The stark artificiality of the stage design proclaimed its relationship to the modern world and its unsurpassed hold on the new: "The cellophane set, brilliantly lit to evoke a sky hung with rock crystal, defied comparison to anything the audience had ever seen."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The set and costume designer was Florine Stettheimer, a New York painter whose close friends included Marcel Duchamp and Carl Van Vechten, and whose paintings were characterized by their light-infused surfaces and whimsical approach to their subjects (her style was sometimes called "primitive <span style="font-style:italic;">moderne</span>"<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a>). Stettheimer had never ventured into the world of stage or costume design before <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> (and wouldn't again), but her efforts were met with critical acclaim for her spectacular vision: "some thought that [her] costumes outdid the Ziegfeld Follies, and one quipped that the sets were 'Botticellophane.'"<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Plastic, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  that most twentieth-century of materials, here transformed the stage into a powerful blend of art, glamour, and the latest technology.</p>

<p>We've lost, in the intervening decades, the ability to read the early-century semiotics of plastics, and particularly of cellophane. Stettheimer's stage today, rather than looking sleek and streamlined, appears hung with the cheap plastic that wraps mattresses or other bulky household items for shipping. But what did cellophane signify? Why was it taken up not only by Stettheimer, but by the designers of lavish Hollywood musical sets and their promoters? Cellophane appears throughout popular culture in the 1920s and 1930s, generally signifying the slickly modern. Cellophane tablecloths glitter in an upscale nightclub in the Astaire-Rogers blockbuster <span style="font-style:italic;">Swing Time</span> ; cellophane also appears in an earlier Joan Crawford film, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dancing Lady</span> , in the transparent swags at the back of a dance set, and again in the Broadway musical staged within the film. Here, the cellophane appears in costume-form: a group of black-attired old women, complete with bonnets, lace collars, wire glasses, and bent-over backs make their way into a futuristic beauty parlor and emerge as modern bombshells, perfectly artificial with cellophane outfits and what might be plastic hair. Cellophane similarly appears in a swanky Chinese nightclub as the "The Girls in Cellophane" take the stage in W.C. Fields' <span style="font-style:italic;">International House</span> . Cellophane was chic and, above all, <span style="font-style:italic;">now</span>.</p>
<p>How could this plastic sheeting have connoted glamour for 1930s audiences? From its first American appearance in 1931 as the revolutionary new moisture-proof wrapper of Camel cigarettes, cellophane was an undisputed success, standing out "as the lone spot of brilliance in the otherwise dismal commercial landscape of the Depression."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">Cellophane served as a cultural reference with greater significance than the mere freshness of cigarettes: it inspired a new packaging aesthetic as well as an intensified relationship of desire between consumer and product. And the aesthetic clearly went beyond the mundane glamour of such luxuries as tobacco products. Cellophane proved <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to be a cultural force: besides appearing on the avant-garde stage, the MGM musical set, and as a backdrop to celebrity photographs, it evoked commentary of one sort or another in the pages of magazines such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Fortune, Esquire</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Yorker</span>. Even Cole Porter equaled it to Spanish nights, great art, and Garbo's salary in his 1934 hit "You're the Top" ("You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain / You're the National Gallery / You're Garbo's salary / You're cellophane!"). Cellophane was linked with glamour in its earliest marketing; one of its first advertisements announced "glamorous new transparent cellulose sheeting." Somehow, this tag line fails to convince, but historian Stephen Fenichell writes that "cellophane was defining itself as a carriage-trade product, a shimmering jewel in sheet form, the epitome of elegance and glamour in the new commercial art form called packaging."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> And customers were buying.</p>
<p>The development of plastic coincided with the Machine Age interest in streamlined design, clean lines, and the spareness that characterized modern buildings, furniture, industrial design, and so on. The prevailing design aesthetic of the early 1930s was "low, horizontal, sculptural, flowing, [and] evocative of speed"; the "streamlined design reflected the desire for frictionless flight into a utopian future whose rounded vehicles, machines and architecture would provide a visually uncomplicated protective environment . . . closed off from the Depression and marked by static perfection."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Plastics seemed to offer a thoroughly modern medium with the magical power of transmuting and perfecting form. Paul Frankl, one of a group of self-proclaimed "industrial designers" and author of several books based on the principles of Machine Age design, exclaimed: "The new alchemy! The very name invented by twentieth-century necromancers rivals those mystical elixirs of the Middle Ages! Cellophane, pyroxolia, karolyth, aladdinite, pyrolin, amerith, durez!. . . .They are truly the founders of a new language of industrial design."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> The language of synthetic chemistry—the plastics that inspired the designer's imagination—borrows its vocabulary from shape-shifting, magic, and the plasticity of language itself in a mélange that connotes glamour.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Frankl exhorted the public to employ this "new idiom," this "new alphabet" in order to learn its "unprecedented syntax."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Plastics, or "materia nova," provided a modern vernacular that could speak directly to the twentieth century and its miraculously transforming technologies. In speaking this language, one participated in its mysterious alchemy and helped to ensure its utopian results. The new plastics made one, above all, modern. American leisure, Frankl exuberantly proclaimed, must be "wrapped in cellophane!"<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Leisure, the time made available by machine labor, should be aesthetically brilliant, impervious to the elements, artificial in all the best senses of the word. <span style="font-style:italic;">Fortune</span> magazine declared that "the synthetic plastic . . . is a glamorous substance and a tribute to the powers of man"<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> and Frankl exhorted his readers to wrap themselves up in those powers, make themselves over in a shiny new substance, and celebrate the virtuosity of a transparent plastic coating.</p>
<p>I'm interested in cellophane as pure surface, as the plastic without depth that provides the transparent gloss and promises to perfect one's leisure, at least aesthetically. The paper-thin, impermeable layer of cellulose sheeting offered the modern imagination new ways of seeing the mundane world: the glassy sheen of cellophane provided a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  protective veneer from dusty reality and, like lightweight and mobile glass, cellophane could wrap anything and thus transform it into a sparkling play of light. Cellophane arrests the gaze at its glittering surface, becomes a version of the photograph, emptied of content or form. This would be a photograph without any representative function, but rather a blank surface that is endlessly appealing, seductive, though it transmits little beyond the wonder of its alchemy. Perhaps it was this blankness that Stettheimer wished to exploit as she planned her cellophane sky and the cellophane robes that some of the actors would wear. Reviewer Joseph Wood Krutch corroborates the empty effects of Stettheimer's cellophane set, claiming that "<span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span> is a success because all its elements—the dialogue, the music, the pantomime, and the sparkling cellophane décor—go so well with one another while remaining totally irrelevant to life, logic, or common sense. . . . One will find [like <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>] . . . the tendency toward form without content and toward a kind of intelligibility without meaning characteristic of surrealism and the Dadaists."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The comment is directed toward the combined effects of the opera's elements, but it certainly speaks to the function of cellophane on the stage itself. Empty of anything but the barest form, the draped cellulose film is irrelevant to life or logic, and offers nothing in the way of meaning. The empty effect was emphasized by the bright white lights that Stettheimer insisted should illuminate the gathered cellophane and made it shine like some artificial and other-worldly sky. Krutch deftly makes the link, then, between the work of cellophane and the more lofty literary modernism that emerged in the preceding decade. As pure form, or form without content, cellophane stands in, at least superficially, for some modernist formal ideals. Crisp, smooth, clear, hygienic, even icy in appearance, cellophane was a wonder wrapping and metaphor for language re-made, removed of all its "words worn thin."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> While Stein had nothing to do with the concept behind the set design, the cellophane seemed to suit, perfectly, her approach to writing.</p>
<p>For Stein, neither memory nor representation had any place in writing; instead her writing would gather its force from vibrant word juxtapositions in the flattened moment of what she termed the "continuous present."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Flatness was a consistent aesthetic priority for Stein, from the time she wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span> in 1913 to her lectures presented on her return trip to the U.S. in 1934, just following the opening of <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span>. In one of these lectures, "Plays," she refers to <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> as a sort of unmoving landscape: "A landscape does not move nothing really moves in a landscape but things are there, and I put into the play the things that were there." She continues: "Magpies are in the landscape that is they are in the sky of a landscape . . . they hold themselves up and down and look flat against the sky."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> The reader, or audience member, would be invited, then, into this flattened landscape, to experience a single plane or flattened moment rather than the progressive diachronic demands of typical dramatic narrative. Stein asserts, again in keeping with the formal innovation and transparent surface of cellophane: "After all, my thought is a complicated simplicity. I like a thing simple, but it must be simple through complication."<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Cellophane offers one version of this complicated simplicity, its empty surface reflecting a complex synthetic chemistry and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  an experimental history that spanned decades. Formal experiment defines more generally the early decades of twentieth-century literature, and certainly no re looms larger than Gertrude Stein's.</p>
<p>The production of <span style="font-style:italic;">Fours Saints in Three Acts</span> thus offers a unique opportunity to consider the relationship between modernism and the new synthetic materials of the twentieth century. One might even think of cellophane as the objective (and material) correlative to many of the aims of modernism: as an almost substance-less substance, it resonates with Stein's project to drain the signifier of its signification; it harnesses a new generation to consider the impact of the surface through an attention to form (rather than a singular focus on content); it also speaks to an increasing concern with hygiene, both in the realms of public health (preventing the contamination of food) and aesthetics (encouraging the "clean" line, shorn of all superfluous words).<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Cellophane, then, as a sign of the new, offered modernists a material with all the plasticity and possibility of language; Stettheimer's set design and Stein's text together spoke in the century's new vernacular, insistently contemporary, to an audience delighted to hear the message.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Plastic and "Limitless Control"</h1>
<p>In order to understand the excitement generated by Stettheimer's set, it helps to understand something of the drama that produced it. Cellophane is, of course, first and foremost a consumer item whose role has been largely played out <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> in the world of design, literature, or avant-garde opera, but in the manufacturing sector and marketing campaigns of such companies as Camel, Lucky Strike, Coty perfumes, and Whitman's chocolates. Its history begins in 1904 when a Swiss chemist worked to invent a waterproof tablecloth. This particular venture failed, but in the process Dr. Jacques Brandenberger created a method of producing transparent sheets of viscose film. He would form a company in 1913 called "La cellophane" (a combination of the Greek <span style="font-style:italic;">kellon</span> for "wood" and <span style="font-style:italic;">phaino</span>, or "to be seen")<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> with the goal of producing a new film stock, an alternative to the highly flammable cellulose nitrate. Again, this venture would fail (the film wasn't, after all, impervious to heat), but Brandenberger would continue to develop his synthetic film as a wrapping material, first selling it as an expensive luxury wrapper to Coty perfumes in the early 1920s. The company began production in the U.S. in 1924 and became a familiar household product with the break-through development of the "humidor pack" for cigarettes in 1930.</p>
<p>The development of cellophane occurs against the broader backdrop of a rapidly expanding plastics industry. Plastics were nothing if not diverse—they ranged from thermo-setting plastics (phenolic resins, cast phenolic, urea resins), thermoplastics (cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate, acrylic resins, polystyrene), and protein plastics (made from casein)—and included such revolutionary materials as celluloid, Bakelite, nylon, and cellophane. Plastics offered industrial designers a new material with unlimited opportunities unhampered by the various challenges of designing in wood, metal, or glass as one enthusiastic commentator on the development of plastics writes: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  "From all these limitations, imposed by the nature of materials, the designer is now free. Plastics have given him a new and almost unbelievable liberty for experiment and expression."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Now a "limitless control of material"<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> defined the designer's idiom and created a utopia of infinite design potential. The idea of infinity bedazzled the growing numbers of modernist designers, whose art would no longer be made to suffer the tyrannical control of natural materials. The "materia nova" offered unfettered access to the creative imagination without the limits imposed by the bends and warps of wood, its narrow range of color, or its limited availability as a natural resource; in this way, plastic was the most impersonal of materials, unmarred by any idiosyncracy, even untouched by human hands. It epitomized another kind of modernist ideal, then, in its cool, aloof distance from the subjective world of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>By the late 1920s, plastics production incorporated modernist design principles, although the history of plastics long predates modernism. The earliest patent of a plastic material was granted in 1855; celluloid proved to be an excellent material for fabricating billiard balls, piano keys, and various other items to resemble ivory, bone, horn, marble, or tortoiseshell. This penchant for imitation aligned celluloid with a distinctly Victorian aesthetic; not only could the nitrocellulose material be formed into highly ornamented household objects that previously only the wealthiest could afford, but its disguise pre-empted any anxiety around the newness and radical innovation of the product.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Plastics, in the guise of age-old natural products, threatened no one and thus conservative public tastes would not bar its financial success. It wasn't until the 1920s, writes Jeffrey Meikle, that the "modernist disdain for imitation as dishonest and immoral"<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> influenced the way that celluloid was produced and promoted. Those household objects such as brushes and combs were now characterized for consumers as "so radically different, so smart and so modern"<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> and did not hide the fact of their industrial production. Instead they were streamlined, designed according to function rather than according to what modernists perceived as the fussy standards of nineteenth-century ornamentation. The aesthetic of spareness (what Ezra Pound made into a kind of poetic hygiene in his principles of imagism)<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> becomes visible a decade later then on the toilet table and in the pantry.</p>
<p>Celluloid would soon lose ground to the multiple new kinds of plastics that were emerging. Meikle writes that "celebration of an approaching 'plastic age' reflected the euphoria of the industry's executives in the 1920s and 1930s. In a few short years they had witnessed their field's expansion beyond the limited materials and methods of celluloid."<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> A 1929 plastics directory, he continues, lists 84 trade names; in 1933 that number doubles, and more than triples by 1939. The amazing growth in the patenting and manufacture of plastics provided a new alphabet, indeed, for those interested in creating a new aesthetic, which would become particularly relevant for a culture making the transition from the economic boom-times of the 1920s to the tightly constrained financial climate of the 1930s. Plastics offered radically democratized access to the products of cutting-edge design: with improved manufacturing processes, plastics could be affordable for a great section of the population who wanted to share in, or speak with, this new and luxurious vernacular. Elite design and middle class incomes coincided for perhaps the first time as the Plastic Age was ushered excitedly in. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Glamour continued to be linked with plastics, both in the world of elite design and in the more everyday world of consumer goods. A 1940 issue of the trade magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Plastics</span>, for example, makes this connection in an article entitled "Vending Machine Glamour." Plastic pulls the "silent salesman" (that is, the vending machine) out of awkward adolescence and into a mature and sexy adulthood: "To the vending machine industry the plastics have given the color and brightness which is helping to transform its products from the awkward appearance of yesterday into the <span style="font-style:italic;">glamour boys</span> of today and tomorrow" (italics in original).<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> The article declares the incipient manifest destiny of this industrial marvel:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>In the ingenious and sometimes spectacular applications of plastics to more and more diversified groups of products and uses, each invasion into a new industry constitutes a chapter of singular importance. Frequently, in fact, an entire industry may gravitate in their direction and the plastics find themselves established in a new field almost overnight. That such annexation of new territory sometimes occurs in exposed and unexpected fields only makes the advance more colorful and interesting.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>As the language indicates, plastics were sweeping the landscape, conquering new and unexpected lands in a mission to liberate and beautify. The colonizing metaphor isn't, in retrospect, so far-fetched: the "freedom" and "limitless control" celebrated by Frankl reappear here in the gleeful tone of an industry recognizing the potential for limitless expansion and therefore limitless profit. The partnership of glamour and the colonial impulse, like that of glamour and the primitive, becomes a recognizable trope in the 1930s. Just as the age of colonial empire was coming to a close, an age of global industrial expansion was opening up. A universe of commercial possibilities came with it, including at times—despite Frankl's excitement about a new vernacular—a borrowed vocabulary from the more tarnished language of empire (though polished up for its new medium). <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Plastics</span> recognized the industry's bright future with its "glamour boys" advancing on the front lines, poised to bring home the sale.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Race for Plastics</h1>
<p>Enter into this climate of euphoric executives, ecstatic designers, and an emergent consuming public, the collaborative Thompson-Stein (and I will add -Stettheimer) venture, <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span>. Exploiting the vogue for everything African, Thompson had decided to use an all African-American cast for the production, claiming (somewhat disingenuously) that the superior diction of African Americans made them the best choice for the difficult language of Stein's libretto: "They alone possess the dignity and the poise, the lack of self-consciousness that proper interpretation of the opera demands. They have the rich, resonant voices essential to the singing of my music and the clear enunciation required to deliver Gertrude's text."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Van Vechten, surprisingly, given his penchant for all things Negro (he was, after all, situated at the center of the Harlem Renaissance as patron, cheerleader, photographer, and a writer of some infamy <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  after the publication of his novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>)<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> disapproved of Thompson's choice, believing that Stein's text had nothing to do with African Americans. Stettheimer also expressed her apprehension on aesthetic grounds, worrying that the "varied brown skin tones would sully the brilliant colors of her costumes"; she consequently (and apparently seriously) "proposed painting the cast white or silver."<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> The artist, whose aesthetic interests ranged from extravagant Victorian landscapes of lace to the more austere modernity of cellophane (her own apartment was decorated in draping lace and cellophane), would incorporate both materials, creating formal costumes against the wondrous vacancy of the surrounding cellophane skies.</p>
<p>When Stein herself heard of the plan to costume the black actors in cellophane, she also expressed grave doubts about maintaining the integrity of her text: "I suppose they have good reasons for using negro singers instead of white, there are certain obvious ones, but I do not care for the idea of showing the negro bodies, it is too much what the English in what they call 'modernistic' novels call futuristic and do not accord with the words and music to my mind."<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Stein apparently worried about the clash between the false futurity of the falsely modern, and her own truly modern prose of the "continuous present," a prose that had brought literature, she claimed, into the twentieth century. She made this claim about the appearance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span>, its central story "Melanctha," of course, exploiting the fascination with African masks and African American stereotypes (the story explicitly circles around Melanctha's insatiable desire as she learns to gather "wisdom" or sexual knowledge). Stein was certainly invested in representations of race—as many critical works on her explore—but in <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span>, she claimed, her interest was elsewhere.</p>
<p>Carl Van Vechten's assertion that <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> had nothing to do with African Americans seems reasonable. The opera focuses on two sixteenth-century Spanish saints, Ignatius and Therese, and is, like much of Stein's work, difficult to paraphrase neatly. The four saints of the title number more like twenty, and there are four or even five acts, rather than the promised three. The word "negro" appears twice within the text, though the use is arguably glancing: "Saint Therese. Could a negro be with a beard to see and to be. / Saint Therese. Never have to have seen a negro there and with it so."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Stein distinguishes seeing and being, producing categories of difference, and opposing ontology to superficial appearance. The "negro," with visible beard, is <span style="font-style:italic;">there</span> to see, embodied and ontologically unquestionable, despite the question form of the line itself. Eight lines later the scene ends with "Saint Therese come again to be absent." While the negro emphatically, or at least doubly, is said to "be," Therese herself comes again (in the voice of the continuous present), reappears, but only in her absence, de-realized in the visual realization of the negro. The embodiedness of the "negro," in these lines, is counterpoised to the absent body of the saint (who is paradoxically there and not there). In this sense, one sees that "being" is bestowed upon the African American (who is not absent) here; Stein uses the idea–that is, borrows the popular stereotype—that the African American is all body, closer to nature, and thus becomes the re for embodiment altogether (as she had when she created the character of Melanctha). The body of culture, on the other hand, is represented by the saint who <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is present only in her absence, in the luminosity of her halo, and who occupies the space of idea rather than any sort of solid physicality. Thompson may have reflected on these lines as he made his casting decision, but it seems more likely that he was working within a milieu that appreciated the avant-garde implications of using a cast of African-American opera singers; he was also banking on the guaranteed notoriety this would bring to the production (<span style="font-style:italic;">Porgy and Bess</span>, George Gershwin's opera featuring an African-American cast, would premiere the following year, in 1935).</p>
<p>It has been suggested that it was the prurience, if not the notoriety (she seemed comfortable with this) of showing bodies beneath cellophane that concerned Stein in the Stettheimer design, although these robes would, in the end, be worn over richly ornamented costumes (even the hands of the cast would be chastely covered with white gloves, combining two popular images of African Americans as minstrels and devout churchgoers). According to Steven Watson, "Only in the opera's 'sniplets,' as choreographer Frederick Ashton dubbed the two fleshly <span style="font-style:italic;">divertissements</span>, did the dancers reveal flesh. One of these, a dance in the second act about six angels learning to fly, featured women with bare midriffs, the shortest of skirts, and bare-chested, bare-legged men."<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Watson adds a comment on the overall effect of the casting and set design: "At just the right moment, <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span> offered a casting revolution, daring and inevitable, at once libidinous and prim, wrapped up in a gauzy candy box of a setting." This, the aesthetic of primitive <span style="font-style:italic;">moderne</span>, best characterized the opera's overall look: if there was a race for plastic, it was the African race, and in that juxtaposition the production achieved a winning effect, at least as far as the artistically minded of 1934 were concerned. The black body, at least for avant-garde audiences, signified some proximity to nature and the <span style="font-style:italic;">feeling</span> that modern culture (that is "civilization") denied its subjects. The cellophane stage, then, represented a sort of reality principle: its cold swags, reflecting the bare bright lights, produced a riveting and modern blankness. The cast members, in all the ontological <span style="font-style:italic;">presence</span> accorded the African American, appeared in relief against the modern and deeply compelling absence of the set (and against the disembodied <span style="font-style:italic;">absence</span> of the "civilized" and thus white modern subject who didn't appear at all on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> stage). The modern script that accepted the civilized/primitive binary held true, then, even on the avant-garde stage. Modernity, represented by the manufactured plastic sky, is here aligned with death or stasis, in contradistinction to the life force of the African-American cast on stage.</p>
<p>Here we see glamour as both depending upon and rejecting the other, recognizing difference as the thrill of transgression. Glamour, emerging from the new technologies signified by the appearance of plastic, the sexual availability that glamour promises and withdraws, and the implicit exclusions on which it is based, is thus founded on a paradox. The racial dividing line on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span> stage marked a distinction between life—represented in the casting decision—and death, here associated with civilization and its industrial production. Cellophane, invented in an exhilarated rush of entrepreneurial energy and embraced by a generation of artists who recognized in it the sign of the new, works in conjunction, then, with death. If, as Freud succinctly claimed in 1920 when he introduced his theory of the death drive, "the aim of all life <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is death," the mass of cellophane hanging over the stage was a harbinger of that in evitable return to an earlier state of matter<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a>. Death was thus inscribed on the stage, presented against the vitality of the opera's performers, singing against the chasm, or the void that defines human life.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Regarding Nothing</h1>
<p>While blankness, absence, and transparency are not unique to the text and staging of <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span>, they produced a particularly timely demonstration of its impact on the modern stage and on the modern subject. Absence, and its suggestion of a greater Nothing, appears repeatedly in the literature of the period as a defining trope of the modern. Modernist literature often swirls around a central and structuring abyss: one thinks of the meaning-collapsing darkness of the Marabar Caves in <span style="font-style:italic;">Passage to India</span>, Caddy's painful absence in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sound and the Fury</span>, the circular wandering and central lack of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sun Also Rises</span>, the missing main character of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>, or the terrifying Nothing that characterizes the work of Beckett and Kafka. This structural emptiness reflects the anxiety of a world no longer able to rely on reason, a world in which, as Heidegger characterizes it, "we hover in anxiety"<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> against a defining Nothing. Nothing is the formless void, yet even "void" suggests its status as object. It is without form, without status in our world of nouns. "Nothing" may be interpreted in numerous registers, from the psychoanalytic (one thinks of Lacan's Thing, that zone around which desire endlessly circles, the vortex or vacuole linked to the failure of language and representation, the space that stands for all we have lost in the transition from infancy), to the existential, to the metaphysical and theological. Even a generation after Nietzsche, the modernist age continued to be characterized by the <span style="font-style:italic;">nihil</span> and the death of god. In god's place, as Marxist theory argues, was the growing fetishization of the commodity: plastic, produced in the magic of synthetic chemistry and met with the public's perpetual wonder, takes up its place as fetish, then, despite the blankness of its surface.</p>
<p>But blankness isn't, after all, identical to nothing. Blankness, particularly the blankness of cellophane, merely comes to represent the nothing through the emptiness of its surface. It isn't nothing, but signifies, or better gestures toward, the nothing that generates so much anxious modernism (Eliot's paradigmatic line, "I can connect / Nothing with nothing" comes to mind<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a>). Rather than ask cellophane to bear the weight of these significant philosophical enquiries into the nothing, I simply want to invoke its power on Stettheimer's stage as metaphoric, as speaking through its shallow and shiny surface to a culture quietly hovering in the anxiety of historical change, a questionable hold on reason, and dizzying technological development. This affective response, one might note, echoes the effect of the sublime, characterized by the bewildered response to something incomprehensibly vast, outside the individual's powers of reason to contain it. Blankness, without the delimiting detail, presented the vastness of scope that the sublime generally indicates. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In his work on the sublime, artist and art critic Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe points out the growing use of blankness as a signifier in the early twentieth century:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The passage from the Victorians to modernism and beyond is one which leads from a <span style="font-style:italic;">horror vacui</span> to a displayed blankness. . . . transparency was also close to the idea of the instantaneous, whereas detail is a matter of duration, and this is the sense in which the kind of modernism grounded in an absolute substitution of transparency for detail and plenitude may be seen as a transitional period between what it despised and what takes it for granted. Before modernism, accumulation and detail, after it, blankness.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Gilbert-Rolfe suggests that transparency, here synonymous with blankness (a point to which I will return below), becomes a wider cultural ideal and signifier for all that is modern. Transparency provides a new way into time itself, which was being newly and constantly theorized during the modernist era. "Duration," in Gilbert-Rolfe's usage, is not to be confused with the Bergsonian "durée" which describes the experience of time as outside of chronology, overlaying past, present, and future in a single and simultaneous moment. The "modernist moment," the arresting of an instant in the rush of the crowded events of historical time, provided a way to open up and understand experiential time outside the tyranny of chronology. Like the instantaneous, Stein's continuous present and James Joyce's "fluid succession of presents" (a concept much like Stein's notion and produced at roughly the same time) bespeak an intimate relationship to the modernist experimentation with and theorization of the "fourth dimension."<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Captured in the transparent skies of Stettheimer's set was a vision into a complexly realized and dramatically flattened time. Her billowing sky, then, suggests this multiply constituted nothing, the window that offers no information except the glean of its own blankly transparent surface.</p>
<p>Transparency and blankness, although apparently analogous, in fact operate in different registers. Transparency relies on the logic of consumer desire: the clean, see-through material that appeared to consumers in the early 1930s offered both an unimpeded view of the product and an additional sheen that improved its appearance; its smooth, glossy surface created a relationship of desire, acting as tantalizingly flimsy barrier, between consumer and good. Transparency thus encouraged consumption through a series of promises, from the cleanliness and good health of the product to the style and modernity of its package.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Blankness, however, works on a much vaster scale and doesn't engage the desires produced by consumer goods; rather, blankness points to absence, and to the terrifying and exhilarating void that eighteenth-century theorists elaborated in their works on the sublime. Gilbert-Rolfe is most interested in charting the shifting significations of blankness through the Victorian period up to the contemporary moment. He writes: "Where [blankness] once marked the absence of the sign by being a sign for absence, it is now the sign of an invisible and ubiquitous technological presence."<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> He describes the meaning of blankness at both ends of this short historical spectrum from the realm of crowded visual detail to the silent hum of the electrical (or digital) current: for the Victorians, blankness was absence, the space to be (anxiously) filled. Blankness was not a desirable condition, but one to be <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  addressed (thus the ubiquitous wallpaper of the era). In the contemporary moment (Gilbert-Rolfe is writing in the last breath of the twentieth century), blankness itself is the sign, blankness speaks, it is "eloquent" rather than silent. Blankness today, he argues, finds expression in excess (an excess linked to the electronic and digital age) rather than absence.</p>
<p>Modernism is importantly situated between these two understandings of blankness. Gilbert-Rolfe uses the modern period in its transitional importance, as a moment of shedding the earlier demand for detail and an increasing desire for the blank surface. Yet the point shouldn't be skimmed over lightly: hardly a passive transitional period, modernism defiantly took up the empty, the blank, or the transparent, projecting it as a historical condition and aesthetic ideal. Particularly fascinating is how in the modern period, blankness was <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> the absence of any variety of things—spanning a vast categorical range from ornament to metaphysical values—<span style="font-style:italic;">and also</span>, in the re of cellophane, the sign of a newly ubiquitous, or a swiftly becoming ubiquitous, technological presence. It is the both/and that fascinates me here—how blankness during the modern period signified absence (in the form of things lost or cast off) <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> presence in the form of the overwhelming recognition of technological power. Gilbert-Rolfe refers to the pervasive techno-presence associated with the age of computer technology; cellophane, rather, and particularly on Stettheimer's stage (and also on the Hollywood set as I will discuss below), suggests the overarching, all-encompassing presence of the technologies born out of synthetic chemistry—these audiences could have no idea just how thoroughly plastic would permeate their lives, even eventually their bodies—via its consumer-driven products. Nevertheless, its blank surface, shimmering innocently (that is, as if to bear no message) in the bright lights, one might experience the vastness of its import, a recognition of the exponentially increasing power of technology over the puny human subject, and in this sense a sublime in which, as Gilbert-Rolfe argues, the infinite nature of technology replaces the formerly infinite nature of nature itself.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, nature is outdone by the velocity of technological development as Walter Benjamin has famously noted;<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> caught up in the tremendous surge of its power, the modern subject experiences a newly revised sublime. The power, one should remember, comes from chemistry, the science that shares in the magic of alchemy and shape-shifting. With the recognition that the physical universe was alterable through the new capacity to change its physical properties, anything seemed possible. The force of this revolutionary technology overtakes and carries along everything in its path—nature will not look the same again, once the industrial world has allied itself with sweeping technological change, and a new era of mass production has begun. This is more visible to us now, having the whole of the century to observe at once, but in the 1930s, technological potential was thrilling (as was the idea of conquering nature), though mixed with the anxiety that accompanies any such sweeping change and encounter with "magic."</p>
<p>Art deco design worked to maximize the tension between the blank quiet of smooth lines and white surfaces and the impending explosion of the technologized world. Van Nest Polglase, the designer behind the beautifully stark sets of the Astaire-Rogers <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  films, developed "the fixed architectural institution that soon became known as the B.W.S. (Big White Set)."<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> The signature look was one of white on white to emphasize the smooth harmony and open space of the set: "Bodies, or rather costumes, which also formed an essential part of this environment, had to be streamlined even when standing still" which added to the "total, smooth environment" of the set.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> Gloss was a premium feature of the design, and Polglase employed plastics (particularly Bakelite) to produce gleaming dance floors. The result was a calmly static set, although Polglase also exploited the effect of circles against angles to "suggest the springs and spokes of a machine, or, more abstractly, the contrast between movement and stillness."<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Polglase featured cellophane in the 1936 film <span style="font-style:italic;">Swing Time</span>, as I mentioned earlier, creating a set that was clearly artificial (even ironically so with the cellophane-clad glamour girls) and streamlined to heighten the effect of the dancers. Technology was quietly visible on stage, although the expanses of cellophane suggested calm stasis over the noise associated with industry. This was Hollywood magic at its purest, combining the beautifully engineered with the veneer of impenetrable beauty.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the greatest displays of Hollywood alchemy, and one that explicitly linked technology with the infinite, was the extravagant 6500 square foot set constructed for the final dance sequence of the Fred Astaire/Eleanor Powell musical, <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadway Melody of 1940</span>. This was the largest set ever constructed for a dance sequence and gathered all the forces of Hollywood technical wizardry. Ann Miller recalls its massive mirrored glass floor and "midnight blue cyclorama wired with 10,000 light bulbs for stars."<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> Thirty-foot mirrors multiplied the set's effect as they reflected the light, the dancers, and produced an effect of infinite depth. A giant curtain of thinly sliced cellophane hung toward the back of the set, and through it the seemingly innumerable stars shone. Twenty-five foot palm trees, also constructed from sliced cellophane, completed the effect of a desert oasis, their cellophane fronds hanging sleekly over the whole set. The Merrill Pye art deco design emphasized the seemingly infinite space, the palm trees and stars visible on every surface, producing an effect that was "clean," "slick," and entirely comprised of "shimmering surfaces."</p>
<p>The final extended dance sequence begins as a woman in sarong and head-wrap sings Cole Porter's "Begin the Beguine" in a sultry style of music appropriate to the tropical setting. The actress here is Carmen D'Antonio, though the singing is dubbed (the vocals are by Lois Hodnett). D'Antonio's filmography indicates that she worked, for the most part, as a secondary player, cast as a dancer and "harem girl," "native girl," servant to Salome, the "treasure of Kalifa," and an "Oriental dream" (she even once played the Puerto Rican love interest of Uncle Bill on the 1960s television series "Family Affair"). She offered Hollywood a pretty and generic otherness that could authenticate its fantasies of Singapore, Arabia, or Morocco. In this Astaire/Powell vehicle, D'Antonio provides an exotic and old-world counterpoint to the sleek Plastic Age features of the set. A chorus of women appears like a dreamy harem in beautifully flowing costumes, their mid-riffs bare as they sway to the sensual music. A gauzy curtain parts to reveal the cellophane trees and behind them, the shimmering cellophane swag. This gigantic MGM set is designed to produce the utmost effect of glamour, with its infinite reflections, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  its glassy surfaces, and the exotic dancers who, like Thompson's African-American cast, provide a shorthand sign for authenticity, a measure of the distance modern culture has come, and an expression of the modern desire to preserve the vision of a simpler and more sensual life (the women, swaying in unison and singing softly suggest beautiful field laborers, picturesque in their servitude). The visual spectacle, resulting from the combination of cellophane and this picture of "ethnic authenticity" literalizes the movement of the sublime from the awesome power of nature to the cool distance of glamour. The physical embodiment, or the weightiness of the authentic or natural is displaced, replaced by the physical transparency, the sleekness of the manufactured product.</p>

<p>The Carmen D'Antonio character quietly disappears as the real star, Eleanor Powell, rises before the cellophane curtain, her white costume a variation on a belly-dancer's seductive garb, but made for the athlete's body, as Powell's movement quickly demonstrates. The set gives a sense of infinite depth: Powell's re is reflected in the mirrors, she dances on the shimmery image of palm fronds, there are lights shining everywhere. Fred Astaire appears and together their feet tap in swift and complicated harmony, the exoticism of the piece undiminished in its passionate choreography. Considered "the greatest tap duet ever filmed," this choreography does not fail to awe in its technical mastery and dazzling design: the sound alone is stunning, the deftness of their tapping feet imperceptible to the eye; this is the body made machine. One might say that here is the sublime, re-realized for an eager movie-going public: the infinite sound, the depthless lights, the reference to otherness, the glassy impenetrability of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the set produce an echo of the sublime in its glamour, bolstered by the explicit use of streamlined technology.</p>
<p>But before the audience can quite make out the complex desire initiated by this sequence, it comes to a close as the couple dances off-stage, and soon reappears, re-costumed for the next segment in all-American clothes. Powell is in a ruffled knee-length day-dress, Astaire has shed his toreador costume for a comfortable suit, and the music has shifted to a more recognizably American swing-tempo. They are the picture of go-to Americans, engaged in friendly competition on the dance floor. It's good clean fun as goofy smiles replace the serious expressions and erotic overtones of the preceding segment, and the cellophane set recedes from view, as each dancer shows, again, a staggering—and this time individual—tap virtuosity. Finally, in a flurry of spins they dance off-stage, are reunited with a friend (played by George Murphy), and the three return to the stage, the image of happy, wholesome, American friends.</p>
<p>In the background, significantly, remains the chorus of women in their Easternized costumes, immobile and statuesque against the cellophane curtain. Here we see the image of American vitality against the beautiful static glamour of the background, and here the film ends. While one may argue that cellophane has played the smallest of roles here, offering some style in the form of a shiny accent, I would argue, rather, that it stands for the beckoning emptiness of the modern age, the transparent reminder of the absence at the heart of, or especially at the heart of, the most innocent American pleasures. The cellophane curtain and palm fronds, hanging like icicles, offer the cold artifice of glamour, a stillness in the background that arrests the eye, despite the athleticism and hard-working effort of the film's tap-dancing stars.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Nudity and High Buildings, or, Cellophane Rising</h1>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Chicago in the summer of the Century of Progress . . . a confused impression of gaiety and boob-baiting . . . .of Bible-belt citizens coming to gasp–and gape . . . and returning, after a wondering examination of the multitudinous exhibits of science and the arts, with only this one memory sharp and clear: nudity and high buildings.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>The giddy use of the new plastics and particularly of the candy-wrapping cellophane had, though, its detractors. <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> published a satirical image called "The Cellophane Gown" by Gilbert Seehausen in 1933 [<a name="5-text" href="#5">re 5</a>], the first year of the magazine's publication. The 1933 Chicago World's Fair (branded as "The Century of Progress") was the instigator of the image, as the above caption makes clear. In the image, a shapely model smiles as she poses in high heels wearing an extravagant and entirely transparent cellophane gown. Richly gathered folds of cellophane fall behind her, a ruffle of cellophane fans about her shoulders, and what looks to be a cellophane tiara tell us that this outfit is a version of the modern ball-gown: she is a fairy queen, though an immodest one. On closer inspection, one notices some complicating details: the gown's full skirt resembles a grass skirt belted with flowers, a flower lei is draped about the woman's neck, a bra or bikini-top is visible. Is this another modern-day primitive posed against an ultra-modern setting? Behind the smiling model, an array of skyscrapers <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  fan away from her. She balances like a beauty queen, rising up in the metropolis in all her plastic glory: Jane of the urban jungle. The image captures the recognition that plastics are on the rise, taking the city by storm, and by seduction.</p>

<p>If cellophane connoted everything modern, it shared all the failures of the modern age, including its vulgar consumerism, its reliance on the rhetoric of "progress," and its overt commodification of sex. E. B. White, in the same year as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> image appeared, wrote an impassioned pamphlet called "Alice Through the Cellophane" that bewailed the shallow commodity culture that had seemed to enwrap the public's mind and threatened society with a kind of consumer-culture asphyxiation: "The revolution began with cellophane," he complains; people are "intrigued with its new transparencies," and driven to accumulate, egged on by the empty promises of ambitious industrialists. White makes clear that "[he] should like to propose a society based on the assumption that nobody is going to buy anything, ever again."<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Cellophane, for White, stands in for all that has gone awry in a society recently impoverished and nevertheless obsessed with its purchasing power: "I can imagine no more tender or healthy sight than a group of little children making the cellophane plant rewind all the little rolls of transparent wrapping material at the end of the day, like a spider eating his own rope."<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> White imagines children, presumably untouched by the corrupt influence of plastic (unlike today's children whose toys seem exclusively made of plastic) to be the disciplinary parents, making the cellophane plant rewind all its glittery, candy-like product for the good of the adults. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The glamour of the new products couldn't last. Plastics entered into a new phase of mass production during the war and a dawning recognition of the environmental costs of the explosion of cheap disposable products chilled the utopian dreams once inspired by the alchemical marvel. What had seemed the magic of its immortal qualities, now acquired new meanings as the non-degrading plastic waste claimed more and more space. The sublime delight at the universe of possibility associated with plastics production became sublime terror at the sheer magnitude of disposal. And the semiotics shifted: what once appeared new, glamorous, and a link to the modern design world, was now cheap, disposable, and a sign of impoverishment, ranging from that of the natural world to the world of culture. Of this fall from the giddy heights of early production to the backs of our cupboards and the garbage dumps, Roland Barthes remarks: "Plastic has climbed down, it is a household material. It is the first magical substance which consents to be prosaic."<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Like the ageing star, cellophane could not hide its defects (its toxicity, its yellowing in time), nor maintain its glamour.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">CODA: Cellophane Futures</h1>
<p>I want to close by considering three more recent expressions of cellophane fashion in dress-form. Each tells us, in one way or another, how far we've come from the modernist aesthetic that celebrated the power of transparency, blankness, the dress as an empty sign. First, a Leonard Joseph design from 1968: one wouldn't guess this dress was made from cellophane, embellished as it is with gold and laden with sequins. The dress may be made of plastic, but it appears in masquerade, hardly announcing its industrial raw material. Cellophane is mere "idea" here: it carries the dress but holds onto none of its identifying features. Certainly there is no celebration of plastic in this richly textured gold shift. Instead the dress connotes a kind of luxurious royalty, à propos of the royal who wore it, "fashion icon" Lee Radziwill.</p>
<p>Second, a 2003 Givenchy Couture show featured a cellophane gown as elaborate as the 1933 <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> image: one reviewer, clearly delighted, wrote: "[Givenchy designer Julien Macdonald] threw caution to the wind only once, when a giant gown of iridescent ruffled cellophane blew along the runway."<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Yet, this gown takes up deep rich color, works with an opaque palette that resembles the rainbow of an oil-slick, and does not use, for its effects, the utopian blankness of the cellulose material. Here the vision is one of excess, a colorized plastic canvas, producing an extreme combination of vamp and vampiric, darkly threatening with lacy accents. The cellophane continues to connote deathliness, mirrored in the blank indifference of the runway model's expression, yet the Givenchy gown reaches back to a prior age, literalizing in its design the threat of plastics as a dangerous seduction.</p>
<p>Finally, a photograph from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Honolulu Star Bulletin</span>, Feb. 12, 2002, pictures a statue of Queen Kapiolani wrapped up in what could be a plastic sarong. The caption reads: "No, this isn't the latest cellophane gown from the avant-garde designers in Paris. The statue of Queen Kapiolani was wrapped up in plastic yesterday as workmen began preparations for a flower bed." Prosaic indeed: here the plastic serves only to protect <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">the queen from the mud that surrounds her as two men labor at her feet. The image echoes, in remarkable ways, the primitive <span style="font-style:italic;">moderne</span>—Thompson's African-American cast, the female chorus of <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadway Melody</span>, and the transparently clad model of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</span> image—yet it tells us that plastic as image no longer has any cultural power. As the emperor to his clothes, the queen to her plastic wrap: this time, however, the nothing is simply that, serving no metaphor, no artistic movement, no galvanizing aesthetic. The Nothing, the conceptual abyss that motivated so much of the work of modernism, disappears in these more recent uses of cellophane. Modernism had attempted to respond to the gaping center with its insistently gorgeous prose, its attention to the effects of a carefully contrived surface, and its own deployment of a glamour that might transfix the reader and thus transform an age. We might remember Stein's words: "And each of us in our way are bound to express what the world in which we are living is doing."<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> In 1934, when she said this, she referred to the sweeping effects of the cinema on human subjectivity. She might also have been referring to the plastics that were coming to redefine the meaning of "continuous present."</p>

It then passed into standard English with the meaning of "a delusive or alluring charm," and, nearly a century later (in the 1930s), was applied to the charm or physical allure of a person, especially a woman, first in American English and then in British English and elsewhere.</p></blockquote></p><p class="display">R.

One of its most succinct definitions appears in H. G. Wells's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Time Machine</span>: "Any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have length, breadth, thickness and duration . . . .There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of space, and a fourth, time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives" (New York: Penguin Classics, 2005), 4.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="contrib"><a href="#back">Brad Bucknell</a></div>
</div>
<div id="body">
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> , though Virginia Woolf's third novel, is usually considered the first work of her maturity. This may be so; however, it has little of the consistent characterization or remarkable "interiority" of Woolf's subsequent "modernist" novels, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>. Written in the aftermath of the First World War, <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> seems rather an excursion into the historical composition of character as such, and indeed, into the making of a set of beliefs and world views which could plausibly have led to war.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> undertakes to "predict," from the position of an ambiguous future, what has not yet taken place in the time frame of most of the novel; it displaces that setting, that past, into the darkness of a post-war future in which the narrator hides and from which she asserts herself. The narrator plays with time as though it were history, making Jacob's "creation" a kind of historical necessity which must be played out in his final and irrevocable disappearance. This writing of the future-past points beyond World War I as a catastrophic anomaly; indeed, the war's omission from any direct treatment in the novel suggests that its conditions are at once unspeakable and also mundane. As such, it is therefore deeply implicated in the stratifications and ideologies of the ordinary western world. Even catastrophe cannot end, or easily change, such a world, as Woolf and her narrator would know. Such knowledge is perhaps what composer Morton Subotnick recognizes as being partly the point of Woolf's novel. His recognition manifests itself in a singular operatic composition, also titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> , which sets to music not just the prediction of disaster, but also the sense of history which creates such catastrophes, such waste. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Morton Subotnick is an American composer, long associated with experimental compositions involving tape, synthesizers, and computer music. During the 1960s, Subotnick composed for the synthesizer, the Buchla 100 (created especially for him by Donald Buchla), <span style="font-style:italic;">Silver Apples of the Moon</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild Bull</span> . At the time, Subotnick saw these pieces, since they were created specifically for record format and thus were not a transcription of an otherwise performable piece, as the beginnings of a new kind of "chamber music."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, as time went on, Subotnick turned his compositional skills toward the intermingling of electronic and acoustic instruments, including voice. Subotnick's <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> is in fact a work of many different phases and versions. Originally, it was commissioned for the Kronos Quartet; a later 1993 version sees the work developed into "a chamber opera for live soprano, recorded baritone voice, live cello, video projections . . . and loudspeakers placed around the performance space . . ."<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> The performance was also enhanced with special technology which, true to Subotnick's ideal of acoustic and electronic interaction, allowed the technology to "respond to the soprano's and cellist's performances and control video and laser disks . . . accordingly"<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a>. This specific technique of interaction, where the technology follows the acoustic performer, Subotnick refers to as a "Ghost" piece.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The term seems appropriate in several ways. Indeed, there is only one real audible trace of Subotnick's <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>, and that is the 1986 Wergo recording of the mono-drama to which I will refer here.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> This version is for soprano, cello, and pre-programmed computer. At the time of this writing, I was unable to acquire a copy of the score; in fact, a complete copy does not seem to exist. Scores for any version of the opera, either in its monodrama form or in the full-blown manifestation have not yet been published, and I do not know if they ever will be. Though the Wergo CD does <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> use the "ghosting" technique to which I have alluded above, the metaphor of a ghost score seems apt: the piece exists, restlessly, only as collection of versions of itself, so to speak, as a kind of "ghost" which keeps appearing on its way to somewhere or to something like a definitive version—a state which apparently it will never reach. It really has no definitive form, and seeks its reference to any substantial "life" from the texts, and even the instruments, which it cites: Woolf's <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>, of course, but others which both precede and come after it. These it weaves together in a kind of asynchronous commentary upon history, and, as with most kinds of historical inscription or commentary, the recording is merely a stop along the way. It exists before the technology for the true ghosting compositional technique came to be.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> And, as will become clear below, the Jacob of Woolf's novel is himself a kind of ghost appearing in conventional character form throughout the novel; however, he is already in fact a victim of yet another kind of technology—that of the First World War—and is recorded in her text as a kind of revenant of himself, of his possibilities, and of the world out of which he came. Subotnick's music is, at least to my ear, first and foremost a response to, a kind of sighting (all puns available) of Jacob's appearance and disappearance in history.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> might be the least likely of Woolf's texts to call for music, or to inspire it. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waves</span> , for instance, has received much more attention from Woolf scholars who seek musical analogies in her writing or who see Woolf's attempt to overcome the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  restraints of Edwardian realism through a kind of musicalization of the novel.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> What kind of writing is this that beckons to music? If it is not poetry, if the language does not "ask" somehow to have its various rhythms and sonorities set to music, if, indeed, the language is that of prose, then how can it properly call to music? Moreover, if the prose seems to lack a central character with whom a reader can identify, a consciousness whose inwardness bears the weight of musical expression, then what kind of music will hear such a call? Indeed, is there any call for music made here at all?<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The answers to these kinds of questions might be embodied in Morton Subotnick's mono-voiced opera, <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>, for soprano, computer, and cello, which seems to ask and answer many of these concerns in a kind of breathless (or is it breath-full?) music more intent on opening out the call to sound not for the sake of the self, or the subject, or of the inward in general, but rather for the sake of history, indeed, perhaps for a history of all that is not recorded or recordable by any other means than by music. And even with music, the recording seems insufficient to the task of making history sound, or of recovering all the ephemera which would comprise a history of sound. I do not mean recorded sound here, either; I speak instead of the impossibility of the presence of sound as it simply flies off and is lost to time, to history, to the future.</p>
<p>I think that part of what Subotnick picks up on in Woolf's <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> is the very temporal and historical difference between the present of the narrator and the present as represented at any moment in Jacob's pre-war life. Such a division of temporalities is not unusual in fiction, of course, since the action described by third-person narrators is normally given in the past tense. However, in Woolf's novel, the present of the narrator and that of the story told are situated very noticeably across a gulf which is that of World War I itself. In other words, the historical fact of the war shapes the very temporal structure of the narrative. As Tammy Clewell has noted, given the absence of Jacob at the opening of the novel and his ultimate and irrevocable disappearance at the end, "Framed between two images of loss, the novel thus unfolds in the very form of an absence."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> The two images to which Clewell refers here are those of the young Jacob being sought by his brother at the beach in chapter one, and of the despair of Jacob's mother some twenty years later at the end of the novel as she wonders what to do with his empty shoes.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The absence adumbrated between these two moments suggests that history plagues us with a potential determinative narrativity beyond which it seems impossible to think, or feel, or know. However, these images also suggest that we are haunted by history's lack of completeness, its necessarily fragmented nature with which we and our representations can never fully coincide. If World War I is a kind of inevitability, given the social structures of which young men such as Jacob are so thoroughly a part, it is/was not entirely graspable: it might be explained, but perhaps never really known. It may be, then, that the form of the novel, and of the opera by the same name, shows us this lack of totalization by history and culture. It is precisely here in this place where something is always escaping—a place not so much of mystery or the ethereal, but of the very concrete, and yet diffuse, particular, and ungraspable moment of history's temporal disorder—that might be most appropriate for music to enter. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The narrator itself seems the model for this reticent form of knowing. For, while the novel offers us a narrator who can limit itself at will or expand into the minds and the situations of characters and places, we can see too that it is also the narrator who creates this "form of absence," and in doing so echoes those calls of grief which frame the novel. It is the main character about whom the narrator seems most reticent. As critics have noted, the narrator "<span style="font-style:italic;">could</span> tell us about Jacob, but she <span style="font-style:italic;">will not</span>."<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> A couple of things are concluded here. For one, there is the belief that the narrator is female—and so it seems to be. This is a point perhaps most explicitly made when the narrator describes Jacob seeing the apparently brainless but beautiful Florinda "turning up Greek Street on another man's arm" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>,81). The narrator offers an at once reserved and yet highly detailed description of Jacob at this moment, as though it is at once inside and outside of him:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The light drenched Jacob from head to toe. You could see the pattern on his trousers; the old thorns on his stick; his shoe laces; bare hands; and face.</p>
<p>It was as if a stone were ground to dust; as if white sparks flew from a livid whetstone, which was his spine; as if the switchback railway, having swooped to the depths, fell, fell, fell. This was in his face.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 81)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The details of Jacob in the light give way to an apparent description of his internal state by means of the analogies with the crushed stone, the spine as whetstone, and the falling railway. Yet, the last sentence keeps us outside of him, at a distance ("This was in his face"), and the narrator starts the next paragraph with a sentence designed to further undermine potentially descriptive interior analogues: "Whether we know what was in his mind is another question" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 81). The sentence astonishes: surely we have just had described to us what <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> in his mind—at least this might be a reader's sense if he/she knows anything at all about conventional narrative description. However, at this moment we are turned toward the narrator and the narration in a kind of conditional mode, wherein the narrator seems to identify herself as female precisely because of a potential relation to Jacob's injured masculinity. The narrator reveals <span style="font-style:italic;">her</span> self not through gendered pronominal designation, or, in this instance, even the use of "I," but rather in terms of what she might do to ease his shock after the discovery of the faithless Florinda. At the same time, though, the narrator also disengages from Jacob, and instead of capitulating to a feminine supportive role, draws attention back to herself as an active observing, and ironic, agent at precisely the moment she excludes her own presence—at least from Jacob and his feelings and thoughts: "Granted ten years' seniority and a difference of sex, fear of him comes first; this is swallowed up by a desire to help . . . with Florinda, with destiny; and then would bubble up an irresponsible optimism. . . . [D]estiny is chipping a dent in him" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 81). The narrator suggests that she won't follow him back to his room, but then does anyway, staying (respectfully?) outside, organizing the reader's view ("Mrs. Wood stood on her doorstep . . . . A barrel-organ played like an obscene nightingale beneath wet leaves" [<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>,81]). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Zwerdling comments that the narrator often filters information through the minds of much more minor characters than Jacob: Evan Williams, for instance, who surprises himself with his own jealous response to his wife's burgeoning liaison with Jacob (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 127).<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Why, then, this turn away from Jacob, and too, this self-conscious return to the narrator herself? Could she really tell us more?</p>
<p>Bishop usefully suggests that in fact Woolf's narrator is refusing the authority of linear narrative and, as he sees it, is "flaunting her power, . . . her status not as a mimetic character but as a textual construct" ("Subject," 163). Bishop cites Teresa de Lauretis's claim that "feminism understands the female subject as one that (unlike Althusser's or Jameson's or Eco's) is not either 'in ideology' or outside ideology [. . .] but rather at once inside and outside the ideology of gender . . . at once 'woman' and 'women'" (cited in "Subject," 163). Bishop suggests then that the narrative technique makes us aware of the process of assembling our points of identification with, and distance from, Jacob, and that "[w]e in fact have already been interpolated as voyeurs; this call induces a self-consciousness, an alienation in Brechtian terms, that makes us recognize our role" ("Subject," 165).</p>
<p>However, I think that Bishop's point leaves us strung between two rather different epistemological poles. Does the female narrator abandon total mastery, therefore limiting herself in various ways, out of a sense of authorial and female/ feminist control, or does the narrator want to make a point about the limits of our ability to know another at all—as she so often states?<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Perhaps the narrator's feminist political critique about mastery itself can only come about <span style="font-style:italic;">through</span> a masterful display of narrative's limitations. Moreover, such narrative restraint also points to an apparently irreducible limit on intersubjective knowledge as well. Paradoxically, the narrative's gestures of control, indeed, of power, come in these moments expressing the ambivalence of knowledge, and, in epistemological terms, the very ambivalence of all-controlling power. If the paradox is true, then the moment of interpellation/ interpolation is itself ruptured, and is <span style="font-style:italic;">a</span> rupture; though the novel clearly suggests that Jacob is a product of the ideologies and institutions of his time and place, it also illustrates that we <span style="font-style:italic;">cannot</span> be fully contained entirely by ideology and institutions any more than the narrator can control and see into every portion of Jacob's being. Thus, the ambivalence that defines the play of the narrator may quite easily then suggest an ambivalence about the totalizing capacities of the ideological and cultural. Once such a grip is broken in terms of the narrator, then it may be broken for Jacob too. If it is true that in one sense Jacob is already "known" because of his gender and his place within the British class structure, it is also the case that he is not complete, not entirely fully formed. He is able, as a young man, to hear the walls of Cambridge echo back to him his inheritance of knowledge (of a certain kind) and social power: "Back from the Chapel, back from the Hall, back from the Library, came the sound of his footsteps, as if the old stone echoed with magisterial authority: 'The young man—the young man—the young man—back to his rooms'"(<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 37). More ambiguously, since the narrator clearly adopts Jacob's tone, we are also told that he is "a young man of substance" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 28); however, such substance is based upon whether or not the young man's desire to be what he is "'and intend[s] to be'" can be carried <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  out in the very world that seems to support him in his convictions about himself. As the narrator suggests, "there will be no [such] form in the world unless Jacob makes one for himself" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 28).</p>
<p>The book more or less focuses on Jacob, but in the end, or at least in a future that the narrator already seems to know, there is no difference between our main character and "Jimmy," mentioned only once as the love of Helen. Helen and Jimmy are enraptured like two "fine collies couchant at twenty yards' distance . . ." (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 83). However, in a small but significant prolepsis we learn that in some future present, "Jimmy feeds crows in Flanders and Helen visits hospitals"(<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 83). And so will Jacob Flanders become carrion, perhaps in the same field with which he shares a name. The mere resonance of Jacob's last name effectively ends whatever plot the book may be said to have. The book is in a sense over even before it begins. If Jacob can be summed up, so to speak, as easily as Jimmy, then why write this long haunted tale? Jacob is essentially a ghost from the beginning, since the narrator, and eventually the reader, cannot help but know that Jacob's room is (always) already empty.</p>
<p>In effect, then, Woolf's narrator defines a space that is already vacant, or, if occupied at all, is inhabited by a barely visible character. Temporal clashes are implemented to structure the narrative in the self-conscious intrusions of the narrator, especially as these seem to allude to some other present in which Jacob's fate may already be decided. This past-ness of Jacob exceeds that of the ordinary use of the past tense in third-person narration, for it includes the kind of historicity which, retroactively, we come to realize is the reason for his final absence.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> It is as though this historical dimension is itself silent; but in fact it contains the overlapping temporalities, and it would seem as well, the fait accompli of Jacob's story. It is the ambivalence of this very self-consciousness into which I believe Morton Subontnick will insert his music, filling out, or adumbrating this silence which is history "itself."</p>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<p>Woolf's own use of musical allusion and reference is almost consistently of a public nature: that is, music always occurs in a social setting of one kind or another. A band plays a waltz at a public kiosk for a haphazard group of dancers (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 13); in the Chapel at Cambridge, "[g]ravely sounded the voices; wisely the organ replied, as if buttressing human faith with the assent of the elements" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 25); in Athens's Square of the Constitution, as the royal band comes marching by, Sandra Wentworth Williams "floats from the particular to the universal," imagining herself "sensitive to every side" of life, joining the ranks of "the courageous [who] mount and ride out to sea—the hair blown back" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 134); and at the Opera House in London, as the narrator points out, "the observer is choked with observations" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 57) as Wagner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Tristan und Isolde</span> is about to begin. The narrator scans the social spectacle with a view that takes in the presence of royalty; Clara Durrant's attempt to escape thoughts of Jacob through the taste of "the sweetness of death in ef;" and even Edward Whitaker's surreptitious attention to Wagner's score (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 57). However, nothing seems actually to unify or <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  bring this varied group together other than the spectacle itself. The narrator insists, in fact, that to save us from chaos "nature and society between them have arranged a system of classification which is simplicity itself; stalls, boxes, amphitheatre, gallery. The moulds are filled nightly. There is no need to distinguish detail" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 57). Music, at least in itself, is unable to recover or to unify; the moulds are filled again and again, and always, we are left somehow alone. We "must choose. Never was there a harsher necessity! . . . for wherever I seat myself, I die in exile. Whitaker in his lodging house; Lady Charles at the Manor" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 57).</p>
<p>The irony of music in social space has its slightly less high-brow equivalents which also echo through the novel. During a party at the Durrants', Elspeth Siddons sings Schubert's setting of Shakespeare's "Who Is Sylvia?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 74). Clara Durrant, Jacob's most respectable paramour, seems, like Sylvia, too pure to indicate anything of her feelings to him. She leaves him on the stairs as new guests arrive (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 76). Jacob and Clara's brother, Tim, on their voyage to the Durrants's, perform less than respectful versions of hymns ("Abide with Me;" "Rock of Ages;" "Great God, What Do I See and Hear?").<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> What they see and hear, aside from their own voices, is only "the drone of the tide in the caves . . . low, monotonous, like the voice of someone talking to himself" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 42). And even though Beethoven's "Moonlight" Sonata wafts through the clear Cambridge evening, it has to compete with a "crash[ing]" waltz (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 34). Priorities are never clear here; the youthful liberation from God leaves Tim and Jacob unsuspectingly still in the position of having "to choose;" but even this choice has its historical setting, its options circumscribed.</p>
<p>For the drone here red by nature has its corollary (as in the seating at the Opera) in the socially fringe sonorities of the book, and in two particular wordless kinds of music. Most prevalent is the sound of the barrel organ, which is heard so often it is hardly heard at all. It supplies a kind of "score" to the novel, a background music (perhaps a kind of Amuzak?) to the usually urban events of the narrative. Sue Roe rightly identifies the instrument not as an organ, but as a "large automatic <span style="font-style:italic;">piano</span> operated by a handle, played in the streets by itinerant musicians and popular at the time" (my emphasis; <span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, note 4, 170). In its way, the barrel <span style="font-style:italic;">piano</span> sounds the very image of an already aging modernity. It could be operated by hand or by automated clockwork motors.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Like so many mechanical instruments, including barrel organs themselves, the barrel piano has its most complex development in the eighteenth century. Versions of mechanical instruments including barrel organs and pianos served in both public (including churches) and domestic spaces, and the popularity of mechanical instruments was strongest in England from 1890 to 1930.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Of course, the instrument was replaced by radio, and by other improved means of electronic reproduction, including the phonograph.</p>
<p>This last point is significant. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>, we are struck again and again by the public presence of this (non-electronic) music machine. It can be heard "like an obscene nightingale" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 81) in the background as the narrator follows Jacob home after his discovery of Florinda's faithlessness; or it is heard entering the room as Bonamy and Clara have tea, and he becomes certain, without a word from Clara, that she is in love <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  with Jacob (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 133); or again, it accompanies the beautiful sunset on the final day of peace, as some in the diverse London crowd head again to the Opera House (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 153). One never seems "safe" from this music; it permeates everywhere and everything. It cannot be isolated or controlled by the multitude of sounds on any street, nor can it be shut out along with those other street sounds by the imposition of walls and doors. It lies just behind, yet finds its way into, both public and private worlds.</p>
<p>The barrel piano, then, sustains a music which is both mundane and nearly "universal" in its pervasiveness at the corners of the narrative. Within this liminal location, it shares space with res like Miss Marchmont who has her own theory of music: "that colour is sound—or perhaps it has something to do with music" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 91). She rehearses here a certain synaesthetic view of music, not unknown to the symbolists and decadents, and, in her own time, to painters like Kandinsky, and musicians like Scriabin, whose "mystic chord" was part of a larger scheme to reconcile many different kinds of opposites ("'Mathematics is music for the mind; music is mathematics for the soul'").<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Such all-encompassing views of music were, of course, not unknown to Pythagoras who had a musical-mathematical view of the universe. Still, his name is not quite significant enough to make it onto the walls of the British Museum where Marchmont continues her search. In the Museum, while Jacob reads Marlowe, the feminist Julia Hedge waits, eternally it seems, for her books, and the atheist Fraser simply despises the "vagueness" of theories such as Marchmont's or that of Christianity. Marchmont herself searches ever onward for "one thing . . . or another" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 91) that will support her ideas. It does not seem to strike others that they are doing the same thing, and perhaps for reasons just as vague. The narrator's use of second-person address, quoted speech, and free indirect discourse in the presentation of Marchmont suggests that she is not silent either, but rather prolix in her pursuit ("And she could not ask you back to her room, for it was 'not very clean, I'm afraid,' so she must catch you in the passage, or take a chair in Hyde Park to explain her philosophy. The rhythm of the soul depends upon it . . ." [<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 91]). She can "never quite say" just what she means, and it is doubtful that she is actually heard or listened to by her colleagues at the Museum. She seems a re just slightly less alone than Julia Hedge, but, like her, is allowed to enter the halls wherein the enormous mind of the British museum is kept—though she clearly remains on the fringes of its reason—the refractions of its logic as upheld from Plato to the near present.</p>
<p>Her unheard theory echoes an even darker re of silent sound just briefly mentioned in the novel. I mean the "old blind woman" who sings with her back to the "stone wall of the Union of London and Smith's Bank." As others are headed to the Opera House, this re stands "clasping a brown mongrel tight in her arms and singing out loud, not for coppers, no, from the depths of her gay wild heart—her sinful, tanned heart—for the child who fetches her is the fruit of sin . . ." (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 56).<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> To the masses moving through the London streets, such a re may be little more than an annoyance—if she is noticed at all. However, the narrator takes the time to make a slightly different point. In the description which follows immediately the presentation of the singer, the narrator details the city as "hoary . . . old, sinful, and majestic." But it is <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  also a place of a perpetual massing and re-massing of itself, of a continuous movement only barely grasped, if at all, by the people who, like buildings and barges, are ever replacing themselves. Elsewhere, the narrator points out the "old man . . . crossing the [Waterloo] Bridge these six hundred years, with the rabble of little boys at his heels, for he is drunk, or blind with misery . . . . It seems as if we marched to the sound of music; perhaps the wind and the river; perhaps these same drums and trumpets—the ecstasy and hubbub of the soul" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 98). Drums and trumpets, or perhaps "[t]wo barrel-organs play[ing] by the kerb," accompany all the faces just outside the Opera House as the day, and peace, are about to end, and too, as these faces, without knowing it, seem to take one last look behind them, differences obliterated, distinctions removed: "all alike were red in the sunset" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 153).</p>
<p>In Woolf's text, music is prevalent, yet trivial in one sense: few of the spiritual or transcendent claims made by the romantics two generations before seem actually or materially to be realized in the novel. However, music is still there, it is the backdrop, the sonic canvas of many of the actions of the book; in this sense it is a kind of unheard yet sonorous context for the present, a present, perhaps like all presents, which cannot be fully conscious of its decisions or momentum—at least not until it looks back, the catastrophe already behind, and its causes now partially revealed. How far is it, then, say for an angel of history, from the first "descriptions of automatic organs and hand-operated water organs" going back to the third century BCE (Langwill and Ord Hume, "Barrel Organ"), to the making of an opera with now very outdated electronic synthesizers?<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Perhaps, it's not long at all, and the length of time may have nothing to do with it. Though the means of articulating, of <span style="font-style:italic;">sounding</span> history may have changed, such a sound can contain everything and nothing, all at once.</p>
</div>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<p>Subotnick's attempt to render audible the silence of Woolf's historical narration may seem a dubious task, for what can music do to fill in the chaos of a now silent past? And, in any case, what sound could history possibly make? The question is unanswerable, perhaps silly, since the only answer can be "every sound." However, if we cannot imagine what the sound of every sound might be, we might be able to imagine an iconic representation of someone hearing such a sound. I point here to a significant omission, a silence, in Walter Benjamin's justly famous description of the angel of history:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p>There is something Orpheus-like in the description, if perhaps only in the sense of a movement which is impossible to stop, but also in the sense of sound (if not music) that here is reversed in its efficacy. Sound here is not music, but in the Klee painting, and in Benjamin's ekphrasis of it, sound is signified by omission. Orpheus can sing his way into Hades, but he cannot get himself out, cannot make himself or the past whole again. There is a significant conjuncture of the visible, the written, and very quietly, the auditory here. Benjamin describes the disaster of "progress" piling up behind the angel; the sound must be deafening. The angel's mouth is open, and perhaps the sound of the destruction, or of the storm's wind, or both, drowns out his own exclamations. He may be speaking something that can't be heard, a message or a Word from God? Has he too come with sound or song to make things whole again, just as Orpheus has? It is too late. It seems the angel is being cast out, perhaps because, unlike Orpheus, he cannot be heard by god or human, or because, like Orpheus, he has turned around. He looks back instead of listens or sings.</p>
<p>But what does the angel hear? What is it that drowns him out? What does progress, or, more broadly, history <span style="font-style:italic;">sound</span> like? From another angle, why is it that Orpheus can sing his way down, but getting back out, Eurydice with him, intact—this cannot be done? He changes modes, for one thing, and must <span style="font-style:italic;">look</span> at her, must see her to know if she is there, and at that moment he loses her, she disappears. Rilke goes so far as to suggest that she is already forgetting him even before he turns, was on her way to this amnesia before he arrived, and is disturbed when he comes to get her. Had the sounds of Hell already drowned him out? Could these be heard still echoing on the passage back to the world's surface? Do they mix with other voices from above?<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> This, in Benjaminian terms, must be the most brutal stroke of all. For, unlike the angel, Orpheus <span style="font-style:italic;">has the chance to make things whole again</span>, to redeem the past and bring it into a perfect present. But his glance shatters all, redeems nothing, and the voice can only lament from then on until Orpheus is torn apart, the dismembered head left floating down the stream, still singing only of the impossible past, and the equally impossible future, the very one his own eyes took away .</p>
<p>There is nothing to see back there; the catastrophe lies ahead, it seems. The angel cannot see it coming, but can see it piling up behind him, even while moving forward, much like Woolf's narrator, and perhaps can hear the sound of it. Then again, the angel may indeed be able to see it coming, since he sees <span style="font-style:italic;">behind</span> him the future as calamity, and the present through which he is blown is the roar of this rush into the future, pushed blindly by the past. Maybe it sounds like hell. We can't know. It's just a picture, and a description of a picture, and a series of perhaps too local resonances. Form itself seems to ossify and become repulsive, even to the gods. Though Orpheus once used music to gain access to his lost love, apparently his song eventually bores the gods, and he is allowed a gruesome death. He goes out with a song on his lips, just as the angel's words seem frozen on its lips.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Orpheus is one who sings loss, not the retrieval of wholeness. That must wait for some other time.</p>
<p>My reration of Benjamin's angel is of course a much more modern heuristic than nineteenth-century views of musical organicism or of the wholeness of musical <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  expression would have us believe. We can see here instead a sense of history and music which connotes not just the sound of calamity, of the loss of wholeness, but more to the point, we can hear in this transposition of Orpheus onto the Angel, a more primal recounting of our relationship to music and culture: the suspicion of music was not just Plato's, but Ovid's as well, and perhaps even Orpheus's. Plato might have feared music's disruptive effects upon an ideal society; Ovid seems also to know, through the image of Orpheus, that the ideal is never more than a song, and one which cannot in any case heal.</p>
<p>The use of "Greece," and by extension Mediterranean classicalism as a re of the ambivalent source of western idealism, culture, and learning is prevalent in <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>. The inheritors of the ancients (including those of Rome) are ironically presented in the shabby res of Professors Huxtable, Sopwith, and Cowan (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 31–34).<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Greece as the very ground of learning is also questioned as it seems to sequester Jacob from the world around him as he reads, in London, Plato's <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus</span>, while the actual present day Greece is the scene for Jacob's less than ideal liaison with Sandra Wentworth Williams later in the book. It is in fact this strain of "Greek-ness," in all its ambiguity, upon which Subotnick in part bases his opera. In an interview with Curtis Roads, Sub-otnick notes that after reading Woolf's novel three times, he found nothing he could set.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> However, it is eventually in the section in which Jacob reads the <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus</span> that Subotnick finds his clue: "I finally came to a passage, which, in its implicit inability to recognize reality, led to the use of multiple texts. The novel deals with western civilization entirely from the standpoint of the intellect, nonvisceral, noncontact intellect."<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> This last statement seems to be true in so far as it applies to Jacob, if not to the "passage" or to the whole novel.</p>
<p>Woolf's choice of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus</span>, and Subotnick's focus on this section of the novel as the basis of his opera, is significant. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus</span> is in part a chronicle of Socrates's critique of rhetoric. His criticism of this art (if it is one) takes place, of course, after two grand rhetorical displays wherein he argues first that the "beloved ought to accept the non-lover when he might have the lover, because the one is sane, and the other mad." <a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> He then appears to change his position entirely in a much longer and more complex speech describing the varieties of madness appropriate to different kinds of souls. The entire dialogue is saturated with the kind of doubleness that Derrida picks up on in his examination of the "pharmakon," or that which is both remedy and poison.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> It is not only the (false) distinction between speech and writing that is broken down in Plato's text, however, since Socrates's speeches clearly show that rhetoric itself can be a guide to "higher" things and not merely a means of deception. The second speech, in fact, illustrates the hard road of idealistic realization when Socrates says that "sight is the most piercing of our bodily senses." It is through our vision of the beautiful especially that the surest path to the good is given to us: "this is the privilege of beauty, that being the loveliest she is also the most palpable to sight" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 157). Just before this, however, Socrates has noted that "there is no radiance in our earthly copies of justice or temperance or those other things which are precious to souls: they are seen through a glass dimly; and there are few who, going to the images, behold in them the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  realities, and these only with difficulty" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 157). As Orpheus might know, "seeing" the "true" is at one and the same time both necessary and very nearly impossible, and rhetoric, perhaps like writing even on the soul, as Socrates puts it (<span style="font-style:italic;">PH</span>, 188), is a guarantee neither of being shown the good, nor of being deceived in one's pursuit of it; there seems to be no assurance of the good's recognition at all, just the necessity of its maintenance as an ideal.</p>
<p>Subotnick is canny in his decision to focus on the passage where Jacob, while reading the <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus</span>, both does and does not see what is going on just outside his window. Eventually, Jacob does see what is outside, but it is never clear that he comprehends it in a complex way. The narrative suspends his perception, and we cannot be sure of his assessment. While such a lack of narrative information is typical of Woolf's style in regard to Jacob, the act of his looking out the window res the specificity and ephemerality of the historical moment. The moment passes, and what is taken away by Jacob is not known. Subotnick accumulates moments of historically specific seeing in the fragments of texts he inserts between Woolf's and Plato's. Their choice and organization here do call our attention to the difference between an intellectual and an emotional response to history, to "real" events; but they also remind us of the tempo, and the undifferentiated nature of these events. If the music Subotnick creates is in part an attempt to return a certain emotional immediacy to the perception and experience of the world, it also, in its own ephemerality, recapitulates the irony of the representation of Jacob at the window: we can be made to see, and even hear, history, but what is there to assure us that we can understand it fully? Subotnick's choice of texts, falling as they do into historical moments which come long after World War I, the publication of Woolf's novel, and of course, the writings of Plato, suggests the ongoing nature of the problem of historical perception, both emotional and intellectual.</p>
<p>Subotnick's opera is divided into three sections. Textually, part 1 consists of a section from <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>, followed by one from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus</span>, and an Epilogue again from Woolf's novel. Part 2 includes a section from Nicholas Gage's <span style="font-style:italic;">Eleni</span> in which a young boy discovers his mother's death at the hands of Greek communists after World War II. Part 3 is a section from Elie Wiesel's <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span> which describes a struggle for bread that occurs on a train heading to one of the death camps. In the scene a son attacks his own father to steal his bread (in Wiesel's book, the son ends up killing the father, and is in turn murdered by others for this bread). This section has incursions from the Gage text as well, and ends with a return first to Plato and finally to <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The passage from <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> that Subotnick uses is one that moves back and forth from the "enormous mind" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 93) of the British Museum to Jacob reading Plato in his room. While the rain pours down, and "Stone lies solid over the British Museum," covering the "brains" of Plato, Shakespeare and others, Jacob reads on "in spite of the rain; in spite of the cab whistles; in spite of the woman in the mews behind Great Ormond Street who has come home drunk and cries all night long 'Let me in! Let me in!'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 94). Subotnick borrows freely from Woolf's text and all the texts he uses, not bothering to show omissions or ellipses. Still, the borrowed fragments form a kind of coherent critique of western culture past and present—coherent, and yet, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  ambivalent. Subotnick himself mentions the division inherent in the Woolf section, as Jacob's reading of Plato seems to prevent him from being aware of "the world outside of his window."<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Subotnick's gathered texts clearly show the contrast between the protected, contemplative world of the Cambridge-educated young man and the world of conflict nearby. Yet, the implications may in fact be double here: the image of Jacob's contemplation can certainly suggest the complacency of learning and therefore indict the tradition and its inheritors; or, the scraps of collected texts could indicate just how far from the perfect justice Socrates describes the west really is. What is clear is that the calamity just outside will not easily or quickly be stopped.</p>
<p>Subotnick's computer generated music has, he says, an "eastern"-sounding character which creates a sonic allusion to the Mediterranean inflection of western culture. In the Roads interview, Subotnick speaks of the large-scale operatic setting of the piece. This has not been recorded, nor, as I've already noted, is there any score publicly available for either the monodrama or this larger version. However, his description of the musical arrangement for the larger opera does resonate with that of the shorter piece I am discussing here. He claims that "Through the music, I sought a direct attack on the meaning of the text." Whether he means here an attack on Woolf's text, or on all of the texts he uses, is unclear. Further, he attempts through the synthesized instrumentation to lend the music a certain "transparency," to "achieve the twangs of Middle-Eastern instruments. I find these instruments interesting because they imitate the voice, with their cries and nasal qualities." He wants to construct a technological music which sounds "as though there is no technology. It's very expressive and you often lose sight of the fact that it is all electronic. It harks back to detuned instruments, wails, cries, and plucked sounds."<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> . The timbrel allusions to the Middle East generally, and not to a specific Greek or Arabic set of instruments or scales, are to a degree successfully achieved. The opening is in fact very soft, with a concentration of alternating cithara-sounding pitches moving between a fifth, D-A, and a flat 6th , D-B flat. The first part, for instance, which cites sections from <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus</span>, seems to focus on the flat 6th degree audible in both the Western harmonic minor scale and in modalities of eastern origin. However, in the first section the cell from which most of the music seems truly generated, and which gives the impression of being constantly improvised, is a rapidly played and rhythmically varied collection of three pitches: C, D sharp (E flat), and F sharp (G flat), a C diminished triad. The grouping consists of a pair of minor thirds, but with a strongly evident tritone between the C and F sharp.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> The minor thirds give the grouping a pentatonic quality, while the tritone keeps any resolution constantly at bay. The basic rhythmic formation for this grouping can be seen in <a name="1-text" href="#1">re 1</a>:</p>

<p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p class="continued">The phrase will be given different rhythmic emphases throughout, and will modulate; but its most marked quality is the tempo which is about 163 beats per minute.</p>
<p>Though the narrated portions divide into three major sections with more than one section within these, the music seems to focus on this motif and one more later on. Broadly speaking, the development worked out from the first musical phrase encompasses the first <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob</span> section, the first passage from Plato, and a return to <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>. The second musical section, which includes the narrations from <span style="font-style:italic;">Eleni</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigh</span>t, introduces a longer basic theme, to which the music always returns. It is a long eighth-note pedal on G flat (F sharp) which briefly resolves on B flat [<a name="2-text" href="#2">re 2</a>].</p>
<p>This motif is complemented by a slower moving bass which frequently circulates from to A flat, to B flat and at times briefly settling on E flat, though it never rests there for long, while the upper notes will travel along in a steady eighth-note pattern which may or may not be in accordance with the key. These lines re a kind of continuity in history, perhaps even a destructive one; they are less patterns of repetition than forms of recurrence appearing again and again as the historical moments related in the texts change.</p>
<p>In fact, while the second section seems to be more tonally centered than other parts of the opera, it is also at times the most dissonant section of the piece, building in layers of sound as the narration moves through the trauma of the section from <span style="font-style:italic;">Eleni</span> to the description of the t for bread from <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span>. The narration, however, will not reconcile these passage; rather it keeps inserting lines from Gage's text into that of Wiesel's. Indeed, Subotnick seems to amplify Woolf's ominous silence about World War I by inserting sections from these texts to show that the horror initiated during the first war continues in a variety of ways. The effect of the overlapping dissonance in the musical lines and of the intrusive narration and vocalizations suggests both a linear drive and a constant disturbance in the apparent "flow" of history, a "calamity" of progress which is unsalvageable. The variations on this second theme continue right to the return of Plato and Jacob's conclusion of Plato's text at the very end of the piece. Here Jacob finally sees that it is raining, and "how the Jews and the foreign woman, at the end of the street stood by a pillar-box arguing"(<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span> 95). The slow movement at the conclusion ends on an A, the dominant of the D with which the whole opera began. There is no final cadence; that may be to come. The implication is more one of pause than of conclusion. As I suggested earlier, it is unclear just what Jacob understands or interprets of this scene beneath his window. We see him in an aspect akin to Benjamin's angel, seeing and hearing, and we cannot tell if he understands that his own wings are caught in the wind of history, especially since Socrates's words about perfect justice are still ringing in his ears. The novel, at least, will ultimately show just how entangled Jacob is.</p>
<p>Perhaps most striking, however, is Subotnick's choice of soprano voice for the <span style="font-style:italic;">sprech- stimme</span> of history (The soprano is Joan La Barbara). The shards of texts are spoken and interspersed with apparently improvised soprano vocalizations, at times wailing, at times guttural, or adopting glottal drones well below its usual range, at times ululating.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> At still other points, the voice uses syncopated rhythmic interjections of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  consonants and vowels, or will take up a scat-like phrase from the language and re-insert it rhythmically in between the regular narration ("Stone lies/ . . . as bone/ lies . . ."). At other times, the voice will inhale and exhale over the same pitch, giving a kind of circular breathing effect. Most remarkable is the fact that the voice will do all of these things <span style="font-style:italic;">in sequence</span>; that is, it will break from the narration into one of these vocal effects, leaping two octaves in a wail, then gutturally droning in the bass, or then singing a phrase in unison with the accompaniment. This might have been achieved with over-dubbing, but the single-voiced version of the opera is meant to be sung as a concert piece for one voice, so the single voice would have to be able to do these gymnastics on its own. The effect is to keep the listener in a constant state of anticipation, since the vocal line itself can leap into and out of the narration at any point, and with unexpected results.</p>

<p>The same woman's voice also inflects the speeches differently, reading from Woolf and Plato in calmly composed tones, and then marking the distress in the harrowing passages from <span style="font-style:italic;">Eleni</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span>. The passage from <span style="font-style:italic;">Eleni</span> finds the narration attempting to convey the distress of a young boy as he slowly realizes that the reason he has been sent to buy sweets is for the mourners who are coming to begin grieving over the death of Eleni, his mother.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> The passage from <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span> is read more matter of factly, though the narrator takes up the distress of the father being murdered by his son: "'Meir, Meir, my boy! . . . don't you recognize me? I'm your father! I've got some bread . . . for you too . . . for you too . . .'."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> The ostensibly Oedipal moment is here reconred; it leaves the Freudian confines of the mythic and trans-historical and is instead presented as kind of madness created by hunger, a hunger which is itself the result of the historical particularity of the Holocaust. We cannot tell, since our focalizer is first-person <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and has chosen not to participate in the scramble for bread, if the son recognizes the father. This isolation of perspective has the effect of stripping away almost all ironies, Freudian or Sophoclean. The bitter irony of the original Oedipus story is that Oedipus does not know he is killing his father; in Freud, the irony is that the son cannot <span style="font-style:italic;">allow</span> himself to know he desires to kill his father. In the Wiesel, something more horrible appears, precisely because of the first-person narration: here we cannot tell if the son knows, and worse, if he even cares that the man he kills for bread is his father. The first-person narrator offers no psychological insights himself. He simply reports on an action brought on by the specific historical situation. Mythical or psychological continuities which might be thought to span time and shape history are destroyed in this moment of near absolute dehumanization. It makes little difference in one way if the son here recognizes his father since the t for bread continues and the son is himself soon murdered. In another way, of course, what is lost here is any pretence to filial connection as an absolute, whether ironically structured as in Freud, or as a kind of fundamental and less ironic form of human connection. Historical brutality seems to wipe out irony <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> simplicity at one and the same time.</p>
<p>The female narrator of Woolf's text, or her avatar, seems to appear here in the opera to speak /sing of the future that was hinted at in the novel. The result is not, however, so much an "attack" on the texts, as a kind of sonorous complement to Woolf's judicious silence. In the opera, silence gives over to an unstoppable vocality, one which seems to intrude even on itself in its haste to articulate the silence of history. In fact, a process of intrusion begins early in the piece. The final lines of the first cited section of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> are intruded upon by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus</span>, perhaps to give us the impression of Jacob's interrupted reading. The introductions of various vocalizations, however, point still further ahead in the opera:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Meanwhile, Plato (<span style="font-style:italic;">high note</span>) continues (<span style="font-style:italic;">high ululation, breath in and out on same pitch</span>) his dialogue; (ululation, then <span style="font-style:italic;">descending phrase sung with cello</span>) in spite of the rain (<span style="font-weight:bold;">In the heaven which is above the heavens</span>); in spite of the cab whistle (<span style="font-weight:bold;">there abides the very being with which true knowledge is concerned</span>); in spite of the woman in the mews (<span style="font-weight:bold;">the colorless, formless, intangible essence, visible only to the mind, the pilot of the soul</span>); who has come home drunk (<span style="font-style:italic;">glissando</span>) (<span style="font-weight:bold;">The divine intelligence, being nurtured upon mind and pure knowledge, and the intelligence of every soul which is capable of receiving the food proper to it</span>) and cries (<span style="font-style:italic;">breath in out on same pitch</span>) (<span style="font-weight:bold;">rejoices</span>) (<span style="font-style:italic;">breath in</span>) (<span style="font-weight:bold;">at beholding</span>) (<span style="font-style:italic;">breath in</span>) (<span style="font-weight:bold;">reality</span>) all night long . . .(<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span> in regular font; <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus</span> in bold, vocalizations in italics. From liner notes, 4)<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The passage suggests an image of reading, and of this reading's interruption; but it also makes us wonder who is intruding upon whom: is it the street sounds on Jacob's mind?; Plato on Jacob's mind?; Jacob on Plato's? Or is it some other voice, possessing all, but controlling in fact none of the other voices?</p>
<p>In the Epilogue to Part 1, the narrator/singer repeats parts of one of Woolf's lines from later in the passage above: "Plato and Shakespeare continue, and Jacob, who was reading the <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus</span>, heard people vociferating round the lamp-post, and the woman <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  battering at the door crying, 'Let me in!' as if a coal had dropped from the fire, or a fly, falling from the ceiling, had lain on its back, too weak to turn over" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span> 94). The "'Let me in!'" phrase is itself repeated in Woolf's text; in the opera, the line is picked up from "and Jacob" twice in all. And in fact, we can recognize very quick, almost indecipherable vocalized insertions of "coal dropped," and "fire" from earlier moments in the opera, as if the voice which extends outside the narration proper is already reaching ahead in some other kind of register which is not exactly singing, and not precisely speech, but rather a strange and variable sound somewhere between the two.</p>
<p>Part 2 intrudes upon—or overlaps with—Part 3 of the narration in a very disturbing set of collisions which seem to place the loss of the mother in the Gage text along side the murder of the father in the Weisel. The child's insistent question about the location of his mother in <span style="font-style:italic;">Eleni</span> ("'Where's Mana?'") is almost always followed by a very high wail which plays on the name. This cry becomes mixed with the description in Part 3 of the father's murder. Unlike the earlier overlapping, this one is inscribed in the text given in the liner notes:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>His eyes gleamed; a smile, like a grimace, lit up his dead face. And was immediately extinguished. (I CLAPPED MY HANDS OVER MY EARS TRYING TO SHUT OUT THE AWFUL SCREAMS THAT WERE THE DEATH KNELL OF MY MOTHER . . .) (<span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span> regular font; <span style="font-style:italic;">Eleni</span> in capital letters as in Subotnick's text; liner notes 6)</p></blockquote>
<p>The opera, at least in its earliest form, keeps dividing the voice against the narration, and against itself, for this is the fragmenting and multiplying of a single voice against the linearity of discursive and musical performance. Yet, the one voice does not contain the many, does not reconcile them into any kind of unity; this is rather the aural image of the impossible rush to speak or to <span style="font-style:italic;">sound all</span>. It is also the ration of the limits of such speech. The rush is so prevalent—and in the second musical section which becomes increasingly discordant as the brutality in the narration increases—it disintegrates the very linearity by which history is usually recounted. In fact this has been going on since the beginning of the opera. If chronology were strict here, the Plato would precede Woolf, but it does not. In the sections from the Gage and Wiesel texts, historically, the Wiesel would come before the Gage, both in its writing, of course, but in time as well, since the civil war in Greece came after the end of the Second World War and the revelations of the camps. Not only does the voice continually challenge its own ordering, but the discursive units and their performance are also scrambled. Nothing it seems, not language, not wails, not music, and perhaps not even an angel or a god, can keep up with the calamity.</p>
<p>Subotnick's piece is a musical response to Woolf's reticent narrator, not that it imitates that reticence; rather the music and voice taken together in their disruptive push forward, look backward and forward across the historical gap that Woolf's narrator has itself created. Instead of imitation, what we have here is a musical rering of the narration. It is true that the cited texts in the Subotnick piece do not refer to the First War at all. They need not, of course, since Woolf's text does not mention the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  war either in direct terms. Subotnick picks up, so to speak, where that calamity leaves off. Moreover, where Woolf's text is mostly silent about the interiority of Jacob, and certainly about the war, Subotnick's selected texts, and the rather high drama of the music, seem to make more familiarly expressive gestures than does Woolf's novel. However, at the same time, Subotnick's opera does not "speak" of history; it uses the textual substitutes for it which are meant to "look in" on it as it moves, and with all the gaps between events included. The voice, especially the non-narrating, singing voice, signals a variety of affects, but sounds out only the inarticulacy of rushing backward and forward in time. It cannot renew the lives or remove the suffering of history, nor fill in the historical silences. This it seems to know. It can, however, allude to these, can impart the pressure of time and loss across the absence of history's incompleteness, on into the future.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f7" href="#f7-text">7. </a>In an e-mail from the recording's producer, Curtis Roads, I learned that in 1986 the ghosting technique Subotnick later used for the <span style="font-style:italic;">performance</span> version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>, and in many other subsequent pieces, was simply not available at the time. In other words, the cellist and soprano had to perform along with the already programmed computer score. Personal correspondence with the author, August 3, 2005. I sincerely thank Mr. Roads and Morton Subotnick for their help in answering some of my questions about the recording.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f8" href="#f8-text">8. </a>See for example, Alex Aronson, <span style="font-style:italic;">Music and the Novel: A Study in Twentieth-Century Fiction</span> (Totowa, NJ: Rowman and Littlefield, 1980), 29–31; Gerald Levin, "The Musical Style of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waves</span>," <span style="font-style:italic;">The Journal of Narrative Technique</span> 13.3 (Fall 1983), 164–171; Robin Gail Schulze, "Design in Motion: Words, and the Search for Coherence in the Works of Virginia Woolf and Arnold Schoenberg," <span style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Literary Imagination</span> 25.2 (Fall 1992), 5–22.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f9" href="#f9-text">9. </a>The problem of character and reader identification in <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> is much discussed. Much of the problem circulates around an ongoing discomfort with the relative absence of Jacob (and especially of his interiority) throughout the novel. For example, Alex Zwerdling, in his essay with the telling title <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "<span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>: Woolf's Satiric Elegy," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf: A Collection of Critical Essays</span>, ed. Margaret Homans (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1993), 75–92, (taken from Zwerdling's <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf and the Real World</span> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986), points out that "Unlike the classic <span style="font-style:italic;">Bildungsroman, Jacob's Room</span> lacks a teleology" . Suggesting that Woolf is more interested in a "consciousness in process," and indeed the consciousness of a young Cambridge man, strung between privilege and "incipient conventionality" , Zwerdling says that Jacob is "an engaging young man, in many ways typical of his class and training, who has unintentionally managed to secure the love of a few human beings. His absence, like his presence, is not likely to alter the world significantly. . . . Only on the small canvas appropriate to such a view, rather than on the grand frescoes of the heroic imagination, could Woolf allow herself to sketch . . ." .<br>
					Taking a more materialist view of things, Edward L. Bishop points put that Jacob is less a character than he is a subject in the Althusserian sense of a being "interpellated" into a social system with all the advantages, and deadly limitations, inherent to that situation. As Bishop puts it, the novel "is not confessional and is not psycho-biography. . . . Woolf seems to be veering away not only from rendering mental states . . . and from giving us the kind of information we could use to infer them but also seems bent on frustrating those automatic processes which cause a reader to identify with a character" (Edward L. Bishop, "The Subject in <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span>," <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Fiction Studies</span> 38:1 [Spring 1992], 147–175, 152.). In a similar vein, Kathy J. Phillips, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf Against Empire</span> (Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press, 1994) sees both <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waves</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob's Room</span> as portraying characters "who are not so much autonomous individuals as products of a culture" (121–122).</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f14" href="#f14-text">14. </a>We meet Jacob at nineteen, for instance, through the eyes of the fifty-year-old Mrs. Norman, also travelling to Cambridge, and, "even at here age, she noted his indifference, presumably he was in some way or other—to her at least—nice, handsome, interesting, distinguished, well built, like her own boy? One must do the best one can with her report" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 24). The ambivalence is two-fold: Who is the "one" here: Mrs. Norman, whose interiority is reported indirectly? Or is it the narrator whose perspective seems to be at one with Mrs. Norman's (indeed, here is another example of how the narrator will give a good deal more of the interior life of a minor character than of Jacob)? The narrator goes on with a famous disclaimer: "It is no use trying to sum people up. One must follow hints, not exactly what is said, nor yet entirely what is done . . . " (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span> 24). These qualifications are repeated nearly verbatim about Jacob at twenty-six, this time in Greece. The narrator at this moment is wondering again about a woman's perspective on Jacob: that of his married lover, Sandra Wentworth Williams (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>,1 35).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f15" href="#f15-text">15. </a>While Jacob is travelling in Italy, the narrator at one point even breaks in to indulge a kind of nostalgic reverie about the Italian country side: "And there is a lonely hill-top where no one ever comes, and yet it is seen by me who was lately driving down Piccadilly in an omnibus" (<span style="font-style:italic;">JR</span>, 119).</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f20" href="#f20-text">20. </a>This re will appear in Woolf's next novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, in much more complexity. There, outside the Regent's Park Tube Station, Peter Walsh and Rezia Warren Smith will hear a voice singing, "with an absence of all human meaning," "ee um fah um so/ foo swee too eem oo" (Woolf, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span> [London: Grafton Books, 1986], 73). It may be a sound unknown to humans, but it is nevertheless a fecund sound, a song of long and eternal memory. J. Hillis Miller in fact identifies the words given by the narrator as coming from Strauss's "<span style="font-style:italic;">Aller Seelen</span>." J. Hillis Miller, "Virginia Woolf's All Souls' Day: The Omniscient Narrator in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>," <span style="font-style:italic;">The Shaken Realist: Essays in Modern Literature in Honor of Frederick J. Hoffman</span>. eds. Melvin J. Friedman and John B. Vickery (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1970), 114–115. Shirley Neuman also refers to this re as symbolizing, without the Lacanian phallus, "humanity through the ages," as ring "a <span style="font-style:italic;">female</span> sexual pleasure" not as supplementary to male pleasure, and finally, as the possessor of a "doubled discourse," singing words without apparent human meaning, which are also, according to the narrator, the words from the Strauss song . Peter Walsh hears only the meaningless sounds; Rezia Warren Smith, wife of the doomed Septimus, hears Hermann von Gilm's lyrics: "'if someone should see, what matter they?'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span> 75). See Shirley Neuman, "Importing Difference," <span style="font-style:italic;">A Mazing Space: Writing Canadian Women Writing</span>, eds.

<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Modern science . . . would come upon secrets of Nature, as science had come before in Atlantis upon such secrets, and, spiritually arrogant and ignorant, intoxicated by knowledge, destroy America—the New Atlantis—in a series of holocausts, an end of Time in my life time that would come in fire-blast, as the end of Atlantean Time had come in earthquake and flood.</p>
<div class="attrib">—Robert Duncan, "The Truth and Life of Myth"</div>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Plato, "the gods divided the whole earth into lots. . . . Poseidon, then, thus receiving as his lot the isle of Atlantis, settled his sons."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> So begins the rise and fall of Atlantis. Or call it a vision of primal unity and subsequent dispersal: the body of Tiamat, Osiris, Kronos; the polis of Eden, Wagadu, utopia's no place. Found in nearly every culture, the flood myth goes back behind Plato's Atlantis and the Judeo-Christian flood to at least the beginnings of the city (Sumer) and ancient Mesopotamian culture.</p>
<p>If there is such a primal vision of creation and destruction in the writings of San Francisco Renaissance poet Robert Duncan (1919–1988), it is based in the recurring dream he had throughout his life, what the poet called the Atlantis dream. The dream surfaces throughout his poetry and prose. Although no two versions of the dream are the same, each narrative begins in a meadow, where the subject is led forth to a ring of children, then to a cavern under the meadow that is ultimately destroyed by flood. In Duncan's magnum opus, <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span>, the dream is and is not biological destiny: "My first mother had died in childbirth, and in some violent memory of that initiation into life, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  she may be the mother-country that had been lost in legend. But for me, the res of the dream remain as if they were not symbolic but primal res themselves of what was being expressed or shown."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>From a biographical perspective, the dream stems from the Pacific tides to which Duncan listened as a child of the Depression, "letting the crash of the surf take over and grow enormous in my mind which dwelt at times like this upon the last days of Atlantis, imagining again the falling of towers, the ruins of cities, the outcry of a populace swept under by the raging elements" (<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 86). After the death of his mother in childbirth, Duncan was adopted by theosophists, who exposed him to various world myths, including the legend of Atlantis. Prior to adopting Robert Duncan, his parents consulted the astrological charts of the Oakland Hermetic Brotherhood. "One thing predicted," biographer Ekbert Faas notes, "was that their future child had not been reincarnated since Atlantis and would embody the decadence of a civilization to be destroyed during his lifetime."<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>From a psychological perspective, the Atlantis dream enacts a symbolic death and rebirth. It is a rite of participation, permission for the singular life to participate in the larger orders of mythopoeia. "Born in 1919 at the close of the War," Duncan relates, "I belonged, I had been told, to an Atlantean generation that would see once more last things and the destruction of a world" (<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 87). The first vision, then, is a vision of last things: earliest dreams and memories conflate the death of the mother, the mother country, and the end or edge of a continent.</p>
<p>Robert Duncan was born into an age of paradox: a time of modernity on the one hand and war and depression on the other. "The Depression years," Duncan writes, "ended all thought of the 'modern,' and still to come the Permanent War Economy in which the euphoria of the 1920s and the mystique of being 'modern' was swept away in the Age of Anxiety and the Beginning of Rage."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> The poet enters into a world in which modernity is belatedness, "nostalgia for a world long gone" ("Self," 219). On a more personal level, the poet enters life as host to memories of personal and transpersonal birth trauma: the death of his mother in childbirth and the death of the "mother country" in Atlantis. In the Atlantis dream, there is recognition of life as derivative, an inheritance from the living and the dead. If Duncan's poetry is "derivative," it is by way of participation in myth: "these things that I did not originate but that came to me as an inheritance of what I was, a gift of life meanings."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Duncan's parents were practicing theosophists, the poet approached their hermetic beliefs "with a divided loyalty and suspicion," reading into its syncretism and utopian wishes the "economic individualism of the nineteenth-century American Protestant ethic and the Self-Cosmos . . . complexly interwoven in their origins" ("Self," 225–26). In a critique of theosophist Madame Blavatsky's ideas, for example, Duncan writes: "It was not a dogma nor was it a magic that I understood for myself in the theosophic world about me, but I understood that the meanings of life would always be, as they were in childhood, hidden away . . . a lasting fascination" (<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 86).</p>
<p>More than anything, it was theosophy's infusion of neo-platonic ideas that Duncan found problematic: a conflation of Protestant mistrust of image and ritual and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Plato's mistrust of the mythopoeic mind. Where theosophy differed from Protestant mistrust, however, was in the role of the priest. For Duncan's parents, "The myths of priests were true; the myths of poets were deceptively true" ("Truth," 4). Questions regarding the truth and falsehood of the mythopoeic are central to Duncan's ethos, and if, according to Plato, philosophy is "the only antidote to the fictions and illusions of Poetry," it is equally true that "the Dialogues of Plato are also stories, and the truth of a story is not rooted in wisdom but in the sense of the drama of life" (ibid). As in the poet's childhood memories of theosophical meetings, the drama of myth making is itself part of the message. Thus, the sickness of modern man, according to Duncan, lies in this tradition of casting out the poet who traffics in myth: "In a time when only one vision—the vision of an atomic disaster and the end of the species—haunts the world, in religion as well as in science, men labor to exorcize all the old stories. The spiritual and political promise of the day is that nothing will happen" (ibid., 5). The challenge for poetry, then, is to find "a structure that will be the complex story of all the stories felt to be true, a myth in which something like the variety of man's experience of what is real may be contained" (ibid., 6). Such a myth, if it speaks to reality, must be accountable to the origins of the real. For Duncan, that myth manifests itself in his Atlantis dream, which draws on the correspondence between individual trauma and collective catastrophe.</p>
<p>Commenting on Robert Duncan's utopian/dystopian poetic, Nathaniel Mackey argues that "the imagination of an other world is itself a judgment of this one, perhaps punishment as well as judgment, for it is impossible to imagine that other world without wanting to go there."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> "The imagination, the potential intellect," Mackey contends, "is intrinsically apocalyptic, inherently judgmental" (ibid., 212). But the correlation here between "the imagination of another world" and "wanting to go there"—the imagination and apocalypse—is too steeped in Christian eschatology and fails to consider that Duncan's view of the imagination was informed, among other things, by a Freudian agon between Eros (creation) and Thanatos (destruction). For Duncan, the imagination is less apocalyptic than metamorphic. One strand of metamorphosis in Duncan's work may be traced from the Atlantis dream to the poem "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow," which recreates the dream not as a fulfillment of its apocalyptic narrative but as a creative vision of knowledge and power repressed within the dramatic narrative of the dream itself.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Atlantis Dream</h1>
<p>The interpretation of dreams runs the risk of over-determination: images stand in as symbols for everything, therefore nothing. And yet a dream image—like ideogram, rebus, or hieroglyph—may be interpreted as a complex of inter-related fields. For Duncan, convinced of psychoanalytic theory early on, the truth of dreams, like the truth of myth and the truth of waking life, is complex and mercurial.</p>
<p>The Atlantis dream is divided into three parts based on the primary images of the meadow, the dance, and the underworld king. This tripartite dream field originates <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  in what is at once an actual meadow, the biological mother, the "mother country" of history and myth, and field of all fields—the cosmos itself. Among other things, the dancers may signify culture and community, and the king, authorship and authority. In Duncan's recounting of the dream in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H.D. Book</span>, the primal and the prophetic intersect: "a prediction of what life will be, now a showing forth of some content of what life is, as in the Orphic mysteries the story of Persephone was shown in scenes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 90). Important here is the Platonic notion that an idea is "a thing seen." An idea "is not something I have," Duncan notes, "but something that comes to me or appears to me" ("Truth," 20). Ideas are manifestations of latent meaning, a "showing forth of some content" that is somehow independent of the poet's volition (ibid.).</p>
<p>The Atlantis dream, part I:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>First there was the upward rise of a hill that filled the whole horizon of what was seen. A field of grass rippled as if by the life of the grass itself, yet I was told there was no wind. When I saw that there was no wind it was a fearful thing, where blade by blade the grass so bowed of its own accord to the West. The grass moved towards the left. The seer or dreamer then was facing north. There may have been flowers—day's eyes—the grass was certainly in flower. The field was alive and, pointing that way, across the rise of the hill to the West, gave a sign.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 89)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The field is all at once a dreamt field ("made up"), "a field of grass," and the cosmos itself. Unlike Dante's "<span style="font-style:italic;">selva oscura</span>" or Charles Olson's "cold hell, in thicket," the subject begins in a clearing. The dream itself is a clearing cultivated and wild, contained and open. But the narrative of the dream is unclear. Who tells the dreamer "there was no wind"? What is the agency behind the apodictic grass, bowing "of its own accord"? The scene is a still life: still and moving, living and dead. A willfulness or intelligence seems to emanate from within the field that "points the way," but if there is life in the field, it is veiled by its very "showing forth" in the sign of the grass itself. Moreover, the field is not only a thing seen but also a seeing thing ("day's eyes") that draws the dreamer away from the east, place of rising and rebirth, and toward west's cardinal point of death.</p>
<p>The field is familiar and yet strangely unfamiliar, imbued with a kind of animism that elicits the dreamer's "fearful" response. The scene is <span style="font-style:italic;">unheimlich</span> in Freud's sense of "that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar things."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Indeed, the dreamer is "fearful" and yet compelled by the grass that points the way. As a complex, the dream image, combining the familiar and the unfamiliar, gets around the censor, allowing for an expression or "showing forth" of a repressed wish. What is the repressed or latent dimension of the field? For Duncan, the dream is a return to a familiar, childhood field, "a place of first permission," as well as an expression of a repressed memory of Atlantis. The unmoved-moving grass triggers a repressed animism, which appears as some vitality submerged under the field. This notion of the return of the excluded or repressed—psychological, historical, mythological, linguistic, and political—is key to Duncan's vision of poetry as revelation. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Compare the first scene of the Atlantis dream in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span> to an earlier ver sion from a copy book entry dated July 1, 1962:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>First there was the upward rise of a hill that filled the whole horizon of the scene. A field of grass rippled as if by the life of the grass itself, for there was no wind while each blade bowed to the left or East. The seer or dreamer then was facing north. There may have been flowers, day's eyes—the grass was certainly in flower. The field was alive and, pointing that way, across the rise of the hill to the East gave a sign.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Was it a "scene" or something "seen"? Does the dreamer see there is no wind or is he "told" there is no wind? If told, then by whom? And does the flowering field point the way east or west? Although east-blowing grass reappears in the poem "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow," if the dreamer is "facing north," then it stands to reason that the grass bowing to the left would bend to the west, not the east. Out of the weave of contrary testimonies, there may be no "first scene" but that each telling is a revision of a lost, original vision. Origin, then, involves contradiction's talking-againstone's self: a fabrication or making up. What one <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span>, is inextricably linked to fiction.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Led forth by the field, the scene shifts. Part II from <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Then, in a sudden almost blurred act of the play, there was a circle of children—sometimes they are all girls or all boys, sometimes they are boys and girls—dancing in the field.

And just here, I realize that this "I" is my self and second that I have been "chosen," but also that in dreaming I am the Chosen One, I have been caught in the wrong—a "King" or victim of the children's round dance. Ring a round of roses. Pocket full of posies.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 89–90)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The natural/supernatural landscape yields to a civil/cultural landscape of children, dance, language, and play. In the first "act," the dreamer is chosen de facto by the dream itself: he "finds himself" in a field. Once again, he is chosen "in dreaming." However, the dreamer is also chosen by a singling out or singing out by the children in the ring. In the Atlantis dream, to be chosen is to be chosen for life (the subject suddenly appears on the meadow) and for death (the subject suddenly appears at the center of a ring, later substituted for a throne in the underworld). The "west bent" grass has pointed the dreamer in a counter- or sinister direction, and he is now "caught in the wrong."</p>
<p>The ambiguity in both scenes seems to emanate from a breakdown between cause and effect. In the first part of the dream, there is an effect (the grass moving by itself) without a cause; in the second part, there is a cause without an effect ("The children choose or have chosen someone who is 'IT' in the center of the ring, but I see no one there"). "IT" turns out to be the dreaming subject, so that his initial presence in the scene is a kind of blind "Eye of the Dream." The ambiguity of the moving grass appears to resolve itself, displaced onto the image of the round dance, but this only creates further ambiguity: there is "no one there" in the center of the ring. The dreamer's self-recognition ("this 'I' is my self"), in turn, may be the dream's attempt to resolve the ambiguity of the complex field-dance image. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The children's round dance amplifies a spatial conration of concentric rings latent in the first and final acts. In the first section, the dreamer stands in a kind of natural ring ("a hill that filled the whole horizon"), but the orientation implies that the dreamer is passive or detached from the field, because the action of the scene moves laterally and at a distance, as if projected onto a screen ("The grass moved towards the left"). Now, the dreamer (It/King) seems to enter the scene in earnest, standing within a series of concentric circles: a ring of children within a ring of field within a dream that is, in turn, inscribed within the world outside the dream. In other words, if the first scene is natural, projective, and linear—a showing forth or forward—then the second scene is culturally constructed, contained, and centripetal. The first scene connotes natural permission, whereas the second scene denotes a public choosing or pre-ordaining in which the subject plays no part. At the same time, it is in this second scene where the subject first refers to himself: a self-proposing, as it were, that would counter the children's singling-out.</p>
<p>The dreamer moves (or is moved) from the natural field of the meadow to the made-up field of the children's round dance, a turn and counter-turn within the larger round of the field itself. <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture</span> means "to turn," and this turning round the speaker proposes the dreamer not only as the subject of a natural scene but also the object of a culturally constructed scene. The dream-subject splits into degraded object ("IT") and exulted subject ("King"): "The Dreamer is in the center, the 'I' or Eye of the Dream. And just here, I realize that this 'I' is my self and second that I have been 'chosen,' but also that in dreaming I am the Chosen One." Circle dances reward community and punish individuality. The community is embodied in the dance, which in turn is the embodiment of the meadow and the song. To be singled out is to be "caught in the wrong," caught outside the song, and discovered by the meadow's covering song. To be "caught" is to be caught up in the fabric of the song and dance. As <span style="font-style:italic;">catch</span> can, it may "possess," "lay hold of" (<span style="font-style:italic;">hand's</span> "apprehend," <span style="font-style:italic;">mind's</span> "comprehend"), "ensnare," "charm," and "fascinate."</p>
<p>In both versions of the Atlantis dream, there is a split between first-person narration ("I") and dream imagery, on the one hand, and third-person narration ("The seer or dreamer," "someone," "Eye of the Dream") and dream thought, on the other. Duncan's approach to the dream-work as a language event operates as a verbal displacement also common in dreams: daisies become "day's eyes," "I" becomes "Eye of the Dream," and so on. As Freud notes, "a change of expression . . . assists dream-condensation even more directly, by finding a form of words which, owing to its ambiguity, is able to give expression to more than one of the dream-thoughts."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Of course, this sort of displacement and condensation appears in dream imagery as well, and in Duncan's dream, a unity of contraries appears in the shift from the meadow scene to the dance scene, where the secreted sentience or life force of the meadow is revealed in the composite image of children dancing on the meadow. Indeed, dreaming is itself a kind of doubling and division of the self into subject (the one who dreams) and object (the one who is dreamt). From a psychoanalytic perspective, both the prescribed and self-prescribed double identities of the dreamer allow him "to treat the rest of the ego like an object."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Self-recognition may also serve as a counter-spell of sorts to the children's spell, allow ing the dreamer to recast himself as "I" just as he is cast as IT/King.</p>
<p>In this second section of the dream, the act of being chosen destabilizes the dreaming subject: he is at once "I," "IT," and "King." In the dream-work of <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span>, Duncan turns toward the ambiguity of the dream-language to present a deeper reading: "Pocket full of posies. Or is it poses? for I had been proposed or I had posed as King, posed myself there. Ashes, ashes. All fall down!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 90). The scene itself is play or make-believe: mimicking the round field in the round dance, the children transform into flowers, "a round of rosies," and the dreamer is transformed into "IT" and "King." Likewise, the ring shrinks in rhyme to a pocket full of posies, then disperses: "Ashes, ashes. All fall down!" The communal space forces displacement and condensation of the self as a transformation and a singling-out. In the rhyme of the ring, to "pose" is to propose destruction.</p>
<p>The dreamer is both more (King) and less (IT) himself. Likewise, the children's rhyme and round dance invite both creative multiplicity (e.g., metaphor: ring = rosies = children; metonymy: ring = pocketful of posies) and destructive exclusion (e.g., the dream-subject is singled out; all things have gone wrong). Here, Duncan uses the drift and play of language to present a complex of narrative associations: posies, poses, proposed. The dream's determination is a willful act, and the counter-spell of the children's play of posies is the profound consequence of being singled out. But even the proposal betrays a fictive, playful dimension: the dreamer stands in for the King; he poses. To come out of nature (the field) and into a community (the dancers) is to come belated to a made-up scene in which one is already "chosen." But the dream is also an act of selection, narration, ordaining. The ambivalence seems to stem in part from having come belated to the scene of the children's game. He arrives in a world already made, a community already "at play" in the making. Has the dreamer "proposed" himself as King or "posed" as King? The dreamer doubles as "Chosen One," or body double of the King.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> To be chosen is to be sacrificed, and in the ring and rhyme of posies, poses, proposed, one also hears intimations of the posed one's dark deposing.</p>
<p>From the <span style="font-style:italic;">Copy Book Entries</span>, here is the earlier version of the second scene of the Atlantis dream:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The differences between the two versions of this section of the dream are based less on puns and contrary images than an attempt in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span> to locate agency in the dreamer, as well as to draw out a more complex sense of cause and effect: "choose or have chosen" vs. "They have chosen"; "I see no one there" vs. "no one appears there"; "the 'I' or Eye of the Dream" vs. "the 'I'"; "I am the Chosen One, I have been caught in the wrong" vs. "I am a king or victim," and so on.</p>

<p class="continued">From open meadow to closed underworld, there is a downward projection, an introjection, though it is unclear who or what leads the subject down toward what is shown. An off-stage character also res in the first scene, though conspicuously absent from the middle or "eye" of the dream, where the children are present. Also worth noting is that this unseen character leads the subject toward a revelation about the chthonic underside of the field and the central absence of agency (e.g., no wind, an empty throne).</p>
<p>This final section of the dream reveals the bowing grass in the first scene and the dancers in the second scene as leading the dreamer toward his own death and presumably the destruction of the meadow. The ring of the field and the ring of children act as fates, singling out the one who would father forth last things. But the King is a sacrificial king. He is inverted and fathers forth nothing. If there is symbolic rebirth, it is only through total destruction. The sacrifice of the king and the sacrifice of the underworld kingdom (the flooding of Atlantis) return, or turn back, to the first law of nature. The grass and round dance act as agents showing forth a primal or first law latent in the composite of images.</p>
<p>In one sense, the dream is a showing forth of the subject within the primary or archetypal contexts of nature, culture, and death, and it is possible, of course, to map onto these mother, peers/siblings, and father. It is also possible to conceive of the three scenes as ages of the dreamer: childhood, adulthood, and old age. But if the dream is <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  primarily narcissistic, it is worth noting the ambiguity (and in some cases, absence) of agency or centering image in each scene, which elicits a fearful or foreboding tone: the invisible, chthonic force that moves the grass; the absent Chosen One at the center of the ring; the vacant King's chair. For Duncan, the center of the dream and the center of the poem are not comprised of narcissistic images but an elusive otherness that both the dreamer and the poet must realize:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>It is in the dream itself that we seem entirely creatures, without imagination, as if moved by a plot or myth told by a story-teller who is not ourselves. Wandering and wondering in a foreign land or struggling in the meshes of a nightmare, we cannot escape the compelling terms of the dream unless we wake, anymore than we can escape the terms of our living reality unless we die.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 89)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">To escape is to wake is to die. Duncan infers a fascinating distinction here between the ontology of the dreaming subject and the ontology of the waking subject. If the poet must have "a likeness to the dreamer of the dream and to the creator of our living reality," then the poem must heed the realities of both life and death (ibid.).</p>
<p>What is most revealing about the dream remains concealed or revealed only in absentia: the mother. Although she is absent from the above narrative, her re is central in subsequent poems that re-vision the Atlantis dream. In Duncan's commentary following the narrative of the Atlantis dream in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span>, the scenes reveal not only an ambivalent and doomed patriarch but also a matriarchal voice of prophecy:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The restless dead, the impending past life, what had been cast away—a seed—sprouts and in the vital impulse would speak to us. The head of a giant woman rises from the ground. "<span style="font-style:italic;">I have seen Kore</span>," the initiate Heracles says: "<span style="font-style:italic;">What face more terrible?" "I am initiate, prepared for Hades</span>." Wonder and terror seem to be signs of the rite. But in my life dream, I have not seen the Maiden, for I stand in her place or in her way.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 90; italics in the original)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">In her place or in her way: repressed, occulted, "wandering in quest of something known in the unknown," the poet is led forth into "wonder and terror" (<span style="font-style:italic;">HD</span>, 103). From birth to initiation, so begin first obstructions and first permissions.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Eleusis</h1>
<p>Duncan's dream analysis in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span> grafts a myth of resurrection—the Eleusinian Mysteries—onto the apocalyptic narrative of the Atlantis dream, suggesting that the "wonder and terror" of the dream have to do most with what is not seen: the <span style="font-style:italic;">visio beatifica</span> of the Kore. Although both the rape of Persephone (Kore) in the Eleusinian Mysteries and the destruction of the city in the Atlantis myth originate in transgression, the theme of revival, or at least partial revival, occurs only in the former. Revision is revival: the dream-work is to the dream as Eleusis is to Atlantis. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In the dream-work, Duncan contrasts his failed vision with the heroic re of Heracles who has "seen the face of Kore." But the poet is mercurial here: this is the Heracles of the Milan Papyrus, which reverses the chronology of the Greek hero's initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries and descent into Hades. Having already seen the face of the Kore, what need is there for dramatic revision? From the "Speech of Herakles": "I was initiated long ago [or: elsewhere]. Lock up Eleusis, [Hierophant,] and put the fire out . . . Deny me the holy night! I have already been initiated into more authentic mysteries. . . . [I have beheld] the fire, whence [. . . and] I have seen the Kore."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Heracles makes a crucial distinction here between "authentic" vision (descent into the underworld) and dramatic revision (the Eleusinian rituals). Is there an authentic vision of the Kore in Duncan's dream? Unless we correlate authenticity with substitutive images, there is no authentic vision. What is seen: terrestrial veils of a meadow, a round dance, and a king. What is seen is blindness, the authorial veil of the seeing "I." If there is a vision in the dream-work, it is tantamount to the torch-bright belatedness of the Eleusinian "holy night": derivative, dramatic, fictive.</p>
<p>No one knows what the Eleusinian Mysteries revealed, though we know the cult at Eleusis was devoted to worshipping Demeter, goddess of grain and agriculture, and her daughter, Persephone. Such worship of vegetation goddesses goes back to the roots of agrarian culture in the Neolithic period. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Homeric Hymn to Demeter</span> tells us that the Eleusinian Mysteries were based on Plouton's (Hades) rape of Persephone and Demeter's subsequent wandering in search of her daughter: transgression, counter-transgression (searching), and restoration. There are various interpretations, though most common is the belief that the myth recounts relationships between the eternal cycle of nature and the historical origins of culture (cultivation). The Eleusinian myth, of course, posits cultural origins not only in nature but also in divine nature, and the rituals at Eleusis were most likely a reenactment of Persephone's descent into and ascent from the underworld. Perhaps most important to both the Eleusinian Mysteries and Duncan's Atlantis dream, is that they center on a vision that is feminine. As Kerényi stresses in his analysis of the myth, the Eleusinian Mysteries "opened up a vision of the <span style="font-style:italic;">feminine source of life</span>. . . just as the ear of grain had opened up a vision into the 'abyss of the seed'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">E</span>, 147, emphasis in original).</p>
<p>There are numerous parallels between Duncan's Atlantis dream and the myth of Demeter/Persephone, so much so that the poet could very well have called it the Eleusinian dream. Both narratives begin in a flowering field alive with chthonic powers. In his analysis of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Homeric Hymn to Demeter</span>, Kerényi states that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nysion pedion</span>, the Nysan Plain, was a meadow: "the divine marriage of Plouton and Kore was celebrated on 'the Meadow,' and the underworld deities were worshipped in a nearby cave" (<span style="font-style:italic;">E</span>, 34). "Flowery meadows," N.J. Richardson observes in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Homeric Hymn to Demeter</span>, "play a prominent part in underworld topography."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> In his catalog of flowers as gateways to the underworld, Richardson singles out the narcissus: "It is a miraculous flower . . . and when [Persephone] reaches out her hands to pick it, the earth gapes and Hades leaps forth. This suggests that the flower is a kind of 'Open Sesame,' a common motif in folk-stories, in which the magic flower is the key that <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  opens the earth, revealing the underworld and its hidden treasures" (ibid., 144). Not unlike the "day's eyes" of daisies in Duncan's dream meadow, for the ancient Greeks, the "golden color [of the narcissus] aptly symbolized the underworld" (ibid.). There are other parallels between the myth and the dream, including the fact that both involve wandering (exile) or being led forth, and both have an intermediary chorus leading the subject into the underworld.</p>
<p>In the Atlantis dream, the subject seems to assume both the role of Persephone, the one who descends, and the role of Demeter, the one who wanders. A biographical reading of the dream would reveal at least a partial inversion of the myth, whereby the dream subject takes on the role of the mother (Demeter) in search of her lost child (Persephone). In other words, the subject is both mother and child. Such a reading might then posit the subject's blindness as a way of partially blocking this inversion, which is complicated all the more by the fact that Duncan's mother died in childbirth.</p>

<span style="font-style:italic;">Myesis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Epopteia</span>
</h1>
<p>Mircea Eliade cites several Orphic (i.e., later) hypotheses on the content of the Great Mysteries. Foucart, for example, working off the Orphic testimony, "considered that the rituals . . . involved a peregrination in darkness, various terrifying apparitions, and the sudden entrance of the mystes into a lighted meadow."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedo</span>, Plato suggests that the Orphic Mysteries go back to Egyptian funerary customs. According to Kerényi, the drama at Eleusis was divided into the Lesser Mysteries (<span style="font-style:italic;">myesis</span>) and the Great Mysteries (<span style="font-style:italic;">epopteia</span>). The Lesser Mysteries:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Myesis</span> can be rendered by the Latin word <span style="font-style:italic;">initia</span>, "beginnings," or its derivative <span style="font-style:italic;">initiatio</span>, or initiation, signifying introduction into the secret. For <span style="font-style:italic;">myesis</span> comes from the verb <span style="font-style:italic;">myeo</span> . . . which denotes the action. The simpler verb <span style="font-style:italic;">myo</span> . . . , from which the noun derives, implies the element of secrecy. It means nothing other than "to close," as the eyes do after seeing. The self-evident first object of this verb is the subject itself: he closes himself after the manner of a flower. But a second object is also possible, which must be very close to the subject, his very own possession. Such an object is the secret. In German this close connection between the secret and the beholder of the secret is expressed by the derivation of the noun <span style="font-style:italic;">Geheimnis</span> (secret) and the adjective <span style="font-style:italic;">heimlich</span> (secret) from <span style="font-style:italic;">Heim</span> (home), the most private precinct.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">E</span>, 46)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">According to this etymology, the occult vision of initiation is paradoxical: seeing is not-seeing, opening is closing, possession is dispossession, and so on. Duncan's dream-work in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span> can be thought of as <span style="font-style:italic;">myesis</span>, a self-reflexive closure that discloses what is not shown in the actual dream. As noted earlier, the scenes of the Atlantis dream are both familiar and unfamiliar, a "wonder and terror" that resonates with Freud's notion of <span style="font-style:italic;">das unheimlich</span> as both <span style="font-style:italic;">vernaculus</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">occultus</span>, "familiar" and "concealed."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">As the eyes do . . . after the manner of a flower</span>: the disclosure of otherness begins with the closure of the self. The dream initiates an open secret, what Kerényi calls the "second object." The <span style="font-style:italic;">volta face</span> of Duncan's dream-work, turning back toward <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the dream, is a sort of doubling closure, showing forth the absent re of the dream (the secret/Kore) who is concealed both in the dream narrative ("I have not seen the Maiden") and as the dreaming narrator ("I stand in her place or in her way").</p>
<p>In the subterranean chamber of the Atlantis dream, a king, a king's symbol of power ("the King's chair"), and finally, in some versions of the narrative, the dreaming/seeing subject ("myself a lonely King in that chair") substitute for the Kore. The king is final avatar of the Kore, or more accurately, avatar in absentia along a chain of substitutions. To stand "in her place or in her way" implies that the speaker's own presence in the dream has blocked the narrative from developing into the second stage of initiation, <span style="font-style:italic;">epopteia</span>, "the state of 'having seen.'" According to Duncan's dream-work, if the absent re of the Kore is "[t]he restless dead, the impending past life, what had been cast away," then what is occluded in the dream is a vision of "the vital impulse" of the dead.</p>
<p>The Atlantis dream is an incomplete initiation, a partial "showing forth" that is blocked by the seeing subject. Indeed, the very fact of the dream's repetition implies a lack of resolution and revelation—the full disclosure of "the state of 'having seen.'" And yet, if the dreaming subject stands in the place of the Kore (symbolic substitution) or in her way (literal obstruction), then Duncan is shown himself <span style="font-style:italic;">as Kore</span>. In other words, he is both the subject and the object of the dream, the secret and the beholder of the secret. But the dream-work reveals that each revelation in the dream, each avatar of the Kore, is a substitution in a chain of substitutions that ends in terror and destruction.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the dream-work in <span style="font-style:italic;">The H. D. Book</span> serves as an intermediary vision of the Kore between the Atlantis dream as initiation (<span style="font-style:italic;">myesis</span>, or "introduction into the secret") and the poet's initiation into poetry as revelation (<span style="font-style:italic;">epopteia</span>, or "the state of having seen"). Taken together, the Atlantis dream, the dream-work, and the poem "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow" operate as a rite of participation in which repressed realities are shown forth. And for the Freudian poet, what is important is not only what is revealed in the dream but what remains concealed. Unlike the Heracles of the Milan Papyrus, drama is not merely derivation but <span style="font-style:italic;">dromenon</span>, deed, "a thing done." The drama of poetry: authentic vision as total composition in which the imagination participates in a complex of what is personal and transpersonal, "made" and "made-up."</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">"Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow"</h1>
<p>Although the Atlantis dream surfaces in several of Robert Duncan's poems, the fullest treatment of the dream appears in "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow," the opening poem in what many consider to be the poet's first mature book, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Opening of the Field</span>.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Like the Atlantis dream, the poem opens with a vision of a meadow. Unlike the dream-work, the poem isn't merely a recounting of the dream or its latent ideas. As Michael Davidson points out, "the poem as field does not imitate but enacts natural and cosmic orders: it does not seek to 'contain' meaning but to discover immanent <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  meanings."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> However, as the earlier dream-work illustrates, each discovery is also a re-covering of meaning. There are, most certainly, both contained meanings and immanent meanings in the poem, and it is the interplay between covering and re-covering that is most vital.</p>
<p>The first meadow opens as a poem and shuts as a door. As it appears in a letter from London to the poet Helen Adam (1 February 1956):</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Often I am permitted to return to a meadow<br>that is not mine, but is a made place<br>—as if the mind made it up—a poem.</p></div>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Two days later, Duncan is reading Ezra Pound's <span style="font-style:italic;">Rock Drill</span> Cantos as both a "prayer for compassion" and "a falsification." "Yes, a falsification," he writes to the poet Denise Levertov. "It is only when the voice in writing lifts into the language itself speaking that the truth of the made-thing presides. The feeling of what is false for me is the evident <span style="font-style:italic;">use</span> of language to persuade."<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Duncan's trouble with Pound's falsifications reveals to him a falsification in his own work. As in the Atlantis dream and dream-work, there is a primary connection made between the evident and the false. Similar to Heracles's distinction between urge and demiurge, act and reenactment, truthfulness resides in "language itself speaking" versus the subject's "<span style="font-style:italic;">use</span> of language to persuade." To press forward by persuasion is to remain unmoved. Two years later, Duncan and Levertov are engaged in a long exchange concerning vision and revision:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>I've found myself sweating over extensive rehaulings on the opening poem ["Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow"] of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Field</span> . . . I mistrust the rationalizing mind that comes to the fore, and must suffer thru—like I did when I was just beginning twenty years ago—draft after draft to exhaust the likely and reach the tone in myself where intuition begins to move. It comes sure enuf then, the hand's feel that "this" is what must be done. But I spent two days struggling with "Sometimes I am Permitted . . ." (with all the irony of the reference in the poem to the grace of the writing at all).</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>, 131)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Sometimes/Often: these "rehaulings" call into question the authenticity of original vision. Revision implies division, diminution, lost integrity. What is at stake here is what <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Duncan calls the "moral urgency" of poetry (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>, 131). The "evident use of language to persuade" is not only uninspired; it is immoral. "In the full enchantment of art," he writes, "fiction has the depth and lastingness as a real experience that actuality has only in events of like creative participation. Yet in the failure of that creative immediacy, we will come to feel that the story is not true to itself" ("Truth," 13–14). Arguably, in the Atlantis dream there is no such "creative participation"; instead, the subject of the dream stands in the way. If to "exhaust the likely" is to achieve integrity in the poem, then Duncan's revision of "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow" is also a radical revision of the Atlantis dream as imbued with the virtue of first things.</p>
<p>The first few stanzas as they appear in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Opening of the Field</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<h1 class="sec-headA">Often I am Permitted to Return to a Meadow</h1>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">As revision of a primal scene, the poem returns to the dream's antediluvian meadow: a "made" coherence that precedes both the poem's remaking and the flood's unmaking of the field. An enabling conceit lies couched in the humility of the title. As a permitted act, the poem is both an invocation of an original scene (Atlantis dream) and a provocation of the speech act as derivation—a drama "made-up by the mind" that allows the poet to reenter the field of the dream as the field of the poem. In the opening tercet of the draft to Helen Adam, the meadow image recedes behind twin artifices of the maker's "mind" and "poem." As such, it repeats the rational operative of the dream-work: Kore is to meadow as mind/poem is to meadow. Whereas the first draft of the meadow poem attempts to resolve this ambivalence by overtly substituting the poem for the meadow, the revised poem returns the meadow to its original ambivalence as both a "made" and a "made-up" place. The self-conscious correlation between meadow and poem drops out.</p>
<p>"Made-up" and "made," the meadow is all at once derivative and primary. It is "mine" and "not mine," "as if . . . made-up by the mind" and "a made place // . . . near to the heart." A homophonic pun registers below the surface of the meadow as "maid place" of the Kore. The "made place" is engendered female and opposite what is "made-up": the pretend place of the male subject whose return would remake the meadow in his own image. The spatial conration of the maid below the meadow in the Atlantis dream takes on a more temporal aspect as antecedent to the poem. In the dream, the "maiden" is unseen but intimated in the rippling field of grass pointing toward the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  underworld. The return in the dream to a made/maid place is derivative, implying falsification and subterfuge: "all things have gone wrong."</p>
<p>The overt correlation between meadow and poem in the first draft is subtly intimated with a stanza break in the revision. Instead of returning to the refrain ("Often I am permitted"), the stanza break between couplet and tercet emphasizes the difficulty in locating the meadow "that is not mine, but is a made place // that is mine, it is so near to the heart." As Duncan states in his preface to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ground Work: Before the War</span>, caesuras are "not just an articulation of phrasings but a phrase itself of silence. Space between stanzas becomes a stanza-verse of silence: in which the beat continues."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> In other words, the absence of language is not the absence of measure; instead, the caesural turn registers as possession within language (a phrase of silence) and dispossession outside of language (a silent phrasing).</p>
<p>It is impossible to say for certain where speaker and meadow exist in relation to one another. As "a scene made-up by the mind," "near to the heart," and "an eternal pasture," the meadow (i.e., poem) is all at once inside and outside the speaker. If <span style="font-style:italic;">permitted</span> means "sent forth" and <span style="font-style:italic;">return</span> "sent back," then permission to return implies a paradoxical motion of being sent back and forth all at once. A return by definition is displacement from an original time or place. To return, then, is to participate in a fabricated or "made-up" origin. The field is folded upon contrary propositions, imitating the folding of the field itself. But the permission of the title implies that the poem's return to a meadow is motivated not by the speech act per se but by someone (or something) whose permission precedes the poem. Permission to return to a meadow, therefore, participates in a scene prior to the beginning of the poem and the movement of language itself.</p>
<p>In Duncan's Atlantis poem, off rhymes (mind/mine, made/place, thought/hall, and so on), homophonic puns (seen/scene, made/maid), and assonance and alliteration (made-up/mind/mine; heart/hall; forms/fall, and so on) imitate the peristaltic motion of "going forth" and "turning back." To listen to the poem is to hear all at once the shuttle of likeness (permission) and difference (retraction). For example, the consonant chain "made-up," "mind," "mine," and "made": each rhyme and off rhyme acts as a kind of acoustic turn (difference of vowels) and return (likeness of consonants). Likewise, clausal enjambments run interference between declaratives, enfolding each image in its contrary, "as if it were a scene made-up by the mind / that is not mine, but is a made place // that is mine, it is so near to the heart." The contrary movement of language and images tends to assert, erase, then reassert relationships between subject and object, speaker and meadow, re and field.</p>
<p>The next several stanzas extend the folded topography of the meadow to include not only the speaker's body but an interior, constructed space ("a hall therein") that contrasts with the natural, "made" surface of the meadow. Making (remaking?) the meadow posits a complex relationship between interiors and exteriors, origins and derivations, the speaker and the "First Beloved":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Wherefrom fall all architectures I am<br>I say are likenesses of the First Beloved<br>whose flowers are flames lit to the Lady. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>She it is Queen Under The Hill<br>whose hosts are a disturbance of words within words<br>that is a field folded.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">("Often," 7)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">It is tempting to say that one image telescopes into another, but each image actually falls away like scaffolding in order to reveal a deeper image. The meadow, "created by light," casts the speaker in relief as "shadows that are forms," which are, in turn, "all architectures I am." These "architectures" are "likenesses of the First Beloved" and correspond with the "hall" of the second stanza. The First Beloved appears to surface here, but the image is convoluted. The meadow, "folded in all thought," proposes an interior that is artificial, constructed in concentricities of likeness.</p>
<p>Cary Nelson notes that the meadow "seems almost an imaginary <span style="font-style:italic;">hortus conclusus</span>, an enclosed garden protected from the outside world."<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Indeed, the mental ("mind") aspect of the meadow seems to portray this place as hermetic, interior, and convoluted, implying a topography contrary to the projective connotation of an opening of the field. But Duncan is a Freudian poet, and equating "enclosed" with "protected" evades the complexities of repressed realities that surface dynamically within the poem. This is, after all, not an enclosing of the field but an opening of the field. Nelson's <span style="font-style:italic;">hortus conclusus</span> holds true only if we restrict the spatial economy of the meadow to a latitudinal model. What is repressed inside/under the meadow is not "protected from the outside" but disclosed by what is concealed in the speaker's "mind": the "made place" of the poem, the subterranean, "words within words," "return" as temporal transgression (e.g., memory, history), and so on. Indeed, both "permission" and "return" imply less of a <span style="font-style:italic;">conclusus</span> than an <span style="font-style:italic;">inclusus</span>, a folding-in or folding-back on what is exterior and anterior to the place and time of the meadow.</p>
<p>Duncan's dream-work recalls that in the Atlantis dream, "there was the upward rise of a hill that filled the whole horizon of what was seen" (HD, 89). Etymological substrata turn up "concealment" and "possession" in the roots of <span style="font-style:italic;">upward, hill</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">horizon. Healdan</span> is "to hold, retain." A horizon (<span style="font-style:italic;">horos</span>) is a boundary. A child's perspective? There is something grotesquely disproportionate about the hill filling "the whole horizon of what was seen," as if the spatial ratios of re (hill) and field (sky) were transposed. But from a mythological or psychological perspective, ratio and scale are proportionate, the field tumescent with what life force lies concealed or repressed within it. This weird topography reappears in the poem not as an upward rise but as folding and stratification into surface and interior. At the same time, the topography lends a sense of latitude and circularity to the meadow, which is picked up later in the children's "ring a round of roses."<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Each line of the poem moves forward by circling backward. The "fall" of "shadows"/"forms" picks up in the fourth stanza as "architectures" that are "likenesses of the First Beloved," just as the preceding "shadows" are likenesses of "a made place, created by light." Qualifying conjunctions ("that") between noun clauses move the imagery forward, at the same time mysteriously enfolding the labyrinthine logic of each scene back on itself. The speaker equates "all architectures I am" with "likenesses of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the First Beloved," whose lit flowers, like Dante's anti-images, foreground the re of the Lady, illuminating her brighter image.</p>
<p>Kore, <span style="font-style:italic;">Kardia, cor</span>: as <span style="font-style:italic;">catches</span> they are charms, guerdons, cordials "so near to the heart," they do not repel death but impel the meadow that gives birth not only to life (First Beloved) but also to death (Queen Under The Hill). Taken as a dream's dark flowers, they are posies posed "as King." Given as a poem's bright cordial, they are "flames lit to the Lady." In "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow," poses propose permission, the original proposition that places the speaker in the meadow of the poem. Indeed, in all of Duncan's poetry there are leads in misleadings, hearings in mishearings, so that like the Gnostic, mistrust becomes a force as generative as trust.</p>
<p>At the middle line of the middle stanza, we seem to pass into the interior of the meadow and the meadow poem. A kind of outrider, it is the longest line of the poem. If we think of the meadow as a language event, then these "words within words" are also our deepest penetralia into the made meadow itself. The formal and visual awkwardness of the line demonstrates "a disturbance of words" that resists containment. The flower-flames link the "First Beloved" to "the Lady," who is also "Queen Under The Hill." The field is enfolded in "a disturbance of words within words," not unlike the poem itself which resonates with a surplus of meaning in alliterations, off-rhymes, and puns.</p>
<p>The third movement of the poem returns to the surface of the meadow, retracting the metaphorical and chthonic dimensions:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>It is only a dream of the grass blowing<br>east against the source of the sun<br>in an hour before the sun's going down</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>whose secret we see in a children's game<br>of ring a round of roses told.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">("Often," 7)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">It: the meadow? the poem? We are once again on the meadow or in the dream of a meadow versus under it, the "words within words" of a folded field rered as "only a dream of the grass blowing." It is a simple thing, a play of surfaces like "a children's game / of ring a round of roses told." The phrasing is reminiscent of the familial voice, reassuring the waking child that "it is only a dream." However, the tone here is not soothing but sinister. What do we "wake from"? If a "return to a meadow" is a return to the Atlantis dream, then to assert that the meadow is "only a dream" isn't to "unfold" but instead fold it once more back into itself—a kind of dream within a dream, a double-dream. The unfamiliar (dream) and the familiar (meadow scene) strangely transpose, as if the speaker were calling to us to wake from the speech act into the "dream of the grass blowing / east against the source of the sun." To wake is to die.</p>
<p>Although the speaker's tone and diction imply a diminution of the meadow, the image superimposes the meadow and the round dance that appear as separate scenes in the Atlantis dream. The round dance turns within (under?) a terrestrial circle (the meadow) inscribed within a solar circle. The children's game seems to counter the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  east-to-west solar movement, their round dance returning like the grass that turns "against the source of the sun." In the Atlantis dream, the grass "bowed of its own accord to the West." Here, the grass isn't bowed to the West but blowing to the East, "the source of the sun." One hears, too, "the source of the <span style="font-style:italic;">son</span>" symbolically red in the East as origin: a "first place," a mothering meadow. If there is a "secret" in the round dance, its orientation is sinister. Indeed, the vision is oriented to the ancient notion of the sun's subterranean return from its death in the West to rise once more in the East. As "a return to a meadow" implies, the poem bears such sinister orientation. Although there is no explicit relationship between fold and circle, both patterns complicate the topographical metaphor of "returning," since folding ("words within words") and circling ("round of roses told") retrace the prescribed field.</p>
<p>Who are these children whose round game holds the secret to the "dream of the grass"? As hosts imitating the moving grass, they are to the meadow as "a disturbance of words" is to The Queen Under The Hill. The word <span style="font-style:italic;">host</span> itself contains a host of contrary meanings: "guest" and "keeper of guests"; as parasite (<span style="font-style:italic;">parasitos</span>), "one who sits at the table (body) of another." Of course, the host is also spiritual parasite of the body (e.g., victim, sacrifice, recompense), and in the body politic, the belly of a wooden horse swarming with the <span style="font-style:italic;">parasitos</span> of Greek soldiers smuggled into Troy: a gift, a guest, a harbinger of death. By all accounts, <span style="font-style:italic;">host</span> signifies a blurring of boundaries between inside and outside, interior and surface. In Duncan's meadow poem, "words within words" are "hosts" to the Queen: a "field folded" and maid of words.</p>
<p>Like the spell and counter-spell of the children's round dance, the poem returns to the fact of first lines, first permissions and propositions, signaling a return to the beginning of the poem. The children's round dance, turning and returning at the surface of the field, correlates with the "disturbance of words within words," turning and turning up the denotative surface of language. The very turning of the round dance signifies both the permission of the poem and the secrecy of the dream enfolded in the meadow. Although the children's round dance seems to turn contrary to the "forward moving" sun, it also turns the poem forward as catalyst or chorus. Turning forward and backward, the reader is asked to hold in mind each preceding image. The "secret we see" reveals the meadow in miniature as "a children's game." That is, the "made-up" circle of the round dance inscribed within the "made" circle of the meadow. The "secret" is also a foretelling of the destruction of Atlantis in the children's rhyme of "ring a round of roses": <span style="font-style:italic;">Ashes, ashes, all fall down</span>. If there is anxiety in the dance and the dream, it is red just here in the rhyme that builds, round and round, toward its own falling down. To dance is to draw out, and in the Atlantis dream the dance draws out the subject as "Chosen One," ushering in the destruction of the meadow. If the children's round dance imitates or reenacts the creation of the meadow, then in both the Atlantis dream and the meadow poem, the dance acts as a kind of demiurge: artistry is derivative, made-up, fallen. And in the Gnostic tradition, the demiurge is evil: artistry is counter-turn (return) against the original turn of creation. Likewise, the "disturbance of words within words" may imply not only a turning-up of buried or repressed meanings within the host of each word, but also the notion that each construction contains within itself the seed of its own destruction. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Unlike the Atlantis dream, however, the poem's round dance returns us to the meadow:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Often I am permitted to return to a meadow<br>as if it were a given property of the mind<br>that certain bounds hold against chaos,</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>that is a place of first permission,<br>everlasting omen of what is.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(ibid.)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The refrain links a formal return in the poem to a kind of magical repossession of the meadow vision as "bound" within both the poem and the speaker, "a given property of the mind" that would "hold against chaos." In this sense, the meadow-as-artifice encloses. Ideas are images—properties of the phenomenal world. But permission and property pull the poem in opposite directions. Do "certain bounds hold against chaos" because of the permission bestowed upon the speaker? Are these "certain bounds" the mind, the mind's image of the meadow, or the meadow itself? And does <span style="font-style:italic;">certain</span> mean "particular," "fixed," or "true"? The poem's oscillating motion seems to arrest itself here in the declarative of an origin in omen, not only of the meadow but also of the poem itself as "everlasting omen of what is." But an omen does not reveal "what is"; it reveals what has yet to be. Ultimately, this "place of first permission" and "everlasting omen of what is" isn't explicitly revealed. This "given property," then, may be thought of as permission's liberating constraint. Mind/mined: a pun joins the mental and the physical, the labor of the mind given over to what is mined: a mental georgic, a labor in and of the field.</p>
<p>Between "certain bounds" and "chaos," "everlasting omen" and "what is," Robert Duncan's "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow" proposes that we do not progress in dream or poem but ceaselessly evolve within a matrix of creation and destruction, history and prophecy. For the Heracles of the Eleusinian mysteries, dramatic enactment was "less authentic." For Duncan, authenticity and authority in the dramatic creation of poetry stem from not only the author's authenticity but also the authority of myth. Indeed, the poem is simultaneously a remembering of the Kore and a dismembering of the speaker's ego that would, as king, depose her. And if she res as words, then to remember the Kore is permission for the poem to stand in the place of the poet's ego, marking a passage between the vision of a dream and the revision of a poem.</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Introduction</h1>
<p>Synaesthesia, briefly stated, is that species of metaphor which uses the vocabulary of the data of one sense to describe the data of another sense—for example, "a green smell" or "a soft flavor." It is not a novel poetic technique and has a decent pedigree in the Western literary tradition. With the development of European expressionisms in central and eastern Europe in the years surrounding the First World War, among all of the various innovations of form, treatments of the self, and philosophies of language, synaesthesia, too, began to be employed to startling effect, toying with those once discrete sensory boundaries. In general terms, "The adjective," writes Richard Sheppard on the fundamental building block of expressionist metaphor, "the principle agent of description, was to change function: instead of describing the impression made by the external world, it was to bring forth the hidden metaphorical dimensions of the poet's subjective vision."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Building on this characterization of rative language, the purpose of this essay is twofold. First, after a preliminary discussion of the literary and linguistic foundation of synaesthesia, I will develop the idea of temporaesthesia, that is, the perception of time as an element in the concrete sensory world of expressionist metaphor. I argue, second, that this synaesthetic category is a potentially potent tool for assessing not only a particular poetic vision, but also a poet's view of history informed by it.</p>
<p>The first issue to address is why, in the dizzying array of modernisms, focus on expressionism. First of all, the answer begins again in Sheppard's statement about the adjective in expressionist poetry. One key strand in the twine of expressionist <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  poetry is the emotional deformation of a perceived reality which is imposed back on that reality. It is a poetry, in other words, which seeks to turn what is subjective to the perceiver into objective reality. Frames of reference in the poetic world were thus liberated from representational conventions of impressionist or symbolist language. Second, expressionism was a markedly "decentered" movement. Speaking of German expressionism, for example, Neil H. Donahue notes that "The atmosphere of subversive excitement was not centered in any one city, as was the French avant-garde in Paris (where Expressionists were also active), but rather it spread through regional cities [ . . . ]"; it was an electric and eclectic atmosphere with "collective but disparate dimensions."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> This was as much the case for the Yiddish expressionist incarnations as the German ones. However, whereas this decentering was symptomatic of the literary cultural attitude of the German-language poets, for the Yiddish poets, as we will see, it was also a thematic nexus.</p>
<p>Now I do not hold that generalizations must pertain to the whole of a nebulous movement (or better a sluice of interpercolating movements) when derived from observations of two poets. Rather, what I hope to achieve is a portrait of the potential of a given technique. To do this I will look at the works of Perets Markish, one of the premier Yiddish expressionists, and compare them with those of Georg Trakl, one of the early German expressionists. The choice is not fortuitous. Georg Trakl, who lived from 1887 to 1914 and spent most of his life in his native Austria, was a key re in early German expressionism; his poetry is marked by a minimalism of subtly altering permutations of imagery and language. Perets Markish (1895–1952), on the other hand, lived a remarkably peripatetic life, living in (and traveling through) many of the centers of Eastern European Jewish cultural life. The poetry of his early career—the poetry on which I am focusing here, from roughly 1917 to 1922—is also a kind of minimalist expressionism (especially when seen in contrast both to his own output later in life, and to a contemporary maximalist Yiddish expressionist such as Uri Tsvi Greenberg), often marked by a similarly compact set of themes, imagery, and language. Not only are their literary lives bookended by the First World War in Eastern Europe—Trakl was an army medic who died by his own hand in 1914 after witnessing the war's unspeakable brutality on the battlefield, and Markish, who fought and was wounded at the front, published his first Yiddish poem in 1917<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a>—but their poetries bear an additional affinity in their synaesthetic imagery. In a number of their poems the perception of time itself is featured as a central element in many of their synaesthetic metaphors, namely "temporaesthesia."</p>
<p>Ultimately what gets put in strong relief by setting these two poets next to one another is the representative place each one occupies as endpoints of a spectrum. In their use of temporaesthesia, Trakl overwhelmingly temporalizes space while Markish starkly spatializes time: of Trakl, the completely "grounded" poet, it has been noted that "landscapes not only provide the dominant source of vocabulary for [his] work, but that they also form the most meaningful living space for his speakers."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> In point of fact, in Hildegard Steinkamp's important work on Trakl's use of landscape imagery, she finds that "He chooses landscape words according to the principle of the experiential proximity <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of phenomena (<span style="font-style:italic;">contiguity</span>), and then, using this selection (of landscape words), structures two coherent and dominant thematic sequences, <span style="font-style:italic;">i.e., space</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">time</span>."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> She is ultimately led to conclude that "Characteristic for Trakl, however, is the structuring of time by idiolectal means, that is, by means of landscape words."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> The metaphors which she chooses to analyze, though, are <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> synaesthetic, but rather they set up correlative or parallel frames of reference. This very nicely sets up my conceptual move to synaesthesia, and more specifically temporaesthesia.</p>
<p>Whereas for Markish, geographically speaking, one of the central elements of his "lyrolect" (that is, those elements of a poet's idiolect which transcend mere repetition and constitute individual vortices of shifting thematic and semantic value) was the word <span style="font-style:italic;">hefker</span>.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Originally meaning "ownerless or abandoned property," it came to mean both what was licentious and lawless (negative) and what was completely free and unfettered (positive); Markish's preference was for the latter valorization. This loose-leafed freedom was emblematic of a peripatetic poet and his people never truly "at home" in the lands they inhabited.</p>
<p>Taking these two poets, as I mentioned above, as poles provides a benchmark against which the use of this technique may be evaluated in the poetry of other expressionists, or modernists more generally. Although what emerge are two distinct and complicated techniques for coping with spatial and temporal relationships, it is ultimately through this affinity that we find a possible way of accessing these poetries' understanding of history.</p>
<p>Trakl could "stand poised above"<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> history; he was able to develop a finely calibrated vocabulary for his hallucinatory sensescapes precisely because there was a cultural connection to place, a conventional grounding which anchored the poetry. This is why even such a powerful war poem as "Grodek," written after experiencing the horrors at the eponymous battle, "<span style="font-style:italic;">appears</span><a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> to be perhaps the most impersonal front-line poem ever written."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Furthermore, when Steinkamp writes "It is in the 'blue hour'<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a>—in the characteristic leisure of his mental and physical passage through the landscape—that Trakl's speakers gain insight into the peril threatening their existence"<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> she is pointing out a fundamental temporalization of space. To take an example, here is the first half of Trakl's "Der Abend" ("The Evening"):</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>With the shapes of dead heroes<br>You fill, moon,<br>The forests growing quiet,<br>Crescent moon—<br>With the soft embraces<br>Of the lovers,<br>The shades of celebrated times<br>The decaying boulders all around [ . . . ]<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The forests are not quiet; rather they are described during the hazy crepuscular time when all is in the process of growing quiet. That is, the forest is reckoned in time. Not only that, but the moon—a visual entity—fills this time-space with the "shades of celebrated times." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>For Markish, there was no option to stand poised above, certainly in no meaningful cultural way as for Trakl. Groundlessness and exile are as culturally organizing principles as the conventional landscape was for Trakl and many other German expressionists. See, for example, how this is expressed in the "Proclamation" which opened the first issue of the Yiddish expressionist literary journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatros</span> (Warsaw, 1922)<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> edited by Uri Tsvi Greenberg: "A bridge, four walls, and a ceiling for the homeless, poet-individuals, in their foreign-land wandering around in the various centers of the Jewish-people's exterritoriality. Literary dissolution."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> How different from Trakl's outlook, then, is Markish's poem "Mit hoyker afn hartsn" ("With a hump upon the heart") from 1922:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>With a hump upon the heart, with a hump upon the back<br>—You seem, watchmaker, like you should have four shoulders!<br>And time upon them grows like wild moss on boulders<br>With the thin dust of dark rafters and pavements [ . . . ]<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In a complicated poem about the abject difficulty of maintaining a sense of self under the "grotesque" tyranny of the modern world, time is red first as a doubly hunch-backed watchmaker (modernity's weird Geppetto) and then as a mossy boulder, about as rooted and concrete a spatialized image as one can get. Notice, too, the very different treatment in each of these poems of the key cognate for "boulders": German <span style="font-style:italic;">Felsen</span>, Yiddish <span style="font-style:italic;">feldzn</span>.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Modernist Notions of Time and Disunity</h1>
<p>It seems clear that the loss of perceived order, whose ultimate symbol was the First World War, was a foundational element for the larger vocabulary of "disunity" so prevalent in early modernist thinking. (Consider, for example, the "prophetic" martial poems of Trakl<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> or Georg Heym, published prior to the First World War, to see how atmospheric this was.) It is a concept which touched all areas of life, from the artistic and philosophical to the social, political, and ideological. Focusing, however, on one of our fundamental perceptual constructs, time, we see that, again in Sheppard's words, "[b]ecause a principle of unity is felt to have been lost, the present seems to lose its organic connection with the past and the future. Time becomes a series of fragmented instants, and a sense of continuity gives way to discontinuity."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Such literary conceits as the vignette, the slice of life perceived as the <span style="font-style:italic;">coup-d'oeil</span>, a glance at a passing reality, give way to the "fragmented instant," "discontinuous" from its contextual reality, broken away, fractured (to use another good modernist <span style="font-style:italic;">Leitwort</span>).</p>
<p>Refocusing our lens once again, this time on a specific modernist trend, namely expressionism, we constantly see language expressive of this notion, and not only on the individual level, but as a strikingly cleft view of history. As Sheppard remarks, again in his essay "German Expressionism," "[ . . . ] the Expressionists frequently stood poised above the twentieth century, unsure of their commitment to it, simultaneously looking back to an ideal past and forward to a Utopian future."<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Our natural concern, then, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is with some semblance of discord between the notions of instantial fracture, the loss of a perceived "organic" unity, and the self-dissociation of the poet from the fractured moment and extending his sight forward and backward to the "Utopian" and the "ideal," the distant endpoints in an organic, cultural (and even mythically constructed) conception of history. In that sense, though, they truly are "no-where," praising the folly of Modern man's attempt to regain the unity, or better yet order, that were somehow lost, and where the grim and umbral conventionalities of language render one incapable of even expressing that feeling.</p>
<p>One way of looking at the problem is by positing a different way of expressing the perception of time among the expressionists. It is a kind of synchronic ordering of a vision of both the past and of the future. To use an archaeological metaphor, we are dealing with Tel Time<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a>. In his "Four Quartets," T. S. Eliot, to be sure not an expressionist but reflective of a modernist propensity, weighs in thus: "Time present and time past/ Are both perhaps present in time future,/ And time future contained in time past./ If all time is eternally present/ All time is unredeemable."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> The fundamental disconnectedness of time rests precisely in the poet's ability to "stand poised above," where the standpoint occupies a moment infected by refractions from the prism "time past" and "time future." It is all an instant in itself, both perceived and contextualized in itself. It is the perfect fragment, dissociated, but still bearing the outline of its former host. One important collection of German expressionist poetry bears the title <span style="font-style:italic;">Menschheits-dämmerung</span> which, since the word <span style="font-style:italic;">Dämmerung</span> is in German an enantioseme (that is, a word bearing semantically within itself its own opposite), can be translated both as "twilight of humanity" and as "dawn of humanity."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Yet the poetry contained in the anthology is poetry of the expressionist instant, existing but looking both to creation and destruction. The echo is the <span style="font-style:italic;">Götterdämmerung</span>, the "twilight of the Gods." Importantly, though, Wagner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Ring</span> (whose final opera is <span style="font-style:italic;">Götterdämmerung</span>) ends in the same place and situation as it began, coming full circle. It is time as a mythic process.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Theoretical Framework</h1>
<p>Moving away from time and back briefly to synaesthesia, we find in Stephen de Ullmann's article, "Romanticism and Synaesthesia: A Comparative Study of Sense Transfer in Keats and Byron,"<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> a couple of fairly interesting and useful assertions, dealing with evidence from the English Romantic period.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> First, there is the designation of a "hierarchy" within the sensorium, ranking, from the lower to the higher, the realms of touch, heat, taste, scent, sound, and sight. I am particularly interested in his having given "heat" its own separate designation within the sensorium. It seems clear that heat operates as a subset of the tactile realm. Adding "heat" to the traditional five-part division of the sensorium permits a degree of liberty with regard to our construal of the sensory world. De Ullmann would not have included the calorific category if it were not felt to have been of specific import in the works of English Romantic poetry. The traditional sensory division should be refined in light of the particular poetic idiolect (and indeed lyrolect) of a poet as well as the larger literary context in which he or she <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  writes. On this ground I feel justified in interpreting the sensory world of modernist poetry as characterized by a set of sense perceptions of particular importance, extending to a greater or lesser degree the traditional sensory schematization, depending on the poet.</p>
<p>The next assertion de Ullmann puts forward is that one can make general statements about trends in the directionality of synaesthetic transfers. To clarify, he states that, for his depiction, "the destination will always be provided by the element <span style="font-style:italic;">about</span> which the poet is saying something."<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> This is to say that the origin or "source" of the synaesthetic transfer is the complement, or the modifier, and the destination or "terminus" is the actual object of description. His contention, then, is that there are discernable trends as to which senses more often act as sources and which senses more often act as termini. In the case of the Romantics, to summarize his findings, it seems that most transfers are from lower to higher senses, that they originate in the tactile field, and that their terminus is the auditory one.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Whether this is borne out in modernist poetry remains to be seen, but it does provide us with a prior methodology to bear in mind when analyzing cases of synaesthesia. Based on a representative assortment of synaesthetic examples, a couple of general instructive trends become apparent for our two poets. By and large, in both Markish and Trakl, their sense transfers conform to de Ullmann's observation that most transfers move from lower to higher levels in the sensorium. After that, however, the ability to generalize begins to break down. For Markish, taste→sight transfers appear to be slightly more numerous where for Trakl, sight→sound transfers, contrary to the "lower to higher" generalization, are rather more abundant than any other single category.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in an interesting way by linguistic theory in the notion of re and Ground. As described by Len Talmy in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Toward a Cognitive Semantics</span>, terminologically speaking the "re" is the variable element, the focus of attention, and the "Ground" is the relatively static element, the orientation point of the "re."<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Taking Talmy's sentence "The bike is near the house,"<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> "the bike" is the re and "the house" is the Ground. Yet were we to take the sentence, "The house is near the bike," this strikes us as somehow odd. This is due to the fact that there are "'associated characteristics' of re and Ground that tend to correlate it with [their] definitional properties . . . "<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a>. Yet these "associated characteristics" are set in terms of definitional ones, and if context reorganizes the conditions of the definitional characteristics, the relations of the associated characteristics may also change; that is why "The house is near the bike" is still permissible.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Later on Talmy asserts that "[a]s part of the system of spatiotemporal homology that is found in language [ . . . ] the reference of re and Ground to the relative location of objects in space can be generalized to the relative location of events in time."<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> With regard to our poets, then, they seem to have taken this perception about language one step further. In what we might call a "synaesthetic" move, both space and time become contemporaries, the one re and the other Ground in the <span style="font-style:italic;">same</span> image. Insofar as the senses, inhering in objects, are spatially organized, I have termed this transposition of time into a spatial continuum "temporaesthesia." We can then move on to make a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  qualified generalization, à la de Ullmann, about the <span style="font-style:italic;">tendency</span> of the transfers which we find in Markish and Trakl. For Markish, as for many of the Yiddish modernists, Yiddish is "a language without a land."<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> One effect of this "deterritorialization" for Markish is that the "conventional" Ground for his temporaesthesiae is Time, thus inverting a more "standard" locative, or even territorial, Ground as we more often find in Trakl.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Synaesthesia</h1>
<p>Before beginning to look specifically at examples of this temporaesthesia, it will be instructive to examine a few instances of synaesthesia proper in Markish and Trakl for two reasons: first, to get a feel for their styles and to gauge where possible how that technique is oriented in their poetry; and second, to show how the idea of temporaesthesia I am developing can be arrived at as a legitimate modernist technique on theoretical grounds. So, to begin, Markish's phantasmagoric and fantastic poema <span style="font-style:italic;">Di Kupe</span> ("The Heap"),<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> about the Horodishtsh pogrom of 1919, breathes life into a pile of decaying corpses after the pogrom. In the fifth section of that poem, in one of a myriad nightmare visions of the actions of the heap, we read:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Slowly! The pile is climbing to lick up the heavens like a plate of cloudy jelly,<br>And to suck out the world's scraped, hollow bone, —<br>Red craziness from her gushes out over distances and over seas . . . <a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">"Craziness" itself is not a concrete object of perception. Nevertheless here the madness is red, being associated with the "red snows" that cover the top of the heap of bodies, bloody with the massacre. Indeed, this is the same blood with which the speaker of the poem orders the "wind-pilgrims," those passing breezes personified as if on some holy mission, to anoint their wings—an image of the blood somehow transferred to the winds themselves in their peregrinations over the heap, seemingly as an element of some gruesome rite.</p>
<p>In Trakl's somber, and less bloody, poem "Trompeten" ("Trumpets")—a poem in which the sounding of trumpets rolls over the sad landscape, causing even the shivering of a graveyard—we find a similar conjunction of "craziness" with sense data. The end of the poem reads, "Dancers arise from a black wall;/ Banners of scarlet, laughing, craziness, trumpets."<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> The scene on the wall pulls together associatively (as is often the function of a list) four "objects," three of which are "sensory" in the traditional sense: "banners of scarlet"—visual; "laughing" and "trumpets"—auditory. The fourth element, "craziness," shares in the redness of the banners whose context bears hints of religion but is most probably predominately martial. We are thus presented with both death (and possibly bloodshed depending on how far the repeated image of scarlet banners may be taken), especially in light of the earlier sepulchral imagery of the poem,<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> as well as with triumph. The image is not necessarily a rarity, bearing in mind an example such as Markish's poem "Du, oysgehonikte af turemshpits fun sdom" ("You, enhonied on the tower-top of Sodom") where we read: ". . . in red, crazy nights . . . ,"<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> which <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  extends the associative field of "redness—craziness" to that of desire and sexuality. These examples are not examples of synaesthesia except in a nebulous way.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Instead they are illustrative as a preliminary glimpse at the complexity of an individual sense datum, as in the "red—crazy" pair.</p>
<p>What is most instructive with regard to these examples is the effect of the awkward application of a sensory description. What I said could refer to any area of the sensorium, but I have begun with color insofar as it is the most marked sense in this regard. In Françoise Meltzer's article, "Color Cognition in Symbolist Verse,"<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> she speaks of a shift in weight, in symbolist poetry, of a color term from its "secondary" role of attribution to one of much greater importance when the noun of which it is predicated is "abstract": "Since color itself is void of any ideational content, when it refers to an abstraction, a sort of semantic boomerang effect is produced: instead of intensifying the object it should modify, the color returns to itself, and suddenly stands out in isolation. In this way a dissonance is produced."<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> This may also be applied to our examples above, but there the "boomerang effect" heightens the associative force of the sense term.</p>
<p>Meltzer addresses this "dissonance" technique further: "Dissonance is also achieved by the symbolists when they force the color to modify an inappropriate concrete noun—a general technique of which synaesthesia would form a subcategory."<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> At issue is not just the bold or striking metaphor; the salient feature is the dissonance itself which pulls one up short. This technique is discussed by Shimon Sandbank in his article "David Fogel, Georg Trakl—and Colors."<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Again, color is accepted as the most readily approachable of the senses with regard to literary analysis. According to Sandbank, we learn of expressionist poetry that "the effort to make color more expressive begins first of all with an attempt to neutralize its accepted symbolic value."<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> The metaphoricization of color—and this can be extended to all of the senses—happens in one of three ways: 1) a color is predicated of a visual object incorrectly, for example (and I will use Sandbank's examples) a "black seagull," insofar as seagulls are not naturally black; 2) a color is predicated of a non-visual, but nevertheless sensorily perceivable, object, for example a "black tune"; or 3) a color is predicated of a "non-object," which is to say something which is not properly perceivable by the senses, for example "black despair."<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> In options 1 and 2, the sources of the transfers are still sense data, whereas in the third option this is not the case. Yet there is an important affinity between these two subcategories, namely that certain objects or concepts have conventionalized associations. For instance, in Sandbank's article, there is a distinction between a conventionally "yoked" pair (to use my terminology), such as "black despair," and a pair which is not conventionally yoked, such as a "black promise."<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> The forms of expressionism with which we are dealing here seem to be interested, on the one hand, in establishing these non-conventional connections and, on the other, in shattering the conventional ones, or at least playing with them in novel ways.</p>
<p>Let us look at some further examples of this transitional form of synaesthesia in order to fill in the picture we have begun to draw, before we move on to the depiction of time. Markish's poem "Fun torbes . . ." ("From Sacks . . .") is a very good segue: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Sails sew themselves from sacks,<br>They tie themselves to little oaks like blisters,<br>And drink a storm with their nails,<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a><br>And have nothing to lose! . . .</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>They shuffle you, twisting inside out,<br>And with you they gauge<br>A storm,<br>As with oars,</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>—Who thinks: is it near or far?<br>Who asks the time<br>On a dial, sealed with paper?</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>Oh, when from brown hunger the peril<br>Will flutter on the sails, as on the flags, —<br>Let me at least spit at a New York or Warsaw street<br>On her adorned, second-hand dealing, palm.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Both of the synaesthesiae here have taste in some way as their termini, the first ("drink a storm with their nails") originating in the tactile realm, the second ("brown hunger") originating in the visual realm. Not to get too involved in the vortex of this poem, but the synaesthetic images are certainly striking. As for the first, "to drink with the nails" engages the vocabulary of consumption, of fulfilling a basic biological craving or need, but is associatively extended to the domain of artisanry. As was mentioned in the note above, "with the nails" is an idiomatic usage indicating a struggle or great effort. What Markish does, though, is to peel back the conventionalized semantic value of the idiom revealing once again the literal meaning of "with the nails." In this way the sense of ardor is brought to bear, but alongside it the explicitly tactile imagery associated with sewing-craft—"sails sew themselves," "they tie themselves"—is likewise maintained. As the sails "drink a storm" it is an ingestion fraught with peril. They are drinking "tooth and nail," as it were, with their claws even, a struggle for survival.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>As for the drinking image as a source for gustational synaesthesiae—such as we see in lines from Markish like "But the thirst burns . . ."<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> and in lines from Trakl such as "Your lips drink the coolth of the blue rock-fountain"<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a>—we find that it is susceptible to "collocability,"<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> what de Ullmann calls "stale epithets,"<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> or even, as discussed earlier with regard to Sandbank, the "conventionalisms" whose habitual usage fossilizes the image and "kills" the metaphor. That is to say that there is something in the nature of the particular senses that tends to freeze a synaesthetic transfer into set linguistic collocations, thereby hamstringing the metaphor's potential. What is nice about the earlier Markish example ("drink a storm with their nails") is that in it the metaphor has been reinvigorated. Its very potency lies in its conflation of inanimacy with both craft and desire.</p>
<p>Now, danger ("peril") is a hungry beast, never seemingly to be sated. It uses the sails to ride the storm, made emblematic ("flags"), hungry for something, brownly hungry. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  The use of a short synaesthetic phrase such as "brown hunger" is a very good example of the kind of modernist linguistic experimentation which reinterprets the nature of the noun-adjective relationship, as we have seen before. Looking, though, at the next to last stanza, the question "who asks the time . . . ?" is quite telling. The instant of the poem not only has no general context, but it seems pointedly to assert that at least the temporal context is in some way outside of the experiential purview of the "actors." That moment is everything and everything relevant is in that moment. Time's passing, which is the structural framework of comprehending order, is being reckoned differently, but here not explicitly so.</p>
<p>At the end of the poem "Vi zangen . . ." ("Like ears of corn . . .") in <span style="font-style:italic;">Di Kupe</span> there is a short expressionist rhetorical question on the lack of a response from heaven, a sign, a drop of rain, or a quick flutter of wind:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>And sunsets ruminate trampled grass,<br>Like the small bones of children's wee hands,<br>—Will no miracle yet happen? . . .<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In this seemingly eternal present of signlessness, this waste of ubiquitous infertility, where at the end of each stanza the supplicant asks whether some sign of water or fresh wind will come,<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> the request for a miracle is the only one phrased as a negative. It is a consciously unreal favor, miracles being the stuff of the mythic past, not the urgent, decaying present. And the synaesthetic property of the verse, whereby the visual sunset engages in the gustatory activity of cud-chewing, serves to heighten the effect, insofar as the only nourishment that can go on is in stepping over the sensory borders, in wresting sustenance from impossible sources, like water from stone; as if in the sunsets, a repeated end-time, one might imagine the tiny bone of a newly skeletal child's hand crunching as the crisp stalks of grass in a sheep's mouth.</p>
<p>In Trakl's poem "De Profundis," published in a 1913 collection, almost exactly this breed of synaesthesia is employed. It is a dark poem, starting off telling of a sad evening when:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Over by the hamlet<br>The gentle orphan girl collects scanty ears of corn.<br>Her eyes graze round and gold in the twilight<br>And her womb waits for the heavenly bridegroom.</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>While returning home<br>The shepherds found the sweet body<br>Decomposing in the thornbush.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Despite the palpable gestures to Christianity, how jarring is the imagery juxtaposed in these stanzas. There is no infertility, at least not in the first stanza. The girl collects the earth's fruits and waits for the moment of her conceiving, of the beginning of her fecundity. And the source of that fertility is the miraculous act, as the groom is somehow <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  celestial. Of particular interest is the image which Trakl here employs, namely of her very eyes grazing, ruminating, in the twilight—where in Markish's poem the grazing is done by the twilight itself. In point of fact, it is not one crepuscular moment but rather "sunsets" which chew the bony cud, thereby not only including the visual element but at the same time incorporating and emphasizing the temporal aspect of the activity, continued over an unknown, perhaps innumerable, number of evenings. Trakl's image, though, does not involve that yoked concept of vision and time. The sunset is not an actor at all, but a reflection in the consuming eye of the orphan, a background of sorts. Though she is waiting, it is only through that single crepuscular event. For we find then in the next stanza her ultimate infertility, her death. No causal connections are drawn, merely the contiguity of sweetness and decay, and we are to assume no offspring born. Again, through the visual-gustatory synaesthetic incongruity here, we see a powerful play on fertility, twilight, and desire. The very next stanza, even, when we are introduced to the narrator, the shadow, we see a similar abutting of the divine refusal of revelation with a gustatory image:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>A shadow am I far from dark villages.<br>God's silence<br>I drank from the fountain of the forest glade.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">To drink (gustatory) the silence (auditory) of God is to engage poetically God's own dissociation from his creation and to ask the question of how even to inquire, the disjuncture being incomprehensible. This dissociation is intensified in that "silence" is the absence of sound, the absence of auditory data. Drinking silence in this way means drinking nothing. Perhaps this "empty" consumption is the only kind of gustation of which a shadow, a being without body or corporeal existence, is capable.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Temporaesthesia</h1>
<p>In these examples of sensory interplay we have seen how both Markish's and Trakl's curiosity about time percolates through their imagery. We may now turn to cases where the transfers are more robust, and where full-fledged temporaesthesia constitutes some of the central imagery. Let us begin with one of Markish's more stalwart examples,<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> the poem "Af shtume vent fun leydike gewelber" ("On the silent walls of vacant stores") from 1922:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>On the silent walls of vacant stores,<br>With bored yawning windows over markets;<br>Clocks hang, hairy like hacked-off heads of calves,<br>And lick emptiness with the pendulum's back-and forth . . .</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>An instant there—on the gulping side,<br>Here an instant—and transacted already . . .<br>And hands silently raise themselves and turn on time<br>And quietly count the small change of floating foam . . . <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>And houses suck earthy shoulders, just like medicinal cuppings . . .<br>Oh, don't fix upon me your twelve eyes, boredom-carcass,<br>Quickly shaking here and there time itself with violence!</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>I do not want to know when it is Past!<br>I do not want to know what the time is!<br>I do not want to know how old I am . . . <a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This is a poem about time, about the violence it inflicts on the reality of a world obsessed with its regimentation, about the cavernous emptiness left in its wake. The final stanza, immediately after the perceiver's "I" is first heard and when it finally gives itself full voice, rocks the perception of our relation to time. The boredom-carcass, the grotesque creature conjured up when time is wasted in the throes of <span style="font-style:italic;">ennui</span>, when efficiency and profitability ("vacant stores," "transacted already") are lost, violently shakes time and alters its perception. This is what Sheppard speaks of in his essay, "The Crisis of Language," when he refers to "a recurrent suspicion of the modern mind," namely "that, variously, the industrial order, or mass democracy, or concepts of efficiency, have destroyed the still point within the spirit and that order has been sacrificed to formless and entropic anarchy."<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Returning to the poem, the "I" rants that he no longer wants to perceive, to be the prey to the all-seeing twelve eyes, like some Providential Medusa with an eye for every hour, to be set along the inorganic, mechanized timeline of life. But his is still not a call for the fracture of time, the dissociation of the moment from its environment. The instances themselves are in cahoots with the run of time. It is rather for the imperception of temporality that he calls. The danger, as he sees it, is depicted precisely in the synaesthetic moment where "clocks . . . lick emptiness with the pendulum's back-and forth . . . " The transfer is motivated by the resemblance of a pendulum and a tongue, but the context (the terminus is temporaesthetic and the source is gustatory, licking being an element of the gustatory semantic field) is again desire for satiety, a theme coursing through the whole poem. The first "instant" ("<span style="font-style:italic;">oygnblik</span>") is concerned with swallowing. The houses, too, the places where clocks live, the temples containing time's idols, are pictured as sucking like "<span style="font-style:italic;">bankes</span>"—the glass globes for medicinal cupping—which is to say a fruitless ingestion.<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> However, in denying his desire to know when a moment goes by—in effect denying the perception of time's passage, i.e. temporaesthesia—in denying his desire to know the time at all, or even his age, he is saying that his perceptions need a new organizing principle, that the lives of moments are not to be regulated by the impersonal, nullifying force of the clocks, as repugnant as the matted hair on a calf's hacked-off head. In this way, time is the terminus, the re, and taste is the source, the Ground. The clock is described as licking emptiness with the motion of its pendulum. Each swing is an instant, a discrete concretized moment. But just as quickly, the dominance or stability relationship is inverted: time is the immutable element. However, it is nothingness/emptiness which is being <span style="font-style:italic;">desired</span>,<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> described "in terms of" the monolithic temporality. This is to say that the frame of discourse just outlined <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  (taste [Ground] → time [re]) is itself inverted, such that time (as Ground) is that in terms of which the empty set of "gustatory" data is being described (as re).</p>
<p>Moving to a poem with a much different feel, we read in Markish's "Ikh zegn zikh mit dir" ("I take my leave of you") from 1917:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>I take my leave of you<br>Passing time,<br>I don't know you, Past,<br>You don't belong to me, —<br>I dreamt you! . . .</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>And you who are, my Future,<br>Grown old in grey hair?<br>I don't belong to you,<br>But you dream of me!</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>I am your, insignificant "Now,"<br>Blind!</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>And blindly I am rich!<br>We both of us die alike<br>And alike are born! . . .<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a></p></div>

<p class="continued">It is a much more aestheticizing (though not in the more technical sense) poem, personifying time past, future, and present as the lover. The sense of belonging, though, apportions itself out inversely. The past no longer belongs insofar as it has no further perceptibility. The future is not belonged to, either because it has not yet happened or because it is too old to care ("grown old in grey hair"). But nevertheless, curiously, the wonder of the scene is the interdreamability of the two distant times, sandwiching time periods, past and future, into a dream space—the present—where "blindly I am rich," rich with the layers of time. There is no <span style="font-style:italic;">syn</span>aesthesia here, strictly speaking; rather there is syntempora, taking the varied periods of time together, simultaneously, as in the lines of Eliot quoted earlier:</p>

<p class="continued">A slightly different treatment can be found in Markish's poem "veys ikh nit tsi kh'bin in dr'heym" ("Don't Know if I'm at Home"), from 1917, as elucidated by Chana Kronfeld in <span style="font-style:italic;">On the Margins of Modernism</span>.<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> In it "the dynamic perception of a present moment" is <span style="font-style:italic;">physically</span> the center of the poem's thematic structure,<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> roughly corresponding to the three stanzas, of "space—time—space." But the "dynamism" of this "modernist mode of presentation"<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> cannot but cause an interfusion of these thematic elements as powerfully demonstrated where "[i]n the first stanza the speaker already sees himself as boundless, 'without a beginning, without an end' (line 7)."<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> These terms, "beginning" <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  ("<span style="font-style:italic;">onheyb</span>") and "end" ("<span style="font-style:italic;">sof</span>"), are of course both spatially and temporally applicable. This apperceptual yoking is a key element of what I am calling temporaesthesia.</p>
<p>We can tell that these instants are taken aesthetically precisely because they are being used as constituents of synaesthetic descriptions. Let us, then, quickly look at a couple more short examples to fatten up our conception. From the seventh section of Markish's lengthy poem "Feldzn" ("Stones") we find: "Who are you, white abysses, hey, fire-flaming infinity" . . .<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> These abysses, though spatial, take on a temporal caste, particularly in that "<span style="font-style:italic;">umendlekhkayt</span>" (as I have translated it "infinity") is more literally "endlessness," a term which enfolds in itself both spatial and temporal applicability. To use the re-Ground vocabulary, we have a spatial re and a temporal Ground, inverting the more "common" poetic practice. Not only is the infinite personified (as "you"), but it is personified as a being in the present, both tense and place; it is the passage of time perceived in a present instant. Indeed, not only is it "presently" personified, but its infiniteness is described visually and calorifically as "fire-flaming," indicating once again its ripeness for the synaesthetic harvest.</p>
<p>In our final example, it is not an infinity, but rather a day which is the measure of a moment. In a poem already mentioned, namely "Yo-yo, mayn kop geven a mol iz . . ." ("Yes-yes, my head once was . . ."), we find the sentence "But let your day feed from my hands in the valley of desire."<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> The transfer from temporaesthetic to gustatory is fairly clear. The interesting point is that the desire and satiety valence of the taste sense, which we have documented above, is now being transferred to time as well, filling out its reification as I have been at pains to demonstrate.</p>
<p>Turning now to Trakl, we see in his temporaesthetic movements, which are relatively no greater numerically than Markish's, a much more static trend as compared to Markish's pronouncedly vigorous layerings. The first example comes from the second part of his poem "Helian" (published in the same 1913 collection as "De Profundis"). Typical of Trakl, there is very little suggestion of larger timeframes. In this poem, for instance, our only cues are "<span style="font-style:italic;">das Schweigen</span>" ("the silence") and "<span style="font-style:italic;">der Abendwind</span>" ("the evening wind"). So we read:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>The hands touch the old age of bluish waters<br>Or on a cold night the white cheeks of the sisters.<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Now "<span style="font-style:italic;">Alter</span>" is not just age or old age, but has another valence, namely of antiquity. Within the timeless crepuscular moment being depicted, the act of touching the water, purely tactile, is no longer a physical act insofar as what is being touched is the water's antiquity and not its aqueousness. But the synaesthetic property is there, in which some tenebrous <span style="font-style:italic;">tertia comparationis</span> is yoking time to touch.</p>
<p>Another example I cull from the curious poem "Kindheit" ("Childhood"), the first poem of Trakl's posthumously published collection <span style="font-style:italic;">Sebastian in Traum</span> from 1915. In it childhood itself, a marked expanse of past-time, "silently lived/ in a blue cave."<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a> Childhood is not a memory but a living existence, only one secreted away in a cave, a blue cave.<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> Later: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>A blue instant is but more soul. [ . . . ]<br>More devout, you know the sense of the dark years,<br>Coolth and Autumn in lonesome rooms;<br>And in holy blueness luminous footsteps ring forth.<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Not only does meaning get imputed to the run of the "dark years" of the past, but the present—the moment born of the dark years, which is blue and the color of the twilit sky before the dark black of night—is redolent with the signs of its own origin, its childhood. "<span style="font-style:italic;">Fromm</span>," the word here rendered as "devout" also has the sense of "gentleness" and "innocence." In that "blue" (or innocent) moment—a synaesthesia between the visual and the temporaesthetic—the "you" of the poem, left inexplicit, in understanding the meaning of the past, is even more innocent ("devout"); and all of the many senses get bound up in the phrase "holy blueness." This, in turn, is followed by its own synaesthetic image, namely that of the luminous (visual source) footsteps ringing forth (auditory terminus).</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Our final example comes from the poem "Hohenburg":</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>There is no one in the house. Autumn in the rooms;<br>Moonbright sonata<br>And the waking-up at the brink of the twilit forest.</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>Always you think the white countenance of Man<br>Far away from the tumult of the time;<br>Over one dreaming a green bough gladly bows, [ . . . ]<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The first thing we should note is the synaesthesia of "moonbright sonata." It certainly heightens the nocturnal context. However, it is rather the autumnal context which interests us here. For Trakl, the seasons tend to betoken more a perception of time's passing than a particular associated attitude. Looking, for example, to the first section of the poem "Helian," we see the play between the seasons Autumn and Summer pointing out just this kind of distinction of the passage of the time of those seasons. In this way it is a natural clock, of sorts. Placing a season, then, as the sole inhabitant of a vacant house, at the edge of a forest filled with moon-music, is the height of this static temporaesthetic that we have seen through Trakl's poems.</p>
<p>The difference is not merely stylistic, with Markish's more kinetic, "chaotic," even vortical depiction of time and its sensory perception set against Trakl's more staid, sober, and dream-like vision. Rather, more importantly, the difference is linguistic. As was said, where Trakl's temporaesthetic tends more conventionally to temporalize space, Markish tends to spatialize time. Put another way, for Trakl "The bike is near the house," but for Markish "The house is near the bike." Each poet inherits pre-existent modes of perception: Trakl, the grounded, autochthonous connection to place; Markish, the deterritorialized, exilic consciousness. Each one then fuses that with a fresh <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  perspective on the place of the perceiving subject in the world of the poem, a world which (in the expressionism of both poets) was <span style="font-style:italic;">formed</span> by that perceiver. Ultimately, Trakl stands poised in place above history, and Markish is anchored in history, but still nowhere, like pages in the wind. The next step would certainly be to expand this analysis to other poets, and even to other modernist movements. But that is for another time . . . and another place.</p>

<div id="body">
<p>Lee Krasner was mightily impressed on the occasion of her first visit to Jackson Pollock's apartment in November, 1941, particularly with one painting (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>). She recalled, "One work—the painting later titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Magic Mirror—</span>just about stunned me."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Ellen Landau has called it an "exemplary" work of the early 1940s, and Walter Hopps sees it as "a crucial early example of [Pollock's] radical fusion of abstraction and imagism."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Yet, aside from Landau and Hopps, and more recently, Elizabeth Langhorne, there has been a paucity of attention to the picture, and their discussions can be enlarged.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Mirror</span> may have been titled later, but its imagery appears to intentionally justify the title. It is well known that Pollock's painting, <span style="font-style:italic;">Moby Dick</span>, was retitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Pasiphaë</span> at the suggestion of James Johnson Sweeny, and that his first group of poured paintings in 1947 were assigned titles in picture-naming sessions with Ralph and Mary Manheim and Krasner, but there is no evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, that anyone other than Pollock was responsible for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Magic Mirror's</span> title. The title conjures up the long history of magic mirrors in the annals of the occult, and while Landau has noted the painting's connection to shamanism, my line of inquiry examines in greater depth the Native American sources with which Pollock is usually associated, and goes beyond them to shamanism in the Russian Empire. Admittedly, this essay is, in part, speculative, but it rests on a number of established <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  facts: Pollock's friendship with John Graham grew from a shared enthusiasm for the ideas of Carl Jung; Graham was an ardent devotee of the occult and was knowledgeable about shamanism in Russia's territories; Pollock had a keen interest in North American shamanism and according to a reliable source, they discussed their mutual interest in shamanism; and Pollock's attraction to shamanism is most evident in several works executed at the time he was involved with Graham. Together they shared the entrancements of the "primitive," the occult, and the unconscious that largely defined the modernist sensibility of their day.</p>

<p>The re in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Mirror</span>, apparently female as identified by a round breast with prominent red nipple, sits before a mirror located in the upper right-hand corner that reflects an ambiguous flurry of color. Above the almost equally ambiguous re is what Landau describes as "a distorted C-shape face with hair hanging down" that <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  she believes was derived from Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman in an Armchair</span>, 1939 (Musée Picasso, Paris), while Hopps sees the same form as "a radically abstracted head with a feathered headdress."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> On the other hand, in lieu of a head, Langhorne proposes a "flying phallus," a reading to which I subscribe.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> This hovering or flying object, detached from the body, infers supernatural power. In fact, my argument for the shamanic content of the painting essentially turns on the supernatural aspect of this object. The head, then, would be faintly located above the re's right shoulder looking upward to the mirror. As for the concept of a female shaman, in a roughly contemporaneous drawing of a dancing shaman Pollock's re is ostensibly female (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>), identified as such by a yellow crescent—a female symbol—in the pubic area.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> The dancer's third leg conveys successive movement, not unlike the jumble of anatomical forms containing one or more breasts in the painting. This suggestion of movement in a seated re can be ascribed to the phenomenon of shamanic soul flight discussed later in the essay. Then there is the painting's surface, which is textured with a granular material, sand or fine gravel. Sand paintings, created by medicine men in several southwestern tribal cultures, are part of ceremonies intended to cure patients by restoring them to a harmonious relationship with nature.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In subject and composition <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Mirror</span> is related to Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl Before a Mirror</span>, 1932 (<a name="3-text" href="#3">3</a>), an image reproduced in Graham's article "Primitive Art and Picasso," published in the April 1937 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Magazine of Art</span>. This article made such an impression on Pollock that he preserved it, and wrote to Graham seeking an introduction, which occurred between 1937 and 1940.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> After their meeting, the older Graham assumed the role of Pollock's mentor (some have said guru), and facilitated his public recognition by including him in the "French and American Painting" exhibition Graham organized for McMillen Gallery in January, 1942. <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl Before a Mirror</span> was highly visible in New York as it had been acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in 1938, and included in two of its exhibitions the following year, "Picasso: Forty Years of his Art" and "Art of Our Time." Graham and Pollock both were very taken with <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl Before A Mirror</span>, the former considering it his favorite work by Picasso.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> His <span style="font-style:italic;">Untitled (Artist Sweating Blood</span>), ca. 1942–43 (<a name="4-text" href="#4">4</a>), based on Picasso's picture, and apparently inspired by Pollock's, presents a woman adjacent to a mirror that is intersected at its upper right corner by what appears to be male genitals. <a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Graham and Pollock may have discerned a male presence in <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl Before A Mirror</span> in the form of an upward thrusting scythe-like arm above two breasts that perform double duty as testes. Unlike Picasso and Graham, however, Pollock untethers his phallic object, signaling its extraordinary powers.</p>
<p>For Pollock, who was in Jungian analysis for alcoholism and depression from 1939 to 1942, <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl Before A Mirror</span> would have had a special resonance. As William Rubin has written, Picasso's painting has an "echo of a troubled, internalized image in the mirror reflection" that embodies "the theme of psychic revelation." <a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Carla Gottlieb also noticed that the mirror reflection "renders the submerged world of the unconscious." <a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> If Pollock needed help recognizing the psychological dimension of <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl Before A Mirror</span>, Graham's article pointed the way with a caption notation asserting that Picasso's <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  work evokes "primordial memories of the unconscious." <a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Carl Jung, too, could have pointed Pollock to the connection between one's mirror image and the psyche. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Integration of the Personality</span>, published in 1939, he wrote,</p>

<p class="continued">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Integration of the Personality</span> helped make Jung's ideas highly accessible, and as Michael Leja has suggested, Joseph Henderson, Pollock's analyst at the time, may have either encouraged Pollock to read it, or discussed it in their sessions. <a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In view of Jung's passage above, and Graham's representation of himself as a woman in <span style="font-style:italic;">Untitled (Artist Sweating Blood), The Magic Mirror</span> may be interpreted as a symbolic self-portrait. As "Pollock" looks deeply into the mirror he discovers and identifies with the female component of his psyche—the anima—which resides in the unconscious. In therapy he sought to achieve the Jungian goal of individuation, that is, the unification of opposites in the psyche that is necessary to establish psychic wholeness. What Langhorne and I take to be a flying phallus hovering above a female re, "propose[s] a union of male and female opposites as a way to articulate a fuller self."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> If, as I maintain, the re is a shaman we have an early instance of what Rushing, discussing Pollock's poured paintings in relation to his interest in Navajo sand paintings, describes as "Pollock standing for the shaman who is his own patient." <a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Similarly, Langhorne, in another study, asserts that <span style="font-style:italic;">Naked Man</span>, ca. 1938–41, "is a presentation of Pollock's own identification with the shaman-artist, in effect a self-portrait." <a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Another aspect of <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl Before A Mirror</span>, the sun and moon imagery of the girl's face on the left, also would have registered with Pollock in light of his Jungian therapy. The sun and moon, according to Jung, represent respectively the conscious and unconscious mind, as well the masculine and feminine dualities. The sun and crescent moon are among the most prevalent of Pollock's symbols in this period, and as Leja notes, "His determination to integrate them, to merge them . . . reveal him as striving to make the disk and crescent integral parts of a greater form." <a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> This effort of visual synthesis parallels Pollock's personal struggle to achieve psychic harmony. The merger of sun and moon is evident in a large number of drawings, and in the conration of masks or heads in the paintings <span style="font-style:italic;">Birth</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Naked Man</span>, ca. 1938–1941, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Male and Female</span> of 1942. Meyer Schapiro observed about the face and reflection in <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl Before A Mirror</span>,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The exposed profile is cool and pale and what is hidden and imagined, the unseen face, is an intense yellow, like a sun . . . but in the face is also a crescent moon which occurs elsewhere on the body and there is a contrast like that of the sun and moon in the relation of the real body and the mirrored body and indeed the moon has a reflected light. <a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Picasso's amalgamation of frontal and profile views of the face, in this work and others, likely was the source for Pollock's solar-lunar heads. Whether he would have equated the girl's reflection with the moon is impossible to say, although in the popular imagination of many cultures the moon and mirror are interchangeable. <a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Pollock may have been familiar with the association of moon and mirror because of his close friendship with William Baziotes in the early 1940s. Baziotes was a great enthusiast of Baudelaire's poetry, whose prose poem, "Favors of the Moon," was the inspiration for his 1942 painting <span style="font-style:italic;">Mirror at Midnight I</span>. <a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Jung's passage concerning the confrontation with the self in a mirror is a psycho-analytic gloss on an ancient and widespread belief concerning reflections and the soul. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Pollock owned the abridged, one-volume edition of James Frazer's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Bough</span> that contains a number of examples of indigenous peoples who regarded their reflections in water or mirrors as their souls, including inhabitants of the Andaman Islands, New Guinea, and New Calendonia. Frazer then recounts superstitions about mirror reflections around the world throughout history.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> From ancient times mirrors were believed to have divinatory powers. Pausanius, the second-century Greek, reported that at Patrae, in front of the sanctuary of Demeter, "an infallible mode of divination" entailed lowering a mirror into the spring, which, after prayers were offered to the goddess, could be read to determine the fate of sick persons. <a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia of Occult Sciences</span>, published in 1939, under a section subtitled "Magic Mirrors," refers to the <span style="font-style:italic;">specularii</span>, those who read mirrors in ancient Rome, a practice known as catoptromancy.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> This is just the kind of book that would have attracted John Graham. In addition to being knowledgeable about Greek and Roman antiquity and well read in the classics, he had a strong interest in the occult, as noted in the 1920s by Duncan Phillips, an early patron. <a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> When <span style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia of Occult Sciences</span> was published, he had just met or was about to meet Pollock, and was only a few years from total obsession with various forms of the occult, including alchemy, astral bodies and planes, astrology, and Theosophy, topics discussed at length in the book. Moreover, according to Lee Krasner, Graham collected mirrors. <a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Among the groups that the encyclopedia associates with magic mirrors are the Chinese, Hindus, Persians, and Renaissance Italians. Perhaps the portion of the text that would have been of greatest interest to Graham describes the so-called "cabalistic mirrors," which unite his fascination with mirrors and astrology. The cabalistic mirrors, in fact, "seven globes each representing one of the seven planets of Astrology, made of the corresponding metal and consulted on the appropriate astrological day," give counsel about superior beings, money matters, probabilities of success, quarrels and lawsuits, questions of love, the whereabouts of lost objects, and future plans. <a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> During the years of his close association with Pollock, Graham painted several pictographs unique to his work that organize astrological symbols within grid-like structures. <a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> His more rative <span style="font-style:italic;">Sun and Bird</span>, ca. 1941–42, employs alchemical and astrological symbols to represent the transformative stages of the alchemical process. <a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Whether or not Graham and Pollock were familiar with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia of Occult Sciences</span>, Graham's enthusiasms for what it contained captured his young friend's attention. Pollock's receptivity to the occult and Graham's interest in it no doubt was conditioned by his flirtation with Theosophy as a high school student. <a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Pollock and Graham, both Jungians, and admirers of "primitive" art, subscribed to Jung's belief that in certain circumstances modern man could access the collective unconscious:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>. . . from the hidden depths of the psyche something arises to confront him . . . contents of an archetypal nature . . . that exert a strong influence of their own whether or not they are understood by the conscious mind . . . and so come to bridge the morbid split in his nature upon a higher level. <a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Primitive art affords this opportunity because, as Graham wrote in "Primitive Art and Picasso," "Primitive races and primitive genius have readier access to their unconscious mind than so-called civilized people. . . ."</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Therefore the art of primitive races has a highly evocative quality which allows it to bring to our consciousness the clarities of the unconscious mind, stored with all the individual and collective wisdom of past generations and forms. In other words, an evocative art is the means and the result of getting in touch with the powers of our unconscious. <a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Graham refers to Maori jade, Eskimo and North American Indian masks, and Tlingit, Kwakiutl, and Haida carvings, as well as African art, of which he was a self-professed expert and dealer. Pollock's interest in Native American art is well documented. Growing up in Arizona and California he had often come in contact with Indians from various tribes. Pollock purchased twelve volumes of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bureau of American Ethnology Report</span> with his brother Charles in the early 1930s, collected clippings about Indian art, made frequent trips to the two New York museums that had extensive Native American collections—the Museum of the American Indian and the American Museum of Natural History—and in 1941 he visited the Museum of Modern Art's "Indian Art of the United States" exhibition several times, especially to observe the demonstrations of Navajo sand painting. <a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> According to Fritz Bultman, an artist who knew both Pollock and Graham well, the former was aware of the "whole shamanistic dream culture of Indians," and Graham was knowledgeable about the literature on Russian shamanism. Consequently, they shared a "coinciding and reinforcing interest in primitivism and Indian art."<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Both Graham and Pollock must have been aware of the connection Jung made between shamanism and his spiritualized psychology. As early as 1918, in "Uber das Unbewusste" (The Role of the Unconscious), which went untranslated until 1964, Jung asserted, "Primitive man simply has a different theory—the theory of witchcraft and spirits. I find this theory very interesting and very sensible—actually more sensible than the academic views of modern science." And he observed that the recent appearance of spiritualism "is a modern belief in spirits and a rebirth of a form of religion practiced by our remote forefathers." <a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> He expressed this idea again in "Seele and Erde ("Mind and Earth"), translated in English in 1928:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>I have found in my American patients that their hero-re possesses traits derived from the religion of the Indians. The most important re in this religion is the shaman, the medicine man or conjurer of spirits. The first American discovery in this field—since taken up in Europe—was spiritualism, and the second was Christian Science and other forms of mental healing." <a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">If Graham, who read German, did not make the connection between Jungianism and shamanism for Pollock, or if he did not come upon the association on his own, his Jungian therapists, Henderson and Violet de Laszlo, would have drawn his attention to it, as shamanism was a serious topic of interest to him. Furthermore, Pollock's and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Bultman's mutual friend in the early 1940s, Tony Smith, according to Bultman, "was a walking encyclopedia of Jung[ian] shamanism." <a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Graham (né Ivan Drombrowski) apparently brought his enthusiams for the occult and shamanism to the United States in 1920 from Russia. Born and educated in the Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire, he graduated from the University of Kiev in 1907, and subsequently received a law degree from the University of St. Vladimir in 1913. <a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Russia at the time was enthralled with the occult. Maria Carlson has observed that "Russian occult interests ran the entire gamut: Spiritualism and Theosophy attracted the most attention and generated the largest number of publications, but there was also Rosicrucianism, alchemy, psychographology, phrenology, Kabbalism, Yoga, sectarianism, Hermeticism, hypnotism, Egyptian religion, astrology, chiromancy, animal magnetism, fakirism, telepathy, the Tarot, and magic (both black and white)." <a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> It was also a period of burgeoning Russian scholarship on the country's "primitive" peoples—the Finno-Ugric tribes on both sides of the Ural Mountains, and the tribes of the vast Siberian land mass—and although the efflorescence of occultism and the study of shamanism have separate histories, they became entwined. The reason is not difficult to discern. Occultism has both theoretical and practical dimensions. The former holds to a worldview that believes the divine mysteries can be penetrated by uncovering a secret body of knowledge, whereas practical occultism engages in a variety of practices to intervene in the supernatural. <a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Such intervention is precisely the shaman's role. The painter Vasilii Kandinsky provides a prominent example of the intermingling of ethnography and the occult. As a student at the University of Moscow Kandinsky did fieldwork in 1889 among a Finno-Ugric people known to the Russians as the Zyrians. Well versed in shamanism, Kandinsky later embraced Theosophy while viewing himself as something of a modern shaman. <a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Occasional travelers to the Siberian wilderness had brought back artifacts and tales of indigenous peoples, but it was in the eighteenth century during Peter the Great's reign (1689–1725) that exploration of the hinterlands began in earnest. In the absence of academically-trained Russians, German explorers were commissioned to map the Siberian territories, record its populations, search for mineral resources, collect animal and plant specimens, and bring back shamanic objects for Peter the Great's Chamber of Curiosities (Kunstkamera), founded in 1714. Accounts of The Great North Expedition of 1733 to 1743, followed by the Expedition of Orenburg and Astrakhan from 1768 to 1774, were published in St. Petersburg in German, thereby introducing an educated Russian public to shamanism. <a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Research in German continued to be published throughout the nineteenth century, and studies in Russian, which accelerated during this time, frequently were translated or summarized in German. <a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> By the early decades of the twentieth century an extensive corpus of Russian language studies on the indigenous tribes of the Russian Empire had been published. <a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> It was only a matter of time before books appeared in other languages, including two general treatises in English on Finno-Ugric and Siberian shamanism by M.A. Czaplicka and Uno Holmberg. <a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Graham, who claimed to know nine, at other times twelve languages, had an extensive literature on shamanism available to him. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In an essay titled "The Poetry of Magic and Spells" published in 1908, the Russian Symbolist poet Alexander Blok declared that "Ancient spells, and with them the whole realm of folk magic and ritual, are for us an ore in which the gold of authentic poetry glints. . . ."<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> Blok was referring to the practices of his ancestors, not those of the Finno-Ugric and Siberian tribes, but his sentiments reflect the desire for primitivistic expression in Russia after the turn of the century. Velimir Khlebnikov was another writer who incorporated folkloric materials in his works. A self-declared Futurist, he was able to embrace folklore and ethnography because the "authentic" expressions of the past, in contrast to the moribund art of his time, could point the way the future.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> In his essay, "On Expanding the Frontiers of Russian literature," published in 1913, he cited various cultures within and without the Russian Empire that he argued should be enlisted by Russian writers, including those of the Finns (Finno-Ugric tribes) and the Mongols.<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> References to the mythological tales of the Oroche, a tribe in eastern Siberia, and the religion of the Ostiak, a Finno-Ugric people in western Siberia, are found in his poems, short stories, and plays between 1911 and 1919.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> Khlebnikov was part of an avant-garde circle that included the painter Mikhail Larionov and the poet-painter David Burliuk, both of whom Graham knew in Russia, and later referenced in his <span style="font-style:italic;">System and Dialectics of Art</span>, published in 1937.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Graham likely encountered Khlebnikov as well.</p>
<p>Larionov, along with Natalia Goncharova, was a foremost exponent of Russian Neo Primitivism in the visual arts prior to 1914. Like Khlebnikov, he could mix primitivism and Futurism. At the same time he and Goncharova were producing Rayonist paintings utilizing Futurist "lines of force," Larionov displayed an awareness of the legends and religious practices of the Buryat people of Central Asia in a number of primitivistic drawings. His library contained M.N. Khangalov's monograph, <span style="font-style:italic;">New Materials Respecting Shamanism Among the Buryat</span>, published in 1890, and he owned a sacred Buryat drawing.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Larionov's drawings allude to shamanic rituals, trances, the bird as spirit animal, and supernatural journeys. His 1912–13 painting <span style="font-style:italic;">Gypsy Venus</span>, with its shamanic references, suggests that Larionov and Khlebnikov, who published the poem <span style="font-style:italic;">Shaman and Venus</span> in 1912, worked in close collaboration.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> Graham's years in Russia, and his contact with Larionov and other avant-garde res, appear to confirm Fritz Bultman's claim that he was knowledgeable about shamanism in Russia's territories.</p>
<p>The Swedish scholar Åke Hultkrantz has concisely summarized the religious, social, and individual elements of Siberian shamanism:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The central idea of shamanism is to establish means of contact with the supernatural world by the ecstatic experience of a professional and inspired intermediary, the shaman. There are thus four important constituents of shamanism: the ideological premise, or the supernatural world and the contacts with it; the shaman as the actor on behalf of a human group; the inspiration granted him by helping spirits; and the extraordinary, ecstatic experiences of the shaman.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">This general definition also applies to shamanism in the New World. Consequently, much of the content of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Mirror</span> can be explained by American Indian and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Eskimo shamanism, but not all of it. Among the indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere, those in western North America and the Arctic were the most recent to migrate from Siberia some 9,000 to 8,000 years ago, which accounts for the many cultural similarities between tribes of these regions.</p>
<p>Pollock's subject, a female shaman, was commonplace in Finno-Ugrian, Siberian, and North American tribal cultures. Johann Gmelin, an eighteenth-century German explorer, encountered a female shaman among the Tungus in Siberia who was considered superior to any man, and as Czaplicka noted, female shamans in the early twentieth century continued to be more important than their male counterparts in some Siberian tribes.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> The prominence of female shamans can be traced to the legends of several tribes in which "the shaman's gift was first bestowed on woman."<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> The Buryat believe the first shaman was an eagle, but when his mission was not understood, the great bird conferred his powers on a woman, the first human shaman.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> In 1938 the American ethnologist Willard Park listed over fifty tribes west of the Rocky Mountains in which women answered the shaman's calling.<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> The percentage of female shamans varied in these tribes, but in a number of cases they predominated. Pollock did not need to go far to find a source for his female shamans.</p>
<p>The eagle, "the bird of the shamans" as Mihály Hoppál calls it, is the most important spirit animal for a number of Siberian tribes.<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> As the shaman's principal helper, the spirit animal conducts the shaman's soul to distant worlds to summon spirits, t hostile ones, retrieve the souls of the sick, and settle the souls of the recently deceased. Ostiak shamans and those of the Yakut in eastern Siberia, for example, assume the attributes of the eagle by wearing feathered headdresses and cloaks, which give them the power of flight while they are in a state of ecstasy.<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> Eagles, likewise, are the sacred bird of many North American Indian tribes. As a study of the Cherokee states in a volume of the <span style="font-style:italic;">BAE Report</span> Pollock owned, "The eagle (awâ hǐlǐ) is the great sacred bird of the Cherokee, as of nearly all our native tribes. . . ."<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> Park reported that the use of eagle feathers for "curing and other shamanistic performances. . . . [is] almost universal among the tribes of western North America."<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> Given the importance of eagle paraphernalia and that of other high-flying birds of prey in shamanic rituals, a fact that could not have escaped Pollock, it can be deduced that the airborne form in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Mirror</span>—that is, the flying phallus—has a spiritual significance. The significance, I argue, pertains to the phenomenon of soul flight.</p>
<p>The shamanic trance that induces soul flight is ubiquitous in Eurasian tribal cultures. This experience also is prevalent in western North America, especially the Northwest, and among the Eskimo of Greenland and the Bering Strait.<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> Graham reproduced an Eskimo mask (Inuit) in "Primitive Art and Picasso," and Landau and Rushing have discussed the utilization of Eskimo masks in Pollock's work of the early 1940s.<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> Pollock owned two volumes of the <span style="font-style:italic;">BAE Report</span> in which he would have read about the soul flights of Eskimo shamans. In his study of the Eskimo of the Hudson Bay region, Labrador, and Greenland, Franz Boas observed that most of the angakut [shamans] . . . fall into an ecstasy and really imagine they accomplish the flights and see the spirits."<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> Similarly, the author of the study on the Eskimo around the Bering Strait reported that <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  "the shamans claim to make journeys to the land of the dead, and upon their return relate to the people what they have seen in that region . . . the shades of dead people or animals which are invisible to persons not specially endowed."<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> The concept of soul flight partially explains the feathered form in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Mirror</span>, but there is also "the whole shamanistic dream culture of Indians" of which Fritz Bultman spoke.</p>
<p>The study of the Bering Strait Eskimo recounts the experience of a man who upon having strange dreams believed invisible powers had called him to the vocation of shaman.<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> This phenomenon was usual among American Indian shamans. According to Park, "The conferring of shamanistic power in unsought dreams seems to be general in the Great Basin [west of the Rockies]."<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> Pollock's awareness of the acquisition of shamanic power in dreams, including the ability to fly, can be connected with the discussion of flying dreams in Freud's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Interpretation of Dreams</span>, the classic work that spawned unending amateur dream interpretation and psychologizing. It has been observed that "A cultural historical survey of the reception of Freud's language of dreams after 1900 would include . . . the weird, wild and sometimes wonderful expropriations of ideas that were made—myriad loose borrowings from the school of Freud as well as that of Jung, through cartoons, poems, films, essays, witticisms and anecdotes, and through the general babble of conversation about psychology. . . ."<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a> The embodiment of shamanic soul flight in a flying phallus is elucidated by Freud's acknowledgment of a colleague in Vienna who</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>has propounded the fascinating theory that a great many flying dreams are erection dreams, since the remarkable phenomenon of erection, which constantly occupies the human phantasy, cannot fail to be impressive as an apparent suspension of the laws of gravity (cf. the winged phalli of the ancients).</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Freud then follows with the viewpoint of another researcher, who, despite his aversion to interpretation,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>nevertheless defends the erotic element as "the most important motive factor of the hovering dream," and refers to the strong sense of bodily vibration which accompanies this type of dream, and the frequent connection of such dreams with erections and emissions.<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Elsewhere Freud insisted that women's flying dreams also are associated with sexual arousal.<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> If the shaman is a symbolic self-portrait then the phallus denotes the re's actual gender identity, as well as Pollock's psychological and spiritual journey. If the re is female, the phallus represents the shaman's animus—the male component of the female psyche—her powerful "other side."<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> Regardless, the winged phallus as a symbol of power can represent the gravity-defying shaman of either gender. In the final analysis, the specific gender identity of the shaman counts for less than the Jungian notion that the merger of opposites in the psyche produces psychological harmony.</p>
<p>All of which leads us to real-life gender merging with which Pollock was familiar. In a conversation with Tony Smith, Pollock described the vision-dream of an Indian man called to the vocation of shaman in which a devil woman appeared, "a woman <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of two natures."<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a> The transvestite shaman, part male and part female, who seeks to restore the afflicted to a harmonious and natural balance in the world, would have had enormous appeal to Pollock's Jungian self. Such persons existed in Siberia and North America, and in some tribes were an established institution. A primary example of this practice was described by the Russian scholar Vladimir Bogoraz, known in the West as Waldemar Bogoras, in his monumental study of the Reindeer and Maritime Chukchi in northeastern Siberia. Bogoras met a number of "transformed" male shamans, and had reliable reports about a few of their female counterparts. Transformation begins in youth when the spirits command an individual to accept the role of shaman. The degree of transformation ranges from wearing the hair like the opposite gender, to dressing the part, and the final stage in which the shaman takes a spouse of the same gender. Depending on the new sexual identity, the transformed shaman either assumed a passive or assertive position in the marriage.<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> On account of their considerable powers, transformed shamans inspired even more fear, if crossed, than ordinary shamans.<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a> Shamanic transvestism can help explain the flying phallus above the female re in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Mirror</span>—that is, the juxtaposition signals the shaman's dual nature—but there is another intriguing possibility. The "soft man," as the Chukchi called the transformed male shaman, was said to have a special protector, a supernatural husband who communicated his orders through his "wife."<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a> The flying phallus would seem an apposite image to represent the transformed shaman's supernatural husband. Czaplicka, who extensively summarized Bogoras, remarked, "It is scarcely possible to see in these cases a religious conception of a divine two-sexed shaman embodying in one being a perfect man- and woman-nature,"<a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a> but Graham and Pollock would have seen it that way.</p>
<p>Park claimed that the berdache (a Persian word brought to the New World by the French to describe the Indian homosexual), who he equated with transvestism, rarely performed as a shaman in the tribes of western North America. He identified transvestite shamans only among the Klamath of Oregon and the Yurok of northern California,<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a> even though previous researchers reported the phenomenon was more widespread. In his research on the Mohave Indians in Arizona and southern California, George Devereaux learned from an elderly shaman that "From the very beginning of the world it was meant that there should be homosexuals, just as it was instituted that there should be shamans. They were intended for that purpose."<a name="f79-text" href="#f79"><sup>79</sup></a> All Mohave shamans were not homosexuals, but those who were lived as transvestites and assumed as much as possible the roles of their biological opposites. Devereaux observed that "Transvestites were exceptionally powerful shamans, especially the <span style="font-style:italic;">hwame</span>," the female practitioners.<a name="f80-text" href="#f80"><sup>80</sup></a> Among their healing specialties, both <span style="font-style:italic;">alyha</span> (male transvestites) and <span style="font-style:italic;">hwame</span> were particularly adept at curing venereal diseases.<a name="f81-text" href="#f81"><sup>81</sup></a> Elsewhere in the Southwest, the Navajos accorded berdaches great respect. They assumed the domestic responsibilities of women, frequently dressed like them, and took spouses of the same sex.<a name="f82-text" href="#f82"><sup>82</sup></a> According to Willard Hill, these <span style="font-style:italic;">nadle</span> often excelled as singers, the shamans who preside over healing ceremonies in which they perform specialized songs or chants.<a name="f83-text" href="#f83"><sup>83</sup></a> In his study of Navajo games, Berard Haile tells of a <span style="font-style:italic;">nadle</span> whose name in translation was "stick bounder"—a reference to a game only played by women—who was highly <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  esteemed because he was "a well-versed Blessing way singer and much in demand."<a name="f84-text" href="#f84"><sup>84</sup></a> Pollock may not have read the academic studies of Devereaux, Hill, and Haile, but knowledge of dual-natured shamans was not confined to academic journals.<a name="f85-text" href="#f85"><sup>85</sup></a> Frazer's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Bough</span> is another source of information on this phenomenon. He identifies a number of indigenous peoples, including "many Indian tribes of North America," whose male sorcerers, priests, and conjurors dress and live as women, but, in fact, he only discusses the "effeminate" healers of the Sauk and Omaha tribes.<a name="f86-text" href="#f86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>One aspect of shamanic ritual central to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Mirror</span>, the use of magic mirrors, is undocumented in North America above the Rio Grande. There are two plausible explanations for Pollock's pairing of shaman and mirror, and both implicate Graham. The first involves the Aztec deity Tezcatlipoca, the god of the North, night, the wind, the underworld, and numerous other domains. Unmentioned in the Pollock literature, he is variously described in Aztec myth as the rival or twin of the god Quetzalcoatl, whose symbol is the plumed serpent. The plumed serpent motif appears in Pollock's work around 1940, and is discussed at length by Langhorne.<a name="f87-text" href="#f87"><sup>87</sup></a> In representations of Tezcatlipoca he most often is shown with a mirror replacing one foot, but also with a mirror worn on his chest or head.<a name="f88-text" href="#f88"><sup>88</sup></a> Graham evinced great interest in Pre-Columbian art, and made numerous references to it in his 1937 book <span style="font-style:italic;">Systems and Dialectics of Art</span>.<a name="f89-text" href="#f89"><sup>89</sup></a> In the early 1940s he could claim that "I am an expert on Prehistoric, African, Oceanic, Mexican-Precolumbian [sic], and North American Indian, as well as Modern and Antique art in general."<a name="f90-text" href="#f90"><sup>90</sup></a> Tezcatlipoca, which means "Smoking Mirror," could see everything that took place on earth, in heaven, and hell in a highly polished obsidian mirror.<a name="f91-text" href="#f91"><sup>91</sup></a> He was the patron deity of sorcerers (variously called magicians, witches and wizards in the early twentieth-century literature) who practiced divination by means of obsidian mirrors, a method that was widespread in ancient Mexico.<a name="f92-text" href="#f92"><sup>92</sup></a> Graham's conjunction of interests in magic mirrors and Pre-Columbian art surely was familiar to his protégé, with whom he spent many hours discussing such things.</p>
<p>The round, brass mirrors of the Siberian shamans, called <span style="font-style:italic;">toli</span>, offered Pollock another example of magic mirrors. They have been traced to myths about a luminous people who existed before there was a sun and moon, but when they fell from grace the world became dark. According to Holmberg, the Altaic peoples believed that God's spirit emissary created the sun and moon by placing two metal mirrors in the sky.<a name="f93-text" href="#f93"><sup>93</sup></a> He observes that "It is commonly supposed that everything that takes place on the earth is reflected in the sun and moon and from these again in the magic mirrors of the shamans."<a name="f94-text" href="#f94"><sup>94</sup></a> Holmberg reproduces a photograph of a shaman's dwelling taken in an Altai district in 1909 (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>), in which, in addition to the drum, Hoppál has identified "the shaman's cloak or gown on the wall of the yurt, with metal ornaments, mirrors (<span style="font-style:italic;">toli</span>), and embossed work on it clearly distinguishable."<a name="f95-text" href="#f95"><sup>95</sup></a> (It is worth noting here that the garment the re wears in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Mirror</span> is defined by a series of wavy lines indicating the folds of a cloak or gown, thereby suggesting some sort of ritualistic apparel.) S.M. Shirokogoroff, writing in the 1930s, argued for the "intimate connexion" between the Buddhist use of brass mirrors in China and Tibet and the <span style="font-style:italic;">toli</span> of the shamans.<a name="f96-text" href="#f96"><sup>96</sup></a> The diffusion of these mirrors in Siberia, not until long after the latest migrations from Asia, accounts for their absence in North America. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>Shirokogoroff provides considerably more information on magic mirrors than Czaplicka, who only notes in passing that "a metal looking-glass with representations of twelve animals on it" was hung around the neck or sewn on the Buryat shaman's coat.<a name="f97-text" href="#f97"><sup>97</sup></a> Shirokogoroff informs us that these animals, representing units of time, appear on the unpolished side of the mirror. When the shaman looks at the polished side, it helps him enter a trance, a state in which "he can see everything."<a name="f98-text" href="#f98"><sup>98</sup></a> Seeing everything includes seeing into the future, an essential function of shamanism.<a name="f99-text" href="#f99"><sup>99</sup></a> In groups in which mirrors were customary, they were indispensable. The shaman, if necessary, could operate without costume, but there could be no shamanizing without the mirror.<a name="f100-text" href="#f100"><sup>100</sup></a> The Siberian shaman wore the magic mirror, whereas Pollock's shaman, seated left of center in his painting, looks up to a mirror on the right, a compositional arrangement that acknowledges its origins in Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl Before a Mirror</span>. Nevertheless, this mirror, as Pollock's title indicates, is indispensable for the divinatory and shamanic meanings of the painting. As we have seen, the association of mirrors with divination and the capture of souls has existed throughout history in contexts that were not properly shamanistic, but the flying phallus secures the shamanic identity of the re looking in the mirror. Insofar as magic mirrors were unknown to the north of ancient Mexico, John Graham's knowledge of Pre-Columbian art and Siberian shamanism must be accounted for in Pollock's conception.</p>
<p>Pollock's visual references to shamanism, which begin in the late 1930s, can be seen as signs of his intense need to find a way out of alcoholism and depression. The shaman's particular kind of healing offered Pollock a real-life example of psychic integration, as it did for Jung in references scattered throughout his writings. Landau describes <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Pollock's painting, <span style="font-style:italic;">Naked Man</span>, ca. 1938–41, a full-length, nude re with mask-like features surrounded by a fiery, swirling disk, as his "most visibly intelligible presentation of the tribal artist/healer. . . ."<a name="f101-text" href="#f101"><sup>101</sup></a> She also reads two drawings of seated res dating to the early 1940s as a shaman in successive stages of spiritual transformation,<a name="f102-text" href="#f102"><sup>102</sup></a> the second of which depicts a winged, levitating re apparently in a state of ecstatic soul flight. A year or two later Pollock painted <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardians of the Secret</span>, 1943, in which two totemic res flank an elongated, horizontal rectangle (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>). Rushing has convincingly demonstrated that this work derives in part from a <span style="font-style:italic;">BAE Report</span> illustration of a pair of Zia Pueblo secret-society guardians protecting a painting made for curative purposes.<a name="f103-text" href="#f103"><sup>103</sup></a> Scholarly consensus has it that the rectangle filled with indecipherable markings is a metaphor of the unconscious, but what physical object might this entity represent? With its uneven flashes of white pigment and suggestions of deeper blue spaces it resembles nothing so much as the reflective surface of a mirror. Confrontation with the self in a mirror is, as Jung remarked, "a test sufficient to frighten off most people." We protect ourselves by means of the mind's repressive mechanisms—Pollock's guardian res—because as the Siberian shamans undoubtedly knew, to "see everything" is painful.</p>

On Graham's acquaintance with Larionov and David Burliuk, and his later references to them, see Allentuck, 5, 116. Allentuck, 6, states "that as far as [Graham's] early development as an artist is concerned, Larionov was probably his greatest inspiration." Burliuk and Graham were reunited in New York in the 1920s, and the former wrote an introduction to the catalogue for Graham's exhibition at the Dudensing Galleries in 1929.

The "strong sense of bodily vibration" experienced in flying dreams corresponds to the physical sensation induced by drumming. Czaplicka, 203, notes that throughout Siberia "The drum has the power of transporting the shaman to the superworld and evoking spirits by its sounds." In other words, the shaman flies on the drum to the spirits. Interestingly, Péter Hajdú, a Hungarian expert on Uralic languages, has traced the Nenet word for shaman—<span style="font-style:italic;">tadyibye</span>—to a derivative of the verbal root <span style="font-style:italic;">taderasy</span>-, meaning "to be sexually aroused." See Mikhály Hoppál, <span style="font-style:italic;">Studies on Mythology and Uralic Shamanism</span> (Budapest: Akademiai Kiadó, 2000), 122.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f71" href="#f71-text">71. </a>According to Freud, "The peculiar property of this member of being able to raise itself upright in defiance of the law of gravity, part of the phenomenon of erection, leads to symbolic representation by means of <span style="font-style:italic;">balloons, aeroplanes</span>, and, just recently, <span style="font-style:italic;">Zeppelins.</span> But dreams have another, much more impressive, way of symbolizing erection; they make the organ of sex into the essential part of the whole person, so that the <span style="font-style:italic;">dreamer himself flies</span>. . . . Nor must you think to object to this on the ground that women can also have dreams of flying; you should rather remind yourselves that the purpose of dreams is wish-fulfillment, and that the wish to be a man is frequently met with in women, whether they are conscious of it or not. Further, no one familiar with anatomy will be misled by supposing that it is impossible for a woman to realize this wish by sensations similar to those of a man, for the woman's sexual organs include a small one which resembles the penis, and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  this little organ, the clitoris, does actually play during childhood and in the years before sexual in tercourse the same part as the large male organ." See Sigmund Freud, <span style="font-style:italic;">A General Introduction to Psycho-Analysis</span>, trans. Joan Riviere, with a Preface by Ernest Jones and G. Stanley Hall (New York: Liveright, 1935), 138–39.</p></div>

Furthermore, "It is only individual ego-consciousness that has forever a new beginning and an early end. But the unconscious psyche is not only immensely old, it is able to grow unceasingly into an equally remote future."

<p>When Bonnie Kime Scott's ground-breaking anthology, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gender of Modernism: A Critical Anthology</span>, was first published in 1990, I was a graduate student at Berkeley writing a dissertation on primarily noncanonical British women modernists. At the time, those of us who were working in Anglo-American modernist and feminist studies were delighted to encounter this wide-ranging anthology, which sought to illustrate not only how modernism was unconsciously gendered masculine, but how previously marginalized and neglected women writers were actually central proponents and practitioners of modernism. None of my seminars in graduate school exposed me to writers such as Mina Loy, Dorothy Richardson, or Katherine Mansfield, but Scott's anthology legitimized my interest in noncanonical writing and invited me to pursue the kind of recovery work that had been spearheaded by critics such as Elaine Showalter (<span style="font-style:italic;">A Literature of Their Own</span>, 1977), Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Madwoman in the Attic</span>, 1979), and Shari Benstock (<span style="font-style:italic;">Women of the Left Bank</span>, 1986). Today, the project of recovering lost women writers is no longer in vogue as it once was, but Scott's new anthology sees itself as part of this earlier tradition at the same time as it seeks to break new ground by highlighting its engagement with recent concerns in modernist studies: transnationalist feminism, global travel, emigration, queer theory, scientific discourse, technology, visual and material culture. While the impact of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gender of Modernism</span> is incontestable, the conceptual limits of that collection—privileging gender at the expense of other categories of identity, such as race, ethnicity, class, nation, and sexuality; focusing primarily on white women and exclusively on white men—are directly addressed by Scott in her ambitious and well presented introduction to <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span>, which is conceived as both a sequel and a corrective to the first now-classic <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  volume. The trade-off between the laudable conceptual re-evaluations of the new anthology and the first book is the loss of a focus on recovery work, a phenomenon that <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span> makes tacit gestures toward but ultimately moves beyond. One result of this shift in emphasis is a more muted and neutralized understanding of the first anthology's feminist argument that the "politics and aesthetics of gender may lie at the heart of a comprehensive understanding of early twentieth-century literature."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The significance of the tiny pronoun difference in each volume's title—<span style="font-style:italic;">Gender</span> of <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism</span>, versus <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism</span>—cannot be overstated; in the first anthology, a now dated "gendered reading of modernism" was privileged, whereas in the new anthology references to gender are couched within a larger, interdisciplinary conversation about selfhood that is inseparable from the "complex intersections" signaled by the new collection's subtitle.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The first book incorporated five primary male writers; the new anthology has nearly thirty, many working cooperatively with women. Just as gender is no longer isolated from other constituents of identity, both the categories of nationality and periodization are expanded in <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span>. Where the first volume limited itself to British and American texts published roughly between 1910 and 1940, the second anthology incorporates work from India, Africa, and Ireland, in an attempt to give voice to the "missing era," 1880–1910, when women were entering the public sphere as suffragists and socialists. The volume's commitment to "new geographies," interdisciplinarity, and its incorporation of cutting-edge theoretical work on the overlooked transnational and racial dimensions of modernist texts situates the book at the forefront of a new wave of scholarship in modernist studies that seeks to show how the study of <span style="font-style:italic;">modernity</span>—defined at one point as the examination of "patterns of material consumption, technological inventions, and medical interventions" —can do more for the re-evaluation of literature than the traditional focus on periodization and stylistic designation. <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span> places greater emphasis on the cultural and historical underpinnings of literature and rigorously seeks to displace Eurocentric notions of what modernism is by examining both canonical texts and those from the so-called periphery, which it redefines. In a chapter on "Modernism, Gender, and Africa" (Ch. 12), elegantly introduced by Tuzyline Jita Allan, writings by W. E. B. Du Bois and Alain Locke on African Americans are juxtaposed with texts by Charlotte Maxeke, Mabel Dove-Danquah, and Adelaide Casely Hayford, neglected women who examine the effects of gender on women's engagement with modernity in colonial Africa. This fresh and diverse juxtaposition demonstrates how early modernist women in Africa were part of a black intellectual culture that sought to reveal the gendered "impact of colonial hegemony on the new African cultural landscape" . The sobering narratives by these pioneering women also provide a counterbalance to Alain Locke's note of optimism in "Afro-Americans and West Africans: A New Understanding" (445–53).</p>
<p>Where the 1990 anthology was divided into twenty-six chapters on individual, primarily female, modernist writers—thereby signaling its challenge to the male canon—<span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span> is organized by wide-ranging "themes and concepts . . . uniting a group of authors who may or may not have worked together in life" . The sheer size of the new anthology—896 pages that weigh close to three pounds—conveys its claims to monumentality and advertises its interest in both inclusivity and breadth. The book's twenty-one chapters are divided into five compelling sections: "Modernist/ Feminist Activism"; "Issues of Production and Reception"; "Diverse Identities and Geographies"; "War, Technology, and Traumas of Modernity"; and "Arts and Performances." The impressive range of topics that are covered in individual chapters include "Modernism, Gender, and Passing" (Ch. 11), "Mediumship, Automatism, and Modernist Authorship" (Ch. 17), and "Gender and Collaboration in Modern Drama" (Ch. 18). As anyone who has edited a collection knows, there is a certain arbitrariness that is inherent to the process of categorization. In this anthology, we find some conceptual overlap from chapter to chapter, so that, for example, Claire Tylee's selections in "War, Modernisms, and the Feminized 'Other'" (Ch. 14), could have been included in Suzette Henke's chapter "Modernism, Trauma, and Narrative Reformulation," which also addresses the topic of war (Ch. 15). References to manifestos occur in "Suffrage and Spectacle" (Ch. 1), "Manifestoes from the Sex War" (Ch. 2), and "Modernism and Medicine" (Ch. 16), while suffragette perspectives are included in four separate chapters, "Suffrage and Spectacle," "Manifestoes from the Sex War," "Debating Feminism, Modernism, and Socialism: Beatrice Hastings's Voices in <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Age</span>" (Ch. 5), and "Gender and Collaboration <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  in Modern Drama." The phenomenon of repetition is perhaps unavoidable in an anthology of this size, but it does make one think about what was excluded in order to allow for such repetition to occur. I will return to this vexed issue of exclusion in a moment, but for now let's say that at times one is happy to approach a complex topic from multiple angles. Colleen Lamos's nuanced treatment of lesbians in "Queer Conjunctions in Modernism" (Ch. 10) is a welcome companion to Gay Wachman's polemical introduction to "Lesbian Political History" (Ch. 9), where Radclyffe Hall is scolded for allowing her "snobbery and conservatism [to] mar much of her writing and detract from the courage of her lesbian politics" .</p>
<p>There is no doubt that, overall, this thought-provoking and historically informed anthology constructively complicates our understanding of modernism. Many of the chapters effortlessly balance historical and archival research with skillful close readings of primary texts, and several stand out for their innovative use of material from diverse sources. Sonita Sarker's smart and broad ranging chapter, "Race, Nation, and Modernity: The Anti-Colonial Consciousness of Modernism" (Ch. 13), highlights the transnational texts of colonized writers by situating writing by Gertrude Stein alongside work by Victoria Ocampo, Jean Rhys, Behramji Merwanji Malabari, and Cornelia Sorabji. The contiguousness of the extracts in this section emphasizes "hitherto underrepresented social and intellectual relationships"  and deepens our understanding of international modernism. Susan Squier's stunning introduction to "Modernism and Medicine" raises questions about the different responses of modernism and modernity to scientific practice. This section includes excerpts from J. B. S. Haldane's pamphlet, <span style="font-style:italic;">Daedalus, or Science and the Future</span> , which "catalyzed a vigorous debate over the social implications of extra-uterine gestation" , and Elizabeth von Arnim's <span style="font-style:italic;">Love</span> , which recounts the story of a woman who undergoes "rejuvenation therapy" —a course of X-ray and electrical treatments to the ovaries that were available in the U.S. and Europe during this period. Bette London's engaging and witty chapter on "Mediumship, Automatism, and Modernist Authorship" demonstrates how mediumship as a modernist phenomenon represented a performance of a different order from its Victorian counterpart. We learn here how automatic writing is not only "a site of cultural production . . . [but] an unacknowledged modernist mode of writing" . Sometimes, the introductions offer us a tantalizing taste but do not fully deliver. Katherine E. Kelly's fine introduction to "Gender and Collaboration in Modern Drama" praises Edna St. Vincent Millay's play, <span style="font-style:italic;">Aria da Capo</span> , as an "American avant-garde example of indirect but powerfully political dramaturgy" , but no excerpt of the play is included. In other instances, one simply wonders about the logic of inclusion. Why, for example, is there a chapter on dance—Carol Shloss's "Modernism, Gender, and Dance" (Ch. 19)—but none on fashion, music, or architecture? Why is Lola Ridge's moving poem, "The Ghetto" , included in "Radical Moderns: American Women Poets on the Left" (Ch. 3), rather than in a section on Jewish modernist writers? Such quibbles are perhaps unfair, given the impossibility of covering every possible modernist topic and author, but because of <span style="font-style:italic;">this</span> particular anthology's historical relationship to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gender of Modernism</span>—which is still in print almost twenty years later when so many other academic books end up on remainder tables—the issue of inclusion is not only important, but critical. The authors and texts that are included in <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span> are arguably more likely to be read, reproduced, distributed, popularized, taught, and written about than other marginalized or noncanonical writers and works that are not lucky enough to be included in this anthology.</p>
<p>An illustration of this dynamic can be seen in Julia Briggs's insightful section on Hope Mirrlees's avant-garde "Paris: A Poem" , which introduces readers to a truly fascinating "lost masterpiece"  about the poet's stroll through the city during the course of a single day. "Paris" was originally typeset by Virginia Woolf and published by the Hogarth Press in an edition of 175 copies. The poem's iconoclastic typesetting is a reflection of Mirrlees's desire to communicate visually as well as verbally, and the author's idiosyncratic form is retained in this reproduction so that one can track the abandoned punctuation and blank spaces that proved challenging to Woolf. Briggs's meticulous explanatory notes on "Paris," which take up seventeen pages of text, provide us with invaluable commentary on the poem's elusive meaning and experimental structure. In many ways, this section on "Hope Mirrlees and Continental Modernism" (Ch. 8), which contains no excerpts from any other writers, is a throwback to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gender of Modernism</span> because of its focus upon a single writer and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  its interest in introducing readers to a "groundbreaking poem and . . . remarkable author [who] disappear[ed] through the cracks of literary history" . To the extent that Briggs's painstakingly annotated chapter in <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span> opens new avenues of enquiry into a previously lost women writer, it strives, like the contributors in its predecessor, to highlight gender and signal the value of recuperative work. This is not the only chapter that is given over to one woman's vision (Ann Ardis engagingly introduces a chapter on journalist Beatrice Hasting's contributions to <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Age</span>), nor is it the only chapter in which previously lost women appear (Leslie Kathleen Hankins provides a splendid introduction to the London film critic, Iris Barry; Diane F. Gillespie eloquently argues for the importance of painter, Winifred Nicholson), but it is the only chapter that focuses upon a single noncanonical female modernist poet.</p>
<p>We can perhaps best see this tension between the "old" versus the "new" field of modernism in the surprising cover illustration of <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span>, which features a pastel painting by Marie Laurencin of "Two Girls and a Dog" . Laurencin was an important re of the Parisian avant-garde who pursued a specifically feminine aesthetic through her use of pastel colors and curvilinear forms. She painted female res and insisted upon the creation of a visual vocabulary of femininity in her art. Diane Gillespie, in her introduction to the selection by Laurencin—"Men's Genius Intimidates Me"—discusses the artist's self-conscious pursuit of a visual vocabulary that was "unthreateningly naïve, childlike, and stereotypically feminine" . We can see these elements reflected in the cover of <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span>: graceful and dreamy young white European women in pastel coloring and soft shading. It is, I would argue, very difficult to reconcile the enormous symbolic significance of this painting with a book that purports to be at the forefront of the reinvigorated field of modernist studies. In many ways, Laurencin's feminine image is a much more appropriate marketing choice for the earlier anthology, which explored gynocritical modes of representation throughout, but what is also true is that the discomfort that the cover produces is symptomatic of a larger issue that is endemic to the field: the uncomfortable place of women's literature within modernist studies today. Scott's introduction to <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span> argues that the new anthology offers fresh and diverse texts that reflect today's broader, more inclusive understanding of modernism (read: no longer solely preoccupied with recuperative work or gender in isolation). However, at the same time that Scott suggests the field has moved beyond a focus on female authorship, she simultaneously makes a case for the importance of "exciting archival recoveries of texts" by women . Both Julia Briggs's chapter on Hope Mirrlees and the cover by Marie Laurencin are examples of the palpable tension that exists between scholarship on female authors or artists and the ideological shift toward interdisciplinarity and work that crosses multiple boundaries.</p>
<p>The field of British modernism has witnessed a paradigm shift that can be described as a reversal of earlier hard-won gains if one compares the attention currently paid to noncanonical female modernists to the way they were received and marketed when <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gender of Modernism</span> first appeared. For example, although the new anthology contains an excerpt from Dorothy Richardson, her multivolume opus, <span style="font-style:italic;">Pilgrimage</span>, is no longer in print in the U.S. Similarly, although excerpts from Winifred Holtby and Rose Macaulay's journalism appear in chapter 6, none of their novels is in print in the U.S. Other writers, such as Antonia White, May Sinclair, Rosamond Lehmann, and Katharine Burdekin—whose powerful dystopian novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Swastika Night</span> , could have been included in a section on modernist science fiction—are simply left out of <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span>.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> A few important female modernists are currently in print, but sadly not included in Scott's anthology. Perhaps one of the most perplexing omissions is the extraordinary Mary Butts, whose dazzling writing—Lawrence Rainey refers to her work as a "tour de force"—easily could have fit into sections on anti-Semitism, religion, homosexuality, mass culture, or race and nation.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Luckily for Butts, McPherson &amp; Co. has been diligently publishing her work as part of their "Recovered Classics" series and soon will release her lesbian novel, "Unborn Gods," which was never published in her lifetime.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Another highly esteemed but scandalously under-read British modernist, the acerbic Olive Moore (the pseudonym used by Constance Vaughan), could have been included in sections on journalism (she was a reporter for the London <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Sketch</span>); politics (she was a part of Charles Lahr's Red Lion Street Circle, a literary group that gravitated toward radical literature); or race, sexuality, and nation (each of the four brilliant books that she published between 1929 and 1934—and earned her the reputation as an <span style="font-style:italic;">enfant terrible</span> of British literature-—address these <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  topics). Thanks to the efforts of Dalkey Archive Press, Moore has not completely disappeared from literary history.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Some of Nancy Cunard's key political writings on race and imperialism appeared in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gender of Modernism</span>, but no excerpt from her political tracts appear in <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span>, even though our understanding of modernist women's relationship to empire, in my view, is still in its infancy.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> If writers such as Butts, Moore, and Cunard—and here I am talking specifically about female modernists who are currently <span style="font-style:italic;">in print</span>—had been included in Scott's anthology, they arguably would have had a better chance of avoiding the pitfalls of obscurity.</p>
<p>Instead, what is happening with noncanonical British women modernists is both heartening and bewildering: interest in them is being kept alive by a variety of independent sources, some academic and some fan-based, that do not appear to intersect. A Jean Rhys Festival and Conference was held in Dominica in June 2004, and interest in the author is bolstered by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Jean Rhys Review</span> and a listserve. A Dorothy Richardson Society was recently started by Scott McCracken, at Keele University, and the first international conference on Richardson took place in London in 2007. Soon the first annual issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Pilgrimages: The Journal of Dorothy Richardson Studies</span>, will be published.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> The International Rebecca West Society, founded in 2003 by West scholars, met for the third time in New York City in September 2007. The following month, a colloquium on Winifred Holtby was held at Anglia Ruskin University, in Cambridge, organized by Mary Joannou and Marion Shaw (Loughborough University). The event was one of a series on early twentieth-century women writers, following earlier colloquia on Nancy Cunard in 2001, Storm Jameson in 2005, and Sylvia Townsend Warner in 2006; there is a Rosamond Lehmann Colloquium scheduled for April 2009. Of these four writers, Warner is the only one who was included in the original <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender of Modernism</span> as well as its sequel, and interestingly she is the only one whose work is currently being reissued by New York Review Books Classics.9 Popular interest in Daphne du Maurier (who did not make it into either anthology) is sustained by a ten-day Du Maurier Festival of Arts and Literature held annually in Fowey, Cornwall. Katherine Mansfield, who was featured in the original <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender of Modernism</span> but not the sequel, was honored by The Katherine Mansfield Centenary Conference at Birkbeck, University of London, in September 2008. Such segregationist venues are important, but they are destined to attract only specialists, groupies, or those who are able to travel to England for such events.</p>
<p>Cumulatively these individual efforts, while laudable, arguably have very little chance of making the kind of lasting or universal impact that an anthology (such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span>), an international journal (such as <span style="font-style:italic;"></span>), or a large, coordinated academic conference, such as The Conference on Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century British Women Writers, can make. This particular conference, which originated in 1991, focuses on women's eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writing—particularly those writers who have been historically overlooked, ignored, or excluded from the canon. About two years ago I wrote to Pamela Corpron Parker, the Chair of the British Women Writers Association, and asked if the organization might consider opening the conference to twentieth-century writers. Much to my surprise the idea was presented to the board, which voted to maintain an exclusive focus on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British Women writers. Today, those scholars working in the nineteenth century have, in addition to this annual conference, the online Victorian Women Writers Project, while those working on earlier periods have the Brown Women Writers Project, an invaluable online collection which covers the period from 1400 to 1850.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> There is nothing comparable, either in terms of a conference or online resource, for those of us working on twentieth-century British women writers.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Quirky modernists such as Olive Moore and Anna Kavan, or Una Marson, the black Jamaican poet, playwright, and political activist who did freelance journalism, talks, scriptwriting, and producing for BBC radio during the 1930s and 1940s (and is notably excluded from <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span>), have no annual conference or society to propel interest in them.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Yet even those who <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span> benefit from such attention remain marginalized from the mainstream because there is no coordinated effort to revive and sustain interest in them. A colloquium, newsletter, academic talk, or published monograph on a noncanonical female modernist is welcome, but such efforts alone cannot shift the ideological landscape.</p>
<p>Despite the last twenty-odd years of feminist reworkings of women's twentieth-century literature, Virginia Woolf is arguably still the only universally canonized British woman modernist—a fact readily acknowledged by Scott in her introduction to the new anthology. Currently the only female modernist <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  with a national journal, four international societies, a newsletter, an annual conference, and two standing MLA panels, Woolf appears in scattered references throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span> and three excerpts from her work (virtually all of which is in print) are included in separate chapters on journalism, trauma, and the cinema.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> This recurrence reminds us of the issue of repetition, which in Woolf's case no doubt helps to maintain her lasting and formidable reputation.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> It is not that including multiple excerpts from Woolf is in itself objectionable—a writer of her stature is obviously meant to situate and anchor the range of perspectives within modernity that the collection includes. Yet, in an anthology of this prominence, space could have been given over to less well-known but equally worthy writers. The issue of Woolf's inclusion is freighted, in short, because of its material and commercial consequences: the anthology's shift toward more complex understandings of gender comes at the expense of recovering <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> academically institutionalizing lost women writers. Comparison with a recent commendable effort, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia of British Women's Writing, 1900–1950</span>, is instructive; the <span style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia</span> does seek to stimulate interest in the lesser known writers of this era of women's literary history, but because that objective is no longer hip, the book is arguably destined to be read only by those who are already interested in recovery work.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Naysayers may argue that one book can only do so much, but because <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span> appeals to a wider audience it is arguably poised to have more lasting institutional effects.</p>
<p>While the topic of the canon may have been rendered passé by the assumption that formerly marginalized writers have been integrated into the mainstream, in many ways the recovery of women's cultural work is less commercially viable today than it was twenty years ago. One index of how publishers are bowing to certain kinds of ideological pressures with respect to gender is Persephone Books, an independent publisher founded by Nicola Beauman—the author of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Very Great Profession: The Women's Novel 1914–39</span>—which has been actively reprinting a range of largely middlebrow, "forgotten classics" by twentieth-century women writers since 1999. Persephone Books is clearly marketed to a niche female audience: each attractive book uses a distinctive fabric, mostly designed by early twentieth-century women, for its endpaper and matching bookmark, and the company runs a cozy London shop, publishes a newsletter, and hosts a book discussion group that is accompanied by cream tea.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Like the Marie Laurencin cover of <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span>, which trades on the conventions of femininity, the image of Persephone Books exudes a genteel, accessible, and non-threatening femininity—even though the books themselves do not always reflect this domesticated bias.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> In thinking about the modern publishing success of Persephone Books, one wonders if perhaps <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span> is similarly attempting strategically to attract potential readers by visually flagging the ongoing project of women's cultural custodianship even though the text itself does not fit so squarely into this mold. One thing <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span> does not have that was prevalent in the original anthology is a series of beautiful and striking black and white photographs of modernist women: Djuna Barnes and Mina Loy in silent conversation, a made-up Nancy Cunard wearing her signature bangles, Jean Rhys gazing sultrily into the camera, a soft-focus portrait of Nella Larsen, the elegant back of May Sinclair in an upswept hairdo and fancy dress.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> To what extent did the marketing of female beauty help to generate interest in female modernists in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gender of Modernism</span>, and what role does the absence of such tactical visual markers in <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span> play in contemporary estimations of female modernism?</p>
<p>The increasing emphasis on a transnational turn in modernist literary scholarship, as Douglas Mao and Rebecca Walkowitz have observed in their recent <span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span> article on "The New Modernist Studies," is widely regarded as a major trend in the field today.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> This body of scholarship privileges a more global understanding of modernism and modernity, and seeks to expand the field's earlier focus beyond the literatures of Europe and North America. What does this transformative embrace of transnationalism mean for the status of British women modernists, and how might we reconcile new developments in the field of Anglophone modernism with the seeming neglect of several of the aforementioned women writers? Virginia Woolf, Jean Rhys, Nancy Cunard, and Katherine Mansfield have all benefited from recent transnational readings, but what about writers such as May Sinclair, Rosamond Lehmann, Vera Brittain, Stella Benson, or Naomi Mitchison?<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Are they out of vogue because their work is resistant to transnational interpretations, or is it that scholars have chosen not to focus attention there? Certainly works such as Winifred Holtby's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mandoa! Mandoa!</span>, a novel <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  about Africa, or <span style="font-style:italic;">The Astonishing Island</span>, her anti-colonial satire (both published in 1933), would lend themselves to transnational readings, but virtually no critical attention has been paid to either book. One major strand of British women's writing that is preoccupied with global issues would appear to be ripe for transnational analysis: the novels of colonial women writers such as Elsbeth Huxley, Rumer Godden, Phyllis Bottome, and Phyllis Shand Allfrey (none of whom appear in Scott's anthology). But as Phyllis Lassner has astutely argued, "despite a deluge of theory and analysis of colonial and post-colonial experience, representation, and its gendered amendments, the white colonial woman writer remains invisible or marginalized."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> If one of the objectives of the transnational turn in modernist studies has been to examine how modernists responded to imperialism, then work still remains to be done on how British women writers grappled with colonial relations and identities in the Middle East, the Caribbean, India, and Africa. How, to borrow Lassner's language, might these writers be read as "representative of a new kind of multicultural and postcolonial perspective"?<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> In thinking about the increasing emphasis on transnational exchange within modernist studies, I also wonder why prominent early-twentieth-century travel narratives by British women are not attracting more scholarly attention, and here I am thinking of the diverse range of work by writers such as: Gertrude Bell (traveler, political analyst, and administrator in the Middle East), Vita Sackville-West (author of <span style="font-style:italic;">Passenger to Teheran</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Twelve Days: An Account of a Journey Across the Bakhtiari Mountains in Southwestern Persia</span>), and Freya Stark (explorer, mapmaker, ethnographer, and author of thirty books on her experiences in the Middle East).<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> None of these writers is excerpted in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gender in Modernism</span>, and such blatant omission—given the anthology's enthusiastic endorsement of transnational currents and the rhetoric of globalization—suggests to me that academics veer away from the work of such women because it is assumed to be politically suspect, that is to say, complicit with dominant imperial and racial ideologies.</p>
<p>Lest this review end on too cranky (or too cynical) a note, let me hasten to add that, despite my reservations, I found Scott's anthology overall to be a compelling, thought-provoking, and invaluable resource for anyone working in modernist studies today. I learned about writers I did not know about, such as Lola Ridge. Nancy Berke's shrewd introduction to Ridge's "Lullaby" shows how the poem is constructed like a traditional nursery rhyme but attacks both racism and gender. Ridge, in a footnote to "Lullaby," problematizes the view of women as feminist innovators involved in social change by informing her readers, in 1918, of: "An incident of the East St. Louis Race Riots, when some white women flung a living colored baby into the heart of a blazing fire" . I am not sure how I ever got through graduate school without learning about this racist incident, but it is just one example among many that illustrates the "complex intersections" promised by the anthology's subtitle. <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span>'s capacity for large-scale analysis, its establishment of critical conceptual foundations that build upon and productively complicate the first collection, and its incorporation of a variety of interdisciplinary debates in cultural studies and contemporary theory make it required reading. And perhaps it will even help to stimulate a more nuanced conversation about the further recovery of women's cultural work than the one we are currently not having.</p>

Similarly, Suzanne Raitt's excellent book, <span style="font-style:italic;">May Sinclair: A Modern Victorian</span> (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2000), has not stimulated enough interest in Sinclair to warrant the reissue of her modernist novels.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f5" href="#f5-text">5. </a>Nathalie Blondel, Butts's biographer and the editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Journals of Mary Butts</span> (New Haven, CT and London: Yale University Press, 2002), wrote in her introduction to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Journals</span> that "Unborn Gods" would be published in 2003 by Trent Editions, but this never happened. She inexplicably refers to the manuscript's title as "Dangerous" , even though the original manuscript—archived at the Beinecke Library—clearly states, in Butts's own handwriting, that the title is "Unborn Gods." Bruce McPherson, the editor of McPherson &amp; Company, estimates that the novel will be released in 2009. Tom Slingsby, a graduate student at the University of Sussex, maintains a wonderful and informative blog and website on Butts: <a href="http://www.thewoodwasinnocent.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.thewoodwasinnocent.co.uk/</a>.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f6" href="#f6-text">6. </a>Olive Moore was first introduced by Dalkey Archive Press in her <span style="font-style:italic;">Collected Writings</span> (published in 1992, but now out of print). Dalkey has separately published <span style="font-style:italic;">Spleen</span>, the story of an Englishwoman in self-imposed exile in Italy after giving birth to a deformed son. The first monograph on Moore, Renee Dickinson's <span style="font-style:italic;">Female Embodiment and Subjectivity in the Modernist Novel: The Corporeum of Virginia Woolf and Olive Moore</span>, is forthcoming from Routledge in 2009.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f7" href="#f7-text">7. </a>A new biography on Cunard will no doubt help to generate scholarly interest in the author; see Lois Gordon, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nancy Cunard: Heiress, Muse, Political Idealist</span> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2007). The book was the subject of a review essay by Elisabeth Ladenson earlier this year, "By Fate Misbred," in <span style="font-style:italic;"></span> 15:2 (April 2008), 381–86. Laura Winkiel's <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism, Race and Manifestos</span> (Cambridge University Press, 2008) contains a fascinating chapter on Cunard's anthology, <span style="font-style:italic;">Negro</span>. An earlier version of this essay was published as "Nancy Cunard's <span style="font-style:italic;">Negro</span> and the Transnational Politics of Race," in <span style="font-style:italic;"></span> 13:3 (September 2006), 507–530. See also Maureen Moynagh's edited collection on Cunard's political writings, <span style="font-style:italic;">Essays on Race and Empire</span> (Peterborough, Ontario: Broadview Press, 2002). Work on women modernists and empire has been productively explored by: Howard J. Booth and Nigel Rigby, eds., <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism and Empire</span> (Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 2000); Robin Hackett, <span style="font-style:italic;">Sapphic Primitivism: Productions of Race, Class, and Sexuality in Key Works of Modern Fiction</span> (New Brunswick, NJ and London: Rutgers University Press, 2004); Phyllis Lassner, <span style="font-style:italic;">Colonial Strangers: Women Writing the End of the British Empire</span> (New Brunswick, NJ and London: Rutgers University Press, 2004); Jane Marcus, <span style="font-style:italic;">Hearts of Darkness: White Women Write Race</span> (New Brunswick, NJ and London: Rutgers University Press, 2004); Jennifer Poulos Nesbitt, <span style="font-style:italic;">Narrative Settlements: Geographies of British Women's Fiction Between the Wars</span> (Toronto, Buffalo, London: University of Toronto Press, 2005); Gay Wachman, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lesbian Empire: Radical Crosswriting in the Twenties</span> (New Brunswick, NJ and London: Rutgers University Press, 2001).

Hauser, and Gay Wachman (Newark: University of Delaware Press, 2009). My own book on the topic, <span style="font-style:italic;">Step-Daughters of England: British Women Modernists and the National Imaginary</span> (Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 2003), is incorrectly listed in a footnote to <span style="font-style:italic;">Gender in Modernism</span> as an unpublished manuscript.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f14" href="#f14-text">14. </a>In case there was any doubt about Woolf's celebrity status within the academy, one need only look at Newnham College's latest fundraising efforts, which are based upon Woolf's fictionalized account of her visit to Cambridge in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One's Own</span>. In October 1928 Woolf was invited to have lunch at King's College by Dadie Rylands, one of its Fellows and a friend of Bloomsbury. Rylands bequeathed the table at which he and Woolf dined to the Charleston Trust, and now that table—along with the eight original chairs—is on loan at Newnham for five years in order to raise funds for the college. The fundraising scheme invites potential donors to host a dinner around Dadie Rylands's table while guests sip champagne and listen to an eminent scholar speaks on some aspect of Woolf or Bloomsbury. The cost for hosting such a dinner ranges from £5– 10,000. The publicity material states: "Woolf would be pleased to see that Newnham now has its own College silver which will of course be used, and each guest will receive a copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One's Own</span> as a memento of the evening . . . [W]e are sure that your support for women's education . . . would be applauded by Virginia Woolf, whose spirit surely inhabits both Newnham and Dadie Rylands' iconic table."

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f16" href="#f16-text">16. </a>I am not trying to be dismissive of Persephone Book's laudable achievement, but rather, to understand why this publisher is thriving when so many feminist presses have folded in recent years. One insight is provided by Colleen Mondor, who quotes Nicola Beauman: "Persephone, by its own definition, 'differs from other feminist publishers in that they are more accessible, more domestic, the feminism is 'softer'.'" See the September 2004 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Bookslut</span>: <a href="http://www.bookslut.com/features/2004_09_003116.php" target="_blank">http://www.bookslut.com/ features/2004_09_003116.php</a>. This "softer" feminism of Persephone Books has most recently seen the publication of Winifred Holtby's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Crowded Street</span> , and Beauman's own <span style="font-style:italic;">A Very Great Profession: The Woman's Novel, 1914–39</span>, first published in 1983. An earlier reissue, <span style="font-style:italic;">Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day</span>  by Winifred Watson, is now an audiobook (for sale by Persephone) and a movie starring Frances McDormand. See <a href="http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/</a>.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f17" href="#f17-text">17. </a>Overall, Persephone Book's collection is eclectic and often surprising, despite the website's claim that their selections are "neither too literary nor too commercial."

<div id="body">
<p>That the foremost literary practitioner of magic realism in Italy, Massimo Bontempelli, was also the head of the National Fascist Writers Union for crucial years in the mid- to late-1920s is no accident of history. Mythic discourse about the nation, the people, and Mussolini propelled fascism's rise to power and consolidated its consensus. Discourse on magic falls within that phenomenon and had distinct political connotations and weight in fascist arts. The "magic" component in magic realism could suggest a transcendent fascism, evoking a wondrous, eternal form of being to associate with Italian landscapes and the Italian populace.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> The strong presence of working people in Italian magic realism in painters such as Gisberto Ceracchini, Felice Casorati, and Ferruccio Ferrazzi illustrates this politics of magic. Virgilio Guidi's painting "In Tram" ["On a tram"; 1923][<a name="1-text" href="#1">re 1</a>] shows humble folk on a vehicle whose windows provide an enchanted view onto a still, clear ring of mountains rather than an urban landscape. They go about their jobs in an imaginary, doubled space that is both modern in its subject matter, the tram, and ageless in its depiction of a geological landscape. The exalting in this way of Italian workers provides one significant link to Bontempelli's activism in the fascist corporativist union ("sindacato") for writers. "Syndicalism" as a political movement—splintered even into various groupings with differing political views—institutionalized the importance of class, and the fascist labor movement was a significant component of the regime as it was gaining power and claiming the status of a revolution. Unionism and a practice of magic realism clearly have points of contact and continuity. What can Bontempelli's activism in the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  writers union teach us about a complex period of history during which the negotiation of differing ideological positions in conjunction with differing artistic practices had such high political stakes? A discourse of magic, I shall argue, mediates these troubled negotiations and qualifies realism in a way that allows magic realism to become an important component of fascist activism. The practice of magic realism within this historical framework is not simply a return to order through rative techniques in painting in the years after World War I and a traditional prose style and narrative structure in literature; it is equally an attempt to ground an artistic practice that is properly fascist in its actions.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> I propose to study here two exemplary novels penned by Bontempelli paying close attention to historical contextualization in order to bring to light the political allegories the works offer.</p>

<p>A first, necessary step to understanding the practice of magic realism in the mid-twenties in Italy is to review its critique of realist representation. Bontempelli evolved multiple strategies for the purpose of signaling his belief that the old realism had run its historical course. Like other talented modernists who moved in various post-realist directions—abstraction, Futurism, the New Objectivity, and surrealism—Bontempelli drew up a compensatory strategy. In the work that Bontempelli produced directly after World War I, his most experimental, he used literary forms such as the mini-novel or <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the brief comic dialogue to counter realist narrative conventions. Experiments in nar rative framing produced multiple perspectives that also defied realist presumptions about time and space. The author definitively eschewed the teleological finality of the epic and the nineteenth-century novel, a choice that moves the works deeper into the realm of mystery. The editor-in-chief of the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">'900, Cahiers d'Italie Et d'Europe</span> from 1926 to 1929, Bontempelli also moved aggressively in critical writings to attack nineteenth-century European realism, calling it literature for crickets.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Linked to positivism and an outdated culture, realism no longer held up, he thought, either as an aesthetic or an epistemological grounding. He blasted realism for sterility, petit-bourgeois sentimentalism, anemia, and a defeatist obsession with the downtrodden, cowards, the banal, and every low subject prevalent—in his view—in modern writing.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> A new realism, the author suggested, would have to found itself on the actualizing power of invention and the imagination.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Literature, art, and music are creative <span style="font-style:italic;">activities</span>. These practices produce their own discursive reality and, by this logic, their own realism.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> A similarity is constructed in which this realism is construed as a power that matches magic.</p>
<p>As his practice of magic realism was emerging, Bontempelli intensified his efforts at troubling the old realism using new creative strategies. He undoubtedly shared some of the convictions of the painters of the "Novecento italiano" group, with their modernizing neo-classicism. Aiming for wide audiences, Bontempelli, an accomplished journalist, argued for balance and simplicity, holding up Italian Quattrocento painting as a model of precision distinct from realism. He constructed relatively clear temporal directionality in his narratives, using distinct calendar time. Despite the style's dose of harmonious classicism, its magic component throws a wrench into narrative cohesion. Bontempelli moved boldly, devoting some hard work to the study of magical discourse in Western cultural history. He authored a book--entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Il libro degli arcani [Book of the Arcane</span>; 1928]<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> in which he researched spells, potions, talismans, alchemy, the evil eye, palm reading, zodiac signs, and the philosopher's stone. Hermetic thought dating back to Neo-Platonism along with alchemical references is well represented. An especially long portion of the work is devoted to "<span style="font-style:italic;">envoûtement</span>," or possession. Bontempelli's attention to the subject's vulnerability to dissolution is telling—and reminiscent of Ernesto de Martino's anthropological study of threats to self-presence in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Il mondo magico</span>. If a character suffers possession, the narrative will splinter because the self of the character is fragmented. What will the other characters do and how will the troubling of a self be negotiated by other individuals and by groups?</p>
<p>Negotiation is a key element of the plots Bontempelli built around an eruption of magic into the world of daily life: Bontempelli's distinctive narrative constructions stage dramas about social compromise. These narratives revolve around social identifications that are shown to be in flux. Various sectors of the social world enter, in this type of emplotment, into a distinct agon whose resolution will depend on alliances. Stagnant beings incapable of stretching and morphing because they are bound into deadened social identifications are the losers. Those open to negotiation are the protagonists. The success or failure of any compromise formation represented in the narrations is <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  dependent on multiple factors. Who initiates and controls the encounter? Who goes between? Can the distribution of power at a given historical moment change through alliance-revision? The successful binding of individual subjects into an ideal, functional political organism is at stake.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>How exactly does the author set the narrative into motion in such a way as to put negotiation into play in the emplotment? Magic is key. Mysteries and miracles typically govern the plot sequences and automatically put the fictional world at a remove from any familiar chronology or normal shape for events. For example, a dead child is reincarnated into a living one so that he comes to have two mothers in the novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Il io di due madri [The Son with Two Mothers</span>]. The mystery of the revenant produces an array of violently divergent opinions on what could have transpired. Subsequently, proposals for various, drastically different solutions dominate the plot: a theosophical society tries to intervene, a mother is kidnapped and stowed away in a mental institution, and a "zingaro" ("gypsy") kidnaps the boy. Ultimately none of the proposed courses of action in this novel solves the enigma incarnate of the disturbing child, and readers are left unknowing of his fate at its end.</p>
<p>No solid compromise solution emerges in this quintessential example of magic realism, and no plot attains its resolution for very specific reasons. This is a historical novel, set in 1900 in pre-fascist years in which Italy, Bontempelli thinks, was at the mercy of an inadequate liberal government and a politics of pure expedience. This historical novel stages a pointed non-ending and a failure of knowledge because no group's discourse exercises sufficient vision or willpower to undertake self-modification even in the face of great necessity.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Every proposed action is associated with social factions or groups that put forth their own plans but whose imaginative powers have gone stale: the bourgeoisie, medical doctors, churchmen, and judges. As this emplotment demonstrates, narratives about weak, insufficient competing discourses are the raw material of Bontempelli's critique of the past. This fact suggests that putting the magic back into a modernity supposedly fraught with de-magification is not as high on Bontempelli's agenda as reconceptualizing and re-building the ties between literature and the social fabric. Active innovation and realization take place in this view only in the realm of the mental, the imaginative, or what was often termed "spirit." Active imagination is the solution to the stagnation of an era moving from an old order to a new one.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Imagining is in this theory infinitely available to social subjects who gain agency from it.</p>
<p>The link between action and imagination appears explicitly in many places in Bontempelli's writing, and in the following short passage where we read, "L'azione e la immaginazione sono molto più concordi che non si creda, e spesso trovano vie e sbocchi comuni. [Action and imagination are more concordant than one presumes, and they often find common paths and outlets.]<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> When Bontempelli casts imagination and realizing as powerful forces at the disposition of socio-political subjects who are constantly enjoined in power struggles, we shall not be surprised that he might underwrite the political philosophy of actualism theorized by Giovanni Gentile. Gentile chaired a 1924 commission aimed at reforming the Italian constitution in a fascist direction. He <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  advocated a strong state with powers to enact new, fascist legislation and to enforce it. One subject addressed by the commission was precisely the role of syndicalism, and Gentile pursued within this commission his conviction that the negotiation of union interests and state interests could and should take place in corporativist institutions created by fascist reforms of the Constitution.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Moving from Gentile's actualist thinking to Bontempelli's general fascist activity beyond his unionism, we should note that the author had close ties to the regime from its early days and well into the 1930s, becoming a member in 1930 of the elite Accademia d'Italia founded by Mussolini. Well-connected to various Ministers of Culture, the author wrote for the fascist-inspired <span style="font-style:italic;">Paese nuovo</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Corriere italiano</span>. Numerous editorials and published speeches, published and unpublished correspondence, documents at the Central State Archive, and the diaries of other writers and politicians all testify to Bontempelli's belief in fascism and its head of government, Mussolini. Mussolini's archives contain significant correspondence from and pertaining to Bontempelli. As a playwright, his works were consistently, if not always immediately, granted the requisite <span style="font-style:italic;">nulla osta</span> for staging from the Ministry of Popular Culture.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Finally, Bontempelli called his entire critical production, collected in the volume <span style="font-style:italic;">L'avventura novecentista</span>, the documenting of "uno stato d'anima incline a cercare armonia tra il letterario e il politico" [a state of mind inclined to seek out harmony between literature and the political].<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>By the late 1930s, though, a growing disaffection with the fascist regime led to Bontempelli's dissent, which took several forms: public speeches that were judged anti-fascist by authorities and a refusal to occupy the university chair offered to him when Attilio Momigliano had to vacate it subsequent to anti-Semitic legislation in 1938.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1939, Bontempelli's Fascist Party card was revoked.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Confinement to Venice followed, meaning that Bontempelli could neither publish nor leave the city for a year. When the war was fully engaged, Bontempelli was again judged an anti-fascist; he narrowly dodged police raids. The author made a considered decision at that time to change his political allegiance, as did many other intellectuals with fascist pasts who managed to redeem themselves.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> When the war ended, under the banner of the Popular Front Bontempelli ran for the senate of the newly minted republic and won. After an unsuccessful defense in Senate hearings, Bontempelli was unseated for his past exaltation of fascism.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>How did this form of political activism fit with the fiction and literary criticism? Bontempelli's contemporaries already questioned how he could claim to be a fascist and yet fall short of an unambiguous allegiance to nationalism. French was the language of his journal <span style="font-style:italic;">'900</span>. That in and of itself was suspect. A 1926 article in <span style="font-style:italic;">L'italiano</span> signed by "Torcibudella" wondered how <span style="font-style:italic;">'900</span> could be the "rassegna dell'imperialismo fascista" [review of fascist imperialism] and publish communists like Philippe Soupault.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Italian ultra-nationalist fascists charged Bontempelli with misguided Europeanism and a pro-urbanism inconsistent with the rural Italian cultural values they vociferously favored. Literary scholars have over the years been just as puzzled: some believe any discussion of the allegiance to fascism is reductive,<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> some that the fantastic, magical <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  qualities of his fictions helped Bontempelli distance himself from fascist policies, and still others that the writer actually cancels out political contents through fantasy.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Bart van den Bossche is one of a few scholars briefly to have examined analogies between the thinking put forward in <span style="font-style:italic;">L'avventura novecentista</span> and fascist discourse on historical "becoming" in terms of the imagination as mediation.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Shining the spotlight directly on Bontempelli's re-semanticization of realism along with his distinctive mixing of it with a discourse about magic can move the critical thought in a new direction.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>When Bontempelli moved to shift the sense of the word "realism" toward "realization," he did more than scorn a pre-fascist literary past judged putrid.24 Placing an emphasis on literary action moved the writer's charge away from furnishing any proscribed political content.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> A work of fiction does not in this view need to trumpet the victorious fascist March on Rome of 1922, the nation, or its history to be fascist.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Narratives governed by wondrous events of magical origin can legitimately prevail over nationalist themes and still represent the fascist epoch. Rather than depict political material per se, Bontempelli typically generates plots with marvelous, awe-inspiring events that interrupt social cohesion. Protagonists must skillfully negotiate obstacles if the impasse is to be resolved. For those actors who rise to the challenge of negotiating enigmas, an adjustment of their actions takes place, and this adjustment takes the form of a shift in identifications. When something super-human comes into being, subjectivities shift. Magic in Bontempelli has in fact little to do with escaping the political impingements on literary or artistic subject matter, as so many critics have maintained. Nor is it solely de-structuring.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Bontempelli deploys his magic to construct narrations that very clearly feature rival discourses and their corollary rival courses of action.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Given the centrality of this kind of narration in Bontempelli's fiction, it is not surprising that Bontempelli might gear up for action and take up his post as "Segretario." Bontempelli covered this office over several critical years (1926, 1927, 1928) in the history of fascist union movements. Union in this context refers to the fascist corporativist unions. These had original nuclei in fascist labor unions born before Mussolini came to power in 1922; after that date they evolved via a series of pacts (Palazzo Vidoni) and legislation (Carta del Lavoro [labor charter]) in tandem with changing political policies of the regime. These union groups were, obviously, not opposed to fascism, and any opposition unions were promptly dissolved. Fascist, corporativist unions were historically instrumental in disciplining workers' rights movements and in imposing limitations on dissent. They fostered specific ideological models: the <span style="font-style:italic;">sindacati</span> became, over several steps, the representatives of employee interests in the fascist government institution known as the corporation. These government bodies brought together in one institution representatives of owners and of unions, along sector lines. The arrangement was in theory supposed to increase productivity and wealth while promoting equality.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> The corporations had complex governing boards and legal statutes covered all aspects of their endeavors.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> (The authors and publishers corporation was governed by "Regio decreto 3 novembre 1927, no. 2138 "Approvazione del nuovo Statuto organico della Società Italiana degli Autori ed Editori.") Heading up the writers union conferred advantages: access to political leaders and government officials. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>One suspects that Bontempelli never would have been appointed to the high office of Secretary had he not been in Mussolini's good graces.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> We know from various sources the nature of some of the prestigious duties of the secretary and important officials, such as traveling domestically and internationally to lecture about Italian literature, delivering public literary readings, and adjudicating literary prizes. We also know that Bontempelli battled for improved copyright law and pension benefits. Bontempelli's ear was attuned to more than bread and butter issues though. It was attuned to the cultural politics of the regime.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Heading the writers union would not necessarily mean churning out propaganda or enforcing the censorship of literature —at least in the later twenties since artistic practice was not legislated in a strict sense of the word (secretaries in office in the thirties, including Filippo Marinetti, did promote the government's political line to a much greater extent<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a>). The interactions between art and the fascist state were more complex than that.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Nonetheless, the negotiation of difficult issues with higher officials was one of the secretary's charges, and Bontempelli continued to negotiate his own views with them even beyond the years of his official appointment at the writers union. To give one example, the Ministry of Culture discouraged the depiction of suicide in literature. A letter filed at the Ministry documents a request by Bontempelli to waive the policy for a short story that touched on self-inflicted death. A series of letters ends with Galeazzo Ciano's judgment that the topic was inopportune.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>If we move beyond the secretary's exact offices to study the writers union in the context of broader fascist union movements in the nineteen twenties, we start to see that Bontempelli's tenure as secretary came squarely during years when fascism was forcefully consolidating its political hold over the country. Scholars have rarely touched on the significance of Bontempelli's activism within this larger picture. Francesca Petrocchi fruitfully studied the fascist writers unions, but it was not her intent to examine individual writer's activities. Historians such as Renzo De Felice, Francesco Prefetti, and Marco Cuzzi have reconstructed the complicated history of fascist labor unions and the corporations without focusing, naturally, on literary history. Historical materials concerning the earliest part of Bontempelli's tenure as secretary are more plentiful than those from its final phase. We do not know, to date, why his tenure ended and in what year. Scholars have asserted with confidence, however, the importance of inter-class compromise to the conceptualization of the fascist model of labor relations in which unions (also organized in their own horizontal confederations of unions) interacted with employer confederations within the institutional context of the corporations. The conciliatory character of early fascist labor unions and, later, of the corporations as well, was championed by Mussolini himself.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> According to this ideology as it developed in corporativist directions, the working class does not aim for the conquest of state authority or the overturning of class domination. Unions and owners' organizations working together are supposed to overcome antagonism for the greater good, productivity, and the progress of fascism and the Italian people.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Fascist corporations, as regulatory organs of the economy, aspired to the realization of a state of equilibrium that would benefit the whole nation.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> The corporations were, additionally, thought capable of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  trumping both democracy and communism and were thought of as a Trojan horse in the battle to expand Italian fascism across Europe.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>The Italian peninsula was at the center of it all, just as the Mediterranean is etymologically in the "middle of lands." Corporativism, Italianicity, and Mediterranean-based Europeanism dovetailed. Italy's geographical position was presumed by Bontempelli to be the basis of richness and multiplicity. In that middle place, differing strands of history and multiple cultural influences join together in one people, the Italians. The supreme values of Italianicity were in this view its longevity and hybridity —the Greeks, Latinity, Christendom, and the new fascist era. Italianicity and the European were presumed to be coterminous, at least within certain parameters. (Northern Europe, along with the Mitteleuropean, was thought of as Mediterranean Europe's hinterland.) The corporations, significantly, were thought to be of a piece with fascist Italy's inclusiveness because they held together an amalgamation —this time of classes. (Let us not forget, though, that the <span style="font-style:italic;">sindacati</span> were <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> inclusive.) The notion of amalgamation ultimately provided a theoretical underpinning for a political model designed to nurture a universal fascist world order.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> This internationalist or universalist political perspective garnered the support of a larger number of thinkers, writers, and painters than one might imagine, given the familiar propensity to equate fascism solely with ultra-nationalism.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>The writer with whom Bontempelli initially co-edited <span style="font-style:italic;">'900</span>, Curzio Malaparte, was an important interlocutor in disputes over the desirability of modernizing labor relations and the geopolitical potentials of labor power. At issue, precisely, was the fit between workers, the people, Italianicity, Europe, the past and modernity. Malaparte argued, even before the corporativist structure was put in place, that fascist unions should facilitate a return to a civilizing Italian culture of yore.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> In that sense they would be anti-modern.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> The corollary was an anti-British, pro-Catholic stance we are familiar with —Protestant, industrialized Britain as the plutocratic octopus. Along with other fascist intellectuals, the editors of <span style="font-style:italic;">'900</span> also despised Lutheranism—their shorthand for Northern Europe and its misguided attachments to democratic rights and Bolshevism. Both were viewed as barbaric compared to a Mediterranean-centered culture that boasted Latinity in its genealogy. Bontempelli was probably the Italian writer who pushed hardest for a Mediterranean-based Europeanism, together with the partisans of the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Anti-europa</span> (against Europe as it was conceived of by the League of Nations and Pan-European movements). Part and parcel of this political vision, Bontempelli's union activism hinged on his belief in the historic destiny of Italian fascist culture to re-model Europe along Italian lines. Italy's role was exactly to bring equilibrium: "il suo ufficio di suscitatrice di civiltà e di equilibrante del mondo si rinnova d'èra in èra" [her function of giving rise to civilization and giving balance to the world is renewed era after era].<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> That general renewal could only function if Italy could itself be renewed in certain balanced ways. Like Malaparte, Bontempelli was no advocate of British and American models of modernity, with their excess of newness and materialism. Convinced that nationalism was inadequate to the task of renewal, Bontempelli advocated the view that Italy and Europe had to be conceptualized together, on the basis of an Italian tradition of extreme inclusiveness (in his view): "il suolo d'Italia amalgama rapidamente ogni incrocio" [the Italian soil rapidly amalgamates <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  every cross-fertilization].<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> Fascism as a political order was in Bontempelli's view an ideal container for the multiplicity he read backwards into his own culture.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Fascism alone, he boasted, had no fear of bastardization. Quite the opposite, fascism gained in power from it.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> Among the forms of amalgam Bontempelli theorized was, clearly, his inter-classism.</p>
<p>At this point it is necessary to examine Bontempelli's changing view of magic realism in the context of his changing perspective on unionism itself, since both underwent important transformations. In a chronological sense, Bontempelli's union activism coincided with activity of the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">'900</span>: in 1926 Bontempelli was on the national council of the "Federazione Nazionale dei Sindacati Intellettuali" [National Federation of Intellectuals' Unions] that had gathered up various unions, including the writers' union that he headed as secretary.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> An article in <span style="font-style:italic;">La fiera letteraria</span> that appeared in the fall of 1927 documents Bontempelli's appointment to the offices of secretary of the writers' union when it came (in a political regrouping) to belong to the "Confederazione nazionale dei sindacati fascisti" (not a corporation but a horizontal grouping of those unions that were allowed to enter into the corporations as the sole representatives of their laborers).<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> In an interview in the same issue, Bontempelli put forth his goal to remedy the marginalization of writers, due, he believed, to poor wages and isolation from politics. The fascist writers union is destined, we read, to make sure that writers' "costume" [custom] can be grafted onto the connective tissue of national politics.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> The centerpiece of his program was to extend the job classification "writer" beyond literati to anyone who writes for a living, such as technical writers and textbook authors. Archival documents in the "Segreteria Particolare del Duce" show that in March of 1928 he still was the "segretario nazionale." His title appears in a letter offering ex-officio membership in the writers' union to the Duce.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Three months later, in June of 1928, a major change began to unfold: the regime moved to weaken the corporativist unions when, at the time of a congress of the "Confederazione nazionale dei sindacati fascisti," high Fascist Party officials suggested the confederation had been unable adequately to move forward with the necessary elimination of class tensions.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> The over-arching organization of unions was disbanded within a few months and in its place six smaller national unions were born. One was the artists union, with branches for writers, painters, and musicians. Bontempelli remained at the head of the writers' section. According to Nicola Tranfaglia, the break-up of the Confederazione led to a significant loss of political influence. As a pressure group, the broad confederacy had achieved some labor reforms, though they were not comparable to what transpired in other European countries before Hitler. With the confederation's breakup, the regime gained greater political control by keeping corporativist unions technical and allowing industry owners to increase their power in labor relations within and beyond the corporations.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>It was in the summer of 1928, just when the confederation of unions was dissolved, that Bontempelli's journal <span style="font-style:italic;">'900</span> began its second series (it died in June of 1929). In 1928, Bontempelli was also at work composing his last novel (in his view) in the style of magic realism. The novel was <span style="font-style:italic;">Il io di due madri</span>, published in 1929. By 1930 already, the author had declared that the otherworldly and supernatural were to have <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  no place in his fiction. The novel he wrote according to the new premise was composed in the winter of 1930 and published in the spring of that year: <span style="font-style:italic;">Vita e morte di Adria e i suoi i [The Life and Death of Adria and Her Children</span>]. If the discourse of magic was discarded as a literary component, how did the realism qua realizing change? If the magic goes, does the practice of literary compromise change? How does a changing view of the value of corporativism affect magic realism as itself a compromise? A comparative analysis of the two novels suggests some answers and reveals some of the purposes of magic in this crucial period of literary history.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Il io di due madri</span> is a historical novel set in 1900. Bontempelli zeroed in on one modern, middle-class Italian family rife with conflicts that threaten its unity because an enigma envelops them. The novel tells the story of a miraculous eruption of the past into the present: in the park at Villa Borghese in Rome a seven-year old boy, Mario, spontaneously becomes a different boy. This second boy, Ramiro, is a revenant: he had died seven years earlier, in 1893. The boy comes to have two mothers: Arianna Parigi and the mother of the boy who had died, Luciana Veracina. The child represents a knot of enigma that no human being, it seems, can untie. The entire edifice of institutions that both defend the family and rely on it as a foundation collapses. The class system, the state, and the patriarchy break apart as all scramble in panic to re out what happened and what to do. One can only read this as an invective against the pre-fascist era enmeshed in a web of bourgeois institutions. I would like, though, to concentrate on the structuring of the plot and the system of characters in the novel in order to respond to an important question: Why does Bontempelli generate in the re of this ungraspable son not only a mystery but also a structural go-between, an intermediary who functions to articulate a series of fearful doublings in the novel that end up making the narration itself impossible to close or resolve?</p>
<p>In the action, one or the other family constantly grabs Mario/Ramiro to shuttle him physically across the city of Rome. The narrative architecture dramatizes, in its unending narrative tug-of-war over the boy, discourse systems at odds with one another. The narrative opens with the mysterious transformation of the child and then introduces a series of characters who must negotiate the doubleness and struggle for physical and psychological control over a helpless seven-year old caught in the juggernaut. The symbolic representatives of social institutions—family, class, the Catholic Church, the state justice system, and modern science to name the most important—all react forcefully to the enigma of Mario. Bontempelli systematically links textual characters to social identifications and demonstrates multiple interpellations on the part of an oppressive social order. Will rigid, unyielding social institutions be able to negotiate the magical transformation?</p>
<p>A crucial site of tension, the Parigi family is at loggerheads even within its tiny constellation. The narrative takes on mythic proportions as the author portrays a failed alliance at the center of a (he believes) quintessential societal institution, the Italian family in the years after Italy's political unification. The father, Mariano, is utterly unequal to the task of regrouping. At once domineering and complacent, he refuses to believe in the magical rebirth of a dead boy into his own son's body. A practical-minded <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  businessman who minimizes mystery and is always absent at crucial turning points, he obtusely defends his skeptical thinking and enlists like-minded men, scientists and doctors, who try to resolve the mystery with one form or another of purported rationality. Bontempelli made Mr. Mariano Parigi and his male cohort the weakest contenders in the race to solve the child's enigma.</p>
<p>Closer to truthfulness, if far from what Bontempelli considered positivist and defeatist realism, two women, the mothers, struggle to recognize and make something out of the crisis that grips them, and this is the case even though the two are opposites in terms of their social identifications. Arianna is a stolid housewife and Luciana is a free-spirited musician who travels between Rome and the seaside, is half-Austrian, and has conceived her son out of wedlock. Arianna resides in a well-to-do part of Rome that was urbanized after 1870 (Ludovisi) while Luciana lives first among the people, in Trastevere, and then at San Felice Circeo —the mythical home of the sorceress Circe —on bluffs overlooking the Mediterranean. Only unabated anguish draws the women into one another's worlds and into a compromise alliance. As a new family architecture emerges, the two women come to stand for unity in difference. Each knows that maternal love, which they think should be prime and indivisible, has been split irrevocably. Each recognizes that the other faces the destruction of a sacred bond that founds her being. As the plot advances, the two women will attempt progressively to join forces and ally themselves for the good of the child. The mothers decide that both will live with the boy, alternately in each other's homes.</p>
<p>In order to set up differences between the two women, which then have to be negotiated, the author uses the strategy of complicating gendering. The troubling of gender (and social) stability accumulates as the narrative unfolds, and while united by their anguish, the women retain differences in their degrees of (presumed) femaleness. Arianna remains all woman and all weakness, modesty, obedience, and tears —a <span style="font-style:italic;">mater dolorosa</span>. Without a son, she is physically broken and her heart gives out at the novel's end. Luciana becomes over the span of the novel (about two months) by contrast androgynous within the rigid system of gender identifications the novel presents. Critics have ignored the fact that any notion of development or <span style="font-style:italic;">Bildung</span> is connected only to Luciana, just as they have erred in thinking that the two mothers represent irreducible difference when in fact shared grief binds them. Luciana, a musician, is presented at the novel's beginning as independent, without a man at all —or even a boy, since her son had died seven years earlier. She is called both "la dominatrice" [female dominator] and a New Woman. She outsmarts the men in the novel, including her alienist. At one point, Mario's father has Luciana kidnapped, committed, and declared mentally incompetent for believing that her son has come back to life after seven years. He has her spirited away by carriage to a mental asylum where the alienist determines her cure: relenting. Luciana catches on that a cure will result in yet another death of Ramiro for her, and she counters his administrations: "che cosa vuol curare in me, dottore? . . . l'immaginazione?"  [what do you want to cure me of, doctor, my imagination?].<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> Luciana plots an escape from the asylum and climbs a tree with branches over the asylum's periphery fence; she spends a night there before she drops <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to safety and freedom. Meanwhile, Mario's father and the alienist are convinced that "è materialmente impossibile che sia uscita dal recinto" , "è certo, è matematico, che la scomparsa non è fuggita"  [it is materially impossible for her to have gone beyond the fence; it is certain, mathematically certain, that this vanishing lady has not fled]. An alliance of fools, in the form of the positivist doctor and the money-driven father, "non lo avrebbero mai immaginato che una signora sola, in cura psichica potesse scalare una quercia, strisciare lungo un ramo"  [could never have imagined that a woman alone, under psychiatric treatment, could climb an oak and slide out over a branch]. Only a supreme imaginative strength—or what Bontempelli thinks is supreme, i.e., a woman who could climb a tree—allows the heroine to negotiate her escape and set out again to struggle to reclaim her son. Luciana does something manly and unexpected, climbing, so that her gender identity appears in the novel as mixed and therefore strengthened. This gender mixing is reinforced several times, when Luciana drives a submissive fiancé to suicide and ultimately manages to bend the father who had had her committed to her will. Bontempelli intuits the recasting of gender roles in modernity, and he represents stronger females not so much as usurping male power as strengthened by their hybridity, or compromise, with maleness. These New Women become a reservoir for strong imagination that in turn suits them for action.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> That active trait is linked to divinity/magic so that Luciana, surrounded by an aura, undergoes a virtual apotheosis.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>The openness and hybridity of Luciana's identifications increases over the novel's span. The process moves into its final, most shocking (from Bontempelli's perspective) stage in her quasi-amorous encounter with the magical re of Solwanah, the seafaring "zingaro" ["gypsy," the term Bontempelli uses instead of Rom] who becomes her magical helper and vassal in love. An intense dialogue with Solwanah, set on the bluffs above the Mediterranean, produces additional strength and will to action in the woman. She learns about the gypsy's travels and that his mother ship has been prohibited from returning to Italy (anti-vagrant legislation directed at the Rom populations had been enacted in 1926, a historical fact reflected backward I presume to the earlier period). Ramiro is on that ship. Luciana determines that she must take an extreme step and join her child and the gypsies who are holding him for her. She plots with Solwanah to blow up the bluffs at San Felice Circeo, the site of her ex-fiancé's suicidal plunge to death. The plan is to abscond once the symbolic impingement of the past is exploded. Solwanah excogitates the complex plan, he starts to execute the grand action, and then he is accidentally dismembered himself in a horrific dynamite blast. Since Solwanah alone knows where the child and mother ship are, the boy is lost. Narrative closure is also stymied. Luciana remains alone and powerless at novel's end, despite the fact that she is the only character to have garnered strength through her (presumed) openness to hybridity. Bontempelli leaves his readers with the message that what Luciana is—an artist, a woman, a free woman, manly, open to otherness—was not enough to allow her to make something out of the enigma that was visited upon her. She remains bereft but at an advance compared to the other characters.</p>
<p>The character that nearly matches her in the potential for negotiating an action-oriented alliance with others is Solwanah himself. In this character as well, sexedness <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and gender identification do not completely correspond. His re is part of a pro gressive, gentle blurring of gender, class, ethnic, and racial lines that unfolds over the course of the book and tempers the early, too-neat separation of the novel's characters into female believers and male non-believers. Solwanah is a mildly androgynous re, making him an apt accomplice for and mirror to the forceful Luciana. Both stand allegorically for what Bontempelli supposes to be creative de-racination and a fertile split from established culture. In the case of Solwanah, the gypsy is made quintessentially mobile, hybrid, and open to change and flux through a fundamental stereotype the author puts into play and that appears in a number of painters in the magic realism current, as the 1928 painting "Zingari" ["Gypsies"] by Massimo Campigli demonstrates.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> [<a name="2-text" href="#2">re 2</a>] There a nude, nomadic, male re appears on a still white horse and two larger-than-life gypsy-women become res of magical doubleness and temporal transcendence. They read into the future—the cards on display —and yet they are placed in an ancient past, a landscape with a Roman aqueduct in terracotta colors of ancient memory. In Bontempelli's elaborate fantasy, Solwanah is of Finnish origin, blond, with sparkling, metallic eyes, tattoos on his arms, and the tattered, salt-laden clothes befitting his life as a wanderer on the seas.<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> He is a master traveling tinker and a stand-in in this plot for a fairy godmother. He alone has the equivalent of the magic wand when he pulls his disappearing act with the magical boy. Despite his male sexuation, Solwanah acts in the manner of the mothers, believing in the enigma of the boy's return from the dead. The author puts cross-gendering into play when he writes a narrative of male care-giving. Bontempelli creates a gypsy-character who can credibly (he thinks) take on the function of a being that, by his indeterminacy, can go between now-separated entities: mother and child. When the enchanted boy sets sail on the gypsy ship and disappears from the narrative, the enchanting tinker from across the waters becomes the intermediary to the intermediary—to the child who had once gone between the two mothers and their two worlds. When Solwanah dies, the means to negotiate enigma is lost.</p>
<p>The novel closes with Luciana sitting on rocks at the water's edge, looking out on a formless dawn seen paradoxically as closure and a seal:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Allora Luciana si mise a sedere sulla ghiaia al margine del mare. Il mare aveva ripreso a respirare, qualche spuma leggera salì a bagnare i piedi di Luciana, che non si mosse. Le costellazioni giravano sopra il suo capo nel nero morbido del cielo: . . . una dopo l'altra scendevano l'arco e andavano quetamente a posare nei neri letti dell'orizzonte, qualche onda piana si spinse a bagnare le gambe di Luciana, e si ritraeva. Luciana non sentiva, e lontano guardava. Le costellazioni ora si dissolvevano nell'aria impallidita; sotto l'alba il mare tornò immobile, liscio, bianco come una distesa di latte fino all'ultimo cerchio dove si chiude e suggella col cielo.<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>[Now Luciana sat down on the pebbles at the edge of the sea. The sea had resumed its rhythmical breathing. A light foam reached her feet, wetting them, but she didn't move. The constellations were making their rounds above her head in the soft black sky. . . . One by one, quietly, they descended the arc of heaven to take their rest in the dark bed of the horizon. Slowly, very slowly, waves began lapping at Luciana's legs, then pulling back. Luciana stared into the distance and felt nothing. Now the constellations were vanishing <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  into the fading night. At dawn the sea was a flat, gleaming expanse, white as milk, all the way to the furthest curve which encloses and seals it to the heavens.]<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p>How should this ending be read? Might proximity to the sea suggest contact with the enigmatic boy afloat somewhere on the mother ship, so that ending eases into futurity? Might cycles and continuity be predominant —night, dawn, and day —so that ending is temporary and ever surpassed by beginnings? Or might merging and dissolving into nothingness, the dropping of the constellations first into the sea's horizon and then the merging of starlight into daylight, be linked by Bontempelli less to questions about the interlocking of past, present, and future and linked more to questions about social solvency? When the stars in their conventional conrations sink into the horizon and disappear in a novel so focused on the potentials of compromise groupings, one might read this scene as pertinent to the dissolution or breakdown, symbolically, of social constellations that are the very subject of the book.</p>
<p>Is the dissolve of celestial bodies a sign that at a symbolic or allegorical level the constellations of yore are doomed and disappearing so that a new era will dawn? Are the 1929 readers of the novel and those that follow looking at the sunset and night of pre-fascist history, in which the state lost authority over the justice system, a too-skeptical church lost its credibility, patriarchy lost control over families, and all were impotent to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  move forward? If that is the narrative that has been rolled out by the author then, yes, we must be looking at an ending, since fascism followed and supplanted that world. The novel from this standpoint narrates in order to realize a critique of the past.</p>
<p>In somewhat perverse fashion, though, Bontempelli's novel undoes that specific critique. The text furnishes its readers over its entire extension too many examples of the continual and multiple failures and losses in that pre-fascist era and world. Enough negativity might impart the lesson that it was that historical period to have been deficient and to have required corrective action. Yet constant, unending stories of disaster and impotence together contribute to the sense that no action could counter that much failure. What political system could, old or new, pre-fascist or not, achieve a credible rehabilitation? What each subject owns has been ripped away. There is, additionally, no narrative closure in Bontempelli's emplotment. By not supplying a hard and fast closure to his narration of a pre-fascist world order, Bontempelli leaves open the potential for its repeated failings to infiltrate or contaminate a future that is not supposed to harbor it. When <span style="font-style:italic;">will</span> this story end? Where and how and among what parties can some mediation between endings and beginnings be realized?<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>In sum, one may read this novel as a reflection on how social constellations ought —like corporations in fact —to be empowered. Yet one may also read against the grain a denial of that imperative in the text's un-ending failures that reify loss. The author in <span style="font-style:italic;">io</span> worked hard to show failed compromise-into-alliance thereby suggesting that an opposite could come into being: successful compromise-into-alliance. To return to the Europeanism discussed earlier, the discourse of compromise could still be imagined as potentially generating a powerful position for the continent's citizens: Italo-centric, Mediterranean-based Europeanism. However, another tendency of the emplotment, repetition of failure and denial of closure, undoes what is supposed to be an ideological actualization.</p>
<p>The structural ambiguity risks becoming more than onto-political. If one considers this novel as itself an intertwining of the entities "magic + realism," this kind of literature and this novel itself may have failed to produce a powerful alliance of the component two strands, just as the social factions of <span style="font-style:italic;">io</span> failed effectively to join forces. What Bontempelli may not have known about his own novel as he wrote it was that he was narrating the ambiguities of magic realism itself. <span style="font-style:italic;">Il io di due madri</span> was Bontempelli's last novel in that style. He wrote a comparison of <span style="font-style:italic;">io</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Adria</span> that revolves around their uses of magic:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Tuttavia quel romanzo non era ancora la conquista definitiva. L'uomo e il mondo veduti come un miracolo e un mistero, tale è sempre stata la mia ansia. Ma nel <span style="font-style:italic;">io di due madri</span> uno degli elementi del mistero veniva ancora da un aldilà, che rimaneva in parte irresoluto e però mandava tra la luce qualche ingombrante ombra. Mi occorreva, in quello spazio translucido raggiunto in pieno con i migliori idilli. . . far vivere una umanità cui tutto il mistero e il miracolo venga dal di dentro; dalla sua passione, dal suo volere. . . .

<p>[However, that novel was not a definitive victory. I had always been anxious that man and his world be seen as a miracle and mystery. But in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Son of Two Mothers</span> one element of mystery still came from a beyond that remained unresolved; but that beyond cast an ungainly shadow in the light. In that trans-lucid space that I had achieved in my best idylls, I needed to bring alive a humanity whose mystery and miracle came from the inside, from passion and will. . . . This came to pass only with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Life and Death of Adria and Her Children</span>, which for this reason is my first novel, my first book. I begin now.]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Let us return briefly to Bontempelli's tenure as the head of the several avatars of the fascist writers union. His continued political activism in that institution suggests he considered there was a future for his theory and practice of political compromise—at least until the summer of 1928 when his broad Confederazione was split into six smaller entities and corporativist unionism was already losing power. Might Bontempelli have been disenchanted? Or, might he have, instead, believed that corporativist unions had outgrown their political usefulness, as the regime claimed, and had become an obstacle to the totalizing consolidation of power? More knowledge of Bontempelli's politic views in these years would help in answering the question and in understanding how those politics could have affected this author's and others' conceptualizations and practice of magic realism. What we do know for now is that when his writers' union lost agency just as the fascist regime was forcefully consolidating its power by various means, the novel Bontempelli next wrote did two things: it left aside discourse on magic and it sported a distinct narrative closure—making it quite different from <span style="font-style:italic;">io</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Vita e morte di Adria e i suoi i</span>, like <span style="font-style:italic;">io</span>, dramatizes a fractured genealogy and fragile family. Like <span style="font-style:italic;">io</span>, it also features the supposed degeneration of post Risorgimento Italy and more generally of modern European liberal democracy in the first fifteen or so years of the twentieth century. It shows the same ineffectual men and the same unimaginative upper middle-classes, hidebound by conformity and materialism. The protagonist Adria is an extraordinarily beautiful diva of upper middle class Roman society and a sartorial genius that locks her seamstresses in her personal atelier to work on secret fashion creations. Her hundreds of dresses, each worn once, hang color-coded in an immense hall. Her nightly high-style appearances at the Teatro Argentina are cause for monumental celebrations. The skilled, creative, womanly Adria is able to turn herself into a cherished, ritual object and thereby to found the stability of her cohort.</p>
<p>Her status as cult object begins to detract from her agency as a mothering subject though: Adria determines that motherhood damages her beauty and disturbs her steady devotion to a super-human, sublime mode of being. She decides that she will see her two children on Saturdays only, for a scant hour. The children's intense longing for Adria occupies a good deal of the novel thereafter. Five years after the dramatic suicide of an admirer, at age thirty, the diva determines she must retreat from society and family altogether because the myth of her otherworldly beauty risks destruction as she ages. Without its deity, her cult could disintegrate, and with it social cohesion. She must move to Paris. She walls herself up in a small home, retaining one personal servant and contact with others only through letters and telephone. What wreaks havoc in the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  narrative structure of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adria</span> is not, then, a miracle or magic. The narrative turns on an act of violent separation, as in <span style="font-style:italic;">io</span>, but this time it is the incomprehensible gesture of one mother. Some years later, Adria's old Parisian neighborhood is to be razed to make way for new buildings, so rather than being forced into the open, she places herself in the attic and lights herself on fire. This is a clear demise and a narrative closure. Adria's active withdrawal pre-empts the negotiation found in <span style="font-style:italic;">io</span>. There are no res of mediation in fact in this later novel. The husband dies of a heart attack at the piano. The son becomes a weakling and a drug addict. The daughter becomes a spy for the Italians in the war against the Austro-Hungarians and is shot by a firing squad.</p>
<p>Is Bontempelli unable <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> to people his novels with desperate, innocent offspring whose fates undo the author's plan to teach his readers that the abandonment of the past is an imperative? (He counts, of course, on the idea that conventional family is the quintessential site of social negotiation.) Bontempelli wants to show us a historical socio-political formation that had to go. There should be no regrets about losing an inadequate thing. Then we are shown children who just want their mother, are separated from her, an undergo trauma from which they cannot recover. A potentially healthy separation from her, a maturing, is shown to be impossible because their desire for Adria is buried in their psyches to fester endlessly. The undercurrent present in <span style="font-style:italic;">io</span> surfaces here as well: what culture and what subjects in what historical period would <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> grieve for the <span style="font-style:italic;">compromised</span> victims Bontempelli has written into his novels? If grief in the fictions is universal and unending, how can History as it moves into a fascist future undo the damage and trauma in any satisfactory way?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Adria</span>, as compared to <span style="font-style:italic;">io,</span> empowers a single character and treats the consequences of her actions on a small group. In the earlier novel, "magic" creates an ontological disturbance of epic proportions. The potential to enter into alliances and the failures of diverse groups to enter into compromise was larger than life. Bontempelli drops a discourse on magic in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adria</span> and thereby also affects both the subject matter and the emplotment tied to compromise found in <span style="font-style:italic;">io</span>. When he drops the "magic" in magic realism, clearly the formula for its own internal compromise has to change: realismas realizing starts to carry more weight and to dominate. The focus of the new novel moves to this single, act-driven protagonist, Adria. There is less multiplicity because of the focus on one will to act upon others. By the same token, there is less discourse on the need for compromise and alliance because of the lack of multiplicity. The new narrative structure in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adria</span> without the "shadow" of magic discharges Bontempelli's own attention to alliance-building according to a corporativist ideology. He shifts away from compromise and the negotiation of social difference. Interestingly, this slippage occurs when Bontempelli's corporativist unions were losing ground in the shifting conrations of political power that take place so strikingly in the late nineteen twenties—the years of Mussolini's consolidation of power and consensus. Since the fascist regime was already consolidated, why would Bontempelli in fact need to urge his 1930 readers to join into alliances? Fascism was finally ready to act as a totality. It was realized.</p>
<p>We know now that that power was all <span style="font-style:italic;">too</span> real. We know its consequences. We also know fascism failed. When fascism was defeated during World War II, Bontempelli vowed to try out political activism again, joining the Popular Front and the Left. He <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  won a senate seat in the new Republican Italy of 1948 but was quickly unseated for his fascist past. As in <span style="font-style:italic;">io</span>, the negotiation of endings carried on for Bontempelli un-endingly.</p>

Braun discusses Sironi's own distinctive "expressionist" depictions of workers together with his fascist aesthetics in "Expressionism as Fascist Aesthetic," <span style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Contemporary History</span> 31, no. 2 , 286-87. The ideologies of the two men, Sironi and Bontempelli, have common traits in that class is a dominant subject and that represented groups of classed people are frequent and significant. Their shared fascist ideology links the two. Bontempelli does not, however, favor the deforming portraits and perspectives that Braun identifies in the expressionist Sironi. His poetics of "compromise" also shuns extremes, so that sharp, deforming caricature and the grotesque are virtually absent, causing the work to differ in tone from other European magic realisms, such as the New Objectivity movement in Germany. The development of the latter predated Nazi rule, while instead Bontempelli's style evolved in tandem with fascist rule).</p></div>

<p>In Beatrice Wood's memoir, <span style="font-style:italic;">I Shock Myself</span>, the actress cum artist recounts the events that took place after the infamous Blindman's Ball on May 25, 1917. According to Wood, several attendees returned to Walter and Louise Arensbergs' apartment, en route to Marcel Duchamp's one-room studio, located above their salon at the 33 West 67<sup>th</sup> street building, which had <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  by 1915 become a key center of New York dada. Wood and Duchamp, together with Charles Demuth, Aileen Dresser, and Mina Loy, proceeded to wedge themselves into the narrow confines of the artist's single bed. Always the "host," remarked Wood, "Marcel . . . took the least space and squeezed himself tight against the wall, while I tried to stretch out in the two inches left between him and the wall, an opportunity of discomfort that took me to heaven because I was so close to him."<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> In the days that followed, Wood produced a small 8 ¾ x 5 ¾" watercolor sketch commemorating the intimate encounter, which she titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Lit de Marcel</span>  [<a name="1-text" href="#1">re 1</a>]. She sketched a number of impromptu pictures of the Arensberg salon, often naming the participants in attendance.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> But more so than in her other drawings, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lit de Marcel</span>'s indiscernible bodies tangle together; colors blend and lines messily intersect in a mêlée of curvilinear forms. Of course, to characterize this exchange without qualification would be to romanticize the Arensberg circle as a space of limitless sexual openness, gender equality, and productive cooperation that no doubt idealizes and misrepresents historical fact. Indeed, during the course of that very same evening the British poet and provocateur Arthur Cravan, dressed in a bed sheet with a towel wrapped around his head, spent the night accosting women and demanding their phone numbers. Mina Loy recalls a night at the Arensbergs' when "King Dada and Colossus lolled about a divan in Walter's parlor, engaged in the privileged male sport of the evening which consisted of drawing their forefingers along the green stockings of the blond Countess stretched among the cushions."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> This particular event may in fact exemplify an act of sexual liberation rather than unequivocal sexism; yet, it is the typicality of this "privileged male sport" that should draw the reader's attention. More significant examples of misogyny in literary circles were commonplace: Ezra Pound wrote to John Quinn complaining that female editors had hijacked the literary scene in New York.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Yet Pound's frustration intimates the growing influence of women authors and editors such as Marianne Moore, the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, Mina Loy, Margaret Anderson, and Jane Heap. Although one must guard against facile celebrations of pluralism, the gatherings at the Arensberg apartment—and the social function of the salon in general—often facilitated progressive experiments in community and collective aesthetic exchange.</p>
<p>One historian of American salon culture remarks that "[o]f the three major New York salons" to flourish from roughly 1915 to 1925, "that of Walter and Louise Arensberg was the least known to the public and remains the least documented," but has since proven "the most important in terms of its long-range impact on cultural history."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Robert M. Crunden has in mind the salons of Alfred Stieglitz and Mabel Dodge, and along with the Stettheimer salon and those associated with the Harlem Renaissance, New York had arguably surpassed Paris and London as the prominent artistic center during the First World War. The Arensbergs played hosts to an international consortium of innovators in music, art, and literature, amassing what would become one of the finest private collections of avant-garde art. But more than that, the Arensberg salon came to denote a network of artists, patrons, publications, and events that together created the conditions for unparalleled interdisciplinary exchange.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> On a given night, Francis Picabia, Marcel Duchamp, and Joseph Stella could be seen cavorting with Mina Loy, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  William Carlos Williams, and Wallace Stevens. Members of the group edited, funded, and contributed to such "little magazines" as <span style="font-style:italic;">Rogue, Others, 391</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Blind Man</span>. Although the salon is better known for the visual artifacts that adorned the walls of the Arensberg apartment, a hugely important contribution to modern poetry began to take shape among a transatlantic group of poets.</p>

<p>Early meetings at Grantwood would give focus to a disparate group of painters and poets that included W. C. Williams, Alfred Kreymborg, Mina Loy, Wallace Stevens, Walter Arensberg, Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp, Helen Hoyt, and Maxwell Bodenheim, among others. "It doesn't sound exciting," Williams said later in his autobiography, "but it was. Our parties were cheap—a few drinks, a sandwich or so, coffee—but the yeast of new work in the realm of the poem was tremendously stirring" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AW</span> 136). In 1915, the little colony at Grantwood anticipated the carnivalesque interactions of the Arensberg salon, creating what Crunden suggests was a "semi-mythical ur-source for inspiration, high-jinks, sexual liberation, and alcohol-fueled feelings of mateship."<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Despite the seeming recklessness of these parties, such gatherings also occasioned important shifts in the "realm of the poem": <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued"><span style="font-style:italic;">Others</span> magazine emerged from these meetings under the editorial directorship of Kreymborg, but rather than inaugurate a movement, the publication gave voice to a set of disparate attitudes towards the poem. Kreymborg echoes the distinction between the poets of New York dada and imagism in London: certainly they shared a common interest in vers libre, a rejection of ornament, and a preference for verbal concision, but the often erudite subject-matter of Pound's verse, his insistence on Greek, Provencal, and Chinese models seemed "too remote from our lives."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Kreymborg's shift towards social experience is crucial. If the New York dadaists opted for a different poetic model, then equally distinct was the model of community they practiced. The Arensberg circle had no single manifesto, no set principle imposed on the work of its members; yet, it would be inaccurate to suggest that it lacked a communal organization or structure. Jean-Luc Nancy's notion of the mêlée is instructive in this regard: between the rigidity of inflexible hierarchies and the absence of structure altogether is the possibility of a flexible, semi-autonomous set of social relationships that neither erases individual creativity nor falsely insists on the romantic deification of genius.</p>
<p>What I am interested in exploring in this study is the relationship between the communal practices at the Arensberg salon and the aesthetic practices they employ in their writing. The influence of New York salon culture on the work produced by its participants is, perhaps, more explicitly apparent in the visual arts. Duchamp's collaboratively produced readymades, certain of Francis Picabia's "machine drawings," Florine Stettheimer's "Group paintings" and her sister Carrie's dollhouse constructions, George Biddle's lithographs, and the group sketches of Beatrice Wood and Clara Tice all variously comment upon the social relationships of the group and the communal production of art. Yet, I will argue that the social space of the salon influences poetic experimentation as well, creating the conditions in which poets began to explore writing techniques that privilege dialogic exchange over the monologic voice, replacing the politics of selfhood with representations of a communal subjectivity. However, just as Williams and Kreymborg indicate, there was no pre-ordained principle guiding the members of the Arensberg circle; these poets chose to engage with the social circumstances that influenced their work in a variety of ways. For this reason, I will make reference to various writers, but I will focus on Mina Loy's verbal collage as an exemplary poetic practice that brings the communal experience of the salon into the poem.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">I.</h1>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Social Production of Art</span>, Janet Wolff lucidly articulates the significance of institutional structures in shaping artistic practice: "[e]verything we do is located in, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and therefore affected by, social structures. It does not follow from this that in order to be free agents we somehow have to liberate ourselves from social structures and act outside them." Conversely, she argues, "the existence of these structures and institutions enables any activity on our part, and this applies equally to acts of conformity and acts of rebellion."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Lawrence Rainey has argued along similar lines, noting that the denunciation of the so-called "professionalization" of the arts because of its support either by the academy or government funding bodies during the latter part of the twentieth century is predicated on a nostalgic and wholly inaccurate view of modernism—one that erroneously constructs Marinetti's oft-cited mantra, "words in freedom," as an equally true assertion regarding their modes of creative production and dissemination.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Wolff's concept of an "enabling institution" changes the fundamental question about the nature and function of artistic communities. If one begins from the premise that all art is situated within economies of production, dissemination, and reception, at issue then is not whether one obeys or opposes institutions—since there is no getting outside of the structures that frame artistic work. Rather, historicizing salon culture requires one to ask how this central institution in the production of modern art and literature enables and informs the aesthetic practice of its members.</p>
<p>Scholars such as Emily Bilski and Emily Braun have recently sought to document and theorize the origins and development of salon culture, from its emergence in seventeenth-century France to a variety of early twentieth-century cultural centers. It is important to remember that salon culture differs significantly from era to era, and its signature egalitarianism, diversity, and gender equality changes tremendously depending on the salon in question. Nevertheless, Bilski and Braun provide an invaluable typology, both for its concision and imagery:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Strictly speaking, salons, or 'at-homes', occurred weekly, on a <span style="font-style:italic;">jour fixe</span>, on the same day, at the same time. . . . Invitations, if needed, were sent. . . . Either midday dinner or evening supper was served, although a formal meal was not the focus of activity. Salon sociability prospered, instead, on flexible seating arrangements—ad hoc pairs and small clusters, open circles for the enjoyment of a performance—save for the commandeering centrality of the saloniere, who often presided on a daybed or divan. . . . [A] successful salon depended on a core group of habitués, a combination of close friends and persons of renown. The last, along with the hostess herself, gave the salon its exclusive appeal.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">A flexible arrival time, the presence of food, a casual seating plan, and the matriarchal re of the hostess, along with a heterogeneous array of personalities she brings together, and, most importantly, vigorous dialogue, affords an apt characterization of the salon's principal conventions. Notice also that the space of the salon is gendered feminine. Being that the purpose of these gatherings was to facilitate "the negotiation of difference among strangers . . . [t]he ethics of salon reciprocity banned aggressive behavior in the pursuit of mutual tolerance, and women—perceived as having greater equanimity than men—were expected to take the lead."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Despite the salon's commensurate rise amid declarations of Enlightenment universality, women's exclusion from participation in public institutions continued long after the collapse of aristocratic and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  monarchical rule, making the salon a privileged space in which female res negotiate the entrance of public discourse into private spaces. Significantly, the Arensberg salon lacked a matriarchal re like Gertrude Stein, Mabel Dodge, or A'Lelia Walker; instead, the married tandem of Walter and Louise acted in conjunction as curator and lender. Historians admit that Louise Arensberg's quiet demeanor makes her contribution to the salon less evident, but what is clear enough is that Louise's inheritance comprised a vast majority of the couple's wealth, and any purchase Walter wished to make required her approval. It is perhaps also relevant that Loy's verbal portrait of the Blindman's Ball is titled "O Marcel . . . Otherwise I Also Have Been to Louise's," referencing only one proprietor of the salon. Nevertheless, what is most intriguing about the form the salon takes is its "built-in" refusal of inflexible dogma: arrival times are flexible not precise, seating arrangements are unregimented but not sporadic, the hostess is a mediator but not an impresario, conversation is spontaneous but not incoherent. Refusing bureaucratic rigidity and pandemonium in turn, the salon strives to create a permeable, manifold, and flexible collective. One finds greater success using gerundives to describe its social dynamic—clustering, networking, mediating. And just as the salon mixes the public and private, it privileges neither the individual nor the group. It cultivates a notion of collectivism that neither erases nor speaks on behalf of the subject. Bilski and Braun again provide an apt assessment: "Opinion evolved through collective voices; it was not dispensed in prepackaged formulas."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>This last assertion elicits a useful comparison between two interrelated modernist institutions: the salon circle and the avant-garde movement. One of the distinct features of the modern salon was its role in promoting and disseminating avant-garde art and ideas. Yet the salon's social function differed in significant ways from the types of collective action that have since become synonymous with the historical avant-gardes. Renato Poggioli's foundational study, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Theory of the Avant-Garde</span>, goes furthest to articulate the movement's organization and historical development. Its chief distinguishing trait, according to the Italian critic, is that, unlike the concept of a "school," "movement" is a "term which not only the observers, but also the protagonists, of that history use" to describe a "group of artists intent on a common program."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> The group is ultimately defined "<span style="font-style:italic;">against</span> something or someone," governed by a synthesis of activism and antagonism: "we ultimately see that, in the febrile anxiety to go always further, the movement and its constituent human entity can reach the point where it no longer heeds the ruins and losses of others." Although agonism has complex associations with Greek, Christian, and Romantic traditions, "avant-garde agonism" refers to an extreme form of antagonism, an affirmation of "self sacrifice" by a "collective group" on behalf of the principles it advances.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> In contrast with futurism, imagism, or vorticism, collective formations among the New York salons seemed to lack the pre-determined aesthetic principles that guide the movement's teleological and programmatic logic, nor do these communities typically advocate the same combative rhetoric or hierarchical organization. Ezra Pound, for instance, made no secret of his opposition to Amy Lowell's proposal "to turn 'Imagism' into a democratic beer-garden."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> And while André Breton is famous for excommunicating misbehaved surrealists, perhaps no one puts the question of a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  group's internal power hierarchy more succinctly than Wyndham Lewis in <span style="font-style:italic;">Blasting and Bombardiering</span>: "I concluded that as a matter of course some Romantic re must always emerge, to captain the 'group.' Like myself! How otherwise could a group get about, and above all <span style="font-style:italic;">talk</span>. For it had to have a mouthpiece didn't it?"<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> It is precisely this "talk," this generative collision of multiple voices, that the salon space seeks to make possible. Of course, the salon and the movement are not to be understood as categorically separate concepts; clearly they have a complexly intertwined history. My intention here is simply to problematize Poggioli's now canonical definition in order to reflect more accurately the complexity and diversity of communal practices during the most productive years of high modernism.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no doubt that the Arensbergs' salon could be both elitist and decadent (their exuberant parties were perhaps a prelude to the Roaring Twenties). Furthermore, Rainey's contention that modernist cultural production is enabled by a pre-modern socio-economic system of patronage (albeit masquerading as investment capitalism) is equally effective for describing Marinetti's promotion of futurism and the Arensbergs' accumulation of dadaist art. Despite its opposition to avant-garde agonism, the salon's cultivation of intellectual reciprocity is undeniably bound up with the bourgeois sphere that fostered the institutional development of both it and the avant-garde movement. It is important to remember, however, that subversive political action can sometimes materialize within conservative institutions and consequently transform them. Just as seventeenth- and eighteenth-century salons replaced feudal and religious paradigms of power with secular forms of class stratification, they also capitalized on the Enlightenment value of universal equality in order to achieve greater freedoms for women; so too, modernist poets and painters continued to experiment with alternative modes of collective experience within the social space of the salon.</p>
<p>By 1918 Mina Loy had already discerned the crucially important role of the salon in forming alternative communities. In "International Psycho-Democracy," a manifesto penned just after the First World War while the author was waiting for Arthur Cravan in Buenos Aires, she writes: "Most movements have a fixed concept towards which they advance, we move away from all fixed concepts in order to advance."<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Although Loy does not specify who belongs to this "we," her subsequent invitation to "Make the world your <span style="font-style:italic;">Salon</span>" demonstrates the influence such gatherings had on her political thought. "Our party," she proclaims, seeks a "new system of Experimental Ideative Exchange," wherein "we make the experiment of a 'collectivity' . . . influencing our era by right of the merits of our (collective) personality."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> A document less frequently cited by scholars than her "Feminist Manifesto" and "Aphorisms on Futurism,"<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Loy clearly indicates that what is at stake is a concept of community. Years earlier, in 1913, Loy described her "conversion to Futurism" in a letter to Mabel Dodge, but her initial fascination with Marinetti's liberation of the word also brought skepticism of his gender politics.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Loy rejected his disingenuous explanation of the oft-quoted dictum calling for the "scorn of woman,"<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> in which the impresario insisted that he meant by "woman" the quaint Victorian norms that Loy herself opposed.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>25</sup></a> The eminent scholar and Loy's biographer Carolyn Burke observes that Loy's tract was written at approximately the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  same time she published a series of satires on the futurists, including a poem called "Lions' Jaws," which features a particularly noxious and verbose group calling themselves the "Flabbergast Movement." Although they are careful to guard their "spiritual integrity against the carnivorous courtesan" in public,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>the Flabbergasts<br>blaze from obscurity<br>to deny their creed in cosy corners<br>to every feminine opportunity<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">By the time Loy became an active participant in the Arensberg circle, she came to reject futurism not only for its explicit sexism but also because of the rigidly hierarchical community it practiced. The salon, alternatively, offered a more open and flexible system of collaboration and exchange. In the introduction to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Last Lunar Baedeker</span>, Roger L. Conover accurately contends that "the idea of an institution like the Iowa Writing Program or a magazine like <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span> becoming a broker of poetic reputations in America scandalized her,"<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> but she also became increasingly suspicious of facile declarations of individualism. Her imperative in "Aphorisms on Futurism" to "live in yourself"<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> was gradually discarded for a decidedly more complex conception of "collective personality." Loy was clearly suspicious of institutions that hindered creative practice, but equally receptive to those that enabled her work.</p>
<p>What requires further explanation is the influence of this experiment in "collectivity" on the production of art and literature among members of the Arensberg circle. The salon is an institution that dates from the seventeenth century, and so it is not properly speaking a product of high modernist culture. What distinguishes the modernist salons in New York, and the Arensberg circle in particular, is the attempt made by a community of artists and poets to conflate art and life by integrating the social dynamic of the salon, its communal practices, into the process of artistic construction.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">II.</h1>
<p>In his <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span>, William Carlos Williams recalls the first time he attended an Arensberg soirée at Mina Loy's invitation. They were to meet Arthur Cravan, whom Loy would later marry:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>. . . I was a bit late and the small room was already crowded—by Frenchmen mostly. I remember, of course, Marcel Duchamp. At the end of the room was a French girl, of say eighteen or less, attended by some older woman. She lay reclining upon a divan, her legs straight out before her, surrounded by young men who had each a portion of her body in his possession which he caressed attentively, apparently unconscious of any rival. Two or three addressed themselves to her shoulders on either side, to her elbows, her wrists, hands, to each finger perhaps, I cannot recall—the same for her legs. She was in black lace gown fully at ease. It was something I had not seen before. Her feet were being kissed, her shins, her knees, and even above the knees, though as far as I could tell there was a gentleman's agreement that she was not to be undressed there.</p>
<div class="attrib">(AW, 140-41) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">It is likely that Williams is describing the same event that Loy recounts in <span style="font-style:italic;">Colossus</span>. Always resentful of what he perceived was the standard perception of him as parochial "yokel," the Rutherford native was undoubtedly both fascinated and intimidated by the subversive sexuality and cosmopolitanism of the salon. Beatrice Wood recounts a similarly impressionable visit to the apartment: "walking into the incredible home I caught my breath, suppressed a giggle, and sat down in a state of shock. One by one I confronted each disconcerting image as it shrieked out at me." She remembered in particular Matisse's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mlle Yvonne Landsberg</span> , which she described as a "most awful . . . outlandish woman with white streaks—little daggers—surrounding her entire body." Nearby she saw a Brancusi sculpture "that shot up in the air out of nowhere and made me uncomfortable. Scattered throughout the room were works by Picabia, Gleizes, Braque, and Sheeler, African carvings and pieces from a mixture of periods. It made my head spin in disbelief."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> The iconoclasm and unabashed sexuality of the works she encountered would prove a pivotal juncture in Wood's personal attempt to cast off the bourgeois lifestyle imposed on her by family.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> But moreover, the lack of organization—the "mixture"—of period, genre, and style elicits the young artist's astonishment, as the familiar categories of logical sequence and arrangement become muddled. Recalling <span style="font-style:italic;">Lit de Marcel</span>'s mêlée of mixed parts, Stein's observation, "why is there the resistance in a mixture,"<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> serves as a question that Wood surely would have had to ponder in order to produce such a work.</p>
<p>Examination of the visual art produced during this period indicates a keen interest in the social dynamic of the salon. Although not directly affiliated with the Arensbergs' gatherings, Florine Stettheimer's experimental group portraiture is instructive in this regard. In the painter's <span style="font-style:italic;">La Fête à Duchamp</span>  [<a name="2-text" href="#2">re 2</a>], a host of Arensberg regulars congregate for the occasion of Duchamp's thirtieth birthday celebration on a picturesque lawn, beneath several maple trees. Just above the lawn are three tables located on a terrace decorated with Japanese lanterns. Certainly the scene is tamer than the typical Arensberg affair and the style is decidedly more classical than the work of, say, Picabia, Man Ray, or Duchamp. The intrigue of this picture, however, is that Duchamp appears in it three times: once, arriving fashionably late with Picabia in his automobile; next, he is seen entering the party through an arbor; and once again, he is present among those guests sitting on the terrace, having just stood up to receive a toast in his honor.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Among those who immediately saw the significance of her work, Duchamp himself makes the most lucid observation in regards to what he calls her "group pictures." He elaborates in a letter addressed to all three Stettheimer sisters on May 3, 1919:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>'Group' is an excellent denomination for the kind of canvases you have been producing. There is nothing boring in "group" the way there is in "composition" and it's mobile, i.e. instead of seeing only a series of colored or formal situations on the canvas, you have to consider the effect of the different points joining up were they to change place, and what virtual multiplication through color would add to the mobility of these points. All this, not left to the imagination, but customized by optical requirements common to almost all individuals.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Duchamp is drawn to Stettheimer's attempt to represent movement, but also to the specific conration of the group as a set of dependent variables "joining up" with another in their changing relations. Without exception, the attendees are presented as a network: clustering, saluting, conversing, or exchanging items—they are neither autonomous, isolated individuals hierarchically organized, nor are they an incoherent mess of bodies. There is no question of Duchamp's centrality within New York's artistic circles, but unlike the megalomania of an F. T. Marinetti, Ezra Pound, or Wyndham Lewis, who each sought to fix the hierarchy of power within the movements they founded, the charismatic French artist is best described as omnipresent, rather than dictatorial. Upon arriving in New York, Duchamp had famously professed to one interviewer: "I came over here not because I couldn't paint at home, but because I hadn't anyone to talk with."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Representations of him depict a re who keeps others in flux rather than fix them in check. As a commentary on the New York dada community, the picture privileges two crucial and interrelated tropes of a variety of New York dada visual work: dynamic representations of the group and a challenge to the autonomy of the self. <span style="font-style:italic;">La Fête à Duchamp</span> chimes with the group portraits of Beatrice Wood, but it also shares qualities with certain of Picabia's "machine drawings" that graphically plot a set of artists in relation to one another,<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> while the depiction of a multiplicitous, omnipresent Duchamp is reminiscent of Man Ray's multiple photographs. Taking Stettheimer's group paintings as representative of experiments in portraiture, a similar emphasis on networks of communal artistic production becomes evident in decidedly different kinds of art by members of the Arensberg circle.</p>

<p>Indeed, one can discuss this exchange as a key feature of the readymades as well. The proto-conceptual work for which Duchamp is best known is often discussed in debates about capitalism's object fetishism, the conflation of art and life, appropriative strategies of art, and definitions of authorship more generally. But decidedly less is said about the readymade as a collaborative or communal art form. Consider that Duchamp experimented with co-authorship on several projects, including <span style="font-style:italic;">With Hidden Noise</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Tu M'</span> , and <span style="font-style:italic;">Men Before the Mirror</span> (c. 1920).<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Even the infamous <span style="font-style:italic;">Fountain</span> is arguably a collaborative project.</p>
<p>The story of <span style="font-style:italic;">Fountain</span> is legendary and now reproduced in virtually every history of modern art. Variations of the story typically include the following details: Duchamp is said to have purchased a urinal, which he placed on its back presumably to look like a fountain, and submitted the sculpture to the Society of Independent Artists annual exhibition under the pseudonym, R. MUTT. The Independents comprised an eclectic group of artists, including its president and realist painter, William Glackens, along with more experimental artists Man Ray, Joseph Stella, and Duchamp himself. The organization, whose self-professed mandate was to promote a radically democratic forum for art, championed a simple principle: "no jury, no prizes." Upon seeing the submission, George Bellows shook his fist in rage, while Arensberg fiercely defended its inclusion in the exhibition. An emergency meeting was called among the board of directors, with two clearly delineated factions quickly emerging. Arensberg, John Covert, Duchamp, Man Ray, Morton Schamberg, and Joseph Stella defended the submission, while Bellows, Glackens, Rockwell Kent, Charles and Maurice Prendergast, and John Sloan rejected it. In the end, <span style="font-style:italic;">Fountain</span> lost the decision by a narrow margin to the more conservative committee members. Glackens famously said to the press, "it is, by no definition, a work of art,"<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> while Arensberg and Duchamp promptly resigned from the board of directors in protest.</p>
<p>An interesting (and sometimes ill-considered) facet of the story is the confusion surrounding the urinal's purchase. Scholars are divided on the question of who actually obtained the object from the J. L. Mott Iron Works Company. Although some assume it was Duchamp, others such as Crunden claim that the artist selected the item and Arensberg and Stella (both of whom were committee members of the Society of Independent Artists) purchased it on his behalf. Further complicating the issue, Duchamp wrote eagerly to his sister Suzanne the day after the exhibit opened: "A female friend of mine, using a male pseudonym, Richard Mutt, submitted a porcelain urinal as a sculpture. . . . I handed in my resignation and it'll be a juicy piece of gossip in New York."<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> The "female friend" in question is most likely Louise Norton, whose name emerges again in a letter Charles Demuth sent to the critic Henry McBride, hinting that if he wished to learn more about the work, he should contact Duchamp at his home, or Richard Mutte [sic] at "'9255 Schuyler,'" the address of one Louise Norton.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Arensberg's spat with Bellows makes it likely that he was aware of Duchamp's intentions. It is no coincidence that the committee members siding with Duchamp all had ties with the Arensberg circle, nor that Louise Norton was among the first to defend the aesthetic merit of <span style="font-style:italic;">Fountain</span> in an article published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Blind Man</span> along with <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  a photograph of the sculpture and various other essays and creative work indebted to French artists. And as various other works by Duchamp during this period confirm, the artist was experimenting with collaboration. Just as <span style="font-style:italic;">With Hidden Noise</span> required the discretionary participation of his patron and <span style="font-style:italic;">Tu M'</span> integrated a professional's hand into the work, so too the production of <span style="font-style:italic;">Fountain</span> involved unidentified factory workers in its production, possibly Arensberg and Stella in its selection, and various members of the salon in its marketing to the public. What <span style="font-style:italic;">Fountain</span> constitutes, then, is the complex network of exchange it took to produce the work and circulate its (potential) meanings. Notice that if authorship is problematized, <span style="font-style:italic;">Fountain</span> achieves this end not by the vague erasure of authors, but by their multiplication—by many "hands" entering into the communal production of art. There is no question Duchamp had orchestrated the event to test the democratic commitment of the Society's members. Glackens's hypocritical assertion that <span style="font-style:italic;">Fountain</span> did not qualify as art merely augmented precisely the debate Duchamp's readymades promise. But consider as a final point that which a fountain and urinal have in common, or rather the implied relationship between these objects. A fountain dispenses water; a urinal ultimately receives it. This may only call attention to a cruel joke about the tautologous nature of meaning, or that art amounts to "piss"; or possibly it positions the human subject as a conduit for the fluid exchange of ideas. Either way, <span style="font-style:italic;">Fountain</span> bears testament to the communal manufacture of a debate regarding the definition of authorship as a collaborative activity.</p>

<p>In much the same spirit that Beatrice Wood commemorated the festivities at the Arensberg salon through group portraiture, Francis Picabia immortalized the milieu of a late-night social gathering in a short poem entitled "Grandes Filles et Grands Hommes Chez Arensberg" ("Big Girls and Great Men At the Arensbergs'"). Composed of four verbally compact six-line stanzas, each one is organized according to a distinct refrain. Here are the final two stanzas:</p>

<p>Written on hotel stationary in 1917 (the same year as Wood's <span style="font-style:italic;">Lit de Marcel</span>), Naumann observes that the refrain is "a relatively rigid structure that Picabia might have employed in order to suggest the regularity and dependability of these evening gatherings."<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Neither is it irrelevant that the refrain is a typical feature of folk ballads, and generally accompanies ritual celebrations or communal labor. The poem catalogues the night's enjoyment of eating, dancing, music, and games, amid a disorganized jumble of "girls sitting on the floor," "leaning poses," and the "patron" who "goes wherever he wants."<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Interestingly, Picabia employs the refrain in a poem that is otherwise composed in non-metrical, free-verse lines. But perhaps this juxtaposition of rigid form with loose expression typifies Picabia's subject matter aptly: the salon itself functions according to precise rules of engagement that paradoxically enable its Dionysian abandon.</p>
<p>In her excellent study, <span style="font-style:italic;">Irrational Modernism: A Neurasthenic History of New York Dada</span>, American art historian Amelia Jones notes Picabia's aversion to the ongoing war and his subtle suggestion that "the absence of soldiers gave the New York avant-garde a kind of 'purity.'"<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Indeed, Picabia had been called upon for duty by the French army during the outset of war on the continent, but managed (through one of his wife's connections) to procure a job as a general's chauffeur and was later sent on a mission to obtain sugar in Cuba.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> Subsequently, he abandoned his post and left for New York. Michel Sanouillet recounts that the artist was instantly "seduced by this atmosphere of insouciance and friendship. . . . Picabia forgot all: his mission, the battlefields, equally his military situation and the punishment that he would incur."<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> Alfred Stieglitz is more frank still, outlining Picabia's position on the war in a letter to Marie Rapp Boursault, dated July 23, 1917: "He is naturally anti-War—anti-Flags—&amp; anti-nationality."<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> The structured play of the salon posed an enticing alternative to battle.</p>
<p>But if this brief poem affords a telling glimpse of the nonchalant camaraderie Picabia found so inviting at the Arensberg apartment, the last stanza's refrain provides a crucial statement on the significance of friendship. "In the studio of my friends" is a decidedly awkward grammatical construction in either English or the original French and can only be taken as a metaphor that conflates aesthetic and social space—that is, the space of artistic work and the space of social interaction. It is not clear whether <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Picabia is aware that "stanza" is an Italian word that originally denotes a "stopping-place" (in the sense one might think of a "way station") and gradually evolves to mean a "room" in modern usage. He is nonetheless preoccupied with the apartment as a source of affiliation, positing the social environment of the salon as a laboratory of creative production.</p>
<p>The creative possibilities of community and collaboration are evident in writings by various poets associated with the salon. Mina Loy, for one, had set sail for New York in October of 1915 from her home in Florence, and after only a few months in the city, she made acquaintance with Allan and Louise Norton's <span style="font-style:italic;">Rogue</span> circle, attended the <span style="font-style:italic;">Others</span> gatherings at Grantwood, and became a regular at the Arensbergs' apartment. By late February 1917, she was chosen as the quintessential "New Woman" and profiled in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Evening Sun</span>. It was at this time she guest-edited an issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Others</span>, in which her <span style="font-style:italic;">Love Songs</span> first appears, and began collaborations with Duchamp in editing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Blind Man</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Rongwrong</span>. The seemingly endless flurry of projects culminated in her participation in the group readings at the Society of Independent Artists Exhibition. Needless to say, her collaborations at this time were numerous.</p>
<p>During the time she attended the Arensberg salon, her poetry consisted mainly of experimental lyrics, odes, satires, and verbal collages, and her subject matter frequently addressed the people around her. A poem such as "Gertrude Stein" demonstrates Loy's indebtedness to the American expatriate:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Curie<br>Of the laboratory<br>Of vocabulary<br>She crushed the tonnage<br>Of consciousness<br>Congealed to phrases<br>To extract<br>A radium of the word<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Surely Stein's verbal portraits had considerable influence on Loy's departure from conventional modes of representation. But moreover, like Picabia's studio, the laboratory is a communal workspace, and language a common element. Stein's poetic practice, like radium, simultaneously destroys and creates, emanates and animates the work of others. Loy's most well-known poem, "Love Songs to Joannes," is likely a composite portrait of her various failed love affairs, assembling partial subjects that comprise a serialized panoramic of sexual and emotional encounters.</p>
<p>Just as Loy had declared in her manifesto "International Psycho-Democracy" that her intent was to conduct "experiment[s] in 'collectivity,'" her work during this time is characterized by a shift toward collagic group-portraiture—a technique that might be understood as a textual variant of Stettheimer's "group pictures" or Beatrice Wood's sketches of intersecting bodily forms.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, "O Marcel . . . Otherwise I Also Have Been to Louise's." In this poem, Loy constructs a language environment of multiple voices and phonic <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  detail—in a sense, spatializing a labyrinthine textual milieu that the reader is invited to enter and explore. The following passage provides a representative excerpt of the carnivalesque linguistic play of the poem:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>. . . —will you bring the bottle? Really, have I? Which way? Oh did I? WHEN? Too much? You are abusing myself. No, you would not—Did you ask Demuth about it? Anything you like, would I? Ough Naow? Of course not? Yes I do. I used to do that because I am perfectly sober now . . . I will give you some paper Mina and keep silent to give you a rest. Oh! I will give you some paper all the same. Very much. He said to me, we will toss whether you resign or I resign—a very old French story about 'the English man must shoot first.' She has a pencil in her hair—very impressionistic. You know you should have some salt on your hair it's so nice—because? Nothing—it's music. Ah this is, this is, this is, is IT.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Consisting of multiple fragments of dialogue, the poem was written to commemorate the infamous Blindman's Ball and published along with Duchamp's <span style="font-style:italic;">Fountain</span> in the final issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Blind Man</span>. Held at Webster Hall, 119 East 11th Street, in Greenwich Village, advertisements for the event promised an "Ultra Bohemian, Pre-Historic, Post Alcoholic"<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> affair to celebrate the magazine's commitment to experimental art. Featured performers at the Ball included Michio Ito, the famous Japanese dancer, and Beatrice Wood, who performed a Russian folk dance. Many wore costumes, including Loy, who came dressed as a lampshade. Although critics typically focus on her poetry, Loy also worked as an artist and designer, producing paintings, mixed-media constructions, as well as furniture.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> Evidently, a preoccupation with group portraiture and the dwelling as social space constitutes a key feature of her art (e.g. <span style="font-style:italic;">La Maison en Papier</span> [1906], <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Amour Dorloté par les Belles Dames</span> [c. 1913], <span style="font-style:italic;">Communal Cot</span> [c. 1950], and <span style="font-style:italic;">Househunting</span> [c. 1950]). Equally unique are the objects she produced for commercial manufacture; one of which, "Globe Céleste," transforms a world globe into a lamp. Loy seems to literalize her evocation to make the "world" a "salon" by appropriating the common elements of a room and refashioning them as performative costume and artistic objects. It is as if the salon becomes the medium through which to light the world. Granted, lampshades and globes are objects found in any well-to-do New York household during this period, but it is at least clear that specifically domestic objects come to merit artistic value, in ways comparable to Duchamp's early readymades.</p>
<p>The reference to Duchamp in the title makes it likely that he is the one speaking (at least for most of the text). Loy's poem was later reprinted in a special issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">View</span> in honor of Duchamp, with the following explanatory note provided by the author:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>This was written at the Ball where I saved Marcel. With his robe afloat, the symmetry of his bronze hair rising from his beautiful profile, wavering as a flame, he was—actually—climbing a paper festoon hung from the top of the dome to the musicians' gallery.</p>
<p>To clarify his "subconscious" In Memoriam of that era—when my notes in "The Blind Boy" caused, in New York, a bewildering uproar as to the base immorality of the modernists—I mention: Marcel let fall his 'favor'—a miniature American flag—into his champagne.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The first paragraph of Loy's note initially deifies Duchamp and subsequently debunks such mythologizing: for, it is difficult to imagine a ravaging, statuesque re hanging from a grand "paper festoon." In fact, recollections of Duchamp's antics during the evening of the Ball are inconsistent. Beatrice Wood recounts in her memoir that she and Henri-Pierre Roché applauded from a box as Duchamp hung from a chandelier, while Roché himself describes his countryman ascending a flagpole.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Earlier in the evening, Duchamp makes the decidedly less spectacular gesture of dropping a miniature American flag into his champagne, a detail that emerges in the poem amid Duchamp's drunken conversations. Apart from the reference to "Marcel," the title's other personal reference is very likely Louise Arensberg, and while the group of party-goers is not at the apartment on this particular occasion, the title of the poem confirms that the salon is indeed the center of social activity.</p>
<p>In "Oh Marcel," Loy deliberately reproduces the language of her friends, employing a strategy of quotation and a use of the emdash that is suggestive of the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> If irregular typography, phonetic spellings, and capitalization highlight the oral character of the text, then the ellipsis presents yet another variable of import: the poem comprises incomplete statements, abrupt interjections, and incomplete locutions that provide only fragmentary glimpses into several ongoing conversations. The theme of drunkenness is quickly established with the presence of "bottles," an allusion to Billy Sunday,<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> and the common declaration of one's sobriety—"I am perfectly sober now"—expressed only by the truly inebriated. Indeed, a drunken language of non sequitur, fragment, and proto-surrealist compound expressions (such as the sexually suggestive "tongue sandwich") pervades the text.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> Consider Duchamp's slurred statement in reaction to an unknown provocation: "you are abusing myself." The latter pronoun is typically used when the subjective "I" refers self-reflexively to her/himself; in Duchamp/Loy's sentence, "you" replaces "I," grammatically conflating personal pronouns.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> The "you," of course, is indeterminate, but more to the point, Loy represents in language a scene of intersubjective confusion akin to Wood's drawing. And despite occasional references to individuals by name (e.g. "Demuth," "Clara," and "Mina": Charles Demuth, Clara Tice, and Mina Loy), and a waiter, whose presence makes the context of the poem somewhat clearer, emphasis is placed instead on the intermingling of subjects through methods of textual appropriation. She uses the collage to construct mobile constellations of bodies and objects, consciously emphasizing exchange, movement, and transition. Indeed, Duchamp's assessment of Stettheimer's "group pictures" might be used to clarify Loy's method: "instead of seeing only a series of . . . formal situations on the canvas, you have to consider the effect of the different points joining up were they to change place." What is captured is not so much a collection of selves but the changing nature of their interaction.</p>
<p>The publication history of the text amplifies this reading. In the aftermath of the Independents exhibition fiasco, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Blind Man</span> would serve as the first of many forums for discussing the controversy surrounding Duchamp's <span style="font-style:italic;">Fountain</span>. Alfred Stieglitz's photograph of the readymade is first published here, alongside a detailed account of its rejection from the exhibition, an essay by Louise Norton entitled "Buddha of the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Bathroom," and an ode by Demuth, "For Richard Mutt." To read Loy's poem divorced from its originary context of publication, it seems merely to construct a world of private reference. Yet its position within a magazine issue devoted to Duchamp's readymade elicits the question: to what extent is "O Marcel" a response to <span style="font-style:italic;">Fountain</span>? Mention of a coin toss to determine "whether you resign or I resign" may be a coded reference to Duchamp and Walter Arensberg's resignation from the Society of Independents' board of directors, but more importantly, Loy underscores an analogous feature in the cultural practices of literary collage and the sculptural readymade. Both use strategies of appropriation to call attention to the collective construction of aesthetic objects.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> One might argue that Loy's collage of throwaway remarks is a literary readymade of sorts, yet what the poet foregrounds most candidly is the social nature of this activity. If such aesthetic practices discredit proprietary notions of authorship and problematize intentionality, they do so by acknowledging the role of community formation in the production of aesthetics. In one of the few passages of "Oh Marcel" in which Duchamp is clearly addressing Loy, he offers her a gift of paper; he also offers a promise to "keep silent to give" her "a rest." Though she initially declines, perhaps it is not the paper but his silence to which Loy objects, since it is his voice, and the voices of others, that ultimately composes the poem.</p>
<div class="sectionBreak"><p>The artistic experiments of Loy, Duchamp, and others associated with the Arensberg circle have significant implications for the history of twentieth-century poetics and art. For instance, to what extent do practices of collage, appropriation, multilingualism, and multi-disciplinarity constitute formal operations that problematize authorship not by erasing the originator of texts but by "communalizing" literary artifacts? This, of course, is a question well beyond the scope of the present discussion. A comprehensive account of the poetry written by members of the Arensberg circle alone would require extensive consideration of Marianne Moore, Stevens, Arensberg, Kreymborg, Marsden Hartley, the Baroness Elsa, and Bob Brown, among others I cite throughout this study. What is fascinating about this motley assemblage of canonical modernists and avant-gardists is its apparent incongruity with the conceptual categories and generic taxonomies we typically employ in order to define modernism. Perhaps the salon itself affords a more appropriate means to write the history of modernist aesthetics. The salon is a cluster, a mêlée, of bodies and practices, writers and disseminators, technologies and texts. It is not simply that a social history of its participants and conventions affords an explanation of the conditions under which modernist poets create literature; rather, the social space of the salon is a constitutive element of a communally constructed artistic practice. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>

<div id="body">
<p>"In friendship, power always has its downward curve," Gertrude Stein writes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span>, underscoring her particular sense of human relationships as sites of struggle, competition, and hierarchy.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> In the wake of a now-dominant tradition of feminist scholarship on Stein, which has tended to emphasize her texts' "dialogic form, in which difference may enter without being relegated to a secondary position or subsumed under an authoritarian identity,"<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> we have lost sight of the degree to which Stein in her texts and in her life understood relationships as difficult at best, deadly at worst. Although Stein's work has often been associated with a form of idealized engagement called "talking and listening," she herself was an expert observer (and practitioner) of hierarchical power relations. And of all relationships, friendship was the most fraught for Stein, the dynamic most likely to result in the suppression rather than celebration of difference: the dynamic most drenched in power. Writing about friendship in <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span>, Stein described its erotic blossoming, its fading, its shifts, and its lulls as degrees on a subtle spectrum of mutual influence and manipulation, more complex than familial relationships and certainly less predictable, supportive, or lasting. While families required accommodation, friendship for Stein was in the end about what she called "winning"—or losing.</p>
<p>In her own life, not surprisingly, Stein's friendships were often experienced as struggles for domination and control, as competitions between victor and loser in a game of power. This essay will focus on one such friendship, with the person described by Alice Toklas as Stein's "dearest friend during her life"<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a>: the writer, scholar, and leading French expert on American culture, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Bernard Faÿ. Faÿ is best known as the person who protected Stein from persecution during World War II, and is credited with saving her art collection from seizure by the Nazis. In most accounts of Stein's life, he is a benevolent if compromised friend, a Vichyite who collaborated with the Nazis but whom Stein supported publicly to the end, even working to secure his release from prison.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Yet the story of Faÿ's "protection" of Stein and Stein's "support" of Faÿ during the Vichy years is more complex than it at first appears, occurring as it did within a context of desperation and uncertainty, marked by the needs and pressures of an extraordinary situation. If life under Vichy's profascist regime strained human relationships to their breaking point, it was especially destructive to the casually selfless and altruistic dimensions of friendship in normal times. Under Vichy, Stein's idea of a friendship defined through power and "winning" or "losing" seemed suddenly to describe the norm.</p>
<p>Yet in fact Vichy represents for Stein and Faÿ only the final manifestation of a long and involved relationship characterized by desire, greed, ambition, egoism, mutual flattery, as well as genuine affection and shared vulnerability. Tracing the arc of this friendship over the course of some twenty years reveals the dynamic of relational power at the heart of Stein's aesthetic and social imagination. Completing the arc in the aftermath of World War II throws into relief the complex and violent end of both this friendship and the larger unsettled world out of which it emerged.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">I. 1924–1930</h1>
<p>Faÿ and Stein were first introduced in 1924, in what Faÿ described as "the small, queer, and cosmopolitan, literary Paris where she [Stein] has her home."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Although Stein claimed that initially she and Faÿ "had nothing in particular to say to each other,"<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Faÿ soon became a member of Stein's postwar queer entourage, composed of fellow writers, painters and musicians, students, sycophants, and hangers-on, most if not all of them bisexual or homosexual men. By 1926, the frequent, sometimes daily visitors to Stein's apartment included Carl Van Vechten, Sherwood Anderson, Virgil Thomson, René Crevel, Hart Crane, Paul Bowles, Aaron Copeland, Georges Hugnet, Francis Rose, the artist Pavel Tchelitchew and his partner Charles Henri Ford. And of course, Bernard Faÿ: notable for his erudition, his ambition, and his love of all things American, particularly the reckless, beautiful men he had encountered while a graduate student at Harvard in 1920, whose "great supple bodies, without faults and without vices . . . have taught them only joy."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Described derisively by Ernest Hemingway as "Bernard Fairy," the devoutly-Catholic Faÿ was clearly conflicted about the "impure loves" he had experienced at Harvard, and admitted privately praying to God to absolve him of his homosexuality.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Upon first meeting Gertrude Stein, Faÿ writes, he found someone with all the joyous spiritual qualities of the "Harvard type" (Stein had herself been a student at Radcliffe) but with little of the troubling physical attractiveness. Stein, he writes, taught "of the joy of living, not in the manner of Gide, mediated through sensuality, but straight on, in a direct manner."<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Like the "honest, patient, and tolerant" boys of Harvard,<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Stein was a forthright American, but she was also a lesbian, a fact that <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  canceled out the "great supple bodies" of those Harvard men; and it was this unique calculus of national sameness and erotic difference that initially attracted Faÿ to her.</p>

<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p>Faÿ was a curious individual of complex personal and political sympathies: deeply conservative, with monarchist leanings, a decorated veteran of the French campaign in World War I, Faÿ was already aligned with the French Catholic Right by the time he met Gertrude Stein at the age of 31. His acquaintances during the interwar period included Philippe Pétain, Maurice Barrès, Robert Brasillach, and Charles Maurras; over the course of the 1930s, Faÿ would become identified both with Maurras' Action Française and with the pro-German groups around res like Jean Luchaire and Otto Abetz, future German ambassador to Vichy under the Nazis. Faÿ's intellectual ties to these groups had been fostered by his scholarly work, first at Harvard and then in a quick succession of published volumes, on the topic of freemasonry: a particularly charged issue in France, associated with secularism, liberalism, revolutionary ideals, and "Jewish" thought—all signs of decadence to those on the French Right who identified with monarchism and traditionalist Catholic values. Eventually, as we shall see, Faÿ <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  would use his scholarly knowledge of freemasonry to insidious ends: pursuing, exposing, and working to deport French freemasons to concentration camps during his tenure in the Vichy administration. Yet it was American freemasonry that first interested Faÿ at Harvard, and toward this branch of the movement Faÿ proved more judicious, connecting freemasonry to America's "revolutionary spirit," describing the lodges as "cradles of the spirit of independence," and showing in his analysis of Benjamin Franklin how much "Freemasonry envisaged the reform of society by means of enlightenment and philosophic benevolence."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> As with homosexuality, so too could freemasonry flourish in America without necessarily becoming a "vice." The connection between the two was for Faÿ not untenable. Throughout his life, Faÿ imagined America as a wild, sweet place of unorthodox desires and enlightened if secular politics, an anti-France that held all the attractions and dangers of the mythic Other. It was in America as well where Faÿ first discovered modernist art, whose transgressions represented the same kind of "revolutionary spirit" that both fascinated and repelled him in freemasonry and in his own homosexual experiments. So it was somewhat inevitable that Gertrude Stein—queer, American, Jewish, revolutionary, modernist, yet "proper," and indeed (as we shall see) socially conservative Gertrude Stein—would become for Bernard Faÿ an ideal mentor.</p>
<p>Stein, for her part, clearly enjoyed the power dynamics in her early relationship to Faÿ. Like a diva, Stein was a vital center around which her young gay male admirers orbited. Sharing many traits with the classic operatic diva—a dominant personality, a prodigious physique, a commitment to her solitary art, the determination that she was extraordinary and that "no one [could] harm her"—Stein also had what Wayne Koestenbaum has suggestively called a "singing identity."<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The beauty of Stein's speaking voice was often noted for being "so human, so rich in sound,"<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> and Faÿ in particular described the way Stein's voice and laugh spoke "of joy, of health, of voluntary and spontaneous gaiety."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Gaiety, for Stein, was both the expression and the performance of self: the exuberance that had passed through, indeed transcended, "shame and despair."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> As someone who had survived years of ridicule from the mainstream press and publishing establishment, Stein was an icon of triumphant self-sufficiency and a crucial role model for young gay artists struggling to make names for themselves. Like Saint Theresa, the saint-diva of Stein's most famous opera <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span>, Stein by the 1920s had joyously and unapologetically embraced her exceptionality, her queerness, the inevitable way in which her writing and her life exceeded the boundaries of convention and tradition. Despite repeated failures to find an audience for her work, Stein by the mid-1920s was laying claim to her literal and rative difference as a sign of genius.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> And this ability to succeed despite ridicule, this "winning" quality (a favorite word of Stein's), was enormously inspiring to those around her.</p>
<p>Yet a diva is not exactly a friend to her supplicants. Divas create, inspire, and often appropriate from those around them, but they exist above the fray of relational struggle. Stein reserved the power to damn or bless her admirers, bestowing on them the favor of her considerable reputation as a critic and promoter of modern art in all its forms; many young artists of the day flourished under her supervision and promotion, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  as through the force of her example. Yet this power of Stein's to cultivate, promote—or destroy—young artists also differentiates her from the idealized Theresa of <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints</span>, whose portrayal, as Corinne Blackmer has argued, belongs to a world "in which power freely circulates and is freely exchanged."<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> In the chapel of "our lady," as Faÿ described Saint Gertrude in the late 1920s, power was a scarce commodity held largely by Stein herself. Not surprisingly, those who surrounded Stein often chafed under her imperious rule, precipitating violent quarrels and banishment from the salon. Among them Bernard Faÿ was more calculating and hence more successful in winning Stein's favor than most. In a 1929 essay on Franco-American relations, Faÿ writes tellingly of friendship as "a rare and fragile thing . . . It is not necessary, and many people do not even feel that it is useful."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Privately, Faÿ showed himself willing to weigh seriously the use-value of friendship; as his contemporary Bravig Imbs writes, Faÿ was "coldly analytical and calculating in his friendships."<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Imbs recounts an astonishing conversation he once had with Faÿ about friendship: "'It's simple,' [Faÿ] said, 'first you choose the people you want ultimately for your friends, then you choose those who are the friends of theirs. You begin with the latter, of course, and as soon as they have introduced you to their friends, you drop them. Just make a new list every year and drop people as fast as you acquire more important friends."<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Faÿ's calculating attitude toward friendship made him truly Stein's equal: both saw friendship as a process of selection and rejection inextricable from an arc of power. For Faÿ, "acquiring" Stein was also a process of de-idealization: he was one of the few to see the insecurities and desires that lay beneath the mask of diva. And Stein, who was just fifty when she met Faÿ and eager for admirers who could also promote her work, was beginning to see Faÿ's own use-value to her.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> From the late 1920s on, as Imb writes, "Gertrude and Bernard became very good friends, indeed."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">II. 1930–1935</h1>
<p>It was Alice Toklas who apparently initiated the dismissal of "all the young men" from Stein's circle as the 1920s drew to a close. Among those whom Stein entertained, advised, and wrote portraits of in the postwar decade, Bernard Faÿ was one of the few (with Sherwood Anderson and Carl Van Vechten) who remained a confidante after 1930. Faÿ claimed that Stein by this time had become for him "a need," leaving unstated the degree to which his "necessity" for her had to do with her greater authority at a moment when Faÿ was cultivating his career.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Likewise, Stein remained devoted to Faÿ at a time when she too was growing increasingly eager to acquire more public recognition for her work. A prolific writer, like Stein, Faÿ had already published several books on American culture and history by the time they met, and by the late 1920s had begun to publish his work in prestigious journals, newspapers and presses: exactly the venues Stein was herself eagerly trying to enter. At the same time, Faÿ's institutional capital in both France and America was growing. During this turbulent era of Franco-American relations, Faÿ had established himself as a knowledgeable commentator on both sides of the Atlantic on topics ranging from the French war debt to the American presidency, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and had spread his name throughout the worlds of journalism, academe, and politics. The initial result of this visibility was his appointment, in 1925, as the first Professor of American Civilization in France, at the University of Clermont-Ferrand. Numerous visiting appointments at American universities during the '20s and '30s consolidated Faÿ's transatlantic academic reputation; by 1934, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Kansas City Star</span> was referring to him as the "'unofficial ambassador' of France to the New World."<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> His international success led to the most coveted accomplishment of all: appointment, in 1932, to the elite Collège de France, where Faÿ became the inaugural Chair in American Civilization and the youngest person ever elected to the Collège.</p>
<p>Facing her continued lack of public recognition after a twenty-plus year engagement with literary experimentalism, Stein undoubtedly found Faÿ's prodigious intellectual energy and successful career enormously stimulating. She followed his career shifts with interest and seemingly without the usual feelings of jealousy: his work as a historian and culture critic was far enough removed from her aesthetic concerns to be unthreatening, and his institutional aspirations fascinated Stein, despite her imprecations against what she called "the employed type" who "have only one concern: to take on the habits imposed on them by their milieu or their job and to guard them until death."<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Presumably what saved the "employed" Faÿ from Stein's disdain was his own abstract interest in institutional power; while he was maneuvering for the position at the Collège, "he reported to Stein daily, discussing every political step with her."<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Nor was Stein, having taken the step to self-publish under the Plain Edition imprint, immune to the attractions of the institutional validation given Faÿ. From her 1926 lectures at Oxford and Cambridge to the Plain Edition venture to a series of aggressive pitches to Anglo-American editors and publishers like Ellery Sedgwick and Bennett Cerf, Stein worked throughout this period to bring her writing to the public. Within this context, Faÿ played several roles for Stein.</p>
<p>On the one hand, he was just enough "employed" to be useful to Stein without burdening her with his institutional habits and commitments. In fact, Faÿ seemed to have no particular stake in the institutions through which he passed, seeing them rather as stepping stones on the way to a brilliant public career; and it was largely due to his assorted academic appointments and connections throughout the United States that Stein was provided with her speaking venues during her lecture tour of 1934–35. After Faÿ had published several glowing reviews of Stein's work in American journals, and had volunteered in 1932 to translate <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span> into French, his position as handmaiden and booster of Stein's genius was firmly established; alone among Stein and Toklas's friends, Faÿ visited the couple at their country house in Bilignin twice during the summer of 1932. Nor did Faÿ, unlike Stein's other French translator Georges Hugnet before him, demand that Stein treat him as a writer of equal talent and expressive capacity.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> In commenting to Faÿ on his translation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Making</span>, Stein seemed most impressed not by his lyrical rendering of the original but by his ability to cut the 925-page manuscript into 260 pages, thus rendering it publishable. For this alone, Stein wrote to Faÿ gushily that "our friendship was a turning-point in my life, it made me light-hearted and sure of myself after a long life of doubt."<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Like Carl Van Vechten and Virgil Thomson, Faÿ seemed to know just how to serve, and indeed manipulate, Stein's particular ego investment in both queerness and privilege; he seemed to intuit exactly the degrees to which Stein needed to be perceived as both exceptional <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> accepted. As the thirties proceeded, Stein came increasingly to rely upon Faÿ's contacts to smooth her way toward what she desired most of all: fame, and eventually, celebrityhood. Yet Stein's dependency on Faÿ was also becoming more deeply charged. If during the late 1920s Faÿ had personified the role of youthful, charming, ambitious, gay apprentice to Stein's high modernist genius, by the early 1930s Faÿ had established enough <span style="font-style:italic;">gravitas</span> of his own to be a real intellectual equal to Stein. Soon, their trajectories began to converge in striking, and as yet critically unremarked, ways. In their writings during this period, both take up the subjects of history in general and American history in particular; of French-American relations; of the lives of "great men" and the creation of biography. Both write biographies of George Washington, Faÿ's preceding Stein's by a year; both write pieces on the idea of history and historical methodology; both publish critiques of Franklin D. Roosevelt based upon his economic policy and "seductive" character. It is hard to determine the exact lines of influence in this mutual production—both, after all, had been mulling over the issue of what Stein called "The Difference Between the Inhabitants of France and the Inhabitants of the United States of America" long before they first met; both had been avid readers of American history since their early adolescence. Moreover, Stein clearly had independent aesthetic concerns at this time that reached back to her earliest struggles with genius and originality; likewise, Faÿ's continued fascination with the topic of freemasonry in both its American and French manifestations appeared to be exclusively, and obsessively, his own.</p>
<p>Yet the clear convergence of ideas in the writings of each points at the very least to an ongoing conversation—and a conversation that unlike many between Stein and her associates seemed to be taking place between equals. A telling account of their friendship in 1934 is given by James Laughlin, founder of New Directions publishing house: "Evenings at Bilignin were spent in conversation, which meant a monologue from Miss Stein . . . [But w]hen Bernard Faÿ came down for weekends from Paris there really was conversation. The two old friends knew each other so well they could play off each other's interests and eccentricities. It was a pleasure to hear the duet. Alice and I just listened."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Laughlin's description is Steinian in its differentiation between "conversation" and "real . . . conversation"—the latter being of crucial import to Stein, who throughout her career would describe her work in terms of an ideal exchange of "talking and listening" either within herself or in relation to a reader.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Most critics have tended to describe Alice Toklas as Stein's ideal interlocutor, as the companion whose support and admiration for Stein's work facilitated her move into experimental writing. Yet Laughlin's description of the Stein-Faÿ "conversation" suggests a different kind of dynamic from that between Stein and Toklas. The image of Laughlin and Toklas "just listen[ing]" while Stein and Faÿ "play[ed] off each other" reconres Stein's cherished notion of "talking and listening" to emphasize a conversation (or "play") among equals performed for the benefit of a silent audience of "listeners." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>As suggested above, this period in Stein's career was marked by a heightened interest in the dramatic genre; between 1927–36 she wrote over twenty plays, including <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Saints in Three Acts</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Dr. Faustus Lights the Lights</span>. One perceives this interest in the description of Stein and Faÿ's "playful" exchange, a performance among raconteurs used to the spotlight, an exchange rather different from the more intimate, interior dialogue of some of Stein's most erotic poems to Toklas of the teens and twenties—"Lifting Belly or Pink Melon Joy." The Stein-Faÿ exchange was, Laughlin states, a performative "duet": a lively, sympathetic banter in which each side complemented and heightened the other. If, indeed, there were any possibility of true interchange in Stein's notion of "talking and listening" beyond the erotic intimacy in the love poems to Toklas, the Laughlin description of her conversation with Bernard Faÿ would seem to be it.</p>
<p>Yet if Faÿ at this moment occupied a position of equality with Stein on the "arc of power" of their friendship, this ideal balance was not to last long. In a letter she wrote to Faÿ in 1933 after hearing one of his inaugural lectures at the Collège de France, it is Stein who approaches Fay like a supplicant to her master:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>My dear Bernard,</p>
<p>When I got home just a little tired I realized fully how moved and passionately interested I had been. It was an extraordinary experience. I was living in you and living in the thing and for once in my life almost not living in myself. A strange and very moving experience and giving me quite a new point of view toward life. Thanks a thousand times for that and all. I am beginning to write the confessions of the writer of the autobiography of Alice B. Toklas and there will be much to confess but this is a new way to confess, listening to you to-day gave me distinctly a new way to confess, contact with your mind is comforting and stimulating, and nothing is more deeply satisfying to me than that. We do mean a great deal to each other.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The framing of this letter in terms of climax and release—Stein describes being "moved and passionately interested" to the point of "almost not living in myself," only to find herself "just a little tired" afterward—reminds us of Stein's early erotic exchanges with Toklas, as do the cryptic and encoded phrases "contact with your mind" and "we do mean a great deal to each other." The epistolary style here is more than a little reminiscent of sentimental Victorian exchanges between female friends, a genre that Stein herself experimented with in her early lesbian novella <span style="font-style:italic;">Q.E.D.</span><a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> In her letter to Faÿ, Stein, like a lover, presents herself as a pupil to her beloved: it is Faÿ who gives Stein "a new way to confess" as well as "quite a new point of view toward life." The intimacy and vulnerability of Stein's position is as touching as that of Adele, the protagonist of <span style="font-style:italic;">Q.E.D.</span>, when she implores Helen, her indifferent beloved, that "I could undertake to be an efficient pupil if it were possible to find an efficient teacher."<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Flushed with the excitement of giving in to a more powerful master, Stein like Adele constructs a fantasy of "contact" with Faÿ that revolves around her capitulation to his "new point of view toward life." What he reveals, of course, is how to give an effective public lecture: a lesson that will serve Stein in good stead during her Faÿ-guided lecture tour of America in 1934–35. Ironically, Stein's capitulation to Faÿ's "lesson" will enable her to find her own public voice as a lecturer. Yet Stein's note makes it very clear who is the teacher in <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  this pedagogical scene, and who is the pupil. Indeed, this remarkable letter describes one of the only moments in Stein's entire oeuvre in which she presents herself not as a talker or creator of works of genius, nor as an interlocutor in an exchange among equals, but simply and fully as a listener.</p>
<p>There was much beyond this lecture for Stein to listen to. After securing his Collège de France appointment, Faÿ's energies had increasingly turned toward contemporary politics: an area of interest to most French intellectuals of the 1930s, with a Nazified Germany looming on the horizon and political chaos brewing in France. As the decade matured, the ambitious Faÿ, seeing an opportunity to make use of his expertise on freemasonry and on American culture, and genuinely appalled by the crises of the Third Republic, began a two-pronged campaign of public lectures and journalism on the threats facing Europe—specifically, freemasonry, but more generally the ideologies of liberalism, democracy, secularism, and materialism. Americans and the Jews—once favorably perceived by Fay for their "joy" (Americans) and "intelligence" (the Jews)—were increasingly described by Fay as a major threat to European "soil, blood, and God."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Between 1934–40 Faÿ published some three dozen essays in French and American mainstream and right-wing journals on the changing scene in Europe and America, with a growing focus on the particular promise of a federal Europe dominated by Hitler's Germany. While Stein was experiencing the glory of popular celebrityhood after the success of her lecture tour in 1934–35, Faÿ was cultivating a less visible but more politically-powerful position as culture critic and defender of "France for the French," a xenophobic slogan that would be used by the coming Vichy administration to justify its racist, antidemocratic, authoritarian, collaborationist policies.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Swept up by Faÿ's political enthusiasms, Stein would soon find her own writing enlisted in the service of what she called his "point of view toward life."</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">III. 1935–1944</h1>
<p>It is easy to pinpoint the exact moment when Stein's "power" in her friendship with Bernard Faÿ began its "downward curve." It occurred in an article about Stein that Faÿ wrote for the right-wing, pro-fascist French newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">Je Suis Partout</span> in 1935.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Although there has been no mention of this article in the discussions of Bernard Faÿ by Stein scholars, it is in fact the case that Faÿ wrote more than twenty pieces for <span style="font-style:italic;">Je Suis Partout</span> between 1934–1941, many of them critical accounts of French "decadence," of masonic conspiracy, and of the seductive but "cunning" character of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Faÿ was by no means the most fanatical of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Je Suis Partout</span> writers; but the fact that he eventually became the journal's chief American correspondent speaks volumes about Faÿ's political orientation. It is hard to underestimate the ideological power and social effect of the journal in its support for the principles of German National Socialism and its condemnation of the French Third Republic, as Alice Kaplan has shown in her brilliant study of Robert Brasillach, editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">Je Suis Partout</span> and friend of Bernard Faÿ. Among the most damning charges of the journal was its effort to publish the names, pseudonyms, and addresses of Jews and other French "undesirables" as they <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  attempted to elude capture during the Vichy regime. Bilious in its attacks against Jews, freemasons, Gaullists, socialists, and Resistance ters, <span style="font-style:italic;">Je Suis Partout</span> was, according to Kaplan, "the leading proponent of fascism and anti-Semitism in France."<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>To see Gertrude Stein's name in the pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">Je Suis Partout</span> remains shocking to this day. A Jewish name in its pages could only mean one thing, just as an image of a Jewish person in the paper always relied on the same set of caricatured traits. Yet in Faÿ's article, Stein is being held up—one might even say used—as an exemplar of the very fascist ideals of nationalism, artistic "purity," and authoritarianism that the newspaper was promoting. Appearing in the midst of Stein's lecture tour of the United States, "L'apothéose de Gertrude Stein" ["The Apotheosis of Gertrude Stein"], describes the "enchantment" and "joy" of Stein's American audiences in the face of her "mysterious language of infinite repetitions, of distant innuendos, of daring associations." Stein is the darling of the moment; her work is "the great triumph of the fall and winter." Yet what differentiates this piece from others of its kind in the American press is the insistence with which Faÿ locates Stein's reception in a discourse of nationalism. "The triumph of Gertrude Stein is a national and nationalist triumph," he writes, positioning her writing against the school of American naturalism—"proletarian art"—which cares more for "democratic ideas" and "social life" than for "artistic forms." Ignoring the degree to which Stein herself eagerly embraced "proletarian art" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Lives</span>, which elsewhere Faÿ attributes to having "opened a new door" to writing for the next forty years, "L'apothéose de Gertrude Stein" argues that unlike the naturalists, Stein sought not to critique and denounce but to celebrate and underscore the beauty of American life and American language. Hers is "the triumph of american America over antiamerican America," Faÿ writes. Stein is again contrasted with "political" writers like Dreiser, Lewis, or Sinclair, as well as with overt critics of Steinian "decadence" like Mike Gold, none of whom fully grasp the role and function of art to glorify, enlighten, and celebrate the nation.</p>
<p>The article ends with a bizarre but telling image. Having insistently referred to Stein's American success in militaristic terms, as a "victory" and a "triumph," Faÿ ends by comparing Stein's American reception to "Mussolini when he visits a fascist crowd." He would recapitulate this association several years later, on the eve of World War II, referring to Gertrude Stein as among a handful of "exceptional" writers shoring up American culture in the face of its corrupt democratic "standardization," whose "imperial, genial, and sovereign" style "might one day conquer the nation."<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>From Saint Gertrude to Benito Mussolini: Stein's transformation in Faÿ's eyes recalls yet another, late description by Faÿ of her as "a roman emperor of the second century who would have had jewish blood."<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> While this latter incarnation of Stein favors her authority and power, it also reminds us that for Faÿ Stein's "jewish blood" was never inconsequential, and that this is just the kind of description we might expect from someone writing for <span style="font-style:italic;">Je Suis Partout</span> in the 1930s.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> More disturbing still is the likelihood that Stein would not have been particularly concerned by her appearance in <span style="font-style:italic;">Je Suis Partout</span>, given the favorable cast of the article and the fact that it was written by Faÿ. Flushed with her own newfound celebrity and always susceptible to flattery, Gertrude <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Stein seemed to grow ever more dependent upon Faÿ's support as the 1930s wore on. Indeed, since the beginning of her decision to return to America for the lecture tour of 1934–35, Stein had relied upon not only Bernard Faÿ's lecture style to model her own self-presentation, not only upon his numerous contacts to pave the way for her American appearances, not only upon his published reviews to promote and advertise her writing. She seemed also, increasingly, dependent upon his political ideas to shore up—or even inform—her own.</p>
<p>That Stein would be drawn to Faÿ's fascist sympathies should come as no surprise, given how many of her modernist fellow travelers (Pound, Eliot, Yeats, Wyndham Lewis), were themselves attracted to, if not actively supporting, fascist or pro-fascist regimes. Like these modernist contemporaries, Stein found compelling the fascist critique of bourgeois "decadence" and the strong-arm, authoritarian policies of fascist social control, both of which resonated with her lifelong political conservatism. As the 1930s wore on, Stein adopted a series of explicitly political positions—from her "joking" nomination of Adolf Hitler for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1934 to her defense of dictatorship as "natural" in 1937<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a>—that would consistently affirm the core principles of the French Right. At the same time, Stein was never a political writer—or arguably, thinker—in the sense of Faÿ, with his numerous essays on democracy, French and American history, and culture, and his insider's knowledge of state policies as a journalist and informal diplomat.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Her appearance in the pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">Je Suis Partout</span> thanks to her "dearest friend" Bernard Faÿ thus underscores the degree to which she, her celebrityhood, and her work were appropriated by his ideological worldview and political ambition. It locates Stein undeniably as a pawn in the power game of her friend.</p>
<p>As early as 1934, James Laughlin saw their "duet" through this particular political lens: "[A]n exchange I heard one night troubled me. They got on the subject of Hitler, speaking of him as a great man, one perhaps to be compared with Napoleon. How could this be? The Fuhrer's persecution of the Jews was well publicized in France by that time. Miss Stein was a Jew and Faÿ had nearly gotten himself killed ting the Boches. I couldn't forget that strange exchange."<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Laughlin's disbelief at the counter-intuitive political opinions of Stein and Faÿ brings into focus the "strange" potency of their conversations. Even stranger would be the increasingly obvious influence of Faÿ on Stein's writings of the late 1930s. While earlier in the decade Stein and Faÿ clearly shared a set of common interests—about American history, French culture, FDR—by the end of the decade Stein appears to have largely moved over to Faÿ's political worldview. For example, the infamous statement in "The Winner Loses" that France would "win" by capitulating to Hitler since it would force the citizenry to abandon "the weak vices that they were all indulging in" seems directly indebted to Faÿ's 1938 <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> editorial in which he argues for the possibility, and implicitly, the necessity, of the corrupt, masonic-driven Third Republic to "lie prostrate before Hitler."<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> Stein's text <span style="font-style:italic;">Paris France</span> , with its glorification of French "civilisation" and tradition, not only serves as a potent piece of Vichy propaganda but also seems in large part a restatement of the nationalist argument of Faÿ's 1935 <span style="font-style:italic;">Je Suis Partout</span> essay and of his discussion of French and American difference in his 1939 book <span style="font-style:italic;">Civilisation Américaine</span>. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Although Stein had been interested in questions of national identity since <span style="font-style:italic;">The Making of Americans</span> (1903–12), where she had attempted to describe all American types ("everyone who was and is and will be living"), her politically-charged discussion of nationhood in <span style="font-style:italic;">Paris France</span> invokes only the ideal type ("the French"), consistent from its fashions (always changing) to its logic (daily life) to its civilization ("so fixed and inevitable").<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> A grand apologia of French passivity and defeatism, <span style="font-style:italic;">Paris France</span> is in a larger sense indebted to Faÿ's consistent refrain during this period: that France is profoundly ill-suited to the modern; that it must look back to its great royalist tradition; that it must retain its "essential" Frenchness. In essays written before, during, and after the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Paris France</span>, Faÿ shows himself to be both an interlocutor and a stimulus for Stein in these ideas.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was only after the start of the German occupation of France in 1940 that Faÿ's "power" over Stein became most visible. This was a moment propitious for Faÿ and clearly dangerous for Stein. Faÿ's political maneuvering, his social climbing, and his ideological commitments, particularly his efforts to expose the evil of the "Judeo Masonic conspiracy" that seemed to be destroying French culture, all came together at this moment. Chosen by Philippe Pétain to head the Bibliothèque Nationale—replacing the Jewish Julian Cain, who was eventually deported to Buchenwald—Bernard Faÿ suddenly found himself in the inner circle of Vichy administrative power. While at the B.N., Faÿ's secret activities on behalf of the suppression of freemasonry in France gave him direct access to the Vichy police and through them, to the Nazi occupiers; archival evidence in fact confirms that Faÿ became a Gestapo agent.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Stein, on the other hand, felt compelled in 1940 to shut up her Paris apartment and flee to the countryside, where she wrote friends that her new isolation "has all the excitement and invention of pioneering."<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> Torn between her awareness of her own danger as a foreign Jew living in France, her real allegiance to Pétain and his pro-fascist agenda, and her sense of fellowship with her French neighbors, Stein was at her most vulnerable; added to this were the limitations of her age (66 in 1940). It is at this point in particular that a new dynamic entered into her friendship with Bernard Faÿ.</p>
<p>In his memoirs, Faÿ refers to a strategic meeting with Pétain, to whom he spoke "of Gertrude, of her genius, the dangers that she faced and, particularly, of the peril she would find herself in during the winter when she risked freezing."<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> After the meeting, Faÿ claims, Pétain dictated a letter to the sub-prefect of the region of France in which Stein was living, asking that he watch out for the two American women's health and safety. No mention is made of any recompense for this protection on the part of Stein; Faÿ's account portrays himself as the altruistic, heroic savior of Stein's life. In fact, here as elsewhere, Faÿ showed himself to be highly suited to Vichy's climate of secrecy and manipulation. Among the charges leveled at Faÿ in his 1946 trial for collaboration were his denunciation of suspected communists and freemasons on his staff at the B.N. and the acceptance of a bribe in return for protection of a Jewish friend during the early years of the war.<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Likewise, there is ample evidence that, as with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Je Suis Partout</span> review, Faÿ was fully aware of the importance of Stein's reputation and understood that Stein's wartime vulnerability could be leveraged to serve the Vichy regime. During the first three years of the war, Stein produced at least two pieces of propaganda in support <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of Vichy: an article, "La Langue Française," which appeared in the Vichy journal <span style="font-style:italic;">La Patrie</span>; and a partially-finished translation into English of the speeches of Petain, accompanied by a cryptic but undeniably positive introduction. While the <span style="font-style:italic;">Patrie</span> piece was suggested to Stein by an outside source as a "non political" effort on "the importance or prestige of French language,"<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> the Petain translation project was apparently initiated by Faÿ, or by one of his superiors. On a copy of Stein's "Introduction" discovered in the preparation file for Faÿ's 1946 treason trial, the name "Ménétrel" is written apparently in Faÿ's hand, referring to Bernard Ménétrel, Pétain's personal doctor and confidant. It is possible that Ménétrel brokered Stein's protection—especially given his influence over Pétain's affairs from May 1940 to the escape to Sigmaringen, and the interest on the part of high level Vichy administrators to improve Franco-American relations.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Whoever was the source of the translation project, however, Vichy's efforts on behalf of Stein and hers on behalf of Vichy were cleared through Bernard Faÿ. All sources affirm the likelihood that Stein was aware of this fact.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet Faÿ's "use" of Stein does not excuse her collaborative activities. As Alice Kaplan points out, other writers at this time chose exile, silence, or clandestine publication over the writing of Vichy propaganda.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> Moreover, there is substantial evidence that Stein had an abiding commitment of her own to Petain's National Revolution, seeing in it a model for both French and American leadership.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> Nevertheless, the form of her translation project does suggest a wrenching change in Stein's work during this time as she collaborated with a regime itself fully complicit with the Nazis. For a writer whose most experimental work interrogates the shifting, unstable relationship between signifier and signified, the Pétain translations are remarkable for their literalism: as though Stein had simply translated word-for-word; or as though she were passively giving herself up to the authoritarian voice and language of the fascist Father. Indeed, the Pétain translations seem marked by a kind of coerced attention, by a compliance with some "outside" on the level of the sign itself. This "outside" is of course none other than Vichy, or Pétain; or more precisely, Bernard Faÿ. However genuinely Stein may have believed in Pétain and in the Armistice as a way of "saving" France from a disastrous war, as from its own Third Republic; however much she may have welcomed Pétain's "dictatorship" as a "natural" inevitability; however much she may have seen Pétain as a model for America itself; the delicacy of her own position as a foreign Jew surely factored into her considerations. Within this extreme situation, the balance of power within the Faÿ-Stein friendship had clearly shifted: Faÿ was now the powerful protector, granting Stein the benefits, and demanding from her the price, of his important position in the Vichy regime; while Stein—isolated, elderly, living in a region of France targeted for particular "purges" of Jews by the Vichy secret police—was the disempowered supplicant, writing as faithfully as possible in order to save her own life.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">IV. Epilogue</h1>
<p>At the end of World War II, the fortunes of Gertrude Stein and Bernard Faÿ were once again reversed. By 1945, Faÿ—once an ambitious, driven ideologue at the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  center of the Vichy "revolution"—was in prison in Paris, awaiting trial on charges of collaboration with the Nazi enemy. Gertrude Stein, on the other hand, was enjoying newfound celebrityhood both in France and abroad after being "rediscovered" at the Liberation by American GIs and journalists. Now free to speak her mind about Vichy and America, Stein published <span style="font-style:italic;">Wars I Have Seen</span>, a harrowing account of daily life under the Occupation that nevertheless leaves unrevised her Pétainism, and unmentioned her translation of Pétain's speeches into English. Nor does Stein ever publicly acknowledge Faÿ's protection of her during the war, or indeed the terms of this protection. Stein's few remarks on the matter of her relationship with Faÿ are revealing for the distance they create between the two friends. In a letter she wrote after the war to their mutual acquaintance Francis Rose, Stein claims that Faÿ "certainly did certain things he should not have done, but that he ever denounced anybody, no, that I do not believe, in fact I know he did not, he was a monarchist he was a church man, but he was a passionate patriot always, about that there is no doubt, really not."<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> Stein is right about one thing here: Faÿ was "a monarchist . . . a church man . . . [and] a passionate patriot," and it was precisely this combination of qualities that lay behind his belief in "France for the French," in a nation purged of racial and religious difference. But Stein is also wrong: Faÿ did in fact denounce many French people during the war, including freemasons, communists, academicians at the Sorbonne, and eleven of his junior colleagues at the Bibliothèque Nationale. The fact that Stein is wrong despite claiming certain "knowledge" of Faÿ's innocence accords with her other, more peremptory statement: that Faÿ "certainly did certain things he should not have done"—i.e., collaborating with the Nazis. In her letter to Rose, Stein lays claim to an authority about Faÿ's actions that is not only disingenuous but ultimately seems designed to emphasize her own moral superiority. Such is also the case with the letter Stein wrote in support of Faÿ for his trial for treason, which acknowledges Faÿ's work to save Stein's art collection and his "patriotism" but which ultimately falls far short of an enthusiastic defense.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> In each instance, Stein contrasts her own position as celebrated modern artist and diva with that of Faÿ as the brilliant acolyte who went sadly astray.</p>
<p>The "downward curve" of Faÿ's power in his friendship with Stein would seem to be definitive: Stein was to die in July of 1946, five months before Faÿ was tried and found guilty for collaboration with the Nazis. Yet Bernard Faÿ in fact had the last word in his long, fraught friendship with Gertrude Stein. Sentenced to life in prison at hard labor, Faÿ managed to escape captivity five years later and flee to Switzerland, where he used his fascist contacts to secure a lectureship at the University of Fribourg. In 1957, Faÿ was officially pardoned by the French state and allowed to return to France. In Paris, Faÿ once again contacted Alice Toklas—now lonely, impoverished, and desolate without Gertrude—and persuaded her to convert from Judaism to Christianity. The reasoning was that she would be "consoled by the assurance of being reunited" with Stein in the afterlife.<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> We are left only imagining how Stein would have responded to this gesture. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f40" href="#f40-text">40. </a>Faÿ was what one might call an "opportunistic antisemite": while none of his writings directly attack Jews, and while he did indeed protect a number of Jewish friends from persecution during World War II, he played the antisemitic card in promoting his own efforts to persecute French freemasons (who were often associated with Jews in French culture).

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f42" href="#f42-text">42. </a>I am using the concept of the political here in a somewhat more limited way than its contemporary usage, to refer to the notion of distinct and contested governmental policies—such as the New Deal—and to the ideological debates surrounding national and international affairs. In this sense, Stein was if anything an unusual political writer, as for example in "The Winner Loses," when she claims that Petain's armistice was prophesied by an astrological convergence. Other "political" statements seem both naïve and disingenuous, as when in "Reflection on the Atomic Bomb"  Stein announces that "I never could take any interest in the atomic bomb . . . Sure it will destroy a lot and kill a lot, but it's the living that are interesting not the way of killing them."</p></div>
