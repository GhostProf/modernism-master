<p>
In the period from 1909&#8212;1922 when T.S. Eliot was writing
and publishing poems such as "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,"
"Portrait of a Lady," "Preludes," and The Waste Land&#8212;poems that
firmly established his reputation as one of the major poets of the
century&#8212;he was simultaneously composing a long cycle of intensely
sexual, bawdy, pornotropic, and satirical verse that has only recently
come to light. Centered on the seafaring adventures of a colonial explorer
named "Columbo" (Eliot uses a pseudo-Italian version of Christopher
Columbus's name) and his encounters with two native inhabitants of Cuba,
"King Bolo and his Big Black Bassturd Kween," these poems comically and
obscenely portray the history of early European expansion as an orgy of
uncontrollable desire and deviant sexuality. Columbo's voyages and his
first contacts with the King and Queen of Cuba take place by, through,
and for sex, and they re sodomy, masturbation, miscegenation,
scatological rituals, and rape as the modus operandiof colonial
expansion. Eliot continued to write this extensive cycle throughout
his life, and portions of it he shared privately with a homosocially
arranged coterie of male writers, including Conrad Aiken, Clive Bell,
Bonamy Dobr&eacute;e, James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, and Ezra Pound.Taken
as a corpus, the poems (untitled by Eliot) allegorize Eliot's concerns
with his nascent reputation as a poet, his anxious desire for publicity,
his exile from the United States, and his uneasy relation to issues of
race, sex, and colonialism. They explode reigning myths about Eliot's
asexuality, and they

<b></b>

demand radical rereadings of the place of sex, race, history, and desire
in Eliot's poetic and critical oeuvre.

<p>
Shockingly different in form, kind, and content from Eliot's canonical
poems, the Columbo and Bolo stanzas, with sing-song, adolescent rhythms
and rhyme schemes that seem more appropriate to schoolboy doggerel
than to the poetry of a major literary re, would hardly have done
Eliot's literary reputation much good on the London literary scene of
the 1910s and early 1920s. Nevertheless, as we will see, Eliot actively
tried to get them published. In what appears to be two of the early
stanzas&#8212;in terms of the New World voyage of discovery that Eliot
charts&#8212;Columbo is preparing to leave Spain under the patronage of
Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, and the following scene takes place:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
One day the king &amp; queen of Spain
<br />
They gave a royal banquet
<br />
Columbo having passed away
<br />
Was brought in on a blanket
<br />
The queen she took an oyster fork
<br />
And pricked Columbo's navel
<br />
Columbo hoisted up his ass
<br />
And shat upon the table.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Columbo and his merry men
<br />
They set sail from Genoa
<br />
Queen Isabella was aboard
<br />
That famous Spanish whore.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The penetrating "prick" of the queen's "oyster fork" is apparently
enough to resurrect Columbo from the dead: prodding him&#8212;indeed,
marking him with the threat of rape&#8212;with her phallic utensil, as
she mixes sex and appetite to awaken him to his scatological act. Columbo
returns the queen's "prick" with a contrary but commensurate response,
marking his immanent departure of discovery with a gesture of anal
excrement. Evidently we are meant to read her "prick" as phallic, since
it repeats a phallic moment just seven lines earlier where Eliot writes
anti-Semitically that when Columbo went to see a doctor in Spain,
"Where doctors are not many / The only doctor in his town / Was a
bastard jew named Benny," who "filled Columbo's prick / With Muriatic
Acid" (<i>IOTMH</i>, 315). Eliot's rendition of the colonial historical
imaginary begins with a mocking critique of its origins, which are now
located in the performance of infantile and anal phantasies involving a
non-verbal exchange between patron and subject, one whose signification
operates as both erotic tribute and offensive rebuke.

<p>
Indeed, anal excrement will be the great, expendable form of currency and
expression in these poems: it is alternately deposited at formal social
occasions, thrown, used as a sexual turn-on, depicted as the goods Columbo
brings back to Europe from the New World, and proposed as the substance
of a meal. Later on, within the social structure Columbo finds in Cuba,
"King Bolo's swarthy bodyguard . . . A wild and hardy set of blacks"
will echo and repeat Columbo's gesture of anal excrement in front of Queen

<b></b>

Isabella: while Bolo is lying "down in the shade / His royal breast
uncovering / They mounted in a banyan tree / And shat upon their
sovereign" (<i>IOTMH</i>,316). Part insult, part sexual exhibitionism
and even sexual flattery, anal excrement is omnipresent in these poems,
and asks us to rethink the relation between colonialism and waste,
pillage and bodily excess.

<p>
In the above stanza, Eliot is also already playing with the queer valences
of "Queen"&#8212;as he will do elsewhere in the Bolo poems&#8212;to
suggest not only a hyperbolically sexual character of colonialism, but
also to propose that it thrives on deviant sexualities. Manly women who
"prick" prompt a shocking admixture of resurrection and excrement. Eliot
is at once homophobic in his rendering and homoerotically fascinated, and,
as will be shown, the homoerotic content of these poems was central to
the impetus for their creation and circulation among an all-male group of
peers. Queen Isabella, Christopher Columbus's Spanish-Catholic patroness
who favored his voyage while others looked more skeptically on his
prospects, is red as both an ambiguously female and potentially queer
"queen," while she is also the radically and misogynistically (though
less dangerous) feminine "whore" who acts as the envoy for Columbus's
early trans-Atlantic voyages. Her support of Columbus allowed him to
become the major Atlantic explorer for Spanish royalty and "discoverer"
of the "New World." Queen Isabella, who lived contemporaneously with the
great British "virgin," Queen Elizabeth&#8212;another major female re
of rule who had to negotiate alternating cultural representations of her
as whore and virgin&#8212;has been sexualized in more than one account,
as it has been difficult for interpreters of colonial history to imagine
a powerful queen without also imagining her sexual availability.

<p>
In terms remarkably similar to those found in Eliot's better-known poems,
the categories of history and sex, and memory and desire, make themselves
felt together and inseparably as Eliot proposes that to write a history
of New World discovery is also, inevitably, to write a sexuality. In
"Gerontion" , he res history both as intensely feminine and
corporeal:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think now
<br />
History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors
<br />
And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,
<br />
Guides us by vanities. Think now
<br />
She gives when our attention is distracted
<br />
And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions
<br />
That the giving famishes the craving.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>IOTMH</i>, 32-38)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Although it has rarely been read as such, this passage refers rather
explicitly to female genitalia as a metaphor for the permutations
of history, and the Columbo and Bolo poems corroborate such an
interpretation. In <i>The Waste Land</i> , "mixing memory and
desire" is claimed initially as April's particular cruelty, but memory
is thereafter unable to operate without always already intimating
desire&#8212;whether for the language of Shakespeare, and the family
romance his words invoke ("I remember / Those are pearls that were his
eyes"), for the memory of Richmond, where "I raised my knees,

<b></b>

/ Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe," or for the homoerotic tribute
to the drowned Phoenician sailor, to cite only three moments in the
poem's complicated network of memory and desire.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 Likewise, the Columbo and Bolo poems negotiate the intersections of
 cultural memory and erotic desire to propose, in a more sophomoric
 vein, that colonial discovery was about sexual conquest, and that to
 remember the origins of colonialism we would do well to laugh at its
 physical excesses.

<p>
To date, these Columbo and Bolo poems have received almost no critical
attention and have been largely unexamined since their respective dates of
(still partial) publication in 1988, 1990, and 1996. At present there
is only one essay on the poems, apart from a few published reviews
treating Ricks's 1996 <i>Inventions of the March Hare</i> (in which the
bulk of the stanzas first appeared), and the occasional indications in
biographies and critical guides that Eliot wrote some "bawdy" verses
about Christopher Columbus.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 It is difficult to know where to begin with these bawdy verses,
 since they are as offensive as they are fascinating, as dangerous as
 they are subversive. They play recklessly on prohibitions, offering
 a satirical poetics of desire and memory whose comic edge is always
 in danger of collapsing into the outright racism, homophobia, and
 misogyny that they ventriloquize, repeat, and critique. Yet to read
 them without addressing their comic-book humor would be to oversimplify
 them radically, and would be to refuse the playful interruption they
 offer to the still-dominant but all-too-narrow reading of T.S. Eliot
 as a conservative representative of high literary modernism and its
 critical correlative, the New Criticism.

<p>
Given Eliot's desire for their publication, the extended period of their
composition, and the range of issues that they tropologically invoke,
we cannot simply dismiss them as "mere" juvenilia. The Columbo and
Bolo stanzas are not only an occasional literary preoccupation: their
composition spans Eliot's entire adult lifetime and the body of work
they represent is substantial, totaling at least seventy-five stanzas
in all. So far, twenty-nine of these have been published&#8212;including
nearly ten in Valerie Eliot's 1988 <i>The Letters of T.S. Eliot: Volume
One, 1898-1922</i>, seventeen in Christopher Ricks's 1996 <i>Inventions of
the March Hare</i>, two in <i>The Faber Book of Blue Verse</i>&#8212;and
dozens more sit unpublished in archives.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
In his 1998 review of <i>Inventions of the March Hare</i>, Alex Zwerdling
argues that "the cultural dispensation from which Eliot emerged demanded
virtual silence on the subject of erotic life. Though he would free
himself from it in part, the unpublished poems show that his imagination
constantly brooded on the forbidden subject in ways that would have
shocked his original readers".
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Zwerdling also notes that in the sexually explicit sections of the
 draft for "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"&#8212;"Prufrock's
 Pervigilium," which appears in <i>Inventions of the March Hare</i> for
 the first time&#8212;one "finds not only 'lonely men in shirtsleeves,
 leaning out of windows,' but 'women, spilling out of corsets,' standing
 in the entries of 'evil houses leaning all together' and 'pointing a
 ribald finger at me in the darkness.'"
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 Zwerdling's remarks might equally apply to the more shocking Columbo and
 Bolo verses. In these, Eliot goes much further. Instead of synecdoche
 ("spilling out of corsets" for female body parts) Eliot offers

<b></b>

an exaggerated and explicit bawdiness, in which the poems' res are
capable of extraordinary cartoon-like feats, and exist without fear of
death or repercussions of any kind. Consider these cartoon-like images:
"A bullet came along the road / And up Columbo's asshole;" when he
is "sick-o" he "filled the pump with argyrol / And rammed it up his
prick-o;" Columbo "spun his balls around his head / And cried 'Hooray
for whores;'" and following the dictates of navigation, the crew "turned
[Columbo's] asshole S.S.W." (<i>IOTMH</i>, 318, 319). As we discover
when reading the Columbo and Bolo verses, Eliot was hardly a passive
victim of sexually suggestive finger pointing: he himself shakes quite a
"ribald" finger at his original and later readers in these verses.

<p>
Eliot not only mocks historical and quasi-historical res of the early
colonial era, but he does so while simultaneously parodying poetic form
and expression. As in his other poems, Eliot pushes traditional generic
boundaries, in this case by mixing aspects of several forms of traditional
light bawdy verse, including the limerick and the clerihew, to offer a
peculiarly modernist, self-conscious form of pornotropic doggerel. He
called his Columbo and Bolo poems "ballads," and imagined setting them to
music one day. Jonathan Gill argues that the verses reveal an "affiliation
with songs found in any number of popular anthologies of Negro song,"
and claims that they borrow conventions from minstrelsy song by featuring
"phonetic spelling, improper syntax, and highly charged and malleable
rhythms," as well as a "double tone".
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 As Francis Teague writes of the clerihew, we might also say that this
 verse provides "a cockneyed look at the great"&#8212;of historical
 conquest, in this example. The clerihew "differs from other light
 verse forms by its roughness: while other light verse is polished,
 the clerihew is deliberately clumsy, and might be said to burlesque
 a form such as the limerick."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 In effect, the form thus mirrors the poems' content, burlesquing
 traditional literary genres at the same time that the poems
 parodyreceived narrative histories about the legend of Columbus.

1 Public Desires and Private Circulations: <br />Eliot's Coterie
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Who were Eliot's intended readers? Eliot had been writing the Columbo and
Bolo poems at least since he was an undergraduate at Harvard (1906-1909),
and it is likely that he shared them aloud with several of his male
friends from that time onward.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 The earliest record we have of their circulation appears in July 1914,
 immediately before the beginning of the First World War, when Eliot
 included them in several letters to Conrad Aiken, a slightly younger
 friend with whom he had worked on <i>The Harvard Advocate</i>. At
 the time, Eliot was studying German at a summer-language program in
 Marburg that would soon be cut short by Germany's declaration of war
 against Russia on 1 August, 1914. Eliot, in other words, began sharing
 his parody of early European colonialism with others at precisely
 the moment when Europe was entering the First World War. The Columbo
 and Bolo poems thus gesture backward to relatively distant historical
 "origins" exactly when a new era of European national and international
 politics was unfolding. That is, they look backward while reflecting
 the preoccupations of the new, using a historical rendition to critique
 the continued operations of colonialism within the modernist moment
 whose <i>avant-garde</i> demanded formal and thematic innovation.

<b></b>

<p>
Eliot persisted in writing these verses throughout his lifetime,
and he gradually expanded the circle of friends with whom he shared
them. Although at present we do not have access to the very latest
poems, we know from Aiken that Eliot was still writing them until close
to his death. Aiken wrote a letter to Eliot and his wife Valerie in
December 1964, less than a month before Eliot died on 4 January 1965,
expressing regret that this year they would not have their usual exchange
of Columbo and Bolo poems: "But o dear we shall miss our annual meeting
in New York and the exchange of Bolos and lime rickeys at the River Club
or Vanderbilt."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 Astonishingly, the Bolo verses were the ones Eliot most unceasingly
 returned to and produced.

<p>
Their circulation seems to have been initially prompted by conditions
of both literary and personal history&#8212;in part by the arrival of
Wyndham Lewis's first issue of <i>Blast</i> on the London literary scene
in June 1914, and in part by Eliot's growing disillusionment with the
academic establishment of which, in 1914, while still a Ph.D. student in
philosophy at Harvard, he believed he was destined to be a part. Their
circulation thus stems from overlapping public and private desires:
evidence of his wish to participate in the public moment of the appearance
of <i>Blast</i>'s second issue, tokens of a personal desire to parody
and distance himself from the pedantic milieu that he was soon to leave.

<p>
The circulation of the Columbo and Bolo poems begins, importantly, with
mimicry&#8212;a mode they will continue to reflect as they alternate
between parody, satire, and outright repetition of racist codes
and topoi. Deliberately echoing the sort of humor found in Lewis's
new journal, in which Lewis alternately mocks ("Blasts") and praises
("Blesses") public res according to satirical moral judgments of them,
Eliot begins his letter to Aiken with the following heading:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
<div align="center">
BLESS
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; COLUMBO
<br />
BOLO BLUBUNG CUDJO
<br />
THE CHAPLAIN BRUTUS SQUIRTY PANSY
<br />
BLAST
<br />
THE BOSUN COUSIN HUGH THE COOK
<br />
PROF. DR. KRAPP
</div>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
A jocular letter ensues that pokes fun at academics and includes
one of Eliot's accomplished comic-like pen drawings (<a name="1"
HREF="9.2mcintire_res.html#1"> 1</a>). The drawing shows
Bolo as a rather large, bald man of ambiguous race, smoking a cigar,
decked out with a monocle and a polka-dotted bowtie. Beneath him the
caption reads "VIVA BOLO!!" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 43). Bolo seems rather pleased
with himself, and appears to be ogling something or someone outside the
frame of the drawing. Behind him is a mountain which places him in the
rocky landscape of contemporary Germany. (Eliot depicts this again a week
later in a letter to his American cousin, Eleanor Hinkley [<i>LOTSE</i>,
48]). Bolo is thus curiously <i>distant</i>, temporally speaking, and
<i>present</i> at the same time: he is simultaneously the imaginary King
of Cuba from Columbus's day, and a symbolic, timeless re with

<b></b>

infinitely changeable historical locations&#8212;a gesture that asks,
in another way, that we read Eliot's fascination with Bolo as reflective
of his own contemporaneity.

<p>
Most of those whom Eliot chooses to "Bless" or "Blast" are historical
or stock res that he parodies elsewhere in the Bolo cycle. While
Christopher Columbus is the most explicitly historical re, King Bolo
may also be modeled on a historical re named King Shamba Bolongongo
who died in 1628, "ruler of the Kuba tribes, legendary for the number
of widows and children he left."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 Christopher Ricks suggests that Eliot was possibly aware of some early
 comedic ballads by W. S. Gilbert (of later Gilbert and Sullivan fame),
 whose poem, "King Borria Bungalee Boo," depicts a "man-eating African
 swell" with a small tribe of all-male "subjects."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 Gilbert's ballads, which are disturbingly racist without showing
 the least evidence that they are aware of being so, recount how King
 Burria's tribesmen wage war against a tribe of Amazon women

<b></b>

ruled by "Queen Loo" in order to satiate their cannibalistic urges. While
the Amazonian women decide that they will try to win over the all-male
tribe peacefully through their coquettish ways, their sexual advances
do not persuade King Burria's men, and eventually the king himself eats
Queen Loo while his tribesmen feast on her subjects. As in Eliot's
Columbo and Bolo poems, appetite and sex are commensurate with each
other, and the two ends of the spectrum of war and peace turn out to
be a choice between two forms of incorporation: cannibalism or sex,
both involved with Eros and Thanatos.

<p>
The other res Eliot chooses to "Bless" or "Blast" are again
either historical or representatives of a type. The redundantly titled
"Prof. Dr. Krapp" is aptly named for the "Krapp" he produces, and is
one of several fictional professors whom Eliot mocks at some length
in the same letter, and then in his 1920s correspondence with Bonamy
Dobr&eacute;e. "Squirty Pansy" invokes the playfulness of slang to praise
a sexually ejaculative homosexual male. (The <i>OED</i> cites 1929 as the
first time "pansy" takes on a queer valence in English, defining it as
"effeminate; homosexual; affected;" Eliot's use of the term precedes
the <i>OED</i>'s example by fourteen years.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>) The fact that Eliot "Bless[es]" "Squirty Pansy" should alert us
again to the homoerotic content of the Bolo poems, and to a recurring
investment Eliot had at this time with the queer. We might also note the
preponderance of the alliterative "B's" and "C's" in Eliot's "Bless"
and "Blast" tribute to Lewis: with the exception of "Squirty Pansy"
all of his res begin with either a "B" or a hard "C" sound. Taking
alliteration to ridiculous limits, Eliot joins in with Lewis's version
of cultural critique and adopts <i>Blast</i>'s idiom in order to express
his own scatological and anti-academic satire of imperialism, one which
is also ambivalent towards institutional religion.

<p>
Although Eliot "Bless[es]" the Chaplain, his attitude to religion in
these stanzas is as vexed as his attitude to colonialism. Sundays in
particular seem to be good days for masturbation and rape in the cycle,
and they represent the only day of the week that is ever named. The
chaplain himself is hardly a re of sexual purity, and he eagerly
participates in the "spirit" of sex aboard the ship by whistling at
King Bolo's Kween and buggering himself while at sea: "K.B.b.b.b.k. /
Was awf'ly sweet and pure / She said 'I don't know what you mean!' /
When the chaplain whistled to her" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 126). Eliot's register
of buffoonery about the religious may strike us as rather surprising,
given his conversion to Anglo-Catholicism in 1927. These poems show
us an altogether different side of Eliot, a re more divided in his
literary and religious convictions than we might now think, especially
in the context of what Ronald Bush has articulated as "the reductive
force of his most recent metamorphosis," whereby critics have insisted
on reading him as a representative of formalism and orthodoxy.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 As Michael Levenson argues about <i>The Waste Land</i>, "it has been
 too tempting for too long to assimilate the poem to the events that
 came later in the decade, even shortly later, to see it as safely
 predicting the dispositions of the mid and late twenties: the poem as
 proto-Anglican, crypto-classical, or neo-monarchist."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
Immediately after the imitative tribute to Lewis, Eliot appends a Columbo
and Bolo stanza to his letter:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Now while Columbo and his men
<br />
Were drinking ice cream soda
<br />
In burst King Bolo's big black queen
<br />
That famous old breech l(oader).
<br />
Just then they rang the bell for lunch
<br />
And served up&#8212;Fried Hyenas;
<br />
And Columbo said "Will you take tail?
<br />
Or just a bit of p(enis)?"
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>LOTSE</i>, 42)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The first stanza Eliot sends to Aiken is both disgusting and humorous,
adolescent while it ventriloquizes racist and sexist stereotypes. Columbo
and his all-male crew are evidently enjoying a dessert-like treat when
suddenly "King Bolo's big black queen" "burst" upon the scene. This
is apparently the queen's preferred mode of entrance, and in another
stanza she arrives on board in the same fashion: "King Bolo's big black
kukquheen / Was fresh as ocean breezes. / She burst aboard Columbo's ship
/ With a cry of gentle Jesus" (<i>LOTSE</i>,205). A disruptive element,
the queen is immediately sexualized and propositioned by Columbo, as
he wonders if she might "take" the strange (evidently native) food he
offers. (It is nothing less than parts of a hyena, an animal known for
its uncontrollable laughter, which in its own way emphasizes the hysteria
underlying the encounter between Europeans and natives.) Eliot here
participates in a racist imaginary that res blacks, and especially
black women, as inviting sex and its attendant discourses, at once using
and mocking a phantasmatic perception that had been well in place from
the time of early colonialism.

<p>
Not only have black bodies been red in the white imagination
as signifying an excess of sexuality, but, through their ostensible
uncontrollability, they have also been situated on the border ground
with homosexuality. bell hooks quotes Sander Gilman to propose that "'by
the eighteenth century, the sexuality of the black, male and female,
becomes an icon for deviant sexuality.'"
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 This date seems rather late, and Jonathan Goldberg, for one, has pointed
 out that part of the rhetoric of the very first European explorers
 and colonists involved classifying the native people of color as
 dangerously sexual, even sodomitical. "'They are all sodomites;' so
 reads the dispatch sent from Vera Cruz, July 10, 1519, in the first
 so-called letter of Cort&eacute;z."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 Goldberg then argues that "once made, few reports failed to repeat
 the charge [of sodomy]."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 Eliot was apparently well aware of these kinds of homophobic anxieties
 about New World discovery, and his Columbo and Bolo verses recall
 these associations only to redeploy them as modernist humor.

<p>
Like so many other modernists on both sides of the Atlantic during
this period&#8212;including James Joyce, Ezra Pound, William Faulkner,
and Ernest Hemingway&#8212;Eliot was fascinated with ventriloquizing
racism. Here Eliot displays the racism of his culture, evidently, taking
pleasure in compulsively reiterating the moral abjection of prejudicial
discourse, while he repeats it with a palpable, self-conscious mockery
that exposes it at its most attenuated and outlandish limits. This is
prohibited language which marks the extremity of what can properly be
spoken. "King Bolo's Big Black Bassturd Kween"&#8212;the most potent
moment of naming in the cycle&#8212;disturbs because of the

<b></b>

element of racial hatred it speaks, while it already troubles that
racism by pointing to its own absurdity, turning the critical glance
back upon itself to disclose more about the speaker than about the
queen. Ventriloquizing as such is a kind of mimicry that takes pleasure
in its model but revolts against it through the modes of mockery and
parody, correcting it while exploiting it.

<p>
This, of course, does not get Eliot "off the hook" of racism. Yet
by troping away from the culturally popular racism of the 1910s and
1920s to critique it while he participates in it, his stance toward
racial difference appears more complicated. While Eliot evokes stock
racist stereotypes that represent the colonies as filled with "savages"
and "cannibals," he also inverts and mocks these stereotypes. In the
extensive anthropological commentary on Bolo and Bolovian customs he
concocts for Bonamy Dobr&eacute;e, Bolo is hardly a "savage." He is the
emblem of all that Eliot deems good about "civilization." Meanwhile,
in the stanza above, "Bolo's big black queen" offers the disruptive
element to the dessert party, but the obscene sexual advance comes from
Columbo's words&#8212;as the representative of European politics and
language&#8212;rather than from her body. Columbo needs no prompting for
his lewdness: he is sexually out of control, and his mission centers
on sex whether he is on board his ship or in the newly discovered
colonies. The white colonial party carries and (quite literally)
disseminates the mark of hyperbolic sexuality, and it is precisely their
sexual ardor that functions as their most potent motivation for mixing
with the native inhabitants. Yet the miscegenation of Columbo and the Big
Black Queen operates less as that worried marker of the meeting and mixing
of races in the last century than it does as a simple, albeit titillating,
historical fact. The stanzas thus offer at least as much judgment on
Columbo as they do on the native queen. That is to say that, if there
is a moral stance to be taken, the obscenity in this instance lies with
Columbo's perception of the queen, and not with the queen herself.

<p>
As Eliot expanded the group of friends to whom he sent the Columbo and
Bolo material, his correspondents responded in turn by affirming the
poems' masturbatory qualities. When Eliot told Wyndham Lewis early in 1915
that he would send him some of his ribald verses, Lewis in turn wrote to
Pound: "He told me he had written a lot of filthy sexual verse, which,
if he sends it, I shall hang in the W.C. He described it as Verlainesque,
damn his shifty little eyes. Well, well."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Pound thought of them this way too: in 1922 Eliot announced he was going
 to send some of his Columbo and Bolo poems to Joyce. Pound retorted,
 "You can forward the Bolo to Joyce if you think it wont unhinge his
 somewhat sabbatarian mind. On the hole he might be saved the shock,
 shaved the sock" [<i>sic</i>] (<i>LOTSE</i>, 505).

<p>
Eliot's willingness to circulate these poems only to male writers,
while simultaneously parodying the queerness of colonial history,
participates in the epistemological pairings of "secrecy/disclosure" and
"public/private" that Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick has argued are constitutive
of societal structures of gay closeting.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 Eliot was both very much in the closet about his queer fascinations,
 and halfway out of the closet because of his willingness to play with
 homoerotic titillation among the members of his coterie. Columbo and
 his men are preoccupied with anal eroticism, and regularly sodomize
 both each other and King Bolo's campily named "Kween." After a graphic
 scene of

<b></b>

masturbation, when Columbo had grown "rooty" from "three weeks at sea,"
Columbo "took his cock in both his hands / And swore it was a beauty"
before pouncing on the cabin boy: "Columbo grasped him by the balls /
And buggered him in the ass-o" (<i>IOTMH</i>,317). In another stanza,
"Columbo slid along the deck / And raped the smoke-room steward."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
Eliot, in fact, seems to have arranged his little coterie much as
coteries had been arranged in literary circles for centuries. As Wendy
Wall writes in her discussion of Renaissance coteries, "the coterie used
the circulation of texts to consolidate the bonds formed among an elite
and primarily male group."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 J.W. Saunders, in turn, argues that the Renaissance coterie functioned
 as:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->. . . a finishing school where members polished each
other's art, which, like the taste for clothes, or the ear for a
compliment, or the aptitude for dancing or fencing or riding, was
very much a matter of doing the right things in the right way, in a
game where every man tried to dazzle and out vie his competitors. More
seriously a group restricted, ideally at least, to those who were equals
or near-equals in social status . . . [they] cooperated in the formulation
of critical principles, a sense of values.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Although Eliot did not explicitly seek criticism from the members of his
coterie for his Columbo and Bolo poems, he certainly sought to "dazzle and
out vie his competitors" with the shocking content of his verses. Indeed,
their circulation participates in and offers a pornotropic extension
of the collaborative effort Eliot made with Pound while crafting <i>The
Waste Land</i>, a collaboration that Wayne Koestenbaum and others have
read as emphatically homoerotic.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 Their "dazzle" involves what I want to call <i>epistological</i>
 titillation: the poems evoke the pornographic comic strip to try to
 shock and impress his male peers with the language of obscenity. There
 does not, however, appear to have been a commensurate response from all
 of his male friends, who, apart from Pound and Dobr&eacute;e, did not
 reciprocate <i>epistologically</i> in the game of shock and titillation.

<p>
As I have suggested, Columbo's principal crewmembers are just as "obscene"
as Columbo himself, including the cabin boy, the bosun, and the chaplain
(a version of Charlie Chaplin in an early letter to Aiken, <i>LOTSE,</i>
126). Eliot's rendition of colonial exploration thus imagines a
pronounced sexual affiliation among sailors that extends the tradition
of homoerotic "comradeship" found in sailor fiction. For the most part,
the Cuban natives also share the same propensity to anal and excessive
eroticism as the colonists, and Columbo's crew thus find uncannily queer
mirrors of themselves in the colonies. Offering an inverted version of
Bhabhan mimicry, in which the colonized subject responds "through the
repetition of <i>partial presence</i>" to "the narcissistic demand of
colonial authority," King Bolo and his Queen seem to belonga priori to
the same confraternity of anal and scatological eroticism.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 The stanzas thus level difference by writing the colonial
 encounter as one in which a radical commensurability and sameness of
 desires&#8212;the game of sex&#8212;overrides dissimilarities of race,
 language, custom, history, region, and religion.

<p>
Yet the poems never once offer explicit judgment on their homosexual
practices, and Eliot simply constructs queerness as intrinsic to the
cycle.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 The poems are a version

<b></b>

of Eliot's sexual discovery, charting the evolution of a queer poetics
through an allegory of New World discovery. In only one instance does
the speaker self-reflexively comment on the obscenity of the explorers,
and this happens when the cabin boy Orlandino is accused by the narrator
of "obscene" <i>language</i>:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
A child of upright character
<br />
But his language was obscene-o.
<br />
'Fuck Spiders' was his chief remark
<br />
In accents mild and dulcet.
<br />
They asked him what there was for lunch
<br />
And he simply answered 'Bullshit.'
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>IOTMH</i>,316)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Interestingly, the censorious comment does not cite the violently
sexual or scatological <i>acts</i>, but notes the obscene <i>words</i>
of one of the younger characters. Eliot is establishing a dichotomous
and discontinuous set of values between the imagined narrator of these
verses and the res who inhabit them: the speaker complains that
Orlandino's language is obscene even though the stanzas themselves
contain language much more hyperbolically so, thereby creating a
<i>mise en ab&icirc;me</i> that testifies to the almost endless play of
possible allegories which these stanzas offer. Meanwhile, Orlandino's
<i>character</i> is considered "upright" despite the fact that he is one
of the more overtly queer characters in the poems&#8212;in a stanza Eliot
sent to Aiken in September 1914, "the cabin boy was sav'd alive / and
bugger'd, in the sphincter" (<i>LOTSE</i>,59). This valence continues,
especially if we take into account the unpublished stanzas at Yale,
which are even more expressly homoerotic than those published so far.

<p>
In his first Columbo and Bolo letter to Aiken, cited above, Eliot
also mocks the projects of anthropology, history, and the academic
establishment in general. He glosses his Columbo and Bolo poem to write:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The bracketed portions we owe to the restorations of the editor,
Prof. Dr. Hasenpfeffer (Halle), with the assistance of his two inseparable
friends, Dr. Hans Frigger (the celebrated poet) and Herr Schnitzel
(aus Wien). How much we owe to the hardwon intuition of this truly great
scholar! The editor also justly observes: 'There seems to be a <i>double
entendre</i> about the last two lines, but the fine flavour of the jest
has not survived the centuries.'&#8212;Yet we hope that such genius as
his may penetrate even this enigma. Was it really the custom to drink
ice-cream soda just before lunch? Prof. Dr. Hasenpfeffer insists that
it was. Prof. Dr. Krapp (Jena) believes that the phrase is euphemistic
(<i>LOTSE</i>,42).
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The "double-entendre" refers, of course, to homosexuality, and Eliot
mocks the phony earnestness that can attend academic labor. Eliot's
disillusionment with the scholarly life began in full force while he was
in Germany, and his stock German professorial res function as yet
another caricature in this collection of poems. Academia, he suggests,
is a dirty pursuit of the parenthetical, the excised, and the obscure. He
writes a remarkable body of pornotropic poetry, then laughs at us for
considering it.

2 Desiring Publicity: <br />Eliot as the Kween of Golder's Green
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Given the strikingly bawdy character of these poems, it is also remarkable
that Eliot actively tried to get the Bolo poems published. As it turns
out, they are, <i>prima faccia</i>, the first <i>face</i> that Eliot
wanted to show the world. After having participated <i>epistologically</i>
in a teasing mimicry of <i>Blast</i>&#8212;desiring inclusion within
its moment&#8212;Eliot sent several Columbo and Bolo stanzas to Wyndham
Lewis early in 1915 for the second (and, what would be the last) issue
of <i>Blast</i>. Lewis, however, rejected them, along with some of
Eliot's other racy poems, "The Triumph of Bullshit," and "Ballade pour
la grosse Lulu," which did not end up seeing publication until Ricks's
<i>Inventions of the March Hare</i> in 1996. Lewis wrote to Pound to
justify his decision: "Eliot has sent me Bullshit and the Ballad for Big
Louise. They are excellent bits of scholarly ribaldry. I am trying to
print them in <i>Blast</i>, but stick to my naif determination to have no
'words ending in -Uck, -Unt, and -Ugger.'"
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
Eliot reacted right away by writing a letter of complaint to Pound in
February 1915:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I have corresponded with Lewis, but his puritanical principles seem to
bar my way to Publicity. I fear that King Bolo and his Big Black Kween
will never burst into print. I understand that Priapism, Narcissism
etc. are not approved of, and even so innocent a rhyme as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . pulled her stockings off
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a frightful cry of 'Hauptbahnhof!!'
<br />
is considered decadent.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>LOTSE</i>,86)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot transforms Lewis's queasiness about offensive language into a
teasing charge that Lewis's "puritanical principles" would keep Eliot
from finding the "Publicity" he desires. Lewis did, however,publish
some of Eliot's other verse ("Preludes" and "Rhapsody of a Windy Night"
[<i>sic</i>]) in <i>Blast</i>.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 Did Eliot consider "Preludes" and "Rhapsody" insufficient for the
 "Publicity" he hoped to achieve? Or did he find out after his
 complaining letter to Pound that Lewis would include these two
 poems? Was he hoping that obscenity would do the "publicity-work"
 for him?

<p>
The young Eliot was hoping for a bit of capital "P" "Publicity" from
the Columbo and Bolo poems, and he imagined them as his first "burst"
onto the London literary scene. His desire for publication at this time
was "keen," and he was willing to risk being dangerously flamboyant to
find the publicity he wanted. Importantly, in his complaint to Pound,
Eliot gives an exact echo of the language he uses in the Columbo and
Bolo verses when he describes the queen's mode of presenting herself;
he suggests that his poems cannot "burst" upon the literary scene with
the same ease that Bolo's "big black queen" "burst" onboard or "burst"
upon the party of colonists "drinking ice cream soda." As elsewhere in
his letters, especially to Pound, Eliot proposes that if writing is a
sexual act, then publishing is its ejaculative fulfillment. Indeed, Eliot
seemed to enjoy the valences of "burst[ing]" into print a great deal,
and the term recurs in 1922 when he is about to publish <i>The Waste
Land</i> in the first issue of his new journal, <i>The Criterion</i>. In
this instance the tables are turned, and he gives Lewis a back seat,
writing to Pound: "I think that if the <i>Waste Land</i> [<i>sic</i>]
bursts out in the first number

<b></b>

and you contribute to the second, that Lewis must remain behind the
scenes until the third" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 553).

<p>
After he was rejected by Lewis, Eliot persisted in seeking publication for
the Bolo poems for a number of years. Even as late as May 1921 Eliot was
still hoping that the Bolo poems would find public circulation. Although
he did not know Joyce well, he offers him a sample of the Columbo and
Bolo poems in a letter of May, 1921. He enviously writes to Joyce after
having had a "taste" of the <i>Ulysses</i> manuscript for which he claims
to have "nothing but admiration," particularly for the bawdy sections,
confessing (as did others), "I wish, for my own sake, that I had not
read it" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 455). He compliments Joyce on the news that
"even a limited and very expensive edition is to appear," asking "has it
been properly circularised in England?" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 455). He admits
that he has been having difficulty himself finding the publication and
publicity he desired for his own "limited edition":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I wish that Miss Beach would bring out a limited edition of my epic
ballad on the life of Christopher Columbus and his friend King Bolo, but
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Bolo's big black bastard queen
<br />
Was <i>so</i> obscene
<br />
She shocked the folk of Golder's Green.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>




<blockquote>
<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>LOTS0E</i>, 455)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>


<p>
Eliot thus draws an analogy between <i>Ulysses</i> and the Columbo
and Bolo cycle. He had already asserted a serious admiration for the
scandalous sections of <i>Ulysses</i> in 1919, writing to John Quinn,
friend, New York lawyer and patron of the arts, "I should like to do
everything I can about it over here. The part of <i>Ulysses</i> in
question struck me as almost the finest I have read: I have lived on it
ever since I read it" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 314). The ribaldry of the scandalous,
masturbatory homoerotic sections of <i>Ulysses</i> are not unlike that of
Eliot's verse, and part of Eliot's frustrated admiration for Joyce could
be due to the fact that Eliot met the censor <i>before</i> publication
and "publicity," while Joyce met the censor after both publication and
the immense publicity that is scandal.

<p>
As he will do elsewhere, in Eliot's letter to Joyce he blurs the
distinction between his "epic ballad" and "Bolo's big black bastard
queen:" both it (his poem) and she (the queen) are "so obscene" that
they "shocked the folk of Golder's Green." Eliot thus makes Bolo's
big black queen perform the allegorical work of obscenity; that is,
she functions as a fictional objective correlative for his own desires
for publicity. In his letter to Joyce Eliot draws on the shock-value
of race and sex as markers of disruption in the precious atmosphere of
suburban London and applies them to his unpublishable poetry. In effect,
he constructs a tautologous narrative about his inability to publish:
the disruptive elements of color and sex are too obscene for the "folk
of Golder's Green;" because these elements are in the poems, no one will
publish them; therefore both the poems and he himself are as obscene as
the "big black queen."

<p>
In a letter to Conrad Aiken of 1916, Eliot included two more Columbo and
Bolo stanzas as a gloss on his current situation. Here, as elsewhere,
he explicitly uses the Columbo and Bolo poems to allegorize details of
his own biography:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The news is that I am to be at Highgate School, near town, next term,
that I am starting to rewrite my thesis, that my wife has been very ill,
that I have been taken up with the worries of finance and Vivien's health,
that my friend Jean Verdenal [to whom he dedicated the <i>Prufrock</i>
volume in 1917] has been killed, that nothing has been seen of Armstrong
who is now a captain in Kitchener's army, that compulsion is coming in,
that my putative publisher will probably be conscripted, that we are
very blue about the war, that living is going up, and that

</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->

<br />

<br />
She led the dance on Golder's Green
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Cardinal Bessarian.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>LOTSE</i>, 125)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
King Bolo's queen has by this time moved from Cuba to London, to the
fashionable, Jewish neighborhood of Golder's Green, and she is on display
as a dancer, paired with a powerful Catholic religious representative. But
what work is this queen doing for Eliot? Her status as a foreigner of
color with no proper parentage would mark her as a "bassturd" in the
strictures of British society of the time, while Eliot again implies
that the queen is not female at all, but is in fact a male "queen" or
"fairy" in drag. Reminiscent of the women in "The Love Song of J. Alfred
Prufrock," whose arms are "downed with light brown hair," (Lines 62-63),
Bolo's queen is even more hirsute, lacking subtlety but still warranting
the dialogue between erotic attraction and physical repulsion that we
find in "Prufrock"&#8212;suggesting an androgyny verging on transgenderism
which the queerness of Eliot's cycle would support.

<p>
In the same letter to Aiken, Eliot continues by claiming, "I am
<i>keen</i> about rhymes ending in -een," and he attaches the following
stanza:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
King Bolo's big black bassturd kween
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her taste was kalm and klassic
<br />
And as for anything obscene
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;She said it made her ass sick.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>LOTSE</i>, 125)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot here takes a linguistic step to incorporate himself into his poems,
playing with sound and meaning by alluding to his feeling of being "keen"
for the "een" sound, and thereby effectively, performatively, enfolding
himself into their rhyme scheme, and into the poems themselves. It is
as if he himself is an extension of the "-een" rhymes in his cycle,
or as if he were just as <i>queer</i> as his verses&#8212;as if he just
might be the "kween of Golder's Green." Invoking sodomitical metaphors
to insist on the queen's distaste for obscenity&#8212;"anything obscene"
"made her ass sick"&#8212;he again proposes that it is not, in fact,
the queen who is obscene, but the cultural dispensation that deems the
fact of her large, queer, blackness obscene, and it is the "folk of
Golder's Green" who are the markers and makers of obscenity.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<p>
The black queen is simultaneously a racist portrayal, a point
of titillation, and a satire on racist, sexist, and homophobic
formulations. She functions as the mark of difference in the middle-class
culture of Golder's Green at a moment when even foreignness

<b></b>

was akin to obscenity, and the Jewish suburb did not necessarily give
shelter to other displaced groups. Eliot himself felt an unwelcome
foreigner in London&#8212;he was classless in British society,
and practically parentless at this time as well, since he had "fled"
family when he left America straining relations with his father. In his
letters, Eliot was preoccupied with "foreignness," and already in 1914
when studying in Germany, wrote to Conrad Aiken, "I think that this will
be a very pleasant exile on the whole,&#8212;though I cannot look upon
a summer in Germany as anything but an exile" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 41). This
attitude changes very little during the first years in England, and
he writes to his cousin Eleanor Hinkley in the fall of 1914, "I don't
think that I should ever feel at home in England, as I do for instance
in France . . . I should always, I think, be aware of a certain sense
of confinement in England, and repression" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 61). In a
letter to Mary Hutchinson of 1919 he writes, "but remember that I am
a <i>metic</i>&#8212;a foreigner, and that I <i>want</i> to understand
you, and all the background and tradition of you" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 318).

<p>
Instead of finding the publicity he desired for them, Eliot shared the
Bolo poems privately over the years, usually as a satiric way to negotiate
his dealings with the public world of publishing and notoriety, and the
very private world of his identity as an &eacute;migr&eacute;. Instead
of the Bolo poems, Eliot's first publications, all in 1915, were "The
Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," "The Boston Evening Transcript,"
"Aunt Helen," and "Cousin Nancy" in <i>Poetry</i>, "Preludes" and
"Rhapsody on a Windy Night" in <i>Blast</i>, and "Portrait of a Lady"
in <i>Others</i>. At the beginning of 1915 he was a young struggling
poet, lucky to be befriended by the more established Ezra Pound. At the
end of the year he was on his way to becoming <i>the</i> T. S. Eliot,
the author who would be canonized by the <i>Dial</i> prize in 1922, the
subject of intense critical attention in magazines and reviews of the
1910s and early 1920s, and then the canonical re constructed by the
New Criticism of the late 1920s and 1930s. These became the early basis of
Eliot's reputation, and began to shape the character of English modernism.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
3 Eliot's <i>Parergon</i>
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
How can we negotiate the fact of these poems alongside the body of
Eliot's published material? We might think of the Columbo and Bolo poems
as a pornotropic <i>parergon</i> for Eliot's work. The term is borrowed
from Conrad Aiken's allusion to the Bolo poems in a short essay called
"King Bolo and Others" that he wrote to celebrate the occasion of Eliot's
sixtieth birthday for a volume of tributes collected in 1948. Aiken's
piece actually gives scant attention to the Bolo poems, but refers to them
as a knowing insider, participating in the closeting of Eliot's verses
that had by now been going on through his career. It is unlikely that any
other contributor to the collection, with the exception of Clive Bell,
knew the content of these verses.

<p>
Although he does not elaborate with a sample from the Columbo and Bolo
verses, Aiken does give a rather interesting brief interpretation of the
import of the Bolo poems to Eliot's oeuvre. He reminisces about their
days together at Harvard:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What did we talk about? or what didn't we? It was the first "great"
era of the comic strip, of Krazy Kat, and Mutt and Jeff, and Rube
Goldberg's elaborate lunacies: it was also perhaps the most creative
period of American slang, and in both these departments of invention
he took enormous pleasure. How delighted we were with the word "dinge"
for negro! This rich native creativeness was to be reflected, of course,
in his poetry, notably in Prufrock . . .
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliding the boundaries between the humor of the comic strip and racist
"slang," Aiken brings racism and humor together under the single banner
of undergraduate delight. But where did Aiken get this slang from? Why
were he and Eliot so excited to borrow racist humor and terminology? As
Hortense Spiller proposes, they would not have <i>known</i> many blacks,
but "what they did know was that 'dinge' named a limit, a neologism and,
therefore, an unnamable, beyond representability."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 These poems also offer the mnemonic trace of Eliot's American
 identity. Turning to an allegory of New World discovery precisely at
 the moment he was choosing the Old World over the New himself, these
 poems worry the limits of Eliot's self-representation as a racial other,
 and his genealogical history as an American.

<p>
Aiken continues his tribute by asserting that Eliot's delight in slang
and comic-book characters "gave rise to the series of hilariously naughty
<i>parerga</i> which was devoted spasmodically to that singular and
sterling character known as King Bolo, not to mention King Bolo's Queen,
'that airy fairy hairy&#8212;'un, who led the dance on Golder's Green
with Cardinal Bessarion'" (<i>TSEAS</i>, 22). Quoting from Eliot's 1916
letter, Aiken over thirty years later again effaces race and obscenity
from the equation to portray the "queen" simply as "Bolo's Queen" rather
than his "big black queen." He thus teases his fellow contributors by
offering what could only seem a silly, sophomoric-sounding rhyme without
context&#8212;evacuating accountability and precluding the possibility
that his audience might decipher the meaning of these allusions.

<p>
Aiken's notion that the poems operate as <i>parerga</i> is, though,
a fitting metaphor: the poems are precisely "an extra ornament in art"
(<i>OED</i>) insofar as the <i>parergon</i> is always that which can
surprise us and tell us more about what we deem to be central to the
text (whether literary or otherwise) than the center itself. Derrida
articulates it in this way:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
A parergon comes against, beside, and in addition to the <i>ergon</i>,
the work done [<i>fait</i>], the fact [<i>lefait</i>], the work, but
it does not fall to one side, it touches and cooperates within the
operation, from a certain outside. Neither simply outside nor simply
inside. Like an accessory that one is obliged to welcome on the border,
on board [<i>aubord, &agrave; bord</i>]. It is first of all the on (the)
bo(a)rd(er) [<i>Il est d'abord l'&agrave;-bord</i>].
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot's Columbo and Bolo poems situate themselves for us on the
"border" or the boundary of his other canonical poems, touching them by
illuminating the limits of interpretation; neither entirely "outside
nor simply inside," they "inscribe[] something which comes as an
extra, <i>exterior</i> to the proper field . . . but whose transcendent
exteriority comes to play, abut onto, brush against, rub, press against
the limit itself and intervene in the inside only to the extent that
the inside is lacking."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 The pornotropic poems surprise us, illuminating and foregrounding
 Eliot's obsessions with sexuality,

<b></b>

race, and the corporeal, revealing a complicated sexual imagination. In
his birthday tribute, Aiken insists on the Bolo poems' value as
social and academic critique: "These admirable stanzas, notable at
times for their penetrating social criticisms were to continue for
years as a sort of cynical counterpoint to the study of Sanskrit and
the treatise on epistemology. Their influence on the development of
a Style will no doubt come in due course to the attention of Herr Dr
Krapp of Wien" (<i>TSEAS</i>, 22). Again, Aiken's audience of fellow
contributors&#8212;not to mention his readers&#8212;would have had no
idea what he was talking about: who might "Herr Dr Krapp" be exactly? As
it turns out, he is us: academic scholars who are only now uncovering
these poems to give them critical attention. Eliot writes a bawdy
<i>parergon</i> to his poems, and then laughs at us for considering it,
embracing us into the fold of humor and titillation as its newest objects
of satire.

Ricks chose his title from the provisional one that Eliot had given
his poetry notebook from 1909-1917, even though at a certain point Eliot
scratched through his title with single solid strokes, effectively placing
his title under erasure. <i>Inventions of the March Hare</i> was more of
a notebook than a book, and Eliot makes only one other known reference
to it in a letter to Conrad Aiken in 1914 when he jokes, "Do you think
it possible, if I brought out the "Inventions of the March Hare," and
gave a few lectures, at 5 P.M. with wax candles, that I could become a
sentimental Tommy" (T. S. Eliot, <i>The Letters of T. S. Eliot. Volume
One, 1898-1922</i>, ed. Valerie Eliot [New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988],
59. Hereafter referred to as <i>LOTSE</i>). Eliot's comment to Aiken
says much about the degree to which he was able to mock his own poetic
endeavors at this early stage of his career.

On the Bolo poems see Jonathan Gill, "Protective Coloring: Modernism and
Blackface Minstrelsy in the Bolo Poems", in <i>T.S. Eliot's Orchestra:
Critical Essays on Poetry and Music</i>, ed. John Xiros Cooper (New York:
Garland, 2000), 65-84. Gill charts evocative similarities between these
stanzas and blackface minstrelsy, arguing that Eliot's poems might
be situated directly in this tradition. The essay is illuminating,
but scarcely takes up the crucial question of Eliot's stance towards
race and racism in these poems, even though his argument concerns the
theatrical performance of blackness.

I have been able to examine the bulk of these, and although I am not
allowed to cite from these sources due to reasons of copyright, they
have been central to my analysis, and I refer to them from time to time
in this essay.

Until more becomes known about the details of Eliot's life, there is
no way of checking dates with absolute certainty. At present there is
still a great deal of personal material that is not yet available.

Conrad Aiken, <i>Selected Letters of Conrad Aiken</i>, ed. Joseph Killorin
(New Haven: Yale UP, 1978), 318. Aiken's phrasing would seem to suggest
that Aiken, too, might have composed Bolo verses. I have, however,
been unable to find any evidence of this in Aiken's writings.

See B. C. Southam, <i>A Student's Guide to the Selected Poems of
T. S. Eliot</i>, sixth edition (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1994), 103. In
a rather fascinating historical coincidence that Eliot may or may not
have been aware of, Colombo might also refer to another man of that
name who lived in the sixteenth century and who was the first (known)
person to depict the female clitoris as "the seat of women's delight,"
a statement that was repeated for two centuries. See Colombo, Realdo,
<i>De re anatomica libri XV</i> (Venice: Nicolai Beuilacquae, 1559).

Eliot was always very sensitive to intimations of his homosexual
predilections, and immediately tried to suppress an essay written by
John Peter in 1952 that made the case for <i>The Waste Land</i> as a
homosexual love story about Phlebas.

Ezra Pound, <i>The Letters of Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis</i>,
66-67. With an uncanny appropriateness, the <i>OED</i> cites Lewis's
letter to Eliot about his poems "The Triumph of Bullshit" and "Ballade
pour la grosse Lulu" as the first example of the use of the term
"bullshit" in the English language.

"Rhapsody of a Windy Night" was the title under which Eliot's poem
first appeared. This was corrected to read "Rhapsody on a Windy Night"
in later Eliot collections.

The question of whether Eliot here is also invoking anti-Semitism by
ring a Jewish neighborhood as the bourgeois thermometer of obscenity
would be interesting to pursue.

I am grateful to Hortense Spillers for these comments, written in response
to an earlier draft of this paper. I would like to take this opportunity
to thank her, Eduardo Cadava, Jonathan Culler, Ellis Hanson, Molly Hite
and Jodie Medd, each of whom offered thoughtful and incisive comments
as I was writing this essay.
